<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-03-28 11:58:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman">
<P>
<B>Review question:</B> Does the use of oral immunoglobulin reduce the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and other complications in preterm or low birth weight (or both) neonates?</P>
<P>
<B>Background:</B> Immunoglobulin given orally for preventing emergency intestinal problems (necrotizing enterocolitis) in premature and low birth weight newborn infants. Destructive inflammation of the intestine (called necrotizing enterocolitis, NEC) is caused by gas-producing bacteria that ferment milk. It is a potential problem for newborn preterm (born before their due date) and low birth weight (born at less than 2500 grams) infants. Even after leaving hospital, affected infants may need frequent and prolonged hospitalisation because of continuing nutritional problems. This makes it difficult for parents both emotionally and financially. Immunoglobulins are proteins found in the blood that give the body immunity to disease. Immunoglobulins (types IgA and IgG) taken by mouth (orally) may protect susceptible infants from developing NEC.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics:</B> We searched the medical literature through January 2016 and found three randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) (with 2095 newborn infants). Treatment was started either in the first 24 hours following birth (two small studies) or following commencement of oral feeding (enteral) (one large well-controlled study). In this large study, infants generally received breast milk, whereas they received formula milk in the other two studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Results:</B> Giving immunoglobulin (IgG alone or IgG plus IgA combination) did not reduce the incidence of NEC, need for surgery related to NEC or death from NEC, either during or after the study period. Immunoglobulins could possibly cause breakdown of red blood cells (called haemolysis) (red blood cells are common cells in the blood that delivery oxygen to organs), but no clinically important haemolysis was apparent. There were no other reported side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence: </B>There was low-very low evidence for all the major outcomes. The major factor that affected the quality of evidence was the lack of precision in the result estimates, as the calculated plausible range of the effects (the 95% confidence intervals) were wide.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-02-16 09:38:32 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Group. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library </I>2016, Issue 1), PubMed (1966 to January 2016), CINAHL (1982 to January 2016) and EMBASE (1980 to January 2016) and conference proceedings.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-20 15:28:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The search identified five studies on oral immunoglobulin for the prevention of NEC of which three met the inclusion criteria. In this review of the three eligible trials (including 2095 neonates), the oral administration of IgG or an IgG/IgA combination did not result in a significant reduction in the incidence of definite NEC (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.25; typical risk difference (RD) -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.01; 3 studies, 1840 infants), suspected NEC (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.46; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.01; 1 study, 1529 infants), need for surgery (typical RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.75; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.00; 2 studies, 311 infants) or death from NEC (typical RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.59; typical RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; 3 studies, 1840 infants).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-01-19 17:35:47 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common emergency involving the gastrointestinal tract occurring in the neonatal period (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2006</LINK>). NEC is characterized by acute onset of intestinal inflammatory necrosis that exhibits as abdominal distension, gastrointestinal bleeding and pneumatosis intestinalis on abdominal X-ray (<LINK REF="REF-Tudehope-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tudehope 2005</LINK>). The origin of the intramural gas has been presumed to be from bacterial fermentation from gas-producing bacteria and a substrate (milk) (<LINK REF="REF-Willoughby-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willoughby 1994</LINK>). NEC is a disease of the newborn, which indicates that the pathogenesis is somehow linked to physiological characteristics unique to the newborn intestine (<LINK REF="REF-Edelstone-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edelstone 1982</LINK>). The majority of neonates with NEC are premature or low birth weight (<LINK REF="REF-Cikrit-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cikrit 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yee-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yee 2012</LINK>), and there is an inverse relationship between gestational age, birth weight and onset of NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Yee-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yee 2012</LINK>). The incidence of NEC is between 5% and 15% (<LINK REF="REF-Luig-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luig 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2010</LINK>). NEC characteristically presents between seven and 14 days of life, although, increasingly NEC can also present several weeks after birth, particularly in very low birth weight infants (<LINK REF="REF-Yee-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yee 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pathogenesis of NEC appears to be multifactorial, with any unifying hypothesis of its cause and prevention remaining unconfirmed (<LINK REF="REF-Patole-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patole 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1994a</LINK>). NEC is reported to be due to contributory factors such as mucosal injury caused by ischaemia, infection and intraluminal injury with subsequent circulatory, immunological and inflammatory host responses to the injury (<LINK REF="REF-Maheshwari-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maheshwari 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1994b</LINK>). It is now well established that an exaggerated release of mediators of inflammation induced by microbial factors such as bacterial endotoxin, plays an important role in the development of noxious sequelae that follow infection of the host with pathogenic micro-organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1994</LINK>). An exaggerated release of mediators of inflammation has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Claud-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Claud 2009</LINK>). Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;) and platelet activating factor (PAF) are considered to play a synergistic and central role in the inflammatory cascade that leads to NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Hseuh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hseuh 2003</LINK>). The reported mortality rate for NEC is between 20% and 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzgibbons-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzgibbons 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1994a</LINK>), and has not changed appreciably since the 1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Petrosyan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrosyan 2009</LINK>), because of the increasing survival of smaller infants (<LINK REF="REF-Neu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neu 2011</LINK>). Infants that require surgery have the greatest mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Neu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neu 2012</LINK>). Long-term outcome is less certain. At discharge, many of the neonates remain at significant risk of frequent and prolonged hospitalizations due to nutritional compromise or stricture as a consequence of NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Petrosyan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrosyan 2009</LINK>). Approximately 20% to 40% of neonates who develop NEC eventually require surgical intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Hseuh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hseuh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petrosyan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrosyan 2009</LINK>). This leads to increased resource utilization and possibly impaired growth and developmental outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Hintz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hintz 2005</LINK>). The risk of neurodevelopmental dysfunction is increased in children who require surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2010</LINK>). Additional morbidity arises from parental emotional grief and financial costs (<LINK REF="REF-Neu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Various preventive interventions have been tried to reduce the risk and severity of NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1990</LINK>). NEC has been reported to be six to 10 times less common with exclusive breastfeeding compared to infants who were exclusively formula fed (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1990</LINK>). The prophylactic administration of oral gentamicin in selected babies at high risk for NEC has resulted in significant decrease in the incidence of NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Grylack-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grylack 1978</LINK>); but the use of oral gentamicin in preterm infants is not recommended because of the concerns of the development of antibiotic-resistant organisms. The prolonged use of initial empirical therapy in early postnatal days may be associated with increased risk of NEC or death (<LINK REF="REF-Cotten-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotten 2009</LINK>). Therefore, the use of antibiotics in preterm infants should be monitored carefully and empirical use should be avoided. Human milk oligosaccharides appear to be one of the promising component to prevent NEC. In neonatal rats, a specific isomer of HMO was identified to be protective against NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Jantscher_x002d_Krenn-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jantscher-Krenn 2012</LINK>). The administration of prophylactic enteral probiotics in preterm infants have been reported to reduce the incidence of severe NEC as well as mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2005</LINK>). The arginine supplementation in preterm infants appeared to be protective in decreasing the rate of NEC but no significant impact on neurodevelopment outcome at 36 months of corrected age (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2014</LINK>). In addition, it has been proposed that oral immunoglobulins may be an effective preventive intervention for NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1994</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-10-20 15:50:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Immunoglobulins play an essential role in the body's immune system. Immunoglobulins are large glycoproteins that are secreted by plasma cells and function as antibodies in the immune response by binding with specific antigens. They attach to foreign substances such as bacteria, and assist in destroying them. There are five classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM (<LINK REF="REF-Attaelmannan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attaelmannan 2000</LINK>). Oral immunoglobulin may provide a prophylactic effect against NEC because of its immunoprotective effect, or its heterologous antibodies against infection of the gastrointestinal tract (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1994</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
</INTERVENTION>

<P>It has been proposed that orally administered antibodies bind to the antigen at the level of the gastrointestinal mucosa, which leads to intra-luminal agglutination of potentially infectious pathogens and, thus, interfere with colonization of the mucosal surface by infectious pathogens, and neutralizes bacterial toxic factors or viral particles (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1994</LINK>). IgA, being a secretory immunoglobulin, might be expected to be more efficacious in protecting the neonatal gastrointestinal tract than the more readily available IgG. <LINK REF="REF-Bauer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauer 1992</LINK> reviewed three trials of prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin administration and reported a borderline statistically significant reduction of NEC.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-02-23 03:47:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prevention and treatment of NEC has become an area of priority for research due to the increasing number of preterm survivors at risk (<LINK REF="REF-Patole-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patole 2007</LINK>). There have also been reports of the effectiveness of using oral immunoglobulins as prophylaxis against NEC in premature and low birth weight neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1994</LINK>). It has been proposed that oral immunoglobulins produce an immunoprotective effect in the gastrointestinal mucosa. However, there are concerns regarding the strength of the evidence of the effectiveness of the use of oral immunoglobulins. The authors have been unable to identify any previous systematic reviews on the use of oral immunoglobulin for the prevention of NEC.</P>

We resolved any disagreements successfully by discussion. Therefore, it was not necessary to involve a review arbiter. We completed the 'Risk of bias' table addressing the following methodological issues.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we described the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups. We assessed the risk of bias methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we described the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We judged the study to be at low risk of bias if it was blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes and classes of outcomes. We assessed the risk of bias methods as:</P>

We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses. We assessed the risk of bias methods as:</P>

<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the risk of bias methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (where it was clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review were reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk (where not all of the study's pre-specified outcomes had been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used; study did not include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns that we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. early termination of trial due to data-dependant process, extreme baseline imbalance, etc.). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias. We assessed other sources of bias as:</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of Evidence</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the quality of evidence for the main comparison at the outcome level using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011a</LINK>). This methodological approach considers evidence from randomised controlled trials as high quality that may be downgraded based on consideration of any of five areas: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates and presence of publication bias. (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011a</LINK>). The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the quality of a body of evidence in one of four grades: 1) High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect; 2) Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different; 3) Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect; 4) Very Low: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2013</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The review authors independently assessed the quality of the evidence found for outcomes identified as critical or important for clinical decision making. These outcomes include: diagnosis of definite NEC during the study period, defined as clinical evidence of gastrointestinal and systemic illness, confirmed by pneumatosis intestinalis, pneumoperitoneum, portal venous gas, surgery or postmortem; surgery for NEC during the study period; NEC-related death; by 28 days post-delivery, by discharge and by one year (late or post-discharge); overall mortality; duration of hospitalisation.<BR/>
<BR/>In cases where we considered the risk of bias arising from inadequate concealment of allocation, randomised assignment, complete follow-up or blinded outcome assessment to reduce our confidence in the effect estimates, we downgraded the quality of evidence accordingly (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011b</LINK>). We evaluated consistency by similarity of point estimates, extent of overlap of confidence intervals and statistical criteria including measurement of heterogeneity (I2). We downgraded the quality of evidence when large and unexplained inconsistency across studies results was present (i.e. some studies suggest important benefit and others no effect or harm without a clinical explanation) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011d</LINK>). Precision was assessed based on the width of the 95% confidence interval (CI) and by calculating the optimal information size (OIS). If the total number of patients included in the pooled effect estimation was less than the number of patients generated by a conventional sample size calculation for a single adequately powered trial, we considered rating down for imprecision (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011c</LINK>). When trials were conducted in populations other than the target population, we downgraded the quality of evidence because of indirectness (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011e" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011e</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>We entered data (i.e. pooled estimates of the effects and corresponding 95% confidence Interval) and explicit judgments for each of the above aspects assessed into the Guideline Development Tool, the software used to create &#8216;Summary of findings&#8217; tables (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2008</LINK>).

<P>Although the trials reported outcomes such as definite NEC, suspected NEC, death and need for surgery, none of the studies reported the pre-specified outcomes length of stay in hospital, hospital re-admission, total parenteral nutrition administration, growth and development in childhood, and parental emotional and financial costs. Death was reported as 'during and after the study period', but not reported as 28 days post-delivery, discharge or by one year (as listed in the pre-specified outcome measures). It was not anticipated that several outcome measures would be reported 'after the study period'. The decision to report these outcomes was made post-hoc. No data were available for subgroup analysis other than with regard to class of immunoglobulin, IgG/IgA.</P>

The <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2001</LINK> study was large compared to the <LINK REF="STD-Rubaltelli-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rubaltelli 1991</LINK> study and thus dominated the results. Oral IgG did not reduce the incidence of definite NEC during the study period (typical RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.42; typical RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.02), suspected NEC (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.46; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.01), need for surgery (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.28; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.03), definite NEC after the study period (typical RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.47 to 3.60; typical RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01) or death due to NEC during the study period (typical RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.55; typical RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01).</P>
<P>One study investigated the use of an oral IgA/IgG combination (73% IgA, 26% IgG) (<LINK REF="STD-Eibl-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Eibl 1988</LINK>). There were trends for this combination to reduce the incidence of definite NEC during the study period (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.39; RD -0.07, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.01; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 14, 95% CI 8 to 100), death due to NEC during study period (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.25; RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.02) and need for surgery (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.82; RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.01). None of the results were statistically significant.</P>
<P>One of the studies reported an increased incidence of Heinz bodies in the intervention group receiving oral immunoglobulin (<LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2001</LINK>). However, the proportion of neonates given blood transfusions was similar in the intervention and control groups (62.2% with intervention versus 69.7% with control) suggesting that clinically important haemolysis did not occur. There were no other reported adverse effects from the administration of oral immunoglobulin.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-03-28 11:58:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman">
<P>We included three trials in the review. The randomised trials by <LINK REF="STD-Eibl-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Eibl 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rubaltelli-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rubaltelli 1991</LINK> were small and outcome assessment was not blinded. The <LINK REF="STD-Eibl-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Eibl 1988</LINK> study also had a large number of post randomisation exclusions in both the intervention and control groups (59%). The study by <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2001</LINK> was a large randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. <LINK REF="STD-Rubaltelli-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rubaltelli 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Eibl-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Eibl 1988</LINK> excluded neonates that received breast milk whereas, in the <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2001</LINK> trial, 90% of neonates received breast milk. Breast milk has previously been reported to have a protective effect against NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1990</LINK>), and this was acknowledged by <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2001</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Eibl-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Eibl 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rubaltelli-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rubaltelli 1991</LINK> used similar doses of oral immunoglobulin (600 mg/day in <LINK REF="STD-Eibl-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Eibl 1988</LINK> and 500 mg/day in <LINK REF="STD-Rubaltelli-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rubaltelli 1991</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2001</LINK> used a higher dose of 1200 mg/kg/day. The larger dose of oral immunoglobulin does not appear to have produced a greater response.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Eibl-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Eibl 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rubaltelli-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rubaltelli 1991</LINK> administered the oral immunoglobulin within the first 24 hours following birth. However, <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2001</LINK> did not administer the oral immunoglobulin until after the initiation of enteral feeding. Thus, in the <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2001</LINK> study, 31% of neonates did not start the treatment until the fifth day or later. The effect of the timing of the administration of immunoglobulin on the incidence of NEC is unknown. However, in clinical practice it would be difficult to administer oral immunoglobulins to neonates who were unable to tolerate fluids orally.</P>
<P>The trials by <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rubaltelli-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rubaltelli 1991</LINK> used predominately IgG. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Eibl-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Eibl 1988</LINK> used an immunoglobulin mixture containing 73% IgA and 26% IgG. To date, there is no randomised trial of IgA alone in the prevention of NEC, and the question of whether IgA has a protective effect against NEC is unanswered.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Eibl-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Eibl 1988</LINK> studied neonates weighing between 800 and 2000 g. <LINK REF="STD-Rubaltelli-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rubaltelli 1991</LINK> studied neonates weighing less than 1500 g or 34 weeks' gestation or less and <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2001</LINK> similarly studied neonates weighing 1500 g or less. The association between prematurity or low birth weight and NEC are well known. Despite the increasing survival rate of extremely low birth weight neonates, there are no published randomised studies exclusively targeting extremely low birth weight neonates. It would clearly be important to stratify the groups at risk by gestational age and weight.</P>

<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2001</LINK> trial, 10 out of 43 cases of definite NEC in the treatment group and 12 out of 41 cases of definite NEC in the control group did not receive any of the trial solutions prior to their illness. In the <LINK REF="STD-Eibl-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Eibl 1988</LINK> trial, the rate of exclusion of neonates after randomisation was high (59%). Only one of the trials performed sample size estimation (<LINK REF="STD-Lawrence-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lawrence 2001</LINK>). </P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-03-28 12:10:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman">
<P>There was low or very low evidence for all the major outcomes. The major factor that affected the quality of evidence was the lack of precision in the result estimates, as the calculated plausible range of the effects (the 95% confidence intervals) were wide (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-03-28 11:58:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman">
<P>Based on the available trials, the evidence does not support the administration of oral immunoglobulin for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). There are no randomised controlled trials of oral IgA alone in the prevention of NEC.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-02-12 09:54:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future trials should examine the effects of oral IgA in extremely low birth weight neonates (less than 1000 grams). In addition to examining effect on NEC, consideration should be given to reporting outcomes such as length of stay in hospital, hospital re-admissions, need for total parenteral nutrition administration, growth and development in childhood, and parenteral emotional and financial costs in any future studies. Given an incidence of NEC in this population of 8%, 1000 neonates would be required to show a 50% reduction in NEC at the 5% level (two tailed).</P>
