<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-01-12 11:03:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We wanted to determine if long-term blood transfusions given to people with sickle cell disease who are at a higher risk of stroke (primary prevention) or have had a previous stroke (secondary prevention) decreases their risk of a subsequent stroke without causing severe side effects. We compared long-term blood transfusions to standard treatment or other ways of preventing a stroke. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.</P>
<P>Interventions for silent stroke are addressed in a separate Cochrane Review.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Sickle cell disease is a serious inherited blood disorder where the red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, develop abnormally.</P>
<P>Normal red blood cells are flexible and disc-shaped, but in sickle cell disease they can become rigid, crescent shaped and also stickier. This can lead to blockage of blood vessels, resulting in tissue and organ damage and episodes of severe pain. The abnormal blood cells are more fragile and break apart, which leads to a decreased number of red blood cells, known as anaemia.</P>
<P>Sickled red blood cells can block flow in blood vessels in the brain, leading to strokes.</P>
<P>Strokes occur in up to 10% of children with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) and can cause limb weakness, slurred speech, seizures, and cognitive impairment.</P>
<P>Two tests have been used in trials to identify children at higher risk of having a first stroke. One (transcranial Doppler ultrasonography) measures the speed of blood flowing through arteries in the brain, and those children with high blood flow are at increased risk of a stroke. The other (magnetic resonance imaging) takes images of the brain to see if there are any small areas of damage (silent strokes), those children with evidence of damage are at increased risk of stroke.</P>
<P>Blood transfusions may help prevent a stroke by reducing the level of anaemia, diluting the sickled red blood cells, and increasing the level of oxygen in the blood.</P>
<P>Blood transfusions can be linked to adverse events, e.g. the development of antibodies to proteins on donor red blood cells (alloimmunisation), accumulation of too much iron in the body from repeated transfusions, increased risk of infection, and extended length of stay in hospital.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the medical literature to 25 April 2016. We found five randomised controlled trials which enrolled a total of 660 participants. Three trials compared blood transfusions to no blood transfusions and two trials compared blood transfusion to the drug hydroxyurea. Trials were published between 1998 and 2016 and included children and sometimes adolescents; the majority had one form of sickle cell disease (HbSS).</P>
<P>All trials received government funding.</P>
<P>
<B>Key Results</B>
</P>
<P>In children who are at a higher risk of having a stroke who have not had previous blood transfusions, a long-term blood transfusion regime probably reduces clinical strokes, and may also reduce other sickle cell disease-related complications.</P>
<P>We are very uncertain if stopping blood transfusions in children and adolescents receiving transfusions for a long time (greater than 12 months) increases the risk of stroke.</P>
<P>We are very uncertain whether switching from long-term transfusions with iron chelation to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy has any effect on stroke, mortality, or sickle cell disease-related complications in children who have not had a stroke. Hydroxyurea may have little or no effect on iron levels in the liver.</P>
<P>We are very uncertain if switching from long-term transfusions with iron chelation to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy increases the risk of stroke or mortality in children and adolescents who have had a stroke and were previously receiving regular transfusions. Switching from long-term transfusions to hydroxyurea may increase some sickle cell disease-related serious adverse events such as painful crises.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>In children at higher risk of stroke who have not had previous long-term transfusions, there is moderate quality evidence that long-term red cell transfusions reduce the risk of stroke. The quality of evidence was rated as low to very low for the rest of the outcomes due to trials being at high risk of bias and because there were a small number of trials and a small number of participants included in the trials.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-01-12 10:59:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-08 11:26:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lise J Estcourt">
<P>Sickle cell disease is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. Sickle cell disease can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Stroke affects around 10% of children with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS). Chronic blood transfusions may reduce the risk of vaso-occlusion and stroke by diluting the proportion of sickled cells in the circulation.</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and last updated in 2013.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-01-11 12:24:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Patricia  Fortin">
<P>To assess risks and benefits of chronic blood transfusion regimens in people with sickle cell disease for primary and secondary stroke prevention (excluding silent cerebral infarcts).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-12-19 10:20:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 04 April 2016. </P>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 25 April 2016.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-10-04 10:36:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing red blood cell transfusions as prophylaxis for stroke in people with sickle cell disease to alternative or standard treatment. There were no restrictions by outcomes examined, language or publication status.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-08-09 15:26:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Patricia  Fortin">
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and the risk of bias and extracted data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-12 10:58:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>We included five trials (660 participants) published between 1998 and 2016. Four of these trials were terminated early. The vast majority of participants had the haemoglobin (Hb)SS form of sickle cell disease.</P>
<P>Three trials compared regular red cell transfusions to standard care in primary prevention of stroke: two in children with no previous long-term transfusions; and one in children and adolescents on long-term transfusion.</P>
<P>Two trials compared the drug hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) and phlebotomy to long-term transfusions and iron chelation therapy: one in primary prevention (children); and one in secondary prevention (children and adolescents).</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trials being at a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, indirectness and imprecise outcome estimates.</P>
<P>
<B>Red cell transfusions versus standard care </B>
</P>
<P>
<I>Children with no previous long-term transfusions</I>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-12-19 12:05:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic haemoglobin disorder which can cause severe pain crises and dysfunction of virtually every organ system in the body, ultimately causing premature death. Populations originating from sub-Saharan Africa, South and Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, India and parts of the Mediterranean are predominantly affected. Reductions in infant and child mortality and increasing migration from highly affected countries have made this a worldwide problem (<LINK REF="REF-Piel-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piel 2012</LINK>). Over 12,500 people in the UK and 100,000 in the USA suffer from the disease (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pleasants-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pleasants 2014</LINK>). A recent study estimated that approximately 305,800 babies were born with SCD in 2010, of which two thirds were born in Africa, and this could increase to approximately 404,200 by 2050 (<LINK REF="REF-Piel-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piel 2012</LINK>). In high-income countries, people with SCD are expected to live into their 40's, 50's and beyond, whereas in low-income countries including some African nations it is estimated that between 50% to 90% of children born with HbSS die before their fifth birthday (<LINK REF="REF-Gravitz-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gravitz 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grosse-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grosse 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The term 'sickle cell disease' refers to all genotypes that cause the clinical syndrome. There are three main types of SCD. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common form of the disease (up to 70% of cases of SCD in people of African origin) and is due to the inheritance of two beta globin S (S) alleles (haemoglobin (Hb)SS). The second most common genotype (up to 30% of cases in people of African origin) is haemoglobin SC disease (HbSC disease) it is due to the co-inheritance of the HbS and HbC alleles and tends to be a more moderate form of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Nagel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagel 2003</LINK>).The third major type of SCD occurs when HbS is inherited with a &#946;-thalassaemia allele, causing HbS/&#946;-thalassaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Rees-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2010</LINK>). People who have inherited a &#946;-thalassaemia null mutation along with HbS (HbSßº) have a disease that is clinically indistinguishable from sickle cell anaemia, whereas people with HbS&#946;&#8314; thalassaemia have a milder disorder.</P>
<P>In SCD, under certain conditions in the absence of oxygen, the haemoglobin molecules within the red blood cells can associate as polymers, making the cells rigid and distorted into a variety of shapes, some resembling a sickle. The red blood cells have a shortened life span, resulting in anaemia. They also demonstrate increased adherence to endothelial cells lining the blood vessels, contributing to vaso-occlusion. In later life, chronic damage to poorly perfused organs becomes apparent (<LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 1999</LINK>). Individual heterogeneity among persons with sickle cell disease make the symptoms highly variable in frequency and severity, but the most common clinical manifestation is the acute sickle pain crisis which occurs when small vessels are blocked, depriving the tissues of oxygen and causing ischaemic damage and pain. Vaso-occlusion can also occur in some large vessels, such as those in the brain, causing or contributing to stroke.</P>
<P>Stroke, usually ischaemic, occurs in up to 10% of children with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1996</LINK>) and can cause weakness in the limbs, slurring of speech, seizures, coma and cognitive impairment. Recurrent (secondary) strokes occur in a half to two thirds of untreated individuals and are associated with increasing morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1996</LINK>). 'Silent' cerebral infarctions (SCIs) often go unnoticed but can also cause significant neurological damage and cognitive disability and are present in a further 17% to 27% of children with sickle cell anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Kinney-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinney 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kwiatkowski-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwiatkowski 2009</LINK>). Transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities (tests that measure the speed of blood flow through the brain's blood vessels (either the internal carotid artery or the middle cerebral artery) by ultrasound) are used to identify children at high risk of stroke. TCD velocities are classed as normal (less than 170 cm per second); conditional (170 to 199 cm per second); or abnormal (at least 200 cm per second) in (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1998b</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-10-04 11:38:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The focus in the past has largely been on secondary prevention with long-term transfusion, as risk factors for first stroke were not well established. However, with the technological breakthrough of the use of TCD cerebral blood flow velocity measurement, screening has become feasible and is currently the standard of care. Abnormally high blood flow in one or more major arteries is associated with vascular narrowing and predicts an increased risk of stroke, allowing preventative treatment (i.e. long-term red cell transfusion programme) prior to the first stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1998a</LINK>). The fetal haemoglobin (HbF) stimulating drug hydroxyurea has been substituted successfully for long-term red cell transfusion for the prevention of secondary stroke in a limited number of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 2010</LINK>). Serial phlebotomy may be highly effective in the reduction of iron overload if transfusions are no longer necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>As well as the direct and indirect costs, long-term red cell transfusions can have adverse side effects. Iron overload is a problem and requires daily oral iron chelation with deferasirox or deferiprone (or daily subcutaneous or intravenous infusions with desferrioxamine) to avoid the toxic effects of excess iron (<LINK REF="REF-Inati-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inati 2011</LINK>). However, compliance with the chelation programmes is often poor, and therefore problems of iron overload are potentially serious. Alloimmunisation occurs when the individual develops antibodies to the foreign red cells (<LINK REF="REF-Smith_x002d_Whitley-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith-Whitley 2012</LINK>), which is a major problem for future transfusion. Blood products can be contaminated with infective agents such as hepatitis C and HIV, and while this now occurs only rarely in developed countries, the risk is much higher in the developing countries where sickle cell disease is most prevalent. Other problems with transfusions include hyperviscosity of the blood due to over-transfusion, and haemolytic transfusion reactions, both potentially serious side effects. The regimen is often complex and time-consuming, requiring monthly transfusions to maintain the HbS at approximately 20% to 30%. In short, blood transfusion is a lengthy and costly process which is not without risks, and these must be balanced against the possible benefits prior to embarking on a long-term regimen.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-10-04 12:15:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Red cell transfusions are undertaken in many people with SCD to dilute the circulating sickle cells, thus reducing the risk of vaso-occlusive episodes and anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Serjeant-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serjeant 1992</LINK>) and increasing tissue oxygen delivery. Transfusions can be given acutely, in emergency treatment of complications such as acute splenic sequestration, aplastic crisis, and acute chest syndrome (ACS), and are also frequently used in preparation for surgery. In addition, many people with SCD receive chronic transfusion regimens in an attempt to prevent severe vaso-occlusion and stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Smith_x002d_Whitley-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith-Whitley 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mechanisms for the reduction in stroke risk from long-term red cell transfusion are not known (<LINK REF="REF-DeBaun-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeBaun 2006</LINK>). However, a reduction in cells containing high amounts of HbS or an increase in Hb level could have beneficial effects on cerebral blood vessels or interactions between red blood cells and endothelial cells (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1998b</LINK>). Transfusion does have an immediate haemodynamic effect measured by reduction of middle cerebral artery velocity (<LINK REF="REF-Venkatesubramanian-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venkatesubramanian 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hydroxyurea is currently the only approved therapeutic drug for the treatment of sickle cell anaemia (for adults with severe vaso-occlusive episodes of pain or acute chest syndrome) and its use has become widespread in both children and adults with this condition. In preliminary studies it was substituted successfully for long-term transfusion in the prevention of secondary strokes, leading to its consideration for use in the phase III SWiTCH trial (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the past three decades the standard treatment for iron overload related to long-term red cell transfusion has been the use of iron chelating agents, including desferrioxamine, deferiprone and deferasirox. Although serial phlebotomy has long been utilized for conditions such as polycythaemia, it has recently been found to be highly effective in the reduction of iron overload from chronic red blood cell transfusion in people who are no longer requiring that treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 2004</LINK>). Pilot information on the combination use of hydroxyurea and phlebotomy led to the development of the SWiTCH trial (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-12-08 10:22:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lise J Estcourt">
<P>In the USA the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines recommend a long-term red cell transfusion programme for prevention of stroke in people with SCD who have had a prior stroke, or who have an abnormal TCD reading (blood flow velocity equal to or greater than 200 cm per second in the internal carotid artery or the middle cerebral artery). While many studies support the efficacy of this treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bernaudin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernaudin 2011</LINK>), the optimum regimen and duration of treatment for primary stroke prophylaxis have not been widely agreed upon. This review aims to assess the relative risks and benefits of red cell transfusion regimens for preventing primary strokes in people with SCD, with or without SCIs. Furthermore, older data indicated the need for indefinite continuation of long-term red cell transfusion and iron removal in the prevention of secondary strokes and its treatment consequences (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1991</LINK>). The potential substitution of an oral drug (hydroxyurea) for long-term red cell transfusion and of periodic phlebotomy for oral or subcutaneous iron chelation offered less demanding and potentially less expensive secondary stroke preventative management.</P>

<P>For continuous outcomes we recorded the mean, standard deviation (SD) and total number of participants in both the treatment and control groups. For those continuous outcomes using the same scale, we performed analyses using the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). There were no continuous outcomes measured using different scales (when we would have used the standardised MD).</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes we recorded the number of events and the total number of participants in both the treatment and control groups. We reported the pooled risk ratio (RR) with a 95% CI. Where the number of observed events was small (less than 5% of sample per group), and where trials have balanced treatment groups, we reported the Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>). </P>

Where meta-analysis was feasible, we used the fixed-effect model for pooling the data. We used the Mantel-Haenszel method for dichotomous outcomes or Peto method as necessary, and the inverse variance method for continuous outcomes. There was no statistical heterogeneity, but if statistical heterogeneity was found to be above 75%, we would identify a reason for clinical heterogeneity and not perform a meta-analysis but comment instead on the results as a narrative.

<P>All trials had a transfusion arm with the aim of keeping HbS to 30% or less with local discretion as to the type of red blood cell transfusion administered (simple, manual exchange or automated exchange). Three trials reported using leucocyte-depleted red cells and blood matched for C, D, E and Kell antigen (<LINK REF="STD-SIT-2014" TYPE="STUDY">SIT 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STOP-1998" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STOP-2-2005" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 2 2005</LINK>), the remaining two trials did not report the type of blood component used (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>). In the SWiTCH and TWiTCH trials, participants in the transfusion arm also received iron chelation (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>), in the SIT and STOP 2 trials, participants received iron chelation if required (<LINK REF="STD-SIT-2014" TYPE="STUDY">SIT 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STOP-2-2005" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 2 2005</LINK>) and in the STOP trial, participants did not receive iron chelation (<LINK REF="STD-STOP-1998" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials compared long-term transfusion therapy to standard care with no hydroxyurea (<LINK REF="STD-SIT-2014" TYPE="STUDY">SIT 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STOP-1998" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STOP-2-2005" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 2 2005</LINK>). In two of these trials participants had not had previous long-term transfusions (<LINK REF="STD-SIT-2014" TYPE="STUDY">SIT 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STOP-1998" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 1998</LINK>), and in one trial all participants had previous long-term transfusions to prevent primary stroke (<LINK REF="STD-STOP-2-2005" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 2 2005</LINK>). In the STOP 2 trial, the transfusion halted arm could receive transfusions to treat SCD complications but if hydroxyurea or regular transfusions were initiated it was considered a cross-over and data were censored at treatment initiation (<LINK REF="STD-STOP-2-2005" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 2 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hydroxyurea was the comparator in the SWiTCH and TWiTCH trials, which was initiated at 20 mg/kg/day with escalation to a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with transfusion overlap for four to nine months until MTD was reached. Once MTD was reached, phlebotomy was commenced with a target of 10 mL/kg of blood removed monthly to reduce iron burden (maximum 500 mL) (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>)..</P>

<P>In both STOP trials, the primary outcomes were cerebral infarction or intracranial haemorrhage and STOP 2 also included reversion to abnormal velocity on TCD (<LINK REF="STD-STOP-1998" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STOP-2-2005" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 2 2005</LINK>). In both trials secondary outcomes reported were death, and transfusion- and SCD-related adverse events.</P>

<P>Stroke is a potentially devastating event which affects up to 10% of children with sickle cell anaemia. Recurrences are common after the first stroke, and result in progressively more severe neurological dysfunction. The use of transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening has made it possible to identify a subset of children who are at higher risk for primary stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>This Cochrane Review aimed to evaluate the literature on the effectiveness and safety of red cell transfusions for primary and secondary prevention of stroke.</P>
<P>We identified five randomised controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria and included a total of 660 participants. The trials were published between 1998 and 2016. Three trials compared red cell transfusions to standard care and two trials compared hydroxyurea with phlebotomy to red cell transfusions with chelation. The majority of participants had HbSS sickle cell disease (SCD), all trials included children and two trials also included adolescents. Four trials were for primary stroke prevention and one trial dealt with secondary stroke prevention. No trials included adults for primary or secondary prevention of stroke.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Red cell transfusions versus standard care</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Primary prevention</HEADING>
<P>Three randomised trials compared red cell transfusions to standard care for primary prevention of stroke. Two of these trials included children with no previous long-term transfusions; one of these included children with abnormal TCD velocities, and the other included children with silent cerebral infarcts on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but normal TCD velocities. The third trial included children and adolescents on long-term transfusion whose TCD velocities had normalised. Two of the three trials were terminated early due to safety concerns.</P>
<P>The findings of the review led to the following main conclusions regarding red cell transfusions versus standard care.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Long-term transfusions probably reduce the incidence of clinical stroke in children with a higher risk of stroke (abnormal TCD velocities or previous history of silent cerebral infarctions (SCIs)).</LI>
<LI>Long-term transfusions may: reduce the incidence of other SCD-related complications (acute chest syndrome (ACS) and painful crisis); make little or no difference to IQ scores in children with SCIs; and may increase quality of life.</LI>
<LI>We are very uncertain whether long-term transfusions: reduce all-cause mortality (no deaths in either trial); reduce the risk of TIAs; or increase the risk for developing alloimmunisation.</LI>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-12-19 12:15:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>This review provides the most up-to-date assessment of the effectiveness and safety of red cell transfusions for the prevention of primary and secondary stroke. In this 2016 updated review we include two new trials and we have not identified any ongoing trials.</P>
<P>The results of this review can only be interpreted in consideration of the following factors.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The findings in this review can only be generalised to children with HbSS disease. Two trials also included adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-STOP-2-2005" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 2 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Only one of the trials assessed secondary prevention of stroke (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>All of the trials were conducted in high-income countries (USA, Canada, France and the UK). The potential risks associated with transfusion therapy are increased in low-income countries due to a lack of trained staff, modern equipment, sanitary conditions and clean, infection-free blood products (<LINK REF="REF-Ansong-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansong 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohene_x002d_Frempong-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohene-Frempong 1999</LINK>). Therefore, the risk-benefit ratio will be different in low-income countries to those in the included trials, and the results discussed in this review may not be generalisable to that setting.</LI>
<LI>Co-inheritance of alpha thalassaemia may reduce the frequency of complications in individuals with HbSS (<LINK REF="REF-Rumaney-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rumaney 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 2012</LINK>). Only one trial reported co-existence of alpha thalassaemia (<LINK REF="STD-STOP-1998" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 1998</LINK>). In the Stop trial, alpha thalassaemia (at least one alpha globin gene missing) occurred in 22% in the transfusion arm and 9% in the standard treatment arm (<LINK REF="STD-STOP-1998" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 1998</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The chances of having a stroke must be weighed carefully against the burden of regular blood transfusion. In the STOP trial, of the 192 children eligible to take part in the trial, 52 declined to undergo randomisation due to either reluctance of the child or their parents, or due to concern of the physician about compliance with the regimen (<LINK REF="STD-STOP-1998" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 1998</LINK>). In the SIT trial, of the 99 randomised to transfusion, 15 crossed over to observation, nine of which declined transfusion immediately after randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-SIT-2014" TYPE="STUDY">SIT 2014</LINK>). These figures may illustrate a relatively poor level of acceptance of this therapy.</LI>
<LI>The trials did not answer the question of how long red cell transfusion needs to be continued in this population, once commenced. The STOP 2 trial attempted to determine a safe age, or period, for discontinuation of chronic transfusion therapy for primary stroke prevention (<LINK REF="STD-STOP-2-2005" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 2 2005</LINK>). However, because of the high proportion (39%) of participants who reverted to abnormal TCD high stroke risk or had a stroke after transfusion was ceased, the trial was terminated two years early with the implication that transfusion therapy should be continued indefinitely in indicated participants. Although eight participants (20%) of those who discontinued transfusion had no abnormal TCD over 25 months of observation, there is currently no way of predicting which individuals will require continuance of transfusion and which will not. Extended follow-up analysis of the STOP trial also failed to identify predictors for lower-risk groups (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2006</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The optimal level of sensitivity and specificity for TCD screening remains unclear. The STOP trial included high-risk children with abnormal TCD velocities, the rate of stroke in the standard care group was approximately 10% per year (<LINK REF="STD-STOP-1998" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 1998</LINK>). The number of participants needed to treat (NNT) was approximately 11 participants per year to prevent one stroke. In a lower risk group this NNT would be higher. However, if the specificity of the screening, or the 'cut-off point' for a high-risk classification, was increased, only the very highest risk children would be treated and children at risk of stroke may be missed. It must therefore be judged at what level of risk it is justifiable to enrol a child to a potentially life-long regimen of transfusion. Despite these barriers, the routine use of TCD screening and appropriate prophylactic transfusion has greatly lowered the risk of stroke in people who are managed in contemporary sickle cell programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Enninful_x002d_Eghan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enninful-Eghan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fullerton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fullerton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCarville-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarville 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Telfer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Telfer 2007</LINK>)<I>. </I>At present, the majority of transfusions provided by large sickle cell centres are for the provision of primary rather than secondary stroke prevention.</LI>
<LI>Four of the five trials were stopped early. The STOP trial was terminated 16 months before the planned end date because of the high rate of stroke in the standard care arm (<LINK REF="STD-STOP-1998" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 1998</LINK>). The STOP 2 trial was terminated early over safety concerns because high-risk TCD results developed in 14 participants and two participants had a stroke in the transfusion halted arm (<LINK REF="STD-STOP-2-2005" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 2 2005</LINK>). The SWiTCH trial was stopped early due to futility when hydroxyurea and phlebotomy showed no advantage in iron removal compared with long-term transfusion and iron chelation (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>). The TWiTCH trial was stopped early because after the first interim analysis, when 33% of participants had completed the trial, non-inferiority was found, and non-inferiority was confirmed again after 50% of participants had exited the trial (<LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Children with severe vasculopathy were excluded from the TWiTCH trial, and only individuals with severe vasculopathy had a stroke in the SWiTCH trial (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>). So individuals with severe vasculopathy may not be candidates for hydroxyurea. As well, it is not known if the effectiveness of hydroxyurea with phlebotomy is sustained over the long term.</LI>
<LI>In the SIT trial there was a 20% cross-over rate to either transfusion or hydroxyurea therapy due to increasing disease severity in children receiving standard care (<LINK REF="STD-SIT-2014" TYPE="STUDY">SIT 2014</LINK>). Six per cent of children receiving standard care crossed over to regular monthly transfusions and 14% began receiving hydroxyurea treatment. We do not know how this may have influenced outcomes over the long term, but this increases uncertainty as to the efficacy of standard care compared to transfusions in these children.</LI>

<P>Overall the quality of the evidence was rated moderate to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>). This was due to trials being at serious risk of bias; outcome estimates being imprecise (wide confidence intervals); and a serious risk of indirectness (no direct evidence for adults or children without HbSS) since the trials only included children and adolescents primarily with HbSS disease. The HbSS and HbS&#946;º thalassaemia genotypes included within the trials account for approximately 70% of people with SCD. Individuals with these genotypes have a higher prevalence of stroke that presents earlier than individuals with HbSC and other milder forms of SCD. Nevertheless, the participant inclusion criteria for this review is broad and although the prevalence of stroke is estimated to be rare in children with milder forms of SCD a recent trial in a cohort of 96 children with HbSC disease, estimated the prevalence for SCIs to be 13.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Guilliams-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guilliams 2015</LINK>). The outcome for clinical stroke in primary prevention in children with no previous long-term transfusions and at higher risk of stroke (abnormal TCD velocities and presence of SCIs) was the only outcome rated as moderate quality evidence.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-09-02 15:19:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lise J Estcourt">
<P>To our knowledge, our review process is free from bias. We conducted a comprehensive search; searching data sources (including multiple databases, and clinical trial registries) to ensure that all relevant trials would be captured. There were no restrictions for the language in which the paper was originally published. The relevance of each paper was carefully assessed and all screening and data extractions were performed in duplicate. We pre-specified all outcomes and subgroups prior to analysis. There were insufficient numbers of included trials within the meta-analyses for us to use a funnel plot to examine the risk of publication bias.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-10-07 11:14:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>With regard to the conclusions of the STOP and STOP 2 trials, multiple reports have supported the efficacy of chronic transfusion in preventing primary stroke in those at high risk based on abnormal TCD velocities (<LINK REF="REF-Enninful_x002d_Eghan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enninful-Eghan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fullerton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fullerton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCarville-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarville 2008</LINK>); this has become standard of care practice in almost all sickle cell centres and has led to more subjects being transfused for primary than for secondary stroke prevention in those centres. The findings of the SWiTCH trial were somewhat unexpected because of previously published smaller single institution studies which suggested greater efficacy from phlebotomy in reducing iron overload and not as great a degree of protection from chronic transfusion in secondary stroke prophylaxis (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several observational studies for secondary stroke prevention have also attempted to define whether transfusion may be safely stopped. One review suggested that transfusion may be safely stopped at age 18 years (<LINK REF="REF-Powars-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powars 2000</LINK>), and no recurrences occurred in a small series of seven adults with SCD followed up for three years to 18 years (<LINK REF="REF-Rana-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rana 1997</LINK>). However, a study of 10 participants who discontinued transfusion after one to two years showed a 70% recurrence rate after only 11 months (<LINK REF="REF-Wilimas-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilimas 1980</LINK>). In a subsequent study, five out of 10 people with SCD who had been receiving regular transfusions for five to 12 years experienced an ischaemic event in the 12-month period after transfusions were stopped (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1991</LINK>). These findings suggest that the risk of secondary stroke may be almost as high after discontinuing transfusion therapy 'prematurely' as before starting it. Evaluation of risk factors related to the initial stroke might be an important consideration in the design of any further studies. For example, in a retrospective analysis of 137 stroke participants, those who had an identified medical or concurrent event associated with their initial stroke did not have a recurrent stroke two or more years after the initial event (<LINK REF="REF-Scothorn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scothorn 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>This systematic review noted a lack of prospective randomised controlled trials of blood transfusion for prevention of secondary stroke (following an initial stroke) in SCD. However, the practice of long-term transfusion therapy is supported by evidence from several observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Sarnaik-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarnaik 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Styles-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Styles 1994</LINK>). It was demonstrated in a small study of 15 participants that a target HbS level of 30% to 50% retains a high protective value against stroke, but reduces transfusion requirements and the associated risks (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1992</LINK>). However, in a study which observed 60 persons with SCD for 192 person years, HbS was greater than 30% in seven of the 16 reported transient ischaemic events and five of six recurrent infarctions (<LINK REF="REF-Pegelow-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pegelow 1995</LINK>). A recent survey has indicated that an acceptable "community standard" level of pre-transfusion HbS is less than 45% rather than less than 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Aygun-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aygun 2009</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-12-19 12:04:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>In children with no previous long-term transfusions, red cell transfusions probably reduce the risk of stroke and may confer some additional advantage by reducing the rates of ACS and painful crisis. This must be balanced against the adverse effects and costs of a chronic transfusion regimen. We are uncertain whether transfusions can be stopped in children and adolescents at high risk of stroke who have had their TCD velocities normalised, nor has any treatment duration threshold been established for stopping transfusions.</P>
<P>We are uncertain if switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy is non-inferior to red cell transfusions in a select population of children in primary prevention; we are also uncertain as to how long the drug effects may be maintained. We are uncertain if switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy results in an increased risk of stroke in secondary prevention and switching may increase the risk of adverse events in children and adolescents. Hydroxyurea with phlebotomy did not demonstrate superiority in iron removal as measured by liver iron concentration.</P>
<P>Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on management for adults with HbSS disease or children and adults with HbSßº, HbSC or HbSß&#8314; disease.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-08-10 16:18:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lise J Estcourt">
<P>Information from a well-designed, prospective, randomised controlled trial of chronic blood transfusion regimens in persons with sickle cell disease who have had a previous stroke is desirable in order to make recommendations for the optimal use of this therapy in secondary stroke prevention. Recent improvements in methods of detecting high-risk individuals are improving clinical outcome, but further research is needed to assess the relative risks and benefits of hydroxyurea in comparison with long-term transfusion therapy for primary and secondary prevention of cerebral infarcts. Randomised trials are needed comparing blood transfusions with both standard care and hydroxyurea for both primary and secondary prevention in adults with SCD.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The inclusive independent stroke adjudication process for all suspected new neurological events is a novel feature of the trial. Stroke recurrence is a primary trial endpoint but also is a critical safety endpoint for the SWiTCH trial. Accordingly, it was necessary to develop an inclusive process by which all potential stroke events were recognized and systematically adjudicated using a standardized protocol and masked consultants. Participants who develop any acute neurological change are promptly evaluated for possible stroke. In addition, site personnel are provided with a written script to use at each interval clinic visit, to ensure that subjects and families are asked each month about any signs and symptoms of stroke. After a new neurological event is suspected, the stroke adjudication process begins. The clinical history and neurological exam are reviewed by 3 independent neurologists without knowledge of the imaging findings. Simultaneously, the radiological evaluation is reviewed by 3 independent masked neuroradiologists without knowledge of the clinical history or neurological examination. Only after their independent consensus opinions are formed are these two opinions reconciled into a final stroke adjudication decision; a diagnosis of stroke requires new neurological findings with corresponding radiological changes.</P>

<P>The duration of hydroxyurea therapy without transfusions was relatively short; longer follow-up is clearly needed to establish whether these findings are maintained over time.</P>

<P>After full enrolment and when 37% of the participants had exited the trial, the first scheduled interim analysis showed that the stopping boundary had been passed and non-inferiority was shown. After 50% of participants had exited, repeat analyses supported these findings and the trial was terminated by NHLBI. Remaining participants then completed all exit studies before discontinuing protocol-directed trial treatment. In total, the standard group included 42 participants who completed trial treatment, 11 who had truncated treatment, and eight who exited early; the alternative group included 41 participants who completed treatment, 13 who had truncated treatment, and 6 who exited early.</P>
