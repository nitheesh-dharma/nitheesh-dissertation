<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-01-08 12:01:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There is not enough evidence to assess whether using pneumococcal vaccination during pregnancy can prevent infant infections.</P>
<P>Although the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease is variable across the world, the rate of serious illness or death is high in children who get this infection. The <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I> (pneumococcus) organism colonizes the upper respiratory tract and can cause bacteremia, meningitis, pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract, and upper respiratory tract infections, including otitis media and sinusitis. Newborn vaccination schedules of three primary doses with a booster dose could reduce the impact of pneumococcal disease in immunized children, but these vaccinations have no protective effect in infants less than three months of age. Maternal pneumococcal immunization during pregnancy may be a way of preventing pneumococcal disease during the infant's first months of life. We included seven randomized controlled trials. A total of 919 pregnant women participated in the six randomized controlled trials that contributed data to this review. The trials compared 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine with control vaccine. All women received a single injection of pneumococcal or control vaccine (where used). The women&#8217;s mean gestational age at the time of immunization was between 27 and 38 weeks, where stated. Only two trials with 241 pregnancies reported on neonatal infections. This was not enough information to say whether pneumococcal vaccination during pregnancy led to fewer infant infections. Two trials with 146 pregnancies reported on infant nasal carriage of pneumococci (pneumococcal colonization), which was not enough evidence to show an effect in reducing colonization at two to three months of age or six to seven months of age. The included trials were of reasonable quality. There was no difference between pneumococcal vaccine and control vaccine for tenderness at the injection site. No serious adverse events were reported in the trials.</P>

<P>Approximately 450,000 children worldwide die of pneumococcal infections each year. The development of bacterial resistance to antimicrobials adds to the difficulty of treatment of diseases and emphasizes the need for a preventive approach.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-15 15:23:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Seven trials were included, but only six trials (919 participants) contributed data. There was no evidence that pneumococcal vaccination during pregnancy reduces the risk of neonatal infection (risk ratio (RR) 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 1.46; two trials, 241 pregnancies, <I>low quality evidence</I>). Although the data suggest an effect in reducing pneumococcal colonization in infants by 16 months of age (average RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.98; one trial, 56 pregnancies), there was no evidence of this effect in infants at two to three months of age (average RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.46 to 2.78; two trials, 146 pregnancies, <I>low quality evidence</I>) or by six to seven months of age (average RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.08; two trials, 148 pregnancies, <I>low quality evidence</I>). None of the trials included in this review reported neonatal death as a result of pneumococcal infection.</P>
<P>Neonatal antibody levels were reported as geometric mean and 95% CI. There were inconsistent results between studies. Two studies showed significantly higher immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in cord blood in the pneumococcal vaccine group when compared with the control group for all serotypes. In contrast, another trial showed no difference in neonatal antibody levels between the pneumococcal vaccine group and the control group.</P>
<P>Maternal antibody levels were also reported as geometric mean and 95% CI. One study showed significantly higher IgG levels in maternal serum in women immunized with pneumococcal vaccine when compared with control vaccine regardless of any serotypes. Another study showed significantly higher maternal antibody levels only for serotype 14, but no evidence of an effect for other serotypes.</P>
<P>The percentage of women with seroprotection was measured in one trial at delivery and at 12 months post-delivery. At delivery, results favored the intervention group for serotype 6 (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.69), serotype 14 (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.56) and serotype 19 (RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.89 to 2.76). There were no group differences seen at 12 months post-delivery for serotypes 6 or 14 (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12 and RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.15, respectively), but results favored the intervention group for serotype 19 (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.85).</P>
<P>No significant difference for tenderness at the injection site between women who received pneumococcal vaccine and those who received control vaccine (average RR 3.20; 95% CI 0.32 to 31.54; two trials, 130 women).</P>
<P>The overall quality of evidence is low for primary outcomes. Most outcomes had wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect, and most of the included trials had small numbers of participants and few events which led to downgrading evidence for imprecision of findings.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-01-08 12:02:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-01-08 12:02:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Infections caused by<I> Streptococcus pneumoniae</I> (pneumococcus) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). Pneumococcus is a leading cause of illness in young children and causes illness and death among the elderly and persons who have certain underlying medical conditions. The organism colonizes the upper respiratory tract and can cause the following types of illnesses: (a) invasive pneumococcal infections, including bacteremia and meningitis; (b) pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections; and (c) upper respiratory tract infections, including otitis media and sinusitis. Invasive pneumococcal diseases are less common than non-invasive manifestations, but cause high mortality. Each year, approximately 330,000 to 529,000 children worldwide, mostly in low- to middle-income countries, die of pneumococcal infections (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). The development of resistance to antimicrobials by the bacteria adds to the difficulty of treatment of diseases and emphasizes the need for a preventive approach.</P>
<P>Regional differences in incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease have been noted. A 10-year surveillance in the Oxfordshire region of England, found that the annual incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease among children under five years of age prior to implementation of the pneumococcal vaccine was 24.3 per 100,000 persons (95% confidence interval 21.0 to 27.7) (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 2008</LINK>). A population-based study carried out in a rural area of Bangladesh estimated the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease among children to be 86 cases per 100,000 person-years (<LINK REF="REF-Arifeen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arifeen 2009</LINK>). In the United States, the routine use of pneumococcal vaccine beginning in 2000 has had a substantial impact on the epidemiology of pneumococcal disease in children. In infants younger than five years, rates of invasive pneumococcal disease have decreased from 98.7 cases per 100,000 population during 1998 and 1999 to 23.6 cases per 100,000 population in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Pilishvili-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilishvili 2010</LINK>). Similar findings were reported in European countries. After widespread pneumococcal vaccination, there was a mean decline in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in children aged less than two years from 32.5 to 23.4/100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Isaacman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isaacman 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-01-08 12:02:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There are two types of pneumococcal vaccine available, polysaccharide vaccines and polysaccharide/protein conjugate vaccines. The 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) contains polysaccharide antigen from 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B,17F, 18C, 19A, 19F, 20, 22F, 23F and 33F), which cause 85% to 90% of bacteremic pneumococcal disease in adults. More than 80% of healthy adults who receive PPV23 develop antibodies against the serotypes contained in the vaccine within two to three weeks after vaccination; however, the vaccine is relatively poor at producing immunity in children less than two years old (<LINK REF="REF-Klouwenberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klouwenberg 2008</LINK>). The pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV) is much better at producing immunity in infants than pure polysaccharide vaccines (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klouwenberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klouwenberg 2008</LINK>). In 2000, the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV7) was recommended in the United States for immunization of infants (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2000</LINK>). PCV-7 includes the seven most frequent polysaccharides (serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F) in pneumococcal infections of the young child. Newborn vaccination schedules consist of three primary doses routinely plus a booster dose. After four doses, more than 90% of healthy infants develop antibodies to all seven serotypes contained in the vaccine. In a large trial, PCV7 was shown to reduce invasive disease caused by vaccine serotypes by 97%; however, it was less effective against acute otitis media (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2000</LINK>). Local reactions following PCV7 occur in 10% to 20% of recipients and are more common with the fourth dose than the first three doses. No severe adverse events attributable to PCV7 have been reported. The vaccine could substantially reduce the impact of pneumococcal disease in immunized children (<LINK REF="REF-Isaacman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isaacman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pilishvili-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilishvili 2010</LINK>); however, it does not have an effect on the morbidity and mortality of the younger infants, especially those less than three months of age. This may be due to the fact that serum IgG (immunoglobulin G) antibodies against polysaccharides increase only after the second and third vaccine doses are administered (<LINK REF="REF-Rennels-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rennels 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>PCV7 given to the children has had a substantial effect on pneumococcal disease in the United States since its introduction in 2000. A large, population-based surveillance system monitoring invasive pneumococcal disease in a population of nearly 20 million persons in the United States, found that rates of invasive pneumococcal disease in children younger than two years of age were 68.6% lower in 2001 compared with rates of disease before the vaccine was introduced (<LINK REF="REF-Whitney-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitney 2003</LINK>). Furthermore, widespread vaccination of children with PCV7 has shown a 'herd effect' in decreasing the carriage rate of <I>S. pneumoniae</I> in children, who are an important vector of <I>S. pneumoniae</I> to other children and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Dagan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dagan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pilishvili-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilishvili 2010</LINK>). Data from the same surveillance indicate that unvaccinated adults are benefiting from the vaccination of children. Infection rates in adults fell 8% to 32% when compared with the average rates in 1998 and 1999 (<LINK REF="REF-Whitney-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitney 2003</LINK>). However, invasive pneumococcal disease caused by non-PCV7 serotypes has increased and partially offset the reductions (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pilishvili-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilishvili 2010</LINK>). Overall, rates of invasive pneumococcal disease have remained stable at 22 to 25 cases per 100,000 since 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pilishvili-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilishvili 2010</LINK>). An increase in disease due to non-PCV-7 serotypes and the need for broader serotype coverage to address the global disease burden provides a rationale for a second-generation conjugate vaccine, 10-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV10, including serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV13, including serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) (<LINK REF="REF-Grijalva-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grijalva 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in the United States has recommended the use of PCV13 for immunization of infants since 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2010</LINK>) and the World Health Organization has recommended to replace PCV7 by PCV10 or PCV13 for immunization of infants in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>Maternal immunization could help to prevent the two to three million neonatal and early infant deaths that occur in low- to middle-income countries each year (<LINK REF="REF-Greenwood-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenwood 2003</LINK>). Maternal pneumococcal immunization may be a way of preventing pneumococcal disease during the first months of life before infant-administered pneumococcal conjugate vaccine starts to produce protection. This strategy has the potential to impact on public health, as has been seen by the prevention of tetanus neonatorum through maternal immunization (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2013</LINK>). An effective delivery system for maternal immunization already exists and, because of the success of maternal tetanus immunization, this approach to the prevention of serious illness or death in young infants is widely accepted by the general population. </P>

<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>

<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1212181516253162684622876719716&amp;format=REVMAN_GRAPHS#REF-Higgins-2011">Higgins 2011</A>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we planned to assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings.

<LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>.</P>
<P>For this update, the quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>) in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes for the main comparisons.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Neonatal infection - pneumonia</LI>
<LI>Neonatal infection - meningitis</LI>
<LI>Neonatal infection - otitis media</LI>

<LI>Pneumococcal colonization - six to seven months</LI>
</OL>
<P>GRADE profiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2008</LINK>) was used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create a &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; table. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>
<P>The primary outcomes were included in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. For neonatal infection, none of the included trials in this review reported the outcome of neonatal death. Neonatal pneumococcal colonization by 16 months of age was reported in one trial, but it was not included as a primary outcome or in the 'Summary of findings' table because the colonization at this time point may be confounded by neonatal vaccination.</P>

<P>For this update we did not include any cluster-randomized trials in the review. If in future updates eligible cluster-randomized trials are identified, we will include these cluster-randomized trials in the analyses along with individually-randomized trials. We will adjust their sample sizes or standard errors using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> using an estimate of the intra-cluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomized trials and individually-randomized trials, we plan to synthesize the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomization unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>Where there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. Where we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau² and I².</P>

The power to detect this effect might be too low because of a small sample size. Results of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Munoz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Munoz 2001</LINK>) suggested that maternal pneumococcal vaccination can reduce the risk of pneumococcal colonization by 16 months of age, but no effect was shown at earlier ages.</P>

<P>There are some limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results of this review. First, neonatal infection, the most significant outcome, was only reported in two trials with small numbers of participants. Neonatal death due to pneumococcal infections was not reported in any included trial. Second, the effect on neonatal pneumococcal colonization at 16 months of age with no effect demonstrated at two to seven months may not be due to the vaccine administered during pregnancy. There was no detail regarding the confounding factors or co-intervention reported in the trial. The included studies did not report on breastfeeding or antibody level in breast milk that may impact on antibody transfer to the neonates.</P>

<P>Overall, the quality of evidence is low for all outcomes (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Outcomes had wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect, and included trials had small numbers of participants and few events, which led to downgrading evidence for imprecision of findings.

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-01-08 12:12:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials to support the use of pneumococcal vaccination during pregnancy for preventing infant infections. Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for administration to pregnant women when they have underlying medical conditions for preventing maternal infections (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2003</LINK>). None of the studies reported risk from the vaccine to fetus. Risk to a developing fetus from vaccination of the mother during pregnancy is primarily theoretical. No evidence exists of risk from vaccinating pregnant women with inactivated virus or bacterial vaccines or toxoids (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2011</LINK>). The benefits of vaccinating pregnant women usually outweigh potential risks when the likelihood of disease exposure is high, when infection would pose a risk to the mother or fetus, and when the vaccine is unlikely to cause harm.</P>
<P>One of the strategies to prevent infection in the neonatal and early infant period is neonatal vaccination. Two recent trials (<LINK REF="REF-Pomat-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomat 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2011</LINK>) showed impressive results of earlier PCV7 administration to the newborn (at birth or shortly after birth). Although no clinical outcomes have yet been reported, both trials demonstrated that neonatal PCV7 vaccination was safe, immunogenic and not associated with immune tolerance. Vaccination beginning at birth may be a considerable option to minimize invasive pneumococcal disease in these young infants.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-01-08 12:12:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The review included a small number of randomized controlled trials on pneumococcal vaccination during pregnancy, therefore, they may not have enough power to detect the effectiveness on preventing infant infections. Future trials need to choose the vaccine type as well as the timing of vaccination that could maximize maternal immunogenicity and antibody transfer to the fetus. A new approach using recombinant pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) as a protein-based vaccine has been investigated in mice (<LINK REF="REF-Kono-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kono 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the included studies in this review reported the primary outcome of neonatal death due to pneumococcal infection.</P>
<P>As previously discussed, the future vaccine formulations containing additional serotypes and earlier administration to the newborn needs to be evaluated for its effectiveness in reducing invasive pneumococcal disease in children. If it is the case, trials of pneumococcal vaccination during pregnancy for preventing infant infection may not be needed.</P>
