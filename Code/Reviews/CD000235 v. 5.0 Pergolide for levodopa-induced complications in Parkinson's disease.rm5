</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>In later Parkinson's disease, long-term treatment with levodopa therapy is associated with the development of motor complications which include abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesia) and a shortening response to each dose (wearing off phenomenon). Dopamine agonists have been used in such patients in the hope that they can reduce the duration of immobile off periods and the need for levodopa therapy whilst maintaining or improving motor impairments and only minimally increasing dopaminergic adverse events.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the efficacy and safety of adjunct pergolide therapy versus placebo in patients with Parkinson's disease suffering from the complications of levodopa therapy.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Handsearching of the neurology literature as part of the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group's strategy. Examination of the reference lists of identified studies and other reviews. Contact with Eli Lilly and Company Limited.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of pergolide versus placebo in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and long-term complications of levodopa therapy.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data was abstracted independently by each author and differences settled by discussion. The outcome measures used included Parkinson's disease rating scales, levodopa dosage, 'off' time measurements and the frequency of drop outs and adverse events.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>A large number of small RCTs were identified, but these were part of a large multicentre trial which was eventually published in full. The final publication was used as the only subject for this review. The time patients spent 'off' was reduced by 1.8 hours with pergolide compared with 0.2 hours with placebo (p &lt; 0.001). Dyskinesia developed or deteriorated in 62% of pergolide-treated compared with 25% placebo-treated patients (p &lt; 0.05). The excess in dyskinesia prevalence and severity resolved by the end of the study with levodopa reduction. Levodopa dose was reduced more in those receiving pergolide (235 mg v 51 mg; p &lt; 0.001). Pergolide produced significant improvement in Hoehn and Yahr stage (p &lt; 0.05) and both the motor and activities of daily living parts of a modified Columbia rating scale (both p &lt; 0.001). Significantly more patients suffered nausea (24% v 13%; p &lt; 0.001) and hallucinations (14% v 3%; p &lt; 0.01) on pergolide. No difference was found in the numbers remaining on treatment at the end of the study (pergolide 84% v placebo 82%) but withdrawals due to adverse events were greater in those taking pergolide (10% v 4%).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Based on this single large multicentre study, pergolide reduces 'off' time and improves impairment and disability due to Parkinson's disease whilst allowing a reduction in levodopa dose. This is at the expense of dopaminergic adverse events. Further trials are required to compare pergolide with the newer dopamine agonists.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>In spite of recent therapeutic advances, levodopa therapy remains the 'gold standard' in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, later in the course of treatment, complications of long-term levodopa therapy emerge. These are comprised of choreoathetoid dyskinesia, dystonia and a shortened response to each dose referred to as 'end-of-dose deterioration' or the 'wearing off effect'. Such problems affect 100% of young onset patients after 6 years of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Quinn-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinn 1986</LINK>). Across the full age range of the condition, they affect around 50% after 6 years of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Rajput-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajput 1984</LINK>), although a more recent study found them in only 16% after 5 years of Sinemet or Sinemet CR therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Block-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dopamine agonists act directly on post-synaptic dopamine receptors in the striatum and do not require to be converted into dopamine as does levodopa. Although these agents are not as effective as might be assumed from this novel mechanism of action, they generate less response fluctuations in long-term monotherapy. Thus, original studies showed that few patients developed dyskinesia after up to ten years of treatment with bromocriptine (<LINK REF="REF-Stern-and-Lees-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stern and Lees 1986</LINK>). In a larger scale study, the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Study Group showed that only 2% of 224 patients developed dyskinesia after 3 years of bromocriptine therapy compared with 27% in the 213 who had received levodopa with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (<LINK REF="REF-PDRG-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">PDRG 1993</LINK>). This beneficial action of bromocriptine therapy in newly diagnosed patients is the subject of another Cochrane review.</P>
<P>Pergolide is an ergoline class dopamine agonist along with bromocriptine. Some early studies suggested it may be of value in de novo patients with Parkinson's disease but most studies have been directed at its efficacy as adjunct therapy in later disease. It is hoped that by adding pergolide at this later stage that the long-term complications of levodopa therapy can be reduced by using the agonist for its levodopa sparing effect. This is of crucial importance to patients who are suffering these disturbing side effects of levodopa therapy.</P>
<P>The present study is a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials of adjunct pergolide therapy compared with placebo in Parkinson's disease to establish its efficacy and tolerability. A separate review covers the effects of adjunct pergolide therapy versus bromocriptine.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the efficacy and safety of adjunct pergolide therapy versus placebo in patients with Parkinson's disease, already established on levodopa and suffering from motor complications.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomised trials comparing pergolide with placebo.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease who had developed dyskinesias, end-of-dose deterioration or both. All ages were included. Any duration of prior levodopa therapy was allowed.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Oral pergolide therapy or placebo. Trial durations of greater than four weeks were included.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>1. Improvement in the time patients spend in the 'off' state.</P>
<P>2. Changes in the prevalence of dyskinesia and dyskinesia rating scales.</P>
<P>3. Changes in parkinsonian rating scales.</P>
<P>Many such rating scales exist. The Hoehn and Yahr scale (<LINK REF="REF-Hoehn-and-Yahr-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoehn and Yahr 1967</LINK>) is usually used to classify the stage of the disease, but it is often used to follow the response to drug therapy. More recently, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-UPDRS-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">UPDRS 1987</LINK>) has been used to score various disabilities and impairments due to the disease. Forerunners of the UPDRS include the modified Columbia scale which was used in <LINK REF="STD-North-American-1994" TYPE="STUDY">North American 1994</LINK>. Individual items from this scale (e.g. tremor and gait) were also used to provide more meaningful outcomes for patients reading this review.</P>
<P>4. Reduction in levodopa dose.</P>
<P>5. Number of withdrawals due to lack of efficacy and/or side-effects.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>1. The review is based on the search strategy of the Movement Disorders Group. This includes computerised searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE and hand searching of appropriate neurology journals. Relevant trials were included on the Group's specialised register of randomised controlled trials. Further details are available in the Group's module on the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.</P>
<P>2. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (1998 Issue 3) was also searched for relevant trials.</P>
<P>3. The reference lists of located trials and of other pergolide reviews were searched.</P>
<P>4. Additional assistance was provided by the drug manufacturer Eli Lilly and Company Limited.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The two authors (CC, JS) independently assessed the studies identified by the search strategy. Disagreements about inclusions were resolved by discussion. The full papers were assessed for methodological quality by recording the method of randomisation and blinding, whether an intention-to-treat analysis was used and the number of patients lost to follow up.</P>
<P>Eligible data was abstracted onto standardised forms by both authors independently, checked for accuracy and amalgamated. Since Review Manager version 3 does not support non-parametric methods for combining categorial variables, the results of parkinsonian rating scales were included as descriptions of results. A weighted estimate (fixed effect model) of the typical treatment effect across trials (odds ratio) was calculated for ordinal and dichotomous variables such as 'off' time and adverse event prevalence.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>See also Characteristics of Included Studies.</P>
<P>The majority of the RCTs identified comparing pergolide with placebo were published in the late 1980s and formed part of a large multicentre study which has now been published in full (<LINK REF="STD-North-American-1994" TYPE="STUDY">North American 1994</LINK>). Therefore, these small reports have been excluded from this review.</P>
<P>The large, double-blind, parallel group, RCT comparing pergolide with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-North-American-1994" TYPE="STUDY">North American 1994</LINK>) was performed in 16 centres across North America. Typical inclusion and exclusion criteria for adjunct therapy trials were adopted regarding diagnosis, prior medication, co-morbid conditions, etc.</P>
<P>The two intervention groups in <LINK REF="STD-North-American-1994" TYPE="STUDY">North American 1994</LINK> were similar in terms of age, duration of disease, levodopa dose and disease severity.</P>
<P>Reasons for withdrawals were tabulated and the results were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Statistical methods were appopriate including non-parametric analysis of categorical data.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>See also Characteristics of Included Studies.</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-North-American-1994" TYPE="STUDY">North American 1994</LINK>) met the inclusion criteria for the review. Randomisation in this study was by a "computer generated schedule" but more precise details were not given. No details of the method of concealment of allocation were given. It is therefore unclear whether the study was subject to selection bias.</P>
<P>North Amercian 1994 was performed on a double-blind basis throughout using an identical placebo, so it is unlikely that it was subject to performance or attrition bias.</P>
<P>No statement was made on whether those analysing the results were blind to treatment assignment in <LINK REF="STD-North-American-1994" TYPE="STUDY">North American 1994</LINK>, so there is the potential for detection bias. It was, however, analysed on an intention-to-treat basis.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Only one randomised controlled trial comparing pergolide with placebo has been performed (<LINK REF="STD-North-American-1994" TYPE="STUDY">North American 1994</LINK>). This was a parallel group double-blind study with a total of 376 patients. It was conducted over a medium term period of 24 weeks, so long-term conclusions about the efficacy of pergolide cannot be drawn from this study.</P>
<P>The mean time patients spent 'off' was reduced by 1.8 hours with pergolide compared with 0.2 hours with placebo (p &lt; 0.001). However, dyskinesia developed or deteriorated in 62% of pergolide-treated compared with 25% placebo-treated patients (Table 1.07). The excess in dyskinesia prevalence and severity had disappeared by the end of the study as levodopa was reduced. The mean reduction in levodopa dose was more in those receiving pergolide than those on placebo (235 mg v 51 mg; p &lt; 0.001).</P>
<P>The authors demonstrated significant improvements with pergolide compared with placebo in Hoehn and Yahr stage and both the motor and activities of daily living parts of a modified Columbia rating scale (Tables 1.01 to 1.05). </P>
<P>Significantly more patients suffered nausea (24% v 13%) and hallucinations (14% v 3%) on pergolide compared with placebo (Tables 1.08 and 1.09). No difference was found in the numbers retained on treatment at the end of the study (pergolide 84% v placebo 82%; Table 1.06). However, withdrawals due to adverse events were greater in those taking pergolide (9.5% v 4.3%).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Only one placebo-controlled study of pergolide in Parkinson's disease has been performed. However, this was well conducted with relatively large numbers of patients for this area of work.</P>
<P>Regarding the long-term motor complications of levodopa therapy, mean 'off' time decreased by 1.8 hours with pergolide but dyskinesia was significantly increased. The excess in dyskinesia with pergolide was effectively treated by reducing the dose of levodopa.</P>
<P>On rating scales of impairment and disability, pergolide produced statistically significant improvements in parkinsonian motor symptoms and activities of daily living scores. No measures of quality of life were assessed in this study, so no information one whether these benefits were translated into reduced handicap is available.</P>
<P>Adverse events such as nausea and hallucinations were more common in pergolide-treated patients and led to more withdrawals. However, these are common side-effects with dopamine agonists and some can be blocked by the peripheral dopamine antagonist domperidone. </P>
<P>Trials comparing pergolide with bromocriptine are the subject of another Cochrane review by the present authors. We are not aware of any studies published or underway to compare pergolide with the newer agonists.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Pergolide can be used as adjunct therapy in later Parkinson's disease to reduce 'off' time, improve parkinsonian symptoms and reduce levodopa dose. However, this is achieved at the expense of increased dopaminergic adverse events such as nausea and hallucinations.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Multiple Publications<BR/>Considerable time and effort was required by the authors and the current staff of Eli Lilly and Company to discover whether the small reports which appeared before the main trial report (<LINK REF="STD-North-American-1994" TYPE="STUDY">North American 1994</LINK>) were included in the latter study. Inclusion of the smaller studies with the larger one in this review may have introduced bias in favour of pergolide (Tramer et al 1997). It is suggested that large multicentre trials are published in full in the future rather than piecemeal.</P>
<P>Incomplete Reporting<BR/>Data on the variance of continuous variables was not available in the original report. The standard deviation or standard error should be given for all means in trial reports. Information on randomisation and concealment of allocation must be increased to allow judgements on whether bias was prevented.</P>
<P>It is suggested that the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) reporting standards are used in the future (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 1996</LINK>). These guidelines have been adopted by several leading general medical and neurology journals. They consist of a checklist of 21 items that include descriptions of the randomization procedure and allocation concealment, the mechanisms of blinding/masking and the number of people lost to follow-up. The adoption of these guidelines would greatly assist in performing systematic reviews and would improve the quality of individual trial reports. </P>
<P>Parkinson's Disease Rating Scales<BR/>Trials in the future should adopted a more standardised battery of tests including the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-UPDRS-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">UPDRS 1987</LINK>), 30 minute epoch 'on'/'off' diary cards, levodopa dose reduction and adverse events. Although UPDRS dyskinesia ratings should be used at present, a better validated dyskinesia scale is required.</P>
<P>Further Trials<BR/>A further Cochrane review will examine trials comparing pergolide with bromocriptine. Other reviews will be performed to define the effects of the newer dopamine agonists compared with placebo and bromocriptine. However, direct comparisons between pergolide and the newer agonists have not been performed. Therefore, clinicians do not have any information on which, if any, of the available agonists is superior. Further large multicentre pragmatic studies are required to answer this question.</P>
