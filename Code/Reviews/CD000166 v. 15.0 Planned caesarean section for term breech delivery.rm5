<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Babies are usually born head first. If the baby is in another position the birth may be complicated. In a &#8216;breech presentation&#8217; the unborn baby is bottom-down instead of head-down. Babies born bottom-first are more likely to be harmed during a normal (vaginal) birth than those born head-first. For instance, the baby might not get enough oxygen during the birth. Having a planned caesarean may reduce these problems. We looked at evidence comparing planned caesarean sections and vaginal births at the normal time of birth.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Although having a caesarean might reduce some risks to babies who are lying bottom-first, the operation itself has other risks for the mother and the baby.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We found 3 studies involving 2396 women. (We included studies up to March 2015.) The quality of the studies and therefore the strength of the evidence was mainly low. In the short term, births with a planned caesarean were safer for babies than vaginal births. Fewer babies died or were seriously hurt when they were born by caesarean. However, children who were born by caesarean had more health problems at age two, though the numbers were too small to be certain. Caesareans caused some short-term problems for mothers such as more abdominal pain. They also had some benefits, such as less urinary incontinence and less perineal pain in one study. The studies did not look at effects on future pregnancies, when having had a previous caesarean may cause complications. The studies only looked at single births (not twins or triplets) and did not study premature babies.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?<BR/>
</B>If your baby is in the breech position, it may be safer to have a planned caesarean section. However, caesareans may not be so good for the mother and may make future births less safe. We also do not yet know the effects of caesarean birth on babies&#8217; health when they are older.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-16 10:46:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Three trials (2396 participants) were included in the review. Caesarean delivery occurred in 550/1227 (45%) of those women allocated to a vaginal delivery protocol and 1060/1169 (91%) of those women allocated to planned caesarean section (average risk ratio (RR) random-effects, 1.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60 to 2.20; three studies, 2396 women, <I>evidence graded low quality</I>). Perinatal or neonatal death (excluding fatal anomalies) or severe neonatal morbidity was reduced with a policy of planned caesarean section in settings with a low national perinatal mortality rate (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.29, one study, 1025 women, <I>evidence graded moderate quality</I>), but not in settings with a high national perinatal mortality rate (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.24, one study, 1053 women, <I>evidence graded low quality</I>). The difference between subgroups was significant (Test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 8.01, df = 1 (P = 0.005), I² = 87.5%). Due to this significant heterogeneity, a random-effects analysis was performed. The average overall effect was not statistically significant (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.44, one study, 2078 infants). Perinatal or neonatal death (excluding fatal anomalies) was reduced with planned caesarean section (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.86, three studies, 2388 women). The proportional reductions were similar for countries with low and high national perinatal mortality rates.</P>
<P>The numbers studied were too small to satisfactorily address reductions in birth trauma and brachial plexus injury with planned caesarean section. Neither of these outcomes reached statistical significance (birth trauma: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.10, one study, 2062 infants (20 events),<I> evidence graded low quality</I>; brachial plexus injury: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.47, three studies, 2375 infants (nine events)).</P>
<P>Planned caesarean section was associated with modestly increased short-term maternal morbidity (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.61, three studies, 2396 women,<I> low quality evidence</I>). At three months after delivery, women allocated to the planned caesarean section group reported less urinary incontinence (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.93, one study, 1595 women); no difference in 'any pain' (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29, one study, 1593 women,<I> low quality evidence</I>); more abdominal pain (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.79, one study, 1593 women); and less perineal pain (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.58, one study, 1593 women).</P>
<P>At two years, there were no differences in the combined outcome 'death or neurodevelopmental delay' (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.30, one study, 920 children,<I> evidence graded low quality</I>); more infants who had been allocated to planned caesarean delivery had medical problems at two years (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.89, one study, 843 children). Maternal outcomes at two years were also similar. In countries with low perinatal mortality rates, the protocol of planned caesarean section was associated with lower healthcare costs, expressed in 2002 Canadian dollars (mean difference -$877.00, 95% CI -894.89 to -859.11, one study, 1027 women).</P>
<P>All of the trials included in this review had design limitations, and the GRADE level of evidence was mostly low. No studies attempted to blind the intervention, and the process of random allocation was suboptimal in two studies. Two of the three trials had serious design limitations, however these studies contributed to fewer outcomes than the large multi-centre trial with lower risk of bias.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-07-16 06:12:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Planned caesarean section compared with planned vaginal birth reduced perinatal or neonatal death as well as the composite outcome death or serious neonatal morbidity, at the expense of somewhat increased maternal morbidity. In a subset with 2-year follow up, infant medical problems were increased following planned caesarean section and no difference in long-term neurodevelopmental delay or the outcome "death or neurodevelopmental delay" was found, though the numbers were too small to exclude the possibility of an important difference in either direction.</P>
<P>The benefits need to be weighed against factors such as the mother's preference for vaginal birth and risks such as future pregnancy complications in the woman's specific healthcare setting. The option of external cephalic version is dealt with in separate reviews. The data from this review cannot be generalised to settings where caesarean section is not readily available, or to methods of breech delivery that differ materially from the clinical delivery protocols used in the trials reviewed. The review will help to inform individualised decision-making regarding breech delivery. Research on strategies to improve the safety of breech delivery and to further investigate the possible association of caesarean section with infant medical problems is needed.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2015-07-16 11:04:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-07-16 06:41:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-04-29 11:10:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Breech presentation occurs in 3% to 5% of all pregnancies at term, accounting for the greatest proportion of non-cephalic presentations. Sixty-five to seventy per cent of breech babies are in the frank breech position, in which the baby's legs are flexed at the hip and extended at the knees (with feet near the ears). Non-frank breech position include complete breech (both the baby's hips and knees are flexed) and footling (presenting one or both feet first, which is more common with premature fetuses than at term). Some babies will spontaneously turn to a cephalic position before birth, and others can be rotated using external cephalic version. However, for those persisting in the breech position, a decision will need to be taken to deliver the baby vaginally or by caesarean section.</P>
<P>Factors which have been associated with breech presentation include: nulliparity; previous breech birth; uterine anomaly; contracted pelvis; use of anticonvulsant drugs; placenta praevia; cornual placenta; decreased or increased amniotic fluid volume; extended fetal legs; multiple pregnancy; prematurity; short umbilical cord; decreased fetal activity; impaired fetal growth; fetal anomaly; and fetal death.</P>
<P>Breech babies tend to be at higher risk of adverse outcomes, with increased neonatal morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Conde_x002d_Agudelo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conde-Agudelo 2000</LINK>), although it is unclear whether this is due to pre-existing vulnerabilities (perhaps also the factors that caused the initial breech presentation), or the effects of delivery in this position. The interpretation of observational studies that compare outcomes after vaginal breech birth and cephalic birth is confounded by the fact that breech presentation per se appears to be a marker for poor perinatal outcome. For example, the incidence of childhood handicap among singleton breech babies, born at term, has been found to be high (19.4%) and similar for those delivered following trial of labour and those following an elective caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Danielian-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Danielian 1996</LINK>). Thus, poor outcomes following vaginal breech birth may be the result of underlying conditions causing breech presentation rather than damage during delivery. However, the care during labour, the delivery methods used, and skill of the birth attendant may also influence outcome.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-07-16 06:41:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is concern that vaginal delivery for babies in the breech position increases the risks of compression of the umbilical cord causing oxygen deprivation and distress, cord prolapse, head entrapment, rapid decompression of the head, spinal cord injuries, and other birth trauma. Delivering a breech baby by caesarean section avoids these potential complications and may result in fewer poor outcomes for infants. However, it carries risks for the mother during delivery, in the postoperative recovery, and in future pregnancies, e.g. repeat caesarean section, risk of ruptured scars, placental invasion of the uterus and hysterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Lawson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawson 2012</LINK>). The routine use of caesarean section for breech presentation became widespread prior to evidence from randomised trials that the benefits of such a policy outweighed the risks. As caesarean section has increased for breech delivery, the skills for vaginal breech delivery have become scarcer, and more birth attendants have become inexperienced at vaginal breech delivery.</P>
<P>In a review of two randomised trials and seven cohort studies, the risk difference between trial of labour and planned caesarean section for any perinatal injury or death was 1.1% (<LINK REF="REF-Gifford-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gifford 1995</LINK>), findings similar to a previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 1993</LINK>). An observational prospective study with an intent-to-treat analysis was conducted in France and Belgium in 174 maternity units where vaginal breech birth is commonly practised (<LINK REF="REF-Goffinet-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goffinet 2006</LINK>). The study included 8105 pregnant women delivering singleton term breech babies. Multivariate analysis was used to control for confounding variables. The composite outcome fetal and neonatal mortality and severe neonatal morbidity was low in both groups. In the planned vaginal delivery group it was 1.60%; (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 2.17). This was not significantly different from that in the planned caesarean delivery group (unadjusted odds ratio = 1.10, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.6; adjusted odds ratio = 1.40, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.23). The authors concluded that "where planned vaginal delivery is a common practice and when strict criteria are met before and during labour, planned vaginal delivery of singleton fetuses in breech presentation at term remains a safe option". A large observational study in Canada found increased perinatal mortality and morbidity following vaginal birth or caesarean section during labour than following carsarean section without labour (<LINK REF="REF-Lyons-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyons 2015</LINK>). However, cohort studies are fundamentally flawed by the fact that factors which influence the choice of method of delivery may have more to do with the outcome for the baby than the method of delivery.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-11-11 12:47:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen M West">
<P>Information from randomised trials is required to determine whether benefits (if any) of routine caesarean section for the infant are sufficient to justify subjecting mothers to the increased current and future risks of caesarean section. Attention should be paid to the selection criteria for allowing a trial of labour and the skill and experience of the clinician at delivery.</P>

<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.

<P>GRADE profiler (<LINK REF="REF-Grade-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grade 2014</LINK>) was used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; tables. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>There were no cluster-randomised trials for consideration in the review update. However, we would include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials as per the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> [Section 16.3.4 and 16.3.6] using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If we used ICCs from other sources, we would report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identified both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We would consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We would also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity or subgroup analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.<BR/>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2010-09-21 11:31:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. We explored the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-04-29 11:12:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau², I² and Chi² statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if an I² was greater than 30% and either the Tau² was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity. If we identified substantial heterogeneity (above 30%), we planned to explore it by pre-specified subgroup analysis.</P>

We would have assessed funnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry was suggested by a visual assessment, we would have performed exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-04-29 11:12:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. Where random-effects analyses have been used, the results are presented as the average treatment effect with its 95% confidence interval, and the estimates of Tau² and I².</P>

</SEARCH_RESULTS>
<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2015-04-29 11:13:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Three trials contributed data to the review. The trials included a total of 2396 women whose babies were in breech presentation. Two trials were conducted in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Collea-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Collea 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gimovsky-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gimovsky 1983</LINK>), and one was a large international multi-centre trial conducted in 121 centres in 26 countries (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2000</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>In all included studies, women were randomly allocated to a policy of elective caesarean section or a protocol allowing vaginal delivery within prescribed limitations (e.g. where there was no evidence of pelvic disproportion). The choice of analgesia and anaesthesia was left for the woman and her care providers in all trials. Assisted breech delivery was performed in <LINK REF="STD-Gimovsky-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gimovsky 1983</LINK>, with a midline episiotomy or episioproctotomy, and elective use of Piper forceps. In <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2000</LINK>, the protocol specified that there should be no intervention until there was spontaneous exit of the infant to the umbilicus and minimum intervention thereafter with no traction on the body, and controlled delivery of the aftercoming head usually either with the use of forceps or the Mauriceau-Emellie-Veit manoeuvre (chosen by the clinician). The vaginal breech delivery methods used were not described in <LINK REF="STD-Collea-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Collea 1980</LINK>. Vaginal breech deliveries were carried out by a resident physician (<LINK REF="STD-Gimovsky-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gimovsky 1983</LINK>), the senior obstetric resident or an assistant resident under supervision (<LINK REF="STD-Collea-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Collea 1980</LINK>), and a clinician who the head of department had confirmed as experienced in vaginal breech delivery (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Intravenous oxytocin was permitted in all three trials when augmentation of labour was deemed necessary. However, the definition of adequate labour progress varied between trials. In <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2000</LINK>, adequate progress in the first stage was "a rate of cervical dilation of at least 0.5 cm per hour after the onset of active labour", and in the second stage was "descent of the breech to the pelvic floor within 2 hours of full dilatation, with delivery being imminent within 1 hour of beginning active pushing". <LINK REF="STD-Collea-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Collea 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gimovsky-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gimovsky 1983</LINK> viewed minimal acceptable active phase progress as 1.2 cm/hour for nulliparous women and 1.5 cm/hour for multiparous women. Oxytocin augmentation was indicated in <LINK REF="STD-Collea-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Collea 1980</LINK> if the active-phase dilatation was protracted according to these criteria or there was a prolonged latent phase of more than 10 hours in primigravidas and more than six hours in multigravidas. The difference in these definitions means that delay would be identified at very different points in labour, introducing different thresholds for interventions such as augmentation with oxytocin, or delivery by caesarean section.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>All studies included women with a singleton fetus in breech presentation. In two studies from the same unit, women with frank (<LINK REF="STD-Collea-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Collea 1980</LINK>) or non-frank (<LINK REF="STD-Gimovsky-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gimovsky 1983</LINK>) breech presentation were included, and <LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2000</LINK> included babies in both the frank or complete breech presentation. In all three studies, women were delivered in hospital. Women were over 37 weeks gestational age (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2000</LINK>) and over 36 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Collea-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Collea 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gimovsky-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gimovsky 1983</LINK>).

Estimated fetal weight for randomisation needed to be 2500 g to 3800 g (<LINK REF="STD-Collea-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Collea 1980</LINK>), 2000 g to 4000 g (<LINK REF="STD-Gimovsky-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gimovsky 1983</LINK>) or less than 4000 g (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2000</LINK>), with no evidence of fetopelvic disproportion, assessed by x-ray pelvimetry (<LINK REF="STD-Collea-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Collea 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gimovsky-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gimovsky 1983</LINK>) or ultrasound (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2000</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-04-29 11:14:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-21 15:21:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The three trials reviewed studied different populations of breech presentation: frank (<LINK REF="STD-Collea-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Collea 1980</LINK>), complete or footling (<LINK REF="STD-Gimovsky-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gimovsky 1983</LINK>), and frank or complete (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2000</LINK>)). In the first two trials x-ray pelvimetry and continuous electronic fetal monitoring in labour were used for all women; in the Term Breech Trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2000</LINK>), these tests were used selectively. However, the estimates of effects are compatible between the trials. Due to the relative sizes of the trials, the findings of this review reflect mainly the findings of the Term Breech Trial.<BR/>
<BR/>The interventions being compared in this review are planned caesarean section versus planned vaginal birth according to a clinical protocol. The comparison is thus not only of the intended method of delivery, but includes possible effects of shorter pregnancies and fewer labours in the planned caesarean section group. This reflects the reality of implementing either policy in practice.</P>
<P>Overall, planned caesarean section compared with planned vaginal birth reduced perinatal or neonatal death or serious neonatal morbidity, at the expense of somewhat increased maternal morbidity soon after birth and three months postnatally. At two years, more infants who had been allocated to planned caesarean delivery had medical problems, however there were no differences in the combined outcome 'death or neurodevelopmental delay' and maternal outcomes were also similar. Of 18 infants in the Term Breech Trial with short-term severe morbidity, one died following surgery for subglottic stenosis thought to be congenital in origin, and the remaining 17 had no evidence of neurodevelopmental delay at age two years. There is thus no evidence of long-term disability following the diagnosis of severe perinatal morbidity in this trial.</P>
<P>To determine whether the reduced mortality/neonatal morbidity in the planned caesarean section group might be specific to certain subgroups of women, the Term Breech Trial authors undertook numerous subgroup analyses. The reduction was greater in countries with low national perinatal mortality rates. The lack of similar reductions in high perinatal mortality rate countries appears anomalous. One possible explanation is that in these countries women are frequently discharged home shortly after vaginal birth. Documentation of neonatal complications following vaginal birth may have been less complete than for babies born by caesarean section, who spend a longer time under observation in hospital.</P>
<P>The subgroup analyses found similar reductions in risk of the main outcome (perinatal or neonatal death [excluding fatal anomalies] or serious neonatal morbidity) with planned caesarean section, compared to planned vaginal birth for all other subgroups defined by the baseline variables.</P>
<P>To determine whether the poorer short-term outcome in the planned vaginal birth group might be due to differences in practice in individual cases, the Term Breech Trial authors also undertook sensitivity analyses after excluding women having a vaginal breech delivery after augmentation or induction of labour with oxytocin or prostaglandins, if:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>labour was prolonged;</LI>
<LI>there was a footling breech or breech of uncertain type at delivery;</LI>
<LI>epidural analgesia was not used; and</LI>
<LI>there was no experienced clinician at the birth. Experienced clinician was defined in three different ways: according to the study protocol, as one who considered him or herself skilled and experienced in vaginal breech delivery, confirmed by the individual's head of department, as a licensed obstetrician, as a clinician with over 10 years of vaginal breech delivery experience and as a clinician with over 20 years of vaginal breech delivery experience.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The main outcome (perinatal or neonatal death (excluding fatal anomalies) or serious neonatal morbidity) remained significantly less frequent in the planned caesarean section group after excluding these cases (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Perinatal or neonatal death (excluding fatal anomalies) was also reduced overall with planned caesarean section compared to planned vaginal birth. This reduction was similar for countries with low and high national perinatal mortality rates.</P>
<P>Short-term maternal morbidity was modestly increased with a policy of planned caesarean section. At three months after the birth, urinary incontinence was reduced by planned caesarean section. Although there was no difference in pain at three months after the birth in the Term Breech Trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2000</LINK>), abdominal pain was more common following planned caesarean section while perineal pain was more common following planned vaginal birth. There were no statistically significant differences between groups for back pain, faecal or flatus incontinence, postnatal depression, maternal dissatisfaction with the experience, breastfeeding, relationship with the baby, relationship with the woman's partner, or dyspareunia. At two years, the only difference found was increased constipation in the planned caesarean section group. The added morbidity related to having a scarred uterus in subsequent pregnancies, and the ability to perform everyday activities were not assessed in these trials (<I>see </I>
<LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a secondary analysis of the data from the Term Breech Trial (not according to group allocation), adverse perinatal outcome was lowest with prelabour caesarean section and increased with caesarean section in early labour, in active labour, and vaginal birth. For women having labour, adverse perinatal outcome was also associated with labour augmentation, birthweight less than 2.8 kg, longer time between pushing and delivery and no experienced clinician at delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Su-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In another secondary multiple regression analysis of Term Breech Trial data (not according to group allocation) (<LINK REF="REF-Su-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2007</LINK>), the authors conclude that the maternal risk of caesarean section may be similar to vaginal birth if the caesarean section is undertaken before labour. In this report, maternal morbidity was more than two-fold higher than vaginal birth in women who had a caesarean section in early labour and more than three-fold higher in women who had a caesarean section in active labour. Intrapartum factors associated with maternal morbidity were the duration of the passive phase of the second stage of labour (P = 0.007), duration of the active phase of the second stage of labour (P = 0.002), and episiotomy (P = 0.02).</P>

<P>As the Term Breech Trial was conducted in a wide range of clinical settings, the results of the Term Breech Trial, and thus this review, may be generalised to a similarly wide range of clinical settings. However, the results of this review cannot be generalised to settings where women labour and birth at home, or where caesarean section is not readily available, or to methods of breech delivery which differ materially from the clinical delivery protocols used in the trials reviewed. Also, as is the case with all randomised controlled trials, uncertainty remains as to whether results may be generalised to those who would not have agreed to randomisation because of strong views as to their preferred method of delivery. The results should also not be generalised to the preterm breech presentation or to twin pregnancies in which the first fetus is presenting cephalic and the second twin is presenting breech.</P>

<P>All of the trials included in this review had design limitations, and the GRADE level of evidence was mostly low. No studies attempted to blind the intervention, and the process of random allocation was suboptimal in two studies. Two of the three trials had serious design limitations, however these studies contributed to fewer outcomes than the large multi-centre trial with lower risk of bias.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-04-29 11:14:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The conclusions of this meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials differ from those of the large observational prospective study of 8105 pregnant women delivering singleton term breech babies, conducted in France and Belgium in 174 maternity units where vaginal breech birth is commonly practised (<LINK REF="REF-Goffinet-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goffinet 2006</LINK>). This trial found no significant difference in fetal and neonatal mortality and severe neonatal morbidity between women intending to delivery vaginally and those planning caesarean delivery, with low adverse outcomes in both groups, in a setting where vaginal breech delivery was regularly and routinely practiced.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-07-16 06:23:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-06-30 11:16:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The reviewed trials indicate that a policy of planned caesarean section compared with planned vaginal birth according to a clinical protocol, for singleton term breech presentation, was associated with a decrease in perinatal or neonatal death and/or neonatal morbidity but no difference in the composite outcome death or neurodevelopmental delay at age two years. The latter finding was limited to a subset for whom long term follow up was possible. The numbers were small and the results do not exclude the possibility of important differences in either direction. As the long-term outcome following perinatal morbidity appeared good, the most relevant outcome is the reduction in perinatal/neonatal death. This was 3/1166 (0.26%) in the planned caesarean section group versus 14/1222 (1.15%) in the planned vaginal birth group. At these rates (accepting that estimates based on small numbers are subject to wide variability), one death would be prevented for every 112 caesarean sections planned and one death would be prevented for every 53 additional caesarean sections performed.</P>
<P>For the mother, planned caesarean section was associated with a modest increase in short-term maternal morbidity, possibly a decrease in urinary incontinence at three months but not two years, and an increase in constipation at two years after the birth. Other outcomes at two years were similar between the two groups. The effects of caesarean section on longer-term outcomes, such as risks related to the scarred uterus, have not yet been addressed.</P>
<P>To reduce the problems associated with breech delivery, an active policy of external cephalic version at term may be considered (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2006</LINK>). Secondly, caesarean breech deliveries may be delayed to allow time for spontaneous version to take place. In the Term Breech Trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2000</LINK>), cephalic birth occurred in 19/1041 of the planned caesarean section group, compared with 39/1042 of the planned vaginal birth group (P &lt; 0.02).</P>
<P>The data from this review should be applied with due consideration to specific healthcare environments and the circumstances of individual women. A policy of planned caesarean section may not be affordable or feasible in resource-poor settings. The long-term risks of caesarean section may be increased for women who may not access health services in subsequent pregnancies.</P>
<P>Individual women should be informed of the risks of vaginal breech delivery, the present and future risks of caesarean section, and our lack of accurate knowledge in the latter field, so that as informed a choice as possible can be made in each case. A very large prospective study in France and Belgium provides reassuring evidence that a high level of safety for planned term vaginal breech birth can be achieved (<LINK REF="REF-Goffinet-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goffinet 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>A policy of planned caesarean section will reduce the overall incidence of cephalic birth and will not totally eliminate problems of vaginal breech birth (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2001</LINK>). In the group allocated to planned caesarean section in the Term Breech Trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hannah-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hannah 2000</LINK>), 100/1041 (9.6%) gave birth vaginally, most because the birth took place before caesarean section could be arranged; 22 (2.1%) experienced difficult deliveries; and six (0.6%) experienced birth trauma.</P>
<P>With a policy of routine caesarean section for breech presentation at term, in time, the clinical skills of vaginal breech delivery will be eroded, placing women who deliver vaginally at increased risk.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-07-16 06:23:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Childbirth is a profound and unique human experience. Little is known about the evolutionary importance of the birth process to women's personal development, emotional wellbeing and adaptation to parenthood, and to subsequent child development, particularly for women who attach importance to giving birth normally. Future trials comparing planned caesarean section with planned vaginal birth should take care to ensure that the protocol for planned vaginal birth is designed to optimise the outcome for both mothers and infants. Further information on long-term benefits and risks of caesarean section for the woman will be useful for clinical decision-making. Research is needed to further investigate the finding of increased infant health problems following caesarean section in this review.</P>
<P>Given that by choice or by default, vaginal breech births will continue to take place, attention should be paid to techniques of vaginal delivery which might improve outcomes for the baby. For example, ready availability of symphysiotomy in the event of difficulty with delivery of the head (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wykes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wykes 2003</LINK>) might reduce adverse outcomes and give reassurance to women keen to give birth vaginally.</P>

<P>Excluded because not a randomised trial. Breech delivery outcomes were compared retrospectively for alternate-day obstetric units. Unit 'B' used a conservative approach towards vaginal breech delivery and performed more caesarean sections (105/277, 38% versus 69/266, 26%). Unit 'A' made more use of x-ray pelvimetry, early rupture of membranes and oxytocin augmentation of labour. There were no statistically significant differences in duration of labour, Apgar scores or neonatal morbidity. There were 2 (0.7%) neonatal deaths in unit 'B' and 7 (2.6%) in unit 'A'.</P>

<P>Baseline characteristics similar. Analysis by intention-to-treat. Study was stopped early because of significant differences in perinatal or neonatal mortality at less than 28 days of age (excluding lethal congenial anomalies). Some protocol violations may have biased the results towards favouring caesarean section (e.g. including the recruitment of babies who may already have been dead, twin pregnancies, not having an experienced clinician at vaginal breech deliveries, and including babies with footling or "uncertain" breech presentation). 58 out of 646 women who had vaginal deliveries violated the protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Lawson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawson 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>In this review the review authors state that "At two years, there were no differences in the combined outcome 'death or neurodevelopmental delay'." I think this means that for all participants in all included studies combined, there were no differences between the two groups in this outcome at two years after birth. However, the authors' conclusions then state: "Planned caesarean section compared with planned vaginal birth reduced perinatal or neonatal death or serious neonatal morbidity" but does not make any mention of the outcome at two years. Isn't the overall outcome at two years of age more important than the immediate perinatal or neonatal outcome? A baby's death at one day of life is no more significant than a baby's death at one year of life. Am I missing something? Does the outcome at two years after birth exclude those who died in the perinatal or neonatal period? I feel that in order to aid decision making, the longer-term outcome is the one that should influence the conclusions of this review, not the short-term outcome.</P>

<P>Thank you for this important feedback. We placed more emphasis on the short-term outcomes because they were available for the whole group, and included a very large reduction in perinatal death. The outcome "Death or neurodevelopmental delay" at 2 years was available for a sub-set of less than 50% of the total sample size, and the numbers were rather small with wide confidence intervals. While this finding was reassuring in that it suggested that in the sub-group who were followed up the perinatal morbidity did not translate to long-term problems, it does not over-ride the benefit of planned CS on the more serious outcome perinatal death. In response to your feedback, we have clarified the conclusions in the abstract and main text.</P>
