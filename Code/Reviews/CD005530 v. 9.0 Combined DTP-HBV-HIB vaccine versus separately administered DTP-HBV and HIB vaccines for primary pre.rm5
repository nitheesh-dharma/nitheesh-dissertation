<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-03-12 11:51:45 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data for the primary outcome (prevention of disease) were lacking. We performed a meta-analysis to pool the results of 20 studies with 5874 participants in an immunogenicity analysis and 5232 participants in the reactogenicity analysis. There were no data on clinical outcomes for the primary outcome (prevention of disease) and all studies used immunogenicity and reactogenicity (adverse events). The number of vaccine doses differed significantly between the studies. Heterogeneous interventions, study location, healthcare environment and combining research across disparate geographical locations, may have lead to bias. The risk of bias was unclear across most of the included studies. Comparisons found little heterogeneity. In two immunological responses the combined vaccine achieved lower responses than the separate vaccines for HIB and tetanus. No significant differences in immunogenicity were found for pertussis, diphtheria, polio and hepatitis B. Serious adverse events were comparable with mainly hospitalisation and acute bronchiolitis cases. Minor adverse events such as pain and redness were more common in children given the combined vaccine. Overall, the direction shown by the results is in favour of the DTPw (diptheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis)-HBV-HIB vaccine rather than the DTPa (diptheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis)-HBV-HIB vaccine when compared to the separate vaccines (size of effect: risk ratio (RR) 1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 2.10, for 5269 participants).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-03-12 11:47:51 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We could not conclude that the immune responses elicited by the combined vaccine were different from or equivalent to the separate vaccines. There was significantly less immunological response for HIB and tetanus and more local reactions in the combined injections. However, these differences rely mostly on one study each. Studies did not use an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and we were uncertain about the risk of bias in many of the studies. These results are therefore inconclusive. Studies addressing clinical end points whenever possible, using correct methodology and a large enough sample size should be conducted.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-02-26 19:54:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the availability of proven vaccination, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and <I>Haemophilus influenzae</I> (<I>H. influenzae</I>) type B (HIB) infections continue to be endemic in many parts of the world. The benefits of effective immunisation against HBV and HIB disease during the first year of life are known and in 1996, the World Health Organization (WHO) set an objective for the development of a vaccine combining HBV with the established diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis (DTPw) antigens (<LINK REF="STD-Ortega_x002d_Barria-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ortega-Barria 2007</LINK>). In 1998, the WHO further recommended the inclusion of HIB conjugate vaccines in infant immunisation programmes (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-03-12 11:51:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Childhood vaccinations provide clinically-effective and cost-effective methods of protecting against many diseases. Combination vaccines have been widespread since the 1940s. Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) is one such vaccine and it is estimated that the DTP infant vaccine coverage exceeds 80% worldwide (<LINK REF="STD-Faingezicht-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Faingezicht 2002</LINK>). There are multiple advantages to combining vaccines, for example, reducing the number of visits and injections, increasing compliance, reducing patient discomfort, optimising prevention and reducing operational costs. This might not be the case in some countries such as the United States (US), where combination vaccines are often more expensive than the separate components.</P>
<P>Assessment of the immune responses to combination vaccines has generally been based on randomised controlled comparative trials. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that clinical trials compare the immune responses elicited by the combination vaccine versus separate injections or other appropriate controls. End points commonly used for evaluating combination vaccines include the percentage of people responding to an antigen with a predefined antibody level and the geometric mean concentration (GMC) or geometric mean titre (GMT) of antibodies elicited by the component (<LINK REF="REF-Ball-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ball 2001</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-02-28 15:03:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>The WHO recommends that routine infant immunisation programmes include a vaccination against HIB in the combined DTP-HBV injection (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). HIB is an important pathogen in both high-income and low-income countries. The DTP-HBV combination vaccine would make an ideal partner for combining with HIB vaccines, because the DTP vaccine is mandatory in most immunisation programmes and the HBV vaccination is already in widespread use (<LINK REF="STD-Santos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Santos 2002</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-02-27 16:48:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The strategy of combining the HBV vaccine with the DTP vaccine has already been adopted into immunisation programmes (<LINK REF="STD-Riedemann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Riedemann 2002</LINK>). The effectiveness and safety of adding a conjugate HIB vaccination to the DTP-HBV vaccine, compared with separate administrations, for preventing these diseases has yet to be systematically assessed. The immunogenicity and reactogenicity (adverse events) results of five published clinical trials involving Tritanrix-HBV/HIB in a variety of immunisation schedules and countries were reviewed for its suitability for use in national immunisation programmes (<LINK REF="STD-Aristegui-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aristegui 2003</LINK>). Despite its use in accordance with the WHO recommendation in several countries, no systematic review of the effectiveness and safety of the combined vaccine is available.</P>

<P>We found no studies that addressed clinical outcomes, i.e. incidence of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and <I>H. influenzae</I> type B (HIB). For some of these diseases, past eradication programmes were effective in almost total eradication of the disease and thus trials addressing clinical outcomes demand an unrealistic sample size and follow-up. However, for some of them, for example, HBV, tetanus and HIB, clinical outcomes could be expected. The lack of such outcomes weakens conclusions that can be drawn from published studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Immunogenicity</HEADING>
<P>The number of vaccine doses differed significantly between the studies. We decided to extract data following the last dose of the vaccines, excluding a booster dose, because the sample size of booster groups differed significantly from the original groups.</P>
<P>In two immunological responses the combined vaccine achieved lower responses than the separate vaccines: anti-PRP (HIB) and anti-T (tetanus). These results changed slightly by the update when we added two studies to the meta-analysis. The direction shown by the results is in favour of the DTPw-HBV-HIB vaccine rather than the DTPa-HBV-HIB vaccine when compared to the separate vaccines (size of effect: RR 1.43; 95% CI 0.98 to 2.10 for 5269 participants). For the other responses, no significant differences could be shown but the number of events (response below the threshold) was so low that the CIs are very large.</P>
<P>We should take note that the anti-PRP comparison was influenced by one study with a large number of events (<LINK REF="STD-Pichichero-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pichichero 1997</LINK>), which used pure (and not conjugated) PRP vaccines (polyribosylribitolphoshate). The anti-T comparison is influenced by one study added in the update with a high number of serological failures (<LINK REF="STD-Marshall-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>We were unable to find data of serious adverse events for some of the included trials, although we did contact trial authors for additional information. We did not find any difference between combined and separate vaccines. However, nine studies with a total of 5232 participants is a relatively small number upon which to base conclusions. A significant increase in pain and redness was observed in the patients given the combination vaccine.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations of the review</HEADING>
<P>The quality of many of the studies included in the analysis is uncertain. The interventions are heterogeneous. While most of the studies were supported by the manufacturers GlaxoSmith\Kline Biologicals, Rixensart (Belgium) and by Aventis Pasteur (Lyon, France), combined vaccines were prepared as investigational formulations and reconstituted with different dilutents. Therefore, the findings may not generalise to all DTP-HBV-HIB vaccines. Though studies included in the meta-analysis had similar vaccination schedules, immunogenicity was measured at different points of vaccination: after the first, second, or third vaccination and in some studies, after the booster vaccination. The meta-analysis included immunogenicity data after the third vaccinations, while the immunogenicity profile might differ after the booster vaccination. The study location, the healthcare environment and combining research across disparate geographical locations, may lead to bias. The studies did not use an ITT analysis (excluding one study included at the update) (<LINK REF="STD-Rao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 2009</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-03-08 00:29:24 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Immunogenicity, defined as antibody concentration responses by serological analysis of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, HBV and HIB reported no significant difference between combined and separate vaccines. However, for anti-PRP (HIB) below the assay cut-off of 1.0 µg/ml, in nine studies of DTPa-HBV-HIB vaccines, we found a significant difference between combined and separate vaccines (RR 2.14; 95% CI 1.48 to 3.10). This cut-off refers to the long-term protection and that, according to many authors, a significant difference on this specific point is not clinically relevant. In six studies of DTPw-HBV-HIB vaccines we did not find a significant difference between combined and separate vaccines (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.58).</P>
<P>We did not find a significant difference (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.04 to 8.95) between DTPa-HBV-HIB and DTPw-HBV-HIB combined and separate vaccines in anti-T (tetanus) immunological response. However, we did find a significant difference (RR 2.22; 95% CI 1.21 to 4.06) between combined and separate DTPa-HBV-HIB vaccines. Most events were due to one study added to the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Reactogenicity (adverse events) defined as incidence of any solicited local and systemic adverse event showed no difference between combined and separate vaccines. However, for pain, we found a significant difference between DTPa-HBV-HIB combined and separate vaccines and DTPw-HBV-HIB combined and separate vaccines (RR 1.09; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.16). We found a significant difference between DTPa-HBV-HIB combined and separate vaccines and DTPw-HBV-HIB combined and separate vaccines (RR 1.09; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.18) for redness.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-02-28 15:04:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of the review was to assess the clinical protection, immunogenicity and reactogenicity (adverse events) of a combined DTP, applied to both DTPw (diptheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis) and DTPa (diptheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis) vaccines, HBV and conjugate HIB vaccines, with or without three types of inactivated polio virus (IPV) or concomitant oral polio vaccine (OPV), in comparison with separate vaccinations of DTP, HBV, conjugate HIB, IPV and OPV, in infants up to two years of age.</P>
<P>We found no studies that addressed clinical outcomes, i.e. incidence of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, HBV and HIB. For some of these diseases, past eradication programmes were effective in almost total eradication of the disease and thus, trials addressing clinical outcomes demand an unrealistic sample size and follow-up. However, for some of them, for example, HBV, tetanus and HIB, clinical outcomes could be expected. The lack of such outcomes weakens conclusions that can be drawn from published studies.</P>
<P>The number of vaccine doses differed significantly between the studies. We decided to extract data following the last dose of the vaccines, excluding a booster dose, because the sample size of booster groups differed significantly from the original groups.</P>
<P>Updating the review we included two more studies and the new data showed significantly less immunological response for HIB and tetanus and more local reactions to the injections with DTPa-HBV-HIB vaccines rather than DTPw-HBV-HIB vaccines.</P>
<P>The quality of many of the studies included in the analysis is uncertain and we could not conclude that the immune responses elicited by the combined vaccine are equivalent to the separate injections. However, the differences rely mostly on one study each; it is not clear whether the results can be generalised to all vaccines. The results of this review should be viewed with caution, mostly as an indication that high quality data are lacking.</P>

<P>Overall, the level of evidence provided by the studies was low and we could not conclude that the immune responses elicited by the combined vaccine are equivalent to the separate vaccines. The data showed significantly less immunological response for HIB and tetanus and more local reactions to the injections. However, the differences rely mostly on one study each. In the case of HIB, the less immunological response is related to a cut-off of 1.0 µg/ml, whose clinical relevance is questionable. It is not clear whether the results can be generalised to all vaccines. The results of this review should be viewed with caution, mostly as an indication that high quality data are lacking.</P>

<P>Studies addressing clinical end points whenever possible, using correct methodology and a large enough sample size (and probably including DTPa components) should be conducted.</P>
