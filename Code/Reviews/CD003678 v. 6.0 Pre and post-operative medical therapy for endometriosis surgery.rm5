<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-11-02 23:08:19 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition affecting approximately 10% of women of reproductive age (<A HREF="Ozkan 2008">Ozkan 2008</A>). Common symptoms are dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain, infertility or a pelvic mass. Diagnosis by laparoscopy or laparotomy enables identification of the location, extent and severity of the disease. Surgery may include removal (excision) or destruction (ablation) of endometriotic tissue, division of adhesions and removal of endometriotic cysts. Laparoscopic excision or ablation of endometriosis has been shown to be effective in the management of pain in mild to moderate endometriosis. Adjunctive medical treatment pre or post-operatively may prolong the symptom-free interval.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-11-02 23:27:01 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-11-02 23:20:33 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition which affects women during their reproductive years. Endometriosis occurs when endometrial tissue, which usually grows in the uterus (normal), is found in other parts of the body, for example the ovaries, fallopian tubes and pelvis. A range of symptoms are evident and women most commonly present with dysmenorrhoea (painful periods), pelvic pain, infertility or a pelvic mass. Endometriosis also responds to hormonal changes associated with the menstrual cycle and cyclical growth of endometriotic implants or cysts is thought to be associated with pelvic pain and the development of adhesions (scar tissue). Estimates of the prevalence of endometriosis amongst women vary but a recent article (<LINK REF="REF-Ozkan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ozkan 2008</LINK>) reported a prevalence of 0.5% to 5% in fertile women and 25% to 40% in a subfertile population, with the peak incidence between 30 and 45 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Guzick-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzick 1989</LINK>). Endometriosis may be asymptomatic (no symptoms) or associated with chronic pelvic pain and subfertility (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The 'gold standard' for the diagnosis of endometriosis is visualisation of endometriosis lesions or cysts during a surgical procedure, either laparoscopy or laparotomy. The extent of the disease can be graded according to a scale developed by the American Fertility Society (<LINK REF="REF-AFS-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">AFS 1985</LINK>), although there is no direct correlation between the severity of the disease and the severity of the symptoms experienced (<LINK REF="REF-Vercellini-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vercellini 1996</LINK>). Concern over the reproducibility of the scoring system resulted in the publication of a new scoring system in 1997 by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (<LINK REF="REF-ASRM-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASRM 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-11-02 23:24:48 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current treatments that are available for endometriosis include both surgery and medical therapy. Surgical therapy can be performed concurrently with diagnostic surgery and may involve the destruction of endometriotic tissue (ablation), division of adhesions (scar tissue) or removal of endometriotic cysts. In advanced endometriosis (AFS stage III or IV), laparoscopic surgery to remove (excise) visible endometrial implants, divide adhesions (scar tissue) or surgically interrupt neural pathways is the treatment of choice (<LINK REF="REF-Muzii-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muzii 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Proctor-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proctor 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rana-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rana 1996</LINK>). This is because large (&gt; 3 cm) lesions respond poorly to medical therapy and hormonal suppression does not influence the extent of the adhesions which are often associated with large lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Medical therapies for systemic hormonal suppression of endometriosis include danazol (a synthetic testosterone hormone derivative), gonadotrophin releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas), progestogens, gestrinone and the oral contraceptive pill. These therapies may be effective for relief of pain associated with endometriosis but they also decrease fertility. Both danazol and GnRHas are associated with side effects related to hyperandrogenism (increased hair growth and a deepening of the voice) and hypoestrogenism (such as hot flushes and vaginitis), respectively, and should only be used for periods of up to six months. Recurrence of endometriosis symptoms and disease is common after the cessation of medical therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Barbieri-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbieri 1990</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-11-02 23:26:21 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Over recent years there has been interest in combining medical and surgical therapy in an attempt to reduce recurrence of endometriosis. The pre-operative use of GnRHas may decrease the extent of endometriosis and the size of endometriomas (ovarian endometriosis) making complete removal of endometriosis easier during laparoscopic surgery and increasing subsequent pregnancy rates (<LINK REF="REF-Hemmings-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemmings 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Donnez-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donnez 1987</LINK>). However possible disadvantages of pre-operative medical therapy, especially with danazol or GnRHas, are the adverse effects associated with these medications (for example hot flushes or vaginal dryness), which may influence women's willingness to use the therapy and result only in a delay of surgery. Post-operative medical therapy appears be an effective treatment of microscopic endometriosis which may not have been evident to the surgeon. It induces suppression of lesions that can not be surgically removed and reduces the risk of recurrence of endometriosis as a result of surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Kettel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kettel 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1992</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-11-02 23:27:01 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the combination of surgery and medical therapy would appear to be beneficial, it is necessary to evaluate the benefits and consider the harms prior to this strategy being recommended. This review aims to evaluate the use of medical therapy before or after, or before and after, surgery for endometriosis.</P>

<LI>Adequate sequence generation: use of a random number table, use of a computerised system, central randomisation by statistical coordinating centre, randomisation by an independent service using minimisation technique, permuted block allocation or Zelan technique were considered adequate. If the paper merely stated 'randomised' or 'randomly allocated' with no further information this was assessed as being unclear.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Allocation concealment: centralised allocation including access by telephone call or fax, or pharmacy controlled randomisation, using sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelopes were considered adequate. Where there was no mention of allocation concealment methods, this domain was assessed as unclear.</LI>
<LI>Blinding: for these treatments, even when blinding of patients and clinicians to treatment allocation was part of the trial protocol, the adverse effects of medical therapies make it difficult for blinding to be maintained. Therefore we have focused on whether the outcome assessment was blinded. Unless the trial was specifically described as double blind, or there was a statement about blinding in the methods section of the paper, it was assumed that blinding of patients, clinical staff and outcome assessors did not occur.</LI>
<LI>Outcome data: outcome data were considered complete if all patients randomised were included in the analysis of the outcome(s).</LI>
<LI>Selective outcome reporting: a trial was assessed as being at low risk of bias due to selective outcome reporting if the outcomes of interest described in the methods section were systematically reported in the results section. Where reported outcomes did not include those outcomes specified or expected in trials of treatments for endometriosis, this domain was assessed as unclear.</LI>
<LI>Other bias: imbalance in potentially important prognostic factors between the treatment groups at baseline, or the use of a co-intervention in only one group (for example analgesics) were examples of potential sources of bias that were noted.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Additional information on trial methodology or original trial data was sought from the principal authors of trials which appeared to meet the eligibility criteria but were unclear in aspects of methodology or outcomes, or where the data were in a form unsuitable for meta-analysis.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2010-11-25 13:41:46 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review used both positive and negative outcome measures. This was taken into account when the meta-analysis was interpreted. For example with regard to the outcome of pain, a positive treatment effect was associated with a reduction in pain scores indicated by a WMD less than zero. However with regard to pregnancy rates, which was a desirable outcome in the treatment of subfertility, a positive treatment effect was associated with an increase in pregnancy rate indicated by a relative risk (RR) greater than one. The data were entered so that in positive outcomes (for example pregnancy) points to the left of the 'line of no effect' favoured the control, and in the negative outcomes (for example pain) points to the left of the 'line of no effect' favoured treatment.</P>
<P>When neither continuous nor dichotomous data suitable for the calculation of mean difference, standardised mean difference or relative risk could be extracted from a trial, any available data were reported descriptively in additional data <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. It is expected that the data for outcomes of pain are skewed rather than normally distributed. Any skew ness was described in the results section.</P>

<P>Two trials compared pre-surgical medical therapy for endometriosis to surgery alone (no medical therapy) (<LINK REF="STD-Donnez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Donnez 1994</LINK>; Shaw 2001).<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Donnez-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Donnez 1994</LINK> included 80 women with infertility who were &lt; 35 years of age with laparoscopically confirmed ovarian endometriotic cysts which were drained and flushed out laparoscopically. The patients were then randomised to receive a subcutaneous goserelin implant four-weekly for 12 weeks or no treatment. Twelve weeks after the first-look laparoscopy, another laparoscopy was performed during which a biopsy was done, endometriosis and the cyst wall vaporised. AFS scoring was done by the same two observers.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-12-01 09:25:25 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>(1) There is insufficient evidence to support the view that medical therapy for hormonal suppression of endometriosis prior to surgery is more effective than surgery alone. Two studies compared pre-surgical medical therapy with surgery alone. AFS scores were significantly improved in the medical treatment group in one study and not in the other. Meta-analysis of the data from these studies was not possible. Medical therapy may or may not be associated with better outcomes for the patients.</P>
<P>(2) Post-surgical hormonal suppression of endometriosis compared to surgery alone (either no medical therapy or placebo) showed some reduction in pain after 12 months but results were inconsistent and pain recurrence in both groups indicated that there was no evidence of a benefit for pain beyond 12 months. There was no evidence of benefit for the outcomes of disease recurrence (AFS scores) or pregnancy (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.18).</P>
<P>(3) There were no trials identified from the search that compared hormonal suppression of endometriosis before and after surgery with surgery alone.</P>
<P>(4) There was no significant difference between pre-surgery hormonal suppression and post-surgery hormonal suppression for the outcome of pain in the one trial identified. This trial reported a statistically significant reduction in recurrence at six months as measured by AFS scores but ease of surgery was reported only as a descriptive summary so any difference between the groups can not be quantified from the information given in the report of this trial.</P>
<P>(5) There was insufficient evidence to support the view that medical therapy for hormonal suppression of endometriosis pre and post-surgery was more effective than medical therapy post-surgery only.</P>
<P>In summary, the use of medical treatment after surgery was not associated with a long-term statistically significant difference in pain from endometriosis. When used prior to surgery, medical therapy was shown to decrease cyst size but the effect on AFS scores was conflicting. There is no evidence that medical therapy pre or post-surgery improves pregnancy rates. No conclusions can be drawn with respect to the outcomes of facilitating surgery, duration of surgery, post-operative complications or levels of satisfaction of women participants from the trials included in this review. Adverse effects were described but not quantified, so no direct comparisons between the included trials were possible.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-11-03 01:05:29 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A strength of this review is that all of the included studies involved women with laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis and laparoscopic assessment of the extent of the endometriosis. Weaknesses of this review are that the included studies were small and many were at risk of bias. There was a spread of different times at which a range of different outcomes were measured, which does not allow for studies to be combined in a meta-analysis. Only one study used a quality of life measure as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Sesti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sesti 2007</LINK>) although this may well be the outcome of most interest to women with endometriosis.</P>
<P>There were some methodological issues in the trials included in this review. Of the 16 reports of randomised controlled trials, 11 described the randomisation process used but only four reported adequate allocation concealment. Four of the 16 studies were double blinded and in two studies the outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention status. The side effects associated with medical therapies for endometriosis are such that maintaining blinding of participants and investigators is likely to have been difficult in these trials.</P>

<P>There is no evidence from the studies identified to conclude that hormonal suppression in association with surgery for endometriosis is associated with a significant benefit with regard to any of the outcomes identified. From two studies of pre-surgical medical therapy there is no evidence that pre-surgical medical therapy is better than surgery alone. There was no evidence that post-surgical medical therapy was associated with a benefit compared to surgery alone.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-11-03 01:07:06 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Research done to assess the effects of medical treatment pre or post-surgery for endometriosis is associated with many difficulties. Not many women will consent to undergo second-look laparoscopy to assess the results of previous treatment modalities. Hence, recruiting large numbers of participants for randomised trials is difficult. Maintaining blinding is also difficult due to the adverse effects associated with hormonal suppression, which would be obvious to both the patient and investigator. Blinded outcome assessment is possible and desirable. Women with subfertility due to endometriosis may also not accept treatment that may improve pain and other symptoms but reduces or delays their chance of conceiving.</P>
<P>Despite these difficulties, it would be valuable to have well designed, adequately powered and well conducted trials to determine if there is a significant benefit in adjunctive medical therapy before or after surgery for endometriosis. Consistency in the methods of assessing outcomes, with respect to pain and the extent of endometriosis from AFS scores, would also facilitate meta-analysis of data across trials. Data to quantify the number and degree of adverse events experienced as a result of medical therapy would enable better assessment of the comparative benefits and harms of medical treatment.<BR/>
