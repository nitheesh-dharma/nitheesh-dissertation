<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Ways to support older people deciding whether to enter long-term residential care</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The decision to enter long-term care is a major life event for older people. It is usually made at a time of crisis and vulnerability, and there is often pressure to make the decision quickly. How the decision is made may affect older people's adjustment to residential care and quality of life, along with those of their carers or family. There are a number of ways that health professionals provide support to older people making this decision. These include a thorough assessment of their needs, provision of adequate information, counselling, providing choices, and the facilitation and timing of the decision-making process.</P>
<P>The review authors could not find any studies that adequately assessed these interventions. This means that there needs to be more studies, not necessarily that the interventions are not helpful. </P>
<P>Older people who were not able to make decisions due to medical conditions were excluded from the review.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The decision to enter long-term care is often a major life event for older people, made in the context of personal crisis and loss. We hypothesised that the process through which a decision to enter long-term residential care emerges affects the overall psycho-social adjustment to, and acceptance of, this decision, and may have an impact on a range of other outcomes for older persons and their carers, such as health status. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of various decision-support interventions delivered by health or social care providers on the outcomes of older people facing the possibility of entering long-term residential care. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library, </I>Issue 1 2005); MEDLINE (Ovid) (1966 to November week 3 2004); PsycINFO (Ovid) (1872 to February week 4 2005); and other databases. There were no language restrictions. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials/quasi-experimental trials, controlled before and after studies, controlled prospective studies and interrupted time series studies of assessment, information provision, counselling, decision-making facilitation, provision of choice, timing of the process, other communication strategies and any other intervention deemed relevant in supporting decision making for older people facing the possibility of long-term residential care. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>As there were no studies that met the inclusion criteria no data collection or analysis was conducted. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>No studies met the review's inclusion criteria. Although the searches identified a number of studies, they were predominantly opinion pieces or qualitative in nature. While these studies are a potential source of evidence about current practice or people's views, they were not suitable for drawing conclusions about the effects of interventions to support decision-making. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>No eligible studies were identified to inform the use of interventions to support the decision-making process for older people facing the possibility of long-term residential care. This should not be interpreted as demonstrating that these interventions are not effective. The many related studies we identified which did not meet the study design criterion for this review indicate that there is substantial research interest in this topic. It would be useful to summarise the information available in the wider literature using newly-developing methods for synthesising qualitative studies. This could help identify interventions which warrant further research. Rigorously conducted randomised controlled trials of these interventions could then make a valuable contribution to the range of evidence surrounding this significant event in the lives of many older people, informing practice and policy development. </P>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>The decision to enter long-term care is often a major life event for older people, made in the context of personal crisis and loss, and is also a significant event for families and carers (<LINK REF="REF-Cheek-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheek 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gold-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gold 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hagen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penn-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penn 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodgers-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodgers 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2003</LINK>). The importance of addressing psychosocial issues during the decision-making and entry process has been identified in a number of qualitative studies and by a number of commentators (<LINK REF="REF-Atkinson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkinson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheek-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheek 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jordan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kellet-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellet 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penn-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penn 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodgers-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodgers 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tilse-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tilse 2000</LINK>). It has been hypothesised that the process through which a decision to enter a long-term residential care setting emerges affects the overall psycho-social adjustment to, and acceptance of, this decision, and may have an impact on a range of other outcomes for older persons and their carers, such as health status. </P>
<P>Health professionals use a number of interventions, discussed below, to support people through the decision-making process. These interventions are provided within the context of the social and cultural background of stakeholders (the person, family, carers, service providers and the health team), resource availability, practice guidelines, legal duty of care, agency policies (for example, in relation to choice of facility), and ethical codes.</P>
<P>Promoting consumer involvement in decision making is key to health professionals' ethical commitment to patient autonomy and self-determination, and is particularly important for social workers who often facilitate this process (<LINK REF="REF-AASW-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">AASW 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IFSW-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">IFSW 1999</LINK>). Gibson (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 1998</LINK>) argues strongly that enhancing personal power, choice and control reduces some of the negative aspects of dependency for older people. Many commentators recognise the vulnerability of frail older persons (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2003</LINK>), and, as a consequence, argue the importance of interventions that seek to empower older persons and their carers. One aspect of empowerment is the provision of full information. The wide range of information that needs to be provided and digested by older people, families or carers illustrates the complexity of the context of this decision, and the importance of information provision and education. Types of information considered important in the literature include the outcomes of assessments (health and functional status, care needs), care options, rights, appropriate facilities, what to consider when selecting a facility, and the legal and financial implications of entering a long-term residential care facility (<LINK REF="REF-Cheek-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheek 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farrier-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodgers-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodgers 1997</LINK>). Forms of education or information provision may be oral, written, group, or audio-visual. Rodgers' findings also suggest the importance of enabling the older person to visit the prospective facility prior to placement (<LINK REF="REF-Rodgers-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodgers 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been argued that a thorough multi-disciplinary assessment should be the requisite starting point for any decision regarding long-term care (<LINK REF="REF-AASW-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">AASW 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farrier-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penn-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penn 1985</LINK>). This position has been incorporated into processes that govern entry into long-term residential care in many countries (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2002</LINK>). The need for counselling and psycho-social support for both older people facing the prospect of long-term residential care and their carers is strongly supported within the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Atkinson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkinson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheek-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheek 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kellet-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellet 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penn-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penn 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodgers-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodgers 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siddell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siddell 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tilse-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tilse 2000</LINK>), and is reportedly valued by consumers (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siddell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siddell 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Health professionals draw on a range of skills and knowledge to facilitate the decision-making process, often in the context of differing views amongst stakeholders (<LINK REF="REF-AASW-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">AASW 2002</LINK>). Family conferencing (facilitated family meetings), with or without the older person included, is common practice at the point of entry to long-term care, and may be the context for many of the above interventions (for example, counselling, information provision, education and facilitation of decision making). Eliciting the views of those affected by the decision to enter residential care is argued as being central to the assessment process, and underpins many of the advocacy and empowerment interventions developed by healthcare professionals, in particular, social workers. The literature also suggests that time pressure significantly affects how the placement process is experienced by older people and their carers (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reinardy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Reinardy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodgers-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodgers 1997</LINK>). This review was, therefore, concerned with interventions that take timing into account, for example, staging information provision and facilitating the decision-making process over time. Outcomes could also be influenced by a number of participant characteristics such as gender. We wondered if gender would impact on the effects of the various interventions, and this dimension was therefore included in the planned sub-group analysis. We were also interested in whether having a choice of facilities had an impact on outcomes.</P>
<P>Wilson, Setterlund and Tilse (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2003</LINK>) observe that the disjunction between the placement process and ongoing care means social workers and other health professionals involved in the former do not directly observe the outcomes of their intervention in the latter; for example, acceptance of or satisfaction with the decision, adjustment to life in the facility, and psychological health. While outcomes are inherently difficult to measure in populations characterised by chronic and progressive health problems (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 1998</LINK>), we identified a number of areas of interest (<LINK REF="REF-Farrier-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hagen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leiberman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leiberman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reinardy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Reinardy 1995</LINK>). The most important outcomes were considered to be quality of life, participation in the decision-making process and psycho-social adjustment. </P>
<P>This review sought to inform the development of best practice for health professionals involved with facilitating the entry of older people into long-term residential care. In particular, we wanted to identify which interventions, or cluster of interventions, are associated with the achievement of positive outcomes in relation to the transition process and the subsequent adjustment of older persons and their families/carers. While the focus of this review is on outcomes for people entering residential aged care, we also planned to evaluate the interventions in relation to their impact on all older people facing the possibility of residential aged care. The review was also interested in identifying the costs of service provision (for example, written information provision) in comparison with routine care, where this information was available. We anticipated that the findings of this review would be relevant to front-line healthcare professionals, service managers and those involved with the development of health and residential care policy.</P>
<P>A significant proportion of older people facing the possibility of residential aged care have dementia or other conditions that affect cognitive functioning, such as depression, psychosis, and brain injury. While many people with these problems are able to express a view and can participate in the decision-making process, they may have reduced decision-making capacity. As this review focuses on decision-making issues, we excluded older people with established decision-making incapacity. However, we recommend that a separate review examines the different decision-making processes for this group of people.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the effects of various decision-support interventions by health or social care providers during the entry process, with those of the routine process of entry into long-term residential care. </P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>All older people facing the possibility of residential aged care, and their families or carers. We defined 'older people' as those over the age of<I> </I>60<I> </I>years. While our primary focus was the older population, studies in which at least 85% of participants were aged 60 years or older, or which included people who enter long-term care due to a health issue usually associated with ageing, were considered eligible. We excluded older people facing the possibility of residential aged care that was intended to be temporary, and older people with established decision-making incapacity.<BR/>
<BR/>'Long-term residential care' is defined as a form of residential care intended to provide older people with non-acute and non-rehabilitative care. These care settings might variously be termed hostels, nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, and adult homes. Aged care environments that do not routinely provide home support services, for example independent unit living within retirement villages, were excluded. </P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review identified no studies assessing the effects of interventions to support the decision-making process for older people facing the possibility of long-term residential care. Given the relative frequency and significance of this event amongst the population of older people, and its dominance in the role of social workers with older people, this is a disappointing review outcome. </P>
<P>While a range of healthcare professionals are involved in facilitating the move to residential aged care, this role is often undertaken by social workers. Although social workers have a strong history and association with evidence based practice (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbons-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbons 2001</LINK>), the lack of eligible studies may reflect the profession's diffident relationship with evidence based on so-called 'gold standard' quantitative randomised and controlled studies. <LINK REF="REF-Gibbons-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbons 2001</LINK> suggests disengaging from the qualitative versus quantitative debate and embracing the range of rigorous research methodologies that can contribute to building an evidence base for practice in social work. </P>
<P>The lack of relevant studies may also reflect the perception that moving to residential care is a routine and inevitable outcome for older people who have care needs. While the context of limited alternative care options invites this response (as reflected in the title of one article, <I>'...well, I got no option' </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Jordan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 1998</LINK>)), the level of care needed is a continuum and the point at which residential care is utilised differs markedly amongst older people, reflecting that there is certainly a role for individual decision-making. The lack of relevant research may also reflect a perception that older people are passive players in this significant life event, rather than active protagonists capable of actively making decisions about how or whether they have their perceived care needs met, and entitled to this involvement (<LINK REF="REF-Jordan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The number of studies on this topic that did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review demonstrates the level of interest in this area of practice, writing and research. This is important, given the increasing trend in the use of long-term residential care. This review highlights the need for well-designed studies to evaluate interventions that could support older people in this decision-making process. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No eligible studies were identified to inform the use of interventions to support the decision-making process for older people facing the possibility of long-term residential care. This should not be interpreted as demonstrating that the relevant interventions are not effective. <I>
<BR/>
</I>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The many studies we identified which did not meet the study design criterion for this review demonstrate the level of research interest in this topic. It would be useful to access the information available in the wider literature using methods for synthesising qualitative studies. This could help identify interventions which warrant further evaluation. Rigorously conducted randomised controlled trials would then make a valuable contribution to the range of evidence surrounding this significant event in the lives of many older people, informing practice and policy development. </P>

<P>Information on planned methods of analysis is retained here, for application in future updates of this review.</P>
<P>For continuous data, if outcomes were measured in a standard way across studies, or if there was only one study for a particular outcome, weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) would have been reported. If studies used different instruments to measure the same conceptual phenomenon (eg. patient satisfaction with information provided) the standardised mean difference (SMD) would have been reported. In such cases, a cautious approach would have been taken to combining results, and the rationale would have been detailed. In studies that reported dichotomous data, relative risk with 95% CI would have been calculated and reported, with risk difference reported if appropriate. Risk ratios from studies with comparable dichotomous outcomes would have been combined using the Mantel-Haenszel method if a fixed effect method was appropriate, or the Dersimonian &amp; Laird method for a random effects model.</P>
<P>Statistical heterogeneity would have been considered and tested via visual inspection of graphs and the chi-squared test. A significance level of less than 0.01 would have been interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity. If appropriate, we would also have performed the I2 test and would have considered a value greater than 50% to represent substantial heterogeneity (Alderson 2003). Reasons for statistical heterogeneity would have been explored by sub-group analyses where the data allowed. This would have been discussed in the results section of the review. Even in the absence of statistical heterogeneity, the robustness of any summary measures would have been explored, particularly with respect to study quality.</P>
