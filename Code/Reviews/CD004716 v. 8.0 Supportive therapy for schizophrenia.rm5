<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-02-05 12:47:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness with &#8216;positive symptoms&#8217; such as hallucinations (hearing voices and seeing things) and delusions (having strange beliefs). People with schizophrenia also suffer from disorganisation and &#8216;negative symptoms&#8217; (such as tiredness, apathy and loss of emotion). People with schizophrenia may find it hard to socialise and find employment. Schizophrenia is considered one of the most burdensome illnesses in the world. For some people it can be a lifelong condition. Most people with schizophrenia will be given antipsychotic medications to help relieve the symptoms. In addition to this they can also receive therapy, of which there are various types.<BR/>
<BR/>One therapy often given to people with schizophrenia is supportive therapy, where typically after a person is established in the care of mental health services, they will receive general support rather than specific talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). For example, in consultations with health professionals there will often be time given to listening to people&#8217;s concerns, providing encouragement, or even arranging basic help with daily living. Many people with schizophrenia also receive support from their family and friends. Supportive therapy has been described as the treatment of choice for most people with mental illness and may be one of the most commonly practiced therapies in mental health services.</P>
<P>It is, however, difficult to answer the question of exactly what supportive therapy is. It is difficult to find a widely accepted definition of supportive therapy. For the purposes of this review, supportive therapy includes any intervention from a single person aimed at maintaining a person&#8217;s existing situation or assisting in people&#8217;s coping abilities. This includes interventions that require a trained therapist, such as supportive psychotherapy, as well as other interventions that require no training, such as 'befriending'. Supportive therapy does not include interventions that seek to educate, train or change a person&#8217;s way of coping.</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of supportive therapy compared to other specific therapies or treatment as usual. This update is based on a search run in 2012; the review now includes 24 randomised studies with a total of 2126 people. The studies compared supportive therapy either with standard care alone or a range of other therapies such as CBT, family therapy and psychoeducation. The participants continued to receive their antipsychotic medication and any other treatment they would normally receive during the trials. Overall, the quality of evidence from these studies was very low. There is not enough information or data to identify any real therapeutic difference between supportive therapy and standard care. There are several outcomes, including hospitalisation, satisfaction with treatment and general mental state, indicating advantages for other psychological therapies over supportive therapy. However, these findings are limited because they are based on only a few small studies where the quality of evidence is very low. There was very limited information to compare supportive therapy with family therapy and psychoeducation as most studies in this review focused on other psychological therapies, such as CBT. Apart from one study presenting data on death, there was no information on the adverse effects of supportive therapy. In summary, there does not seem to be much difference between supportive therapy, standard care and other therapies. Future research would benefit from larger studies where supportive therapy is the main treatment.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-01-22 15:47:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials (November 2012).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised trials involving people with schizophrenia and comparing supportive therapy with any other treatment or standard care.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-02-05 12:47:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We reliably selected studies, quality rated these and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we estimated the risk ratio (RR) using a fixed-effect model with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where possible, we undertook intention-to-treat analyses. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) fixed-effect with 95% CIs. We estimated heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> technique) and publication bias. We used GRADE to rate quality of evidence.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-02-05 12:47:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four new trials were added after the 2012 search. The review now includes 24 relevant studies, with 2126 participants. Overall, the evidence was <I>very low quality</I>.</P>
<P>We found no significant differences in the primary outcomes of relapse, hospitalisation and general functioning between supportive therapy and standard care.</P>
<P>There were, however, significant differences favouring other psychological or psychosocial treatments over supportive therapy. These included hospitalisation rates (4 RCTs, n = 306, RR 1.82 CI 1.11 to 2.99, <I>very low quality of evidence</I>), clinical improvement in mental state (3 RCTs, n = 194, RR 1.27 CI 1.04 to 1.54, <I>very low quality of evidence</I>) and satisfaction of treatment for the recipient of care (1 RCT, n = 45, RR 3.19 CI 1.01 to 10.7, <I>very low quality of evidence</I>). For this comparison, we found no evidence of significant differences for rate of relapse, leaving the study early and quality of life.</P>
<P>When we compared supportive therapy to cognitive behavioural therapy CBT), we again found no significant differences in primary outcomes. There were very limited data to compare supportive therapy with family therapy and psychoeducation, and no studies provided data regarding clinically important change in general functioning, one of our primary outcomes of interest.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-02-05 12:47:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-02-05 12:47:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One of the common features of psychotherapies and professional interventions for people with schizophrenia is to provide support. For example, in an out-patient consultation there will often be time allocated to listening to patients' concerns, giving encouragement, or even arranging basic help with day to day living, such as access to local resources. The key elements of support are to maintain an existing situation, or assist pre-existing coping abilities. Supportive therapy has been described as the treatment model of choice for most patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hellerstein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellerstein 1994</LINK>), and may be the most commonly practiced intervention in the mental health service.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-02-05 12:47:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is, however, difficult to answer the question of exactly what is supportive therapy? A starting point is to look at the literature on supportive psychotherapy, which has been defined as "a dyadic treatment characterised by the use of direct measures to ameliorate symptoms and to maintain, restore or improve self esteem, adaptive skills and ego function" (<LINK REF="REF-Pinsker-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinsker 1991</LINK>). There may also be a difference in the practice of supportive therapy according to country (<LINK REF="REF-Holmes-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 1995</LINK>). In the UK, supportive therapy implies a frequency of less than once a week, whereas in America, some practitioners would regard any psychodynamic intervention at a frequency of less than four or five times a week as supportive psychotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Werman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Werman 1994</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-10-08 07:02:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Even though there is no internationally agreed definition, one of the key features is that supportive therapy aims to enhance, rather than challenge, current psychological defence mechanisms. An alternative view is to identify supportive therapy according to the components of the therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Misch-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Misch 2000</LINK>). For example, one expert proposes seven distinct components; reassurance, explanation, guidance, suggestion, encouragement, affecting change in the environment, and permission for catharsis (<LINK REF="REF-Bloch-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloch 1996</LINK>). Bloch also argues that supportive therapy must be a long-term intervention. The difficulty of this proposal is that there is no clear reason why a specific component of therapy should be regarded as supportive. Possible solutions include defining supportive therapy according to outcome, according to the perception of the client or by identifying a feature of therapy that is inherently supportive, regardless of its impact on a client (<LINK REF="REF-Barber-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barber 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are many other forms of support that can be given which are distinct from the psychodynamic tradition. For example, there are mental health workers who have the job title of support worker whose role is often to provide practical support such as reminders and transport for other services, or to spend time befriending a client.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-02-05 12:47:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ultimately, the lack of a widely accepted definition of supportive therapy means we are not able to avoid an arbitrary element in the definition used for this review. Our definition (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>) is influenced by the potential usefulness of this review, which could be:</P>
<OL>
<LI>to give information on the effectiveness of a therapy that is commonly used as the control arm of clinical trials for psychotherapies in schizophrenia;</LI>
<LI>to help clinicians with the decision of whether to offer a supportive intervention;</LI>
<LI>to help clinicians understand the value of supportive elements of their individual interactions with people who have schizophrenia.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Supportive therapy and supportive care</HEADING>
<P>We have used the phrase 'supportive therapy and supportive care' here to indicate that this review covers a wider variety of interventions than supportive psychotherapy alone. However, for the sake of simplicity, we used the term 'supportive therapy' elsewhere in this review. These interventions are provided by a single person with the main purpose of maintaining current functioning or assisting pre-existing coping abilities in people who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illness. The therapies can be aimed at individuals or groups of people. If the content of the therapy was not sufficiently clear after reading a clinical study, then we included any therapy that had supportive or support in its title. We have included advocacy as a form of supportive therapy. Advocacy is a narrower intervention than other interventions included in the review, but it nevertheless fits our definition as it assists people with their communication and interaction with mental health workers.</P>
<P>A number of common therapies are excluded as they are designed to teach new skills or change pre-existing skills. These include cognitive behavioural therapy<B> (</B>CBT<B>) </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Cormac-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cormac 2004</LINK>), social skills training, psycho-education (<LINK REF="REF-Pekkala2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pekkala2002</LINK>), compliance therapy (<LINK REF="REF-McIntosh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntosh 2006</LINK>) and problem-solving therapy.</P>
<P>Some therapies or schemes have been excluded as they involve a team approach rather than an individual worker, or because they are designed to alter a person's environment, rather than to help the person cope with their environment. These include family placement (<LINK REF="REF-Pharoah-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pharoah 2006</LINK>), supported employment and supported accommodation (<LINK REF="REF-Chilvers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chilvers 2006</LINK>) . An exception was to include an intervention if it was clear that it consisted of a practitioner whose main purpose was to help a client cope with their current situation, rather than alter the situation to make it easier for the client.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>We have also excluded counselling (unlike the meta-analysis from the National Institute of Clinical Excellence on supportive therapy (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2003</LINK>)). The main purpose of counselling is to give an opportunity for a client to explore, discover and clarify ways of living (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 2001</LINK>). Counselling employs a wide variety of techniques, and the purpose may be to facilitate a change in someone's life rather than to maintain the current situation. As counselling has such a broad scope, an exception was to include a clinical trial if there was a clear indication that the main purpose of counselling was to provide support rather than facilitate change or give an opportunity to explore personal issues.</P>

<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if:<BR/>a. the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and<BR/>b. the measuring instrument has not been written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial.</P>
<P>Ideally, the measuring instrument should either be i. a self-report or ii. completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). We realise that this is not often reported clearly; if relevant we noted whether or not this is the case in <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided primarily to use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. Had we had both change and endpoint data, we would have combined them in the analysis as we used mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences (SMD) throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Chapter 9.4.5.2).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion:</P>
<UL>
<LI>standard deviations (SDs) and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors;</LI>
<LI>when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the SD, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>));</LI>
<LI>if a scale started from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), which can have values from 30 to 210), we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2 SD &gt; (S-S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. We entered skewed endpoint data from studies of fewer than 200 participants as other data within the data and analyses section rather than into a statistical analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at mean if the sample size is large; we entered such endpoint data into syntheses.</P>
<P>When continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not, we entered skewed change data into analyses regardless of size of study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we made efforts to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes, we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). The Number Needed to Treat/Harm (NNT/H) statistic with its confidence intervals is intuitively attractive to clinicians but is problematic both in its accurate calculation in meta-analyses and interpretation (<LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2009</LINK>). For binary data presented in the 'Summary of findings' tables, where possible, we calculated illustrative comparative risks.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups. We would prefer not to calculate effect size measures (standardised mean difference (SMD)). However, if scales of very considerable similarity had been used, we would have presumed there was a small difference in measurement, and we would have calculated effect size and transformed the effect back to the units of one or more of the specific instruments.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2015-02-05 12:47:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>We did not include any cluster-randomised trials in this version of the review. If we had found trials where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review, if we include cluster-randomised trials, we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If we had included trials where clustering had been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we would have presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the ICC [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC is not reported it will be assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies have been appropriately analysed taking into account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would be possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason, cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, had we included such trials, we planned to use only the data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>Where a study involves more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we presented the additional treatment arms in comparisons. If data were binary, we simply added these and combined within the two-by-two table. If data were continuous, we combined data following the formula in section 7.7.3.8 (Combining groups) of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, we did not reproduce these data.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Overall loss of credibility</HEADING>
<P>At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). We chose that, for any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for, we would not reproduce these data or use them within analyses. If, however, more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we addressed this within the 'Summary of findings' tables by down-rating quality. Finally, we also downgraded quality within the 'Summary of findings' tables where loss was 25% to 50% in total.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Binary</HEADING>
<P>In the case where attrition for a binary outcome was between 0% and 50% and where these data were not clearly described, we presented data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis (an intention-to-treat analysis). Those leaving the study early were all assumed to have the same rates of negative outcome as those who completed, with the exception of the outcome of death and adverse effects. For these outcomes, the rate of those who stayed in the study - in that particular arm of the trial - were used for those who did not. We undertook a sensitivity analysis to test how prone the primary outcomes were to change when 'completer' data only were compared to the intention-to-treat analysis using the above assumptions.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>If standard deviations (SDs) were not reported, we first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there are missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error (SE) and confidence intervals available for group means, and either a P value or T value available for differences in mean, we can calculate them according to the rules described in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): When only the SE is reported, SDs are calculated by the formula SD = SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, T or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae do not apply, we can calculate the SDs according to a validated imputation method, which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Last observation carried forward</HEADING>
<P>We anticipated that in some studies the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) would be employed within the study report. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2007</LINK>). Therefore, where LOCF data have been used in the trial, if less than 50% of the data have been assumed, we reproduced these data and indicated that they are the product of LOCF assumptions.</P>

<P>We investigated heterogeneity between studies by considering the I<SUP>2 </SUP>method alongside the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> P value.

The importance of the observed value of I<SUP>2 </SUP>depends on i. magnitude and direction of effects and ii. strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P value from Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test, or a confidence interval for I<SUP>2</SUP>). An I<SUP>2 </SUP>estimate greater than or equal to around 50% accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was interpreted as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). When substantial levels of heterogeneity were found in the primary outcome, we explored reasons for heterogeneity (<LINK TAG="SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</LINK>). Where the I<SUP>2</SUP> estimate was equal to or greater than 75%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). We did not summate data if inconsistency was high, but presented the data separately and investigated reasons for heterogeneity. If data were heterogeneous we used a random-effects model.</P>

<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). These are described in Section 10 of the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects. We did not use funnel plots for outcomes where there were 10 or fewer studies, or where all studies were of similar sizes. In other cases, where funnel plots are possible, we sought statistical advice in their interpretation.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-02-05 12:47:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model: it puts added weight onto small studies which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We chose the fixed-effect model for all analyses. The reader is, however, able to choose to inspect the data using the random-effects model.</P>

<P>We aimed to include trials in a sensitivity analysis if they were described in some way so as to imply randomisation. For the primary outcomes, we included these studies and if there was no substantive difference when the implied randomised studies were added to those with better description of randomisation, then we entered all data from these studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Assumptions for lost binary data</HEADING>
<P>Where assumptions had to be made regarding people lost to follow-up (see <LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK>), we compared the findings of the primary outcomes when we used our assumption/s and when we used data only from people who completed the study to that point. If there was a substantial difference, we reported results and discussed them, but continued to employ our assumption.</P>
<P>Where assumptions had to be made regarding missing SDs data (see <LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK>), we compared the findings of the primary outcomes when we used our assumption/s and when we used data only from people who completed the study to that point. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to test how prone results were to change when completer-only data only were compared to the imputed data using the above assumption. If there was a substantial difference, we reported results and discussed them, but continued to employ our assumption</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We analysed the effects of excluding trials that were judged to be at high risk of bias across one or more of the domains of randomisation (implied as randomised with no further details available): allocation concealment, blinding and outcome reporting for the meta-analysis of the primary outcome. If the exclusion of trials at high risk of bias did not substantially alter the direction of effect or the precision of the effect estimates, then we included data from these trials in the analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Imputed values</HEADING>
<P>We planned to undertake a sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of including data from trials if we had used imputed values for ICC in calculating the design effect in cluster-randomised trials, however, no cluster-randomised trials were included in this version of the review.</P>
<P>If we noted substantial differences in the direction or precision of effect estimates in any of the sensitivity analyses listed above, we did not pool data from the excluded trials with the other trials contributing to the outcome, but presented them separately.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Method</HEADING>
<P>Due to the nature of the interventions, none of the 24 included studies were able to use a double-blind technique. Some (11/24), however, endeavoured to reduce bias by having some or all outcomes rated by people blind to allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Durham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Durham 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eckman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Eckman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haddock-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Haddock 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kemp-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kemp 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levine-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sensky-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Sensky 2000b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spaulding-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Spaulding 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stanton-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stanton 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tarrier-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tarrier 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turkington-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Turkington 2000</LINK>).

<P>Nineteen included studies had less than 100 participants; the range of the number of participants was 12 to 315. A total of 2126 people participated in the 24 trials, most of whom had a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Ten studies included only people with schizophrenia, however two of these (<LINK REF="STD-Coyle-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Coyle 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Malm 1982</LINK>) did not describe criteria clearly.

Of these, one study also included people with bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1999</LINK>) and one included severely disturbed psychiatric patients (<LINK REF="STD-Dincin-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Dincin 1982</LINK>). Twenty-three studies employed operational criteria for diagnoses (DSM-II, DSM-III, DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, ICD-10, RDC, WHO Discrimination Criteria), however, one of these trials <LINK REF="STD-Coyle-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Coyle 1988</LINK> did not report how the diagnoses were reached. <LINK REF="STD-Malm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Malm 1982</LINK> described the diagnostic criteria used, but these were not recognised operational criteria.

<P>i. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1987</LINK>)<BR/>This scale assesses the severity of psychotic symptomatology in general. It consists of three subscales, positive symptoms, negative symptoms and general psychopathology, and a total score. This scale was used by <LINK REF="STD-Durham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Durham 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levine-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Penn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Penn 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Uzenoff-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Uzenoff 2007</LINK>.</P>
<P>ii. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (<LINK REF="REF-Lukoff-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lukoff 1996</LINK>)<BR/>This is a semi-structured interview, which assesses the major psychiatric symptoms. It is a 16-item scale, and each item is scored on a seven-point scale, ranging from &#8217;not present&#8217; to &#8217;extremely severe&#8217;. The range of possible scores is 24 to 168, and high scores indicate more severe symptoms. Data from the BPRS is reported by <LINK REF="STD-Haddock-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Haddock 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kemp-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kemp 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Penn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Penn 2009</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 1999</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Kemp-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kemp 1996</LINK> reported data for the full version of the BPRS immediately after treatment.

Results for the abridged version were reported immediately after treatment and at six-month, 12-month and 18-month follow-up.</P>
<P>iii. Schedule for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1983</LINK>)<BR/>This scale assesses the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. A six-point scale is used to rate alogia, affective blunting, avolition-apathy, anhedonia-apathy, anhedonia-asociality and attention impairment. Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. This scale was used by <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sensky-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Sensky 2000b</LINK>.</P>

<P>v. Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scales (PSYRATS) (<LINK REF="REF-Haddock-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haddock 1999b</LINK>)<BR/>This consists of two scales, which assess delusional beliefs and auditory hallucinations. There are 11 items in the auditory hallucinations scale, including frequency, duration, level of distress, controllability, loudness, location and beliefs about origin of voices. The delusional beliefs scale has six items, including preoccupation, intensity of distress, conviction and disruption. Each item is rated on a &#64257;ve-point scale. The PSYRATS were used by <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 2002b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Penn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Penn 2009</LINK>.</P>
<P>vi.

<P>ii. Insight and Treatment Attitudes Questionnaire (ITAQ) (<LINK REF="REF-McEvoy-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">McEvoy 1989</LINK>)<BR/>This scale assesses an individual&#8217;s recognition of illness and need for treatment and includes 11 questions. Reponses are rated as follows: 2 = good insight, 1 = partial insight, and 0 = no insight, which are summed to provide a total insight score. Higher scores correspond to better insight. <LINK REF="STD-Uzenoff-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Uzenoff 2007</LINK> reported data on this scale.</P>
<P>iii. Schedule for Assessment of Insight (SAI) (<LINK REF="REF-David-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 1990</LINK>)<BR/>The schedule is a semi-structured interview with three components; treatment compliance, awareness of illness and ability to relabel psychotic symptoms correctly. The range of possible scores is zero to 14, but scores are expressed as a percentage of maximum insight. Low scores therefore indicate poor insight.

It was used by <LINK REF="STD-Davidson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Davidson 2004</LINK>. It assesses the respondent&#8217;s current state and asks if that differs from his or her usual state and produces an overall score that can be compared with a prescribed cut-off score. All items have a four-point Likert scoring (0-1-2-3) system that ranges from a 'better/healthier than normal' option, through a 'same as usual' and a 'worse/more than usual' to a 'much worse/more than usual' option. The higher the score, the more severe the condition. </P>
<P>ii. Quality of Life Scale - QLS (<LINK REF="REF-Heinrichs-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinrichs 1984</LINK>)<BR/>This 21-item scale is based on a semi-structured interview providing information on symptoms and functioning during the preceding four weeks. There are seven severity steps (zero to six; six being adequately functioning and zero being deficient). Four item categories have been identified by factor analysis i) interpersonal relationships (seven items), ii) instrumental role (four items), iii) intrapsychic function (seven items) and iv) common place objects and activities. Higher scores indicate better quality of life. This scale was used by <LINK REF="STD-Uzenoff-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Uzenoff 2007</LINK>.</P>

Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1965</LINK>)<BR/>The scale measures state self-esteem by asking the respondents to reflect on their current feelings, with a 10-item Likert-type scale with items answered on a four-point scale &#8212; from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Five of the items have positively worded statements and five have negatively worded ones. The scale ranges from zero to 30. Scores between 15 and 25 are within normal range; scores below 15 suggest low self-esteem.  This scale was used by <LINK REF="STD-Davidson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Davidson 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Penn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Penn 2009</LINK>.</P>
<P>iv. Well-Being scale- WBS (<LINK REF="REF-Ryff-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryff 1989</LINK>)<BR/>This is a scale to measure positive aspects of psychological functioning along six dimensions in which respondents rate statements on a scale of one to six, with one indicating strong disagreement and six indicating strong agreement: independence and self-determination (autonomy); having satisfying, high quality relationships (positive relations with others); the ability to manage one&#8217;s life (environmental mastery); being open to new experiences (personal growth); believing that one&#8217;s life is meaningful (purpose in life); and a positive attitude towards oneself and one&#8217;s past life (self-acceptance). A high score indicates that the respondent has a mastery of that area in his or her life. Conversely, a low score shows that the respondent struggles to feel comfortable with that particular concept. <LINK REF="STD-Davidson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Davidson 2004</LINK> reported data for this scale.</P>

<P>There was a lack of data for this comparison, with only five studies included. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low for the outcomes in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>We found no evidence of significant differences between supportive therapy and standard care for rates of relapse and hospitalisation, clinical improvement in mental state, leaving the study early and quality of life and no studies reported data on general functioning and satisfaction with treatment.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Supportive therapy versus any other psychological or psychosocial treatment</HEADING>
<P>Twenty studies were included in the comparison, which combines data from the comparisons for other psychological interventions, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), family therapy and the quality of the evidence was very low for all outcomes except leaving the study early, which we rated as moderate in the <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>For the outcomes rate of hospitalisations, clinical improvement in mental state and satisfaction of treatment for the recipient of care, we found evidence favouring any other psychological or psychosocial treatment. We found no evidence of significant differences for rate of relapse, leaving the study early and quality of life.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Supportive therapy versus cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen studies compared supportive therapy with CBT. Again, the quality of the evidence was very low for all outcomes except leaving the study early, which we rated as moderate (see <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found no evidence of significant differences between supportive therapy and CBT for rates of relapse and hospitalisation, clinical improvement in mental state, leaving the study early and quality of life. For general functioning, we could not pool data as it showed high heterogeneity; one study showed equivocal data, the other found in favour of supportive therapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Supportive therapy versus family therapy</HEADING>
<P>There was a lack of data for this comparison, with only two studies included. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low for the outcomes in the <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>.</P>
<P>We were not able to pool the data for rate of relapse due to high heterogeneity; one study found no difference in relapse rates, the other study found a difference in favour of family therapy. We found no differences for the rate of hospitalisation and leaving the study early. As there were limited data for this comparison, we had to use proxy data for two outcomes: for mental state we had data for participants experiencing an episode of affective symptoms and for general functioning we had data for participants with no paid work. Neither of the studies reported data for satisfaction with treatment and quality of life.</P>

<P>Again, we were only able to include two studies in this comparison and the quality of the evidence was very low (see <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found that there was no evidence of significant differences between supportive therapy and psychoeducation for the outcomes with data &#8211; rate of hospitalisation, no clinical improvement in mental state and leaving the study early.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Few data</HEADING>
<P>It is important to point out that the findings in this review are significantly weakened by the limited amount of available data. The search strategy identified five trials, involving 822 people, comparing supportive therapy with standard care. However, few data regarding the predetermined primary outcomes of interest could be extracted. The important clinical question, whether supportive therapy confers any advantage over standard care in the treatment of people with schizophrenia, remains unanswered. It is important to answer this question before results of research comparing supportive therapy with other psychological or psychosocial therapies can be interpreted fully and meaningfully.</P>
<P>More studies compared supportive therapy with other psychological or psychosocial interventions. There were, however, many comparison interventions. The number of studies comparing supportive therapy with each intervention was generally small, the main exception being CBT, for which we identified 13 studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Delivery of therapy</HEADING>
<P>In trials of psychological interventions, there is question about whether the same therapists should provide two different interventions, potentially allowing factors such as level of experience of the therapists and individual differences in personality to be evenly distributed between groups. However, an alternative, and in our opinion more persuasive, argument is that different therapists should provide different therapies. This takes into account the likelihood that therapists have a loyalty to, and training and experience in, one particular type of therapy. This may be particularly important if they have been involved in generating the hypotheses which are being tested. The majority of studies in this review used the same therapists for supportive therapy and other psychological interventions. Most studies did not specify what training the therapists had received or what level of experience they had. Where studies did report details of therapist training, therapists who delivered supportive therapy were sometimes trained in other modalities, such as CBT, but not in supportive therapy. The studies which described standardised supportive therapy, with the use of a manual, were in the minority; as were the studies that evaluated or monitored adherence to the treatment model.</P>
<P>Not all studies attempted to match the amount of therapist contact. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Coyle-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Coyle 1988</LINK> compared supportive therapy with social skills training and psychoeducation. Supportive therapy sessions, however, were half as long as other therapy sessions, and were delivered individually rather than in a group.</P>
<P>More recent studies, such as <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 2002b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Penn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Penn 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sensky-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Sensky 2000b</LINK> are of a much better quality. It seems likely that methodology and reporting have improved considerably over recent years, which will be valuable for future versions of this review. The concerns described above mean that only tentative conclusions can be drawn from this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Applicability</HEADING>
<P>All trials used entry criteria to define who would be included in the study. These, however, varied from study to study. The studies involved people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like illnesses defined by a range of criteria. Most studies, but not all, used some form of diagnostic criteria. Settings also varied, and both inpatients and outpatients were included. This suggests that the results would be valid for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or a related psychotic illness, whether they are being treated as an inpatient or on an outpatient basis. However, the possibility that patients typically studied in randomised controlled trials may differ in important ways from patients typically seen in mental health services should also be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Roth-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 1996</LINK>). The results of this review should ideally be considered alongside results of effectiveness research. In effectiveness research, generalisability may be higher that for randomised controlled trials, although internal validity is lower (<LINK REF="REF-Margison-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margison 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>One aspect of trial setting which might be particularly important is the country in which trials are conducted. In this review, the majority were set in the USA. Seven were set in the UK, and one each in Israel, Italy, Sweden and Australia. There may be a difference in what is regarded as supportive therapy in the USA and in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Holmes-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 1995</LINK>), with, for example, supportive therapy in the USA perhaps being more frequent and more closely related to a psychodynamic approach than in the UK.</P>
<P>One of the difficulties in attempting this systematic review has been finding a clinically useful definition of supportive therapy. Despite the lack of a universally accepted definition, we felt it was important to define the intervention and identify the available evidence. Throughout the process, we have been aware of the risk that interventions included in the review would be too diverse. Readers of this review need to know what is meant by supportive therapy, and to be able to apply the findings in clinical practice. The included interventions do vary, and we have some concerns about whether they have enough in common to be grouped together in a useful way. The wide variation in the duration and frequency of sessions could be taken as evidence of differences between interventions in the included studies. Nevertheless, we note the lack of research in this field, and the lack of specific meta-analyses on supportive therapy. We feel the use of a broad definition of supportive therapy in this review is justified as producing an initial analysis of the available data. It is possible that narrower definitions of supportive therapy, perhaps used in more specific settings, could produce different results. For example, it may be possible that an untrained support worker within a community team could reduce the input required for a patient from other members of the team, or may increase the leisure and community activities of a patient. In this review we are unable to make comments on specific questions such as these.</P>
<P>Treatment manuals, training of therapists and monitoring of treatment fidelity, all help to enhance internal validity of trials. These were used in a minority of trials in this review. However, it can be argued that these measures may increase the apparent effectiveness of interventions over what is possible to reproduce in clinical practice. In many reports, little description of the supportive intervention was provided.</P>
<P>Two studies in particular described interventions which are different from the other supportive interventions. <LINK REF="STD-Kemp-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kemp 1996</LINK> reports that therapists delivering supportive therapy were specifically instructed to decline to discuss treatment with people. <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1999</LINK> also describes a somewhat different intervention. In this study, supportive therapy is more like a client-focused case management with advocacy. Advocacy, which comes within our definition of supportive therapy, was provided by consumer advocates, who could be people who had experienced mental illness, relatives or carers of people with mental illnesses, or interested lay people. No particular frequency or duration of sessions was specified.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-02-05 12:47:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was little consensus between studies over which outcome variables to use. Definition of outcomes such as relapse also varied between trials.</P>
<P>Sample sizes were small for most studies, perhaps resulting in true beneficial or harmful effects going undetected.</P>
<P>The quality of the available data is also a cause for concern which needs to be borne in mind when interpreting the results of this review. Twenty of the 24 studies did not adequately report the use of allocation concealment, raising concerns about selection bias. We suspect that this would be most likely to act in the direction of biasing results against supportive therapy, as supportive therapy is used as a control treatment in the majority of studies in this review. Although double-blind trials are not possible when testing a psychological intervention, it is possible for therapists to be blinded to the study hypothesis. Only two studies attempted this. Not all studies rated outcomes blindly, resulting in a risk of detection biases. Attrition bias cannot be discounted either, as losses to follow-up were generally poorly reported, and intention-to-treat analyses were the exception rather than the rule.</P>
<P>These potential biases are particularly important in this review. This is because studies are almost all designed with supportive therapy as a comparator for other treatments, rather than being the primary treatment of interest to investigators. The hypothesis and the expectation of investigators is therefore likely to be that supportive therapy will not perform as well as the other treatment under investigation.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity was present, as judged by visual inspection and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, for the outcomes: mental state measured on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), general functioning on the Global Assessment of Function disability scale (GAF) and Global Assessment Scale (GAS) when supportive therapy was compared with other psychological interventions or CBT alone; relapse when supportive therapy was compared with other psychological interventions CBT alone and family therapy; and leaving the study early when supportive therapy was compared with CBT. This may be due in part to the diversity of the interventions. There is a possibility that our attempt to investigate the effects of supportive therapy may not have been as successful as we might have hoped due to the variety of interventions meeting our criteria for supportive therapy or care. However, as high rates of heterogeneity were not found for other outcomes, this does not seem likely to be a major problem. Another possibility, and probably one that is more likely, is that the heterogeneity was due to diversity of control interventions (family therapy or CBT). Although homogeneity was not restored when data from <LINK REF="STD-Levine-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1998</LINK> were excluded from the pooled analyses (due to the presence of heterogeneity). We think the data in <LINK REF="STD-Levine-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Levine 1998</LINK> may have been incorrectly reported or may have been an anomaly due to the small numbers in each treatment group (n = 7). Also the standard deviations were very small, and we believe the authors may have erroneously reported standard errors as standard deviations.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. The limitations of randomised trials of psychotherapy</HEADING>
<P>In doing this review, we explicitly aimed to include only randomised controlled trials. However, it is important to recognise that evidence from randomised controlled trials is not the only form of evidence which can be used to guide clinical practice. There are particular problems with randomised controlled trials for psychological therapies. Psychotherapy relies on the uniqueness of the clinician-patient relationship, and ways of measuring outcomes which take account of this need to be developed (<LINK REF="REF-Holmes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 2000</LINK>). Randomised controlled trials employ techniques to enhance internal validity, such as frequent monitoring, the use of therapy manuals and excluding patients with dual diagnoses. These techniques may increase the apparent effectiveness of the intervention above what would routinely be achieved in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Roth-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 1996</LINK>). In randomised controlled trials of long-term therapy, there is a risk of contamination by other treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Margison-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margison 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Definition of supportive therapy</HEADING>
<P>Distinguishing supportive therapy from standard treatment has also been an issue in this review. We have largely relied on authors' descriptions of the interventions, and have classified some interventions described as treatment as usual as supportive therapy. Similarly, some interventions which were described as supportive in nature were not felt to meet the pre-determined inclusion criteria for this review. Descriptions have not always been of sufficient detail to judge whether a control intervention should be classified as supportive therapy or not, leaving the possibility that some data were in appropriately omitted. The lack of differences in outcomes between supportive therapy and standard care could suggest that this distinction is not a valid one. However, this is not the only interpretation of the results, and a real difference in effectiveness could exist, but may not have been identified due to paucity of data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Strengths</HEADING>
<P>Despite the reservations and difficulties outlined above, it is important that this review has been attempted. Supportive therapy is commonly used in clinical practice for people with schizophrenia. It may be cheaper than other therapies, such as CBT but is probably more costly and intensive than what is generally provided as standard care in many places. We also feel it to be a prevalent approach so it is important to systematically examine the effects of supportive therapy as a specific intervention. As far as we are aware, the only published study previously to have attempted this was the meta-analysis undertaken by the Department of Health for the purposes of the NICE Guideline on Schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2003</LINK>). The scope of this systematic review is not quite as focused as this work and therefore the <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2003</LINK> review is larger with more studies included. We feel our tighter definitions of supportive therapy are justified, workable and give a clearer picture of the evidence.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. For people with schizophrenia</HEADING>
<P>The evidence presented in this review does not allow us to conclude that supportive therapy has any substantial benefit over standard care. Although there is no evidence of a treatment effect when comparing supportive therapy with standard care, the small number and small size of trials means that a treatment effect, either favouring supportive therapy or standard care, cannot be ruled out. This rather unsatisfactory conclusion also applies to other comparisons where supportive therapy is directly compared with several other psychological therapies, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). At present there is not really conclusive evidence for people with schizophrenia to choose one of the other therapies over a more simple supportive approach.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>Guidance encourages use of family and cognitive therapy for people with schizophrenia. From this review, one cannot conclude that supportive therapy offers anything different to other forms of psychological intervention. For some outcomes, including hospitalisation, general mental state and affective symptoms, data suggest an advantage for other therapies over supportive therapy but due to the small amount of data and the lack of consistency between outcomes measuring similar variables, firm conclusions should not be drawn from these results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. For mangers and policy makers</HEADING>
<P>Unfortunately, the paucity of data means no clear recommendations for clinical practice can be made on the basis of this review. At present, there is no evidence from this review of a beneficial effect for supportive therapy over standard care, although such a beneficial or harmful effect cannot be ruled out. There is some evidence to suggest a disadvantage of supportive therapy in comparison with other therapies but this is scarce and is often derived from studies that may have some inherent bias towards the other therapies. Certainly, these data require replication in large, clinically meaningful randomised controlled trials before they can be used to guide clinical practice. It is important to highlight the lack of data regarding harmful or adverse effects of supportive therapy. This would be deemed unacceptable in a trial relating to a specific medication.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. General</HEADING>
<P>As with similar studies, public registration of a study before anyone is randomised would ensure that participants could be confident that people would know that the study had at least taken place. Unique study numbers would help researchers to identify single studies from multiple publications and reduce the risk of duplicating the reporting of data. Compliance with CONSORT (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>), both on the part of authors and editors, would help to clarify methodology and many outcomes. Failure to comply with such standard guidelines results in both loss of data and confusion in the results, neither of which help clinicians, patients or managers.</P>
<P>Intention-to-treat analysis should be performed on all outcomes and all trial data should be made easily accessible. A minimal requirement should be that all data should, at least, be presented as numbers. In addition, continuous data should be presented with means, standard deviations (or standard errors) and the number of participants. Data from graphs, 'P' values of differences and statements of significant or non-significant differences are of limited value. Unfortunately, in spite of the large numbers of participants randomised, we were unable to use most of the data in the trials included in this review due to the poor data reporting.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Specific</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1 Reviews</HEADING>
<P>Many of the excluded studies suggest new comparisons relevant to future reviews (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>), too many for this exhausted group of systematic review authors to currently list.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Trials</HEADING>
<P>Supportive therapy can be usefully investigated using randomised controlled trials. Of course, evidence from randomised controlled trials should be considered alongside evidence from other forms of research, but larger trials do seem warranted and preferably undertaken by those with clear equipoise. A suggestion for the design is outlined in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.2.1 Methods</HEADING>
<P>Allocation concealment is vital in the design of future randomised controlled trials to minimise bias. The randomisation process should also be described fully. It is probably not possible to use double-blind methodology in trials of psychological and psychosocial interventions. However, bias can be minimised by ensuring therapists and people are blind to the specific study hypothesis where feasible, and by using blinded or independent outcome raters.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.2.2 Participants</HEADING>
<P>We would suggest that inclusion criteria for participants in such a study would be broad and that the therapy be given in the context of everyday practice.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.2.3 Interventions</HEADING>
<P>2.2.3.1 Supportive therapy</P>
<P>Future trials should clearly explain whether practitioners who deliver supportive therapy have been specifically trained, and if so how. It may make the results more applicable if the therapists are trained but in the context of routine career development, rather than specific highly-trained specialised practitioners. In addition, using a therapy manual or protocol and attempting to ensure adherence to the model may at least increase internal validity of the trial. Ideally, different therapists should be used for different therapies. Finally, it is important to clearly define supportive therapy. We have found no standard definition and it would be beneficial if a standard definition for this commonly practiced intervention were to be developed.</P>
<P>2.2.3.2 Comparison group</P>
<P>Further data comparing supportive therapy both with standard care and with other treatments are needed. These should be clearly defined within the trial, even if it is routine care.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.2.4 Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Outcomes chosen should be clinically relevant and widely used. Outcomes such as relapse or hospitalisation are less vulnerable to bias than scale data, and may therefore be preferable. Little data are available presently on adverse effects, social functioning, occupational status, quality of life, and economic outcomes, all of which would be of interest. Such outcomes are often not difficult to record over the short, medium or long term.</P>

<P>1. Electronic searches<BR/>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's study-based register (January 2004) using the phrase:</P>
<P>[((*support* OR *advoc*) in REFERENCE) and ((*support* or *individual* or *sociotherapy* or *socioenvir*) in Study)]</P>
<P>This register is compiled by systematic searches of major databases, hand searches and conference proceedings (see Group Module).</P>
<P>2. Reference searching<BR/>We inspected reference lists of all identified studies (included or excluded) for more studies.</P>
<P>3. Personal contact<BR/>We contacted authors of relevant reviews or studies for other sources of relevant information.</P>

<P>1. Selection of trials<BR/>We (LB, TP) independently inspected the abstracts of all citations identified from the search. We identified potentially relevant abstracts and ordered full papers and reassessed these for inclusion and methodological quality. We resolved any disagreement by discussion and reported the outcome.</P>
<P>2. Assessment of quality<BR/>We (LB, TP) independently allocated trials to three quality categories, as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>), which is based on the evidence of a strong relationship between allocation concealment and direction of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Where disagreement arose as to which category a trial should be allocated, we attempted to resolve this by discussion. If doubt remained we added the study to the list of trials awaiting assessment until further information could be obtained. Only trials in Category A or B were included in the review.</P>
<P>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results)<BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment).</P>
<P>For the purpose of the analysis in this review, trials were included if they met the Cochrane Handbook criteria A or B.</P>
<P>3. Data management<BR/>3.1 Data extraction<BR/>We (LB, TP) independently extracted data and contacted authors' of trials to provide missing data.</P>
<P>3.2 Intention-to-treat analysis<BR/>We excluded data from studies where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow-up (this did not include the outcome of 'leaving the study early'). In studies with less than 50% dropout rate, people leaving early were considered to have had the negative outcome, except for the event of death. The impact of including studies with high attrition rates (25% to 50%) were analysed in a sensitivity analysis. If inclusion of data from this latter group did result in a substantive change in the estimate of effect, their data were not added to trials with less attrition, but were presented separately.</P>
<P>4. Data analysis<BR/>4.1 Binary data<BR/>For binary outcomes we calculated the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). The number needed to treat statistic (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH) were also calculated. If data were heterogeneous (see section 5) we used a random-effects model.</P>
<P>4.2 Continuous data<BR/>4.2.1 Skewed data: continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data the following standards were applied to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors, (b) when a scale started from a finite number (such as zero), the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, should be less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>)). Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and this rule can be applied to them.</P>
<P>4.2.2 Summary statistic: for continuous outcomes we estimated the weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups. Again, if data were heterogeneous (see section 5) we used a random effects model. In circumstances where trials assessed the same outcome but measured it in a variety of ways, then we analysed data using the standardised mean difference (SMD).</P>
<P>4.2.3 Valid scales: Unpublished scales are known to be subject to bias in trials of treatments for schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>) therefore, we only included continuous data from rating scales were if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal and the instrument was either a self report or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist).</P>
<P>4.2.4 Endpoint versus change data: where possible we presented endpoint data and if both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcomes then we only reported the former in this review.</P>
<P>4.2.5 Cluster trials: studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated causing type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data, and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported, it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where cluster studies were appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies was possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>5. Investigation for heterogeneity<BR/>Firstly, we considered all included studies within any comparison to judge clinical heterogeneity. We also inspected the graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. We supplemented this using the I-squared statistic. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate is equal to or greater than 75%, we interpreted this as indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). We did not summate data if inconsistency were high, but presented the data separately and investigated reasons for heterogeneity.</P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias<BR/>We had planned to enter data from all included studies into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Davey-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey 1997</LINK>). However, we decided not to undertake funnel graphs, due to insufficient data being available to enable meaningful conclusions to be drawn.</P>
<P>7. Sensitivity analyses<BR/>We analysed the effect of including studies with high attrition rates in a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>8. General<BR/>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for supportive therapy and supportive care.</P>
