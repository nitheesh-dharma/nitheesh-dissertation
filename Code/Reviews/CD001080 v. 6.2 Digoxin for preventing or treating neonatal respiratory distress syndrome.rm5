<P>There is no evidence that the administration of digoxin helps babies with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.<BR/>Sometimes a newborn baby has lungs that are not expanded properly. This is most common in preterm babies (born before 34 weeks) and is known as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Congestive heart failure may lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs, contributing to RDS. The drug digoxin has been used for congestive heart failure and has been suggested for RDS. The review found no evidence from trials that digoxin reduces congestive heart failure, prevents RDS or improves the outcome of preterm babies with RDS.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-01-08 15:40:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although hemodynamic disturbances play a role in the overall pathogenesis of respiratory distress syndrome, the specific contribution of early congestive heart failure (unrelated to hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus) does not appear to be a significant factor in RDS.

<P>Both review authors separately extracted, assessed and coded all data for each study using a form that was designed specifically for this review.

Information regarding inclusion criteria, including gestational age, postnatal age at the time of treatment, and disease severity criteria was noted. Information on clinical outcome included only mortality. Differences in assessment were resolved by discussion. For each study, final data was entered into RevMan by one review author (RFS) and then checked by a second review author (EO). Any disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-12-06 14:23:54 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were employed. The methodological quality of the studies were assessed using the following key criteria: allocation concealment (blinding of randomization), blinding of intervention, completeness of follow-up, and blinding of outcome measurement/assessment. For each criterion, assessment was yes, no, can't tell. Two review authors separately assessed each study. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. This information was added to the Characteristics of Included Studies table. </P>
<P>In addition, for the update in 2010, the following issues were evaluated and entered into the Risk of Bias table: </P>
<P>1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:  </P>
<P>- adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);  </P>
<P>- inadequate (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); </P>
<P>- unclear.  </P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed? For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:  </P>
<P>- adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);  </P>
<P>- inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);  </P>
<P>- unclear.  </P>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as:  </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants;  </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel;  </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors.  </P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as:  </P>
<P>- adequate (&lt; 20% missing data);  </P>
<P>- inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data):  </P>
<P>- unclear.  </P>
<P>(5) Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? </P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:  </P>
<P>- adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);  </P>
<P>- inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); </P>
<P>- unclear.  </P>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? </P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as: </P>
<P>- yes; no; or unclear.   </P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Martin-1963" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1963</LINK> studied the effect of digoxin in preventing RDS in a diverse group of newborns.

No improvement in respiratory status or mortality was noted. Bradycardia, EKG abnormalities, and vomiting were more frequent in the digoxin treated infants.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Braudo-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Braudo 1969</LINK> studied the effects of digoxin in 77 infants with RDS. Infants were randomized to either a 72 hour course of digoxin or placebo treatment.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-01-08 15:44:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the 1950s, investigators believed that pulmonary edema secondary to congestive heart failure may contribute to neonatal RDS. Based on this hypothesis, investigators began to use digitalis glycosides to improve myocardial contractility and decrease congestive heart failure. Two randomized controlled trials which studied the effects of digoxin in the prevention of treatment of RDS are detailed in this analysis. Neither the study of <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1963" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1963</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Braudo-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Braudo 1969</LINK> were able to note any improvement associated with digoxin administration. <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1963" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1963</LINK> noted bradycardia and EKG abnormalities in infants who received digoxin.</P>
<P>Although these studies had very different criteria regarding entry and timing of treatment, neither study demonstrates any effect of digoxin in the treatment or prevention of RDS.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Although hemodynamic disturbances play a role in the overall pathogenesis of respiratory distress syndrome, the specific contribution of early congestive heart failure (unrelated to hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus) does not appear to be a significant factor in RDS. Treatment with digoxin has no proven value in infants solely affected with RDS.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is little reason to believe that further research on digoxin in the prevention or treatment of RDS is warranted.</P>
