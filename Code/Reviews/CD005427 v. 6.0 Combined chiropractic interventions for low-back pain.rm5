<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-03-15 14:40:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>Low-back pain is one of the most common and costly musculoskeletal problems in modern society. About 80% of the population will experience low-back pain at some time in their lives. Many people with low-back pain seek the care of a chiropractor. For this review, chiropractic was defined as encompassing a combination of therapies such as spinal manipulation, massage, heat and cold therapies, electrotherapies, the use of mechanical devices, exercise programs, nutritional advice, orthotics, lifestyle modification and patient education. The review did not look at studies where chiropractic was defined as spinal manipulation alone as this has been reviewed elsewhere and is not necessarily reflective of actual clinical practice. Non-specific low-back pain indicates that no specific cause is detectable, such as infection, cancer, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, fracture, inflammatory process or radicular syndrome (pain, tingling or numbness spreading down the leg).Twelve randomised trials (including 2887 participants) assessing various combinations of chiropractic care for low-back pain were included in this review, but only three of these studies were considered to have a low risk of bias.</P>
<P>The review shows that while combined chiropractic interventions slightly improved pain and disability in the short term and pain in the medium term for acute and subacute low-back pain, there is currently no evidence to support or refute that combined chiropractic interventions provide a clinically meaningful advantage over other treatments for pain or disability in people with low-back pain. Any demonstrated differences were small and were only seen in studies with a high risk of bias. Future research is very likely to change the results and our confidence in them. Well conducted randomised trials are required that compare combined chiropractic interventions to other established therapies for low-back pain.</P>

<P>No trials were located of combined chiropractic interventions compared to no treatment. For acute and subacute LBP, chiropractic interventions improved short- and medium-term pain (SMD -0.25 (95% CI -0.46 to -0.04) and MD -0.89 (95%CI -1.60 to -0.18)) compared to other treatments, but there was no significant difference in long-term pain (MD -0.46 (95% CI -1.18 to 0.26)). Short-term improvement in disability was greater in the chiropractic group compared to other therapies (SMD -0.36 (95% CI -0.70 to -0.02)). However, the effect was small and all studies contributing to these results had high risk of bias. There was no difference in medium- and long-term disability. No difference was demonstrated for combined chiropractic interventions for chronic LBP and for studies that had a mixed population of LBP.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-03-16 14:44:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-03-15 17:37:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>Low-back pain is a very common complaint, with the lifetime prevalence reported to range from 11% to 84% (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2000</LINK>). In the majority of those people presenting with acute low-back pain, the cause of pain is non-specific, with serious underlying conditions being rare (<LINK REF="REF-Hollingworth-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollingworth 2002</LINK>). Chronic low-back pain is a well documented, disabling condition, costly to both individuals and society (<LINK REF="REF-Carey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carey 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frymoyer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frymoyer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maniadakis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maniadakis 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The economic burden of low-back pain is significant and a substantial burden on society (<LINK REF="REF-Dagenais-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dagenais 2008</LINK>). In the United Kingdom (UK), five million individuals consult their general practitioner for back pain per year, at a cost of £140.6 million. Every year, the UK National Health Service (NHS) physiotherapy and NHS hospital costs directly related to low-back pain are £150.6 million and £512 million, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2000</LINK>). Another study of healthcare costs in Britain suggested that 13% of all unemployed people reported that back pain was the reason that they were not working (<LINK REF="REF-Great-Britain-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Great Britain 1998</LINK>). In the United States (US), in one of the largest studies of its kind (<LINK REF="REF-Luo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luo 2003</LINK>), investigators found that US$26 billion per year in healthcare expenses were directly attributable to treating back pain. On average, individuals with back pain incurred health care expenditures about 60% higher than individuals without back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Luo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luo 2003</LINK>). In Australia, the estimated direct and indirect cost of low-back pain in 2001 was AUD$9.17 billion (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Chiropractic is defined by the World Federation of Chiropractic (<LINK REF="REF-WFC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WFC 1999</LINK>) as a health profession concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, and the effects of these disorders on the function of the nervous system and general health. There is an emphasis on manual treatments, including spinal manipulation or adjustment, and this is often combined with physical therapy modalities, exercise programs, nutritional advice, orthotics, lifestyle modification and other patient education (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman_x002d_Smith-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman-Smith 2000</LINK>). The proposed mechanisms by which chiropractic interventions may work is a complex one with Meeker and Haldeman identifying five possible mechanisms for manipulation alone (<LINK REF="REF-Meeker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meeker 2002</LINK>). In the case of combined chiropractic the diversity of treatments increases the number of these hypothetical mechanisms.</P>
<P>Chiropractic interventions are commonly sought in high income countries by people with low-back pain. In Australia, consultation with a chiropractor ranks as second behind medical practitioners when people with low-back pain seek care, with 19% seeking chiropractic care (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2004</LINK>). This has been a consistent finding in other high income countries. In the US, three studies spanning a ten-year period have shown that people with back pain most commonly visit medical practitioners and chiropractors (<LINK REF="REF-Deyo-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyo 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hurwitz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurwitz 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shekelle-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shekelle 1995</LINK>), and another study showed that for those with chronic back pain, chiropractic was the third most common practitioner consulted (<LINK REF="REF-Carey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carey 1995</LINK>). In the Canadian Province of Saskatchewan, Côté and colleagues found that 29% of persons with neck and back pain had consulted a chiropractor in the previous four weeks (<LINK REF="REF-C_x00f4_t_x00e9_-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Côté 2001</LINK>). Among patients who attend chiropractors, between 41% and 60% present with low-back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Cherkin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherkin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ebrall-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrall 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hartvigsen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartvigsen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hawk-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawk 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubinstein-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubinstein 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The direct cost of chiropractic care in Australia in 2001 was estimated at AUD$183 million out of a total cost of AUD$1026 million (18%), representing a substantial portion of the cost of care for low-back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2003</LINK>). In the US, from 1996 to 2005, the proportion of outpatient US healthcare expenditures spent on chiropractic care increased from 2.15% to 3.26% (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinical trials of health care interventions can be explanatory or pragmatic (<LINK REF="REF-Treweek-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treweek 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Godwin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Godwin 2003</LINK>). Explanatory trials seek to determine the efficacy of a specific intervention under ideal conditions, that is, whether it can have a beneficial effect. Explanatory trials have an important role to provide knowledge on the effects of precisely defined interventions applied to select groups under optimal conditions. However, it has been argued that healthcare interventions are seldom given under such circumstances and that such trials measure efficacy and not effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Treweek-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treweek 2009</LINK>). Pragmatic trials measure effectiveness and seek to determine the degree of benefit of the intervention in real clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Thorpe-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorpe 2009</LINK>). If a pragmatic trial shows an intervention to have significant beneficial effect, then there can be confidence that not only has the intervention been shown to work, but also that it works in real life (<LINK REF="REF-Godwin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Godwin 2003</LINK>). This distinction between explanatory and pragmatic trials is somewhat academic because there is wide agreement of the existence of a continuum from largely pragmatic to largely explanatory trials and the degree to which a trial is more explanatory or more pragmatic depends on a number of features of the trial (<LINK REF="REF-Oxman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 2009</LINK>). These features include the inclusion and exclusion criteria for trial participants and the nature of the intervention tested and its relevance to actual clinical practice. This review enquires about the effectiveness of combined chiropractic interventions for low-back pain as they would be implemented in practice (that is, as a combination of a number of modalities), and therefore includes primarily pragmatic trials, and takes a pragmatic approach to combining those trials. The question it seeks to answer is one that may arise from either a referring clinician, a patient seeking care or a policy maker: Is combined chiropractic care likely to help a patient with low-back pain, and if so, how does it compare to other interventions?</P>
<P>This review examined trials where chiropractors carried out a combination of interventions and sought to synthesise pragmatic trials that compared chiropractic interventions to other types of interventions or to no intervention. Trials of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) delivered as a single intervention, regardless of the type of practitioner that delivered the SMT, have been examined in a previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Assendelft-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assendelft 2004</LINK>). Hence, identified trials that evaluated chiropractic SMT as a single intervention were excluded from the current effort.</P>
<P>Previous systematic reviews of chiropractic interventions have not been successful in conducting a meta-analysis of the effect of chiropractic interventions for low-back pain. The most recent attempt was in 1996 (<LINK REF="REF-Assendelft-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assendelft 1996</LINK>), and meta-analysis was not possible due to the variety of outcome measures and follow-up timing. It was anticipated that with the inclusion of additional, more recent trials, sufficient numbers of trials would be available to permit the completion of a meta-analysis and meaningful synthesis. While other recent systematic reviews for back pain have included chiropractic interventions, these reviews have tended to concentrate only on spinal manipulation, and have not specifically investigated interventions as delivered by a chiropractor (<LINK REF="REF-Br_x00f8_nfort-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brønfort 2004</LINK>). To reflect actual practice this review searched for and attempted to synthesise studies that investigated chiropractic interventions in their various forms and combinations.</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to identify and systematically review all randomised trials of combined chiropractic interventions for low-back pain (rather than trials of spinal manipulation alone) to evaluate if they are effective when compared with other therapies.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-03-07 18:40:50 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2010-03-15 14:51:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing combined chiropractic interventions to other therapies or to no therapy were included. Non-randomised studies, observational studies and uncontrolled studies were excluded. Trials in any language were considered for inclusion and translation obtained where needed. Published and unpublished trials, when located, were included.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2010-03-03 15:38:35 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>Trials were selected that included participants aged 18 years or over, with non-specific low-back pain. Studies were excluded that examined pathological causes of low-back pain (e.g. cancer, inflammatory arthritis), and low-back pain with radiculopathy. Low-back pain was defined as pain occurring below the lower ribs and above the gluteal folds, including the buttocks.</P>
<P>Duration of pain did not influence inclusion in the review, but was categorised as acute (less than six weeks), subacute (six weeks to 12 weeks) or chronic (12 weeks or more) as defined by the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2009</LINK>). Results were categorised into subgroups depending on whether trial populations were acute, subacute, chronic, mixed or not defined.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2010-03-15 15:06:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>An intervention was deemed as a 'chiropractic intervention' when the investigators of the trial suggested this was the case and it was delivered by a registered chiropractor. The label 'chiropractic' was found to encompass a combination of therapies such as spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) or adjustment, massage, thermotherapies, electrotherapies, the use of mechanical devices, exercise programs, nutritional advice, orthotics, lifestyle modification and patient education. The specific type of chiropractic intervention employed in the trials are outlined in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. Trials that were limited to chiropractic SMT as a single intervention were excluded, as these have been examined in a previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Assendelft-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assendelft 2004</LINK>). Studies were also excluded when a chiropractor delivered the intervention in both study arms, because, while these studies allow assessment of the effect of individual chiropractic interventions compared to each other, the overall effect of the combined chiropractic interventions could not be determined from this study design. Type of intervention and comparison was not an exclusion criteria but defined comparisons. We also planned to use dose (number of treatment sessions) to define comparisons, however, too few trials were available to allow this.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2010-03-15 18:08:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>The choice of outcome measures for inclusion in this systematic review was based on those recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2009</LINK>). The outcomes of interest were pain, disability, back-related function, overall improvement, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects. Results are presented for different follow-up periods. Follow-up was defined as short-term when measurement of outcome was less than one month after randomisation, medium-term follow-up was between one month and six months, and long-term follow-up was six months or more. We modified these time periods from those stated in the protocol to reflect the recently updated Cochrane Back Review Group Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2009</LINK>).</P>

A second review author (SF or SG or WG) independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted results of included studies as recommended in the updated Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) and Cochrane Back Review Group Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2009</LINK>). When necessary, we approximated results from graphic representations in the reports of the included studies. If the review authors disagreed in their assessment of risk of bias or data extraction, this was resolved by discussion and consensus, followed by discussion with a third review author if necessary.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data Analysis</HEADING>
<P>All quantitative results were entered into Review Manager 5.0 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). Results for continuous variables were reported as mean difference (MD) when the outcome measures were the same, and standardized mean difference (SMD) when outcomes were measured with different instruments measuring the same construct. We used the random effects model for any statistical pooling because of the variety of chiropractic interventions in the included studies and subsequent heterogeneity. Effect estimates resulting from meta-analysis expressed as SMD were back transformed by multiplying the SMD with the standard deviation (SD) of a standard instrument used to measure the outcome (for example, centimetres (cm) on a 10 cm Visual Analogue pain scale). Standard deviation values were imputed using the average baseline SD values from both study arms of a trial that used the standard instrument of interest.</P>
<P>When more than two chiropractic intervention arms, or two comparison arms, were used in a study, we combined the data from the arms to create a single pair-wise comparison (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008a</LINK>, Section 7.7.3.8). We did this for the data from five included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cherkin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cherkin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Br_x00f8_nfort-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Brønfort 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurwitz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hurwitz 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>A descriptive analysis of the quality of the evidence for each outcome was performed using the GRADE approach, which assesses and combines the following elements across studies: study design, risk of bias, consistency of results, directness (generalisability), precision of data and reporting bias (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Quality is considered to be high when RCTs with low risk of bias provide results for the outcome, and reduces by a level for each of the factors not met, as follows:</P>
<P>
<B>High quality evidence:</B> there are consistent findings among at least two RCTs with low risk of bias that are generalisable to the population in question. There are sufficient data, with narrow confidence intervals. There are no known or suspected reporting biases. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.</P>
<P>
<B>Moderate quality evidence:</B> one of the factors is not met. Further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</P>
<P>
<B>Low quality evidence:</B> two of the factors are not met. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change it.</P>
<P>
<B>Very low quality evidence:</B> three of the factors are not met. There is great uncertainty about the estimate.</P>
<P>
<B>No evidence:</B> no evidence from RCTs.</P>

<P>We included 12 studies that involved 2887 participants with low-back pain.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies for inclusion</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> describes the process from searching to study inclusion. We identified a total of 3699 non-duplicate potentially relevant citations from electronic databases (the Cochrane Back Review Group (CBRG) Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, MANTIS and the Index to Chiropractic Literature). After two review authors (SF and WG or BW) independently screened the titles and abstracts of these studies, we excluded 3531 records and obtained 168 studies for full text review. Twelve of these studies met our inclusion criteria and their details are described in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. Studies initially appearing to meet the eligibility criteria but which we subsequently excluded are reported in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table along with our first reason for exclusion. One ongoing study was identified from a published trial protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Maiers-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Maiers 2007</LINK>); this study is described in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>Of the twelve included studies, eight had one comparison group (two-arm study), two studies had two comparison groups (three-arm study), and two studies had three comparison groups (four-arm study). Four studies entered participants with acute or subacute low-back pain, seven studies entered participants with mixed pain duration, and one study entered participants with chronic low-back pain.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of study setting</HEADING>
<P>Four studies were conducted in the USA, two in the UK and one in Denmark. Five studies did not report the country in which the study was conducted. Three studies were conducted in hospital settings, one in a health maintenance organisation care facility, one in a teaching chiropractic clinic and two in private chiropractic clinics. In the remainder of the studies, the setting was not reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of interventions evaluated</HEADING>
<P>The included studies employed a range of chiropractic and comparator treatments and are outlined in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Based on our inclusion criteria for types of interventions, none of the included studies evaluated SMT alone. Of the 12 studies included, 10 studies used SMT as part of their chiropractic intervention. The two studies that did not employ SMT as part of their chiropractic intervention evaluated flexion distraction technique as their primary chiropractic intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Gudavalli-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gudavalli 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawk-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hawk 2005</LINK>). Only two of the 12 included studies used the same chiropractic intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Beyerman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Beyerman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 1992</LINK>), SMT plus heat packs. Only four studies reported the level of experience of the chiropractors involved in therapy provision.</P>

<P>See <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> for the risk of bias assessment for each included study. Only three of the included studies (3/12) had low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Br_x00f8_nfort-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Brønfort 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gudavalli-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gudavalli 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawk-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hawk 2005</LINK>). All 12 studies were described as randomised but the method of random sequence generation was clear in only four studies and allocation concealment was adequate in only six studies. Blinding of study participants was reported in one study, of providers in none of the studies and of outcome assessors in seven studies. Blinding of participants and providers in studies of manual therapy is problematic, as participants often know which therapy is being delivered, and providers obviously know what they are delivering. In some studies, authors reported blinding of outcome assessment, but this was not feasible for the primary outcomes as they were self-reported measures of pain, disability and improvement.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 01: Chiropractic versus other therapies (acute and subacute low-back pain)</HEADING>
<P>For the comparison of chiropractic versus other therapies for acute and subacute low-back pain, data were only available for pain and disability.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pain</HEADING>
<P>Three included studies (all high risk of bias) measured pain at short-term follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Cherkin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cherkin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cramer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Cramer 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2002</LINK>). For these studies, the chiropractic intervention included lumbosacral spine adjustments/manipulation plus one or more of the following: drop-table adjustments, massage, ice packs, and exercises. The comparator interventions included myofascial therapy, Back School, McKenzie therapy, an instructional booklet, ultrasound, cold pack and massage. Across the three studies, 124 participants received chiropractic interventions and 299 received the other therapies. Both chiropractic and comparator groups improved from baseline, however short-term pain relief was greater for the chiropractic groups when compared to other therapies (combined SMD -0.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.46 to -0.04)) (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). When this SMD is back transformed into units on the 10 cm VAS, the treatment effect was equivalent to a decrease of 0.48 cm (95% CI 0.08 to 0.87), which is not considered a clinically significant difference.</P>
<P>For medium-term follow-up of pain, there was one study with a high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Cherkin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cherkin 1998</LINK>). Chiropractic interventions included lumbosacral spine adjustments/manipulation plus one or more of the following: drop-table adjustments, massage, ice packs, and exercises. The comparative therapies included ice packs, gentle massage, exercises and McKenzie therapy. Fifty-nine participants received chiropractic interventions and 180 received other therapies. Medium-term pain relief was greater for the chiropractic group when compared to other therapies combined, with MD -0.89 (95%CI -1.60 to -0.18) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>), but this is not considered a clinically significant difference.</P>
<P>Only one study with high risk of bias reported long-term follow-up for pain (<LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2002</LINK>). Chiropractic interventions included spinal manipulation and massage and the comparative therapies were a Back School program or myofascial therapy. There were 49 participants in the chiropractic group and 89 in the comparative therapies. There was no significant difference between these groups for long-term pain relief, MD -0.46 (95% CI -1.18 to 0.26) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>

The chiropractic interventions included lumbosacral spine adjustments/manipulation plus one or more of the following: drop-table adjustments, massage, hot packs, ice packs, and exercises. The comparator therapies included myofascial therapy, Back School, McKenzie therapy, an instructional booklet, ultrasound, cold pack, corset, transcutaneous muscle stimulation, and massage. There were 209 participants who received chiropractic and 336 who received the other therapies. Short-term improvement in disability was greater in the chiropractic group compared to other therapies (combined SMD -0.36 (95% CI -0.70 to -0.02)) (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). When this SMD was back transformed into units on the Roland Morris Disablity Questionnaire, the treatment effect was equivalent to a decrease of 1.94 points on a 24-point scale (95% CI 0.11 to 3.78).</P>
<P>For medium-term follow-up of disability, there was one study with a high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Cherkin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cherkin 1998</LINK>). Chiropractic interventions included lumbosacral spine adjustments, drop-table adjustments, massage, ice packs, and exercises. The comparative therapies included Back School, McKenzie therapy, and an instructional booklet. One hundred and eighteen participants received chiropractic and 180 received the other therapies. Medium-term improvement in disability was greater in the chiropractic group compared to other therapies (combined MD -1.07 (95% CI -2.11 to -0.03)).</P>
<P>One study with high risk of bias reported long-term follow-up of disability (<LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2002</LINK>). The chiropractic interventions included lumbosacral spine manipulation plus massage. The comparator therapies included a Back School program and myofascial therapy.

<P>No studies were found that measured pain in the short and long term. One study with high risk of bias reported medium-term follow-up of pain (<LINK REF="STD-Beyerman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Beyerman 2006</LINK>). The chiropractic interventions included SMT and moist heat pack. The comparison therapy was moist hot pack alone.

<P>One study with high risk of bias reported "average pain" experienced in the past week at short-, medium- and long-term follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Hurwitz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hurwitz 2002</LINK>). The chiropractic interventions were SMT or another spinal-adjusting technique (for example, mobilisation), instruction in strengthening and flexibility exercises, and instruction in proper back care, or chiropractic care as described above plus one or more of the following at the discretion of the chiropractor: heat or cold therapy, ultrasound, and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). There were two comparator therapies including (1) one or more of the following at the discretion of the medical provider: instruction in proper back care and strengthening and flexibility exercises; prescriptions for analgesics, muscle relaxants, anti-inflammatory agents, and other medications used to reduce or eliminate pain or discomfort; and recommendations regarding bed rest, weight loss, and physical activities; (2) medical care as described above, instruction in proper back care from the physical therapist, plus one or more of the following at the discretion of the physical therapist: heat therapy, cold therapy, ultrasound, EMS, soft-tissue and joint mobilisation, traction, supervised therapeutic exercises, and strengthening and flexibility exercises. At the long-term follow-up, there were 326 participants who received chiropractic and 329 who received the other therapies. The number of participants at the short and medium-term follow-up periods was not reported.

<P>One study with high risk of bias reported participants being "satisfied or very satisfied" with their care (<LINK REF="STD-Meade-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Meade 1990</LINK>). There were 329 participants who received chiropractic interventions and 329 who received the physiotherapy intervention. There was no short-term or long-term follow-up reported. For medium-term follow-up, those who received the chiropractic intervention were significantly more satisfied with their care than those who received physiotherapy (RR of 1.12 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.19)).</P>
<P>One study with high risk of bias reported on "rate of improvement" at the short-, medium- and long-term follow-ups (<LINK REF="STD-Br_x00f8_nfort-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Brønfort 1989</LINK>). In this study, there were 10 participants in the chiropractic group and nine in the control group. The chiropractic intervention was SMT plus advice on prevention of future episodes and the comparator group consisted of analgesics, bed rest, ultrasound, ergonomic advice and prevention advice. There was no significant difference in rate of improvement in the short-term (RR 1.05 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.94)), medium-term (RR 1.05 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.94)), or long-term (RR 1.20 (95% CI 0.69 to 2.09)).</P>

From these two studies, 16 out of a total of 106 participants who received the chiropractic interventions reported minor, transient, exacerbations of symptoms. None of the included studies reported any serious adverse effects in participants that received the chiropractic interventions. However, relatively small and short-term RCTs included in this review are not the best study design for detecting adverse events, and longer term large observational studies are needed to provide a valid evaluation of adverse effects, particularly those that are uncommon or rare.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-03-15 16:50:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>Combined chiropractic interventions (rather than SMT alone) provide short- and medium-term relief for pain and disability for individuals with acute and subacute low-back pain when compared to other treatments, but the effect sizes are small and although statistically significant, they are not clinically relevant. Also, the studies that demonstrated this effect were assessed as having a high risk of bias. There was no evidence of a significant difference between chiropractic and other treatments for any outcomes for individuals with chronic or mixed duration low-back pain. This review found no studies that would allow us to conclude about the effects of combined chiropractic interventions compared to the natural history of acute and subacute low-back pain.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in reduction of pain or disability at long-term follow-up for chiropractic compared to other interventions. Improvement at long-term follow-up after a finite amount of therapy may be optimistic in trials of this nature given the 25% recurrence rate of low-back pain within a year of an episode (<LINK REF="REF-Stanton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanton 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinical significance for the 10 cm VAS is considered to be a 1.4 cm change (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2001</LINK>), for the Oswestry Disability Index, a 10% change (<LINK REF="REF-Ostelo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostelo 2005</LINK>) and for the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, a change of two to three points on a 24-point scale (<LINK REF="REF-Bombardier-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bombardier 2001</LINK>). The results for the included studies did not provide a clinically significant difference for the chiropractic interventions.</P>
<P>The Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2009</LINK>) recommends that systematic reviews of low-back pain should be concerned with important patient-centred outcomes, such as: symptoms (for example, pain), overall improvement or satisfaction with treatment, back-specific functional status (for example, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)), well-being (for example, quality of life measured with the SF-36, SF-12, EuroQuol), and disability (for example, ability to perform activities of daily living, return-to-work status, work absenteeism). The included studies in this review looked at a variety of outcomes but the most commonly measured were pain (VAS or NRS) and disability (RMDQ or ODI). Other outcomes of importance were used infrequently in the trials and were often measured with different instruments. For example, general health was measured in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Br_x00f8_nfort-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Brønfort 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gudavalli-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gudavalli 2006</LINK>) using two different measurement instruments. No study measured return-to-work rates or specific activities of daily living. Future trials for chiropractic interventions should include these important outcome measures.</P>
<P>The dose of the chiropractic interventions employed in the included studies may not have been sufficient to make a difference until after the short-term follow-up outcomes were recorded. However, dose-response has not been studied extensively for chiropractic interventions for low-back pain. In a dose-response trial for chronic low-back pain, Haas et al (<LINK REF="STD-Haas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Haas 2004</LINK>) found that there was a positive, clinically important effect of the number of chiropractic treatments for chronic low-back pain on pain intensity and disability at four weeks. Relief was substantial for patients receiving care three to four times per week for three weeks. However, given the small amount of research, it is difficult to draw a conclusion. It is also possible that there is no dose-response effect with chiropractic care for low-back pain, and this is indicated by some favourable spinal manipulation trials that have only a few treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Assendelft-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assendelft 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have synthesised studies of heterogeneous chiropractic therapy approaches and compared them to a heterogeneous group of comparator treatments. This approach has advantages and disadvantages. An advantage is that the therapies in both chiropractic and comparator groups more closely replicate what is delivered in a clinical situation. A disadvantage is that we cannot be sure whether one or all components of any package is having an effect. On balance, we believe there is a place for both approaches, that is, systematic reviews of both pragmatic (mixed therapies that replicate practice) and explanatory or fastidious trials (trials that test only one single intervention modality), as each approach addresses a different type of question.</P>
<P>In some of the studies included in this review, the comparison treatments were very similar to the chiropractic interventions employed, limiting the opportunity for the comparison of different interventions. Meta-analysis was possible for many of the comparisons but not possible for others, mainly due to the small number of included studies. The global chiropractic treatment approach adopted for this review includes various potential confounding factors such as the type of intervention chosen by the chiropractors, the number of treatment sessions, experience of the chiropractors, and the heterogeneity of participants.</P>
<P>Only three of the 12 included studies were rated as low risk of bias. Future trials of chiropractic interventions need to be carefully planned and reported. Although we planned to undertake sensitivity analyses based on risk of bias, we were unable to do this due to the small number of trials available for each comparison. Also, there was an insufficient number of included trials to attempt any meaningful sub-group analysis. This review would benefit from subgroup analysis allowing interpretation of effects of different kinds of chiropractic interventions as the subgroups, with an overall synthesis of results to address the primary objective of the review. However, we were not able to achieve this due to the small number of included studies and the diversity of interventions. This approach will be employed for updates if further trials are identified.</P>
<P>This review looked at pragmatic studies, where chiropractic treatment was diverse in approach and did not include explanatory or fastidious studies of chiropractic where only SMT was used. These fastidious studies have been included in a previous Cochrane review of SMT for low-back pain that concluded that SMT was not superior to other effective treatments, but was more effective than placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Assendelft-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assendelft 2004</LINK>). Sub-group analysis determined that the profession of the manipulator did not alter this result. It may be useful to combine the chiropractic pragmatic trials in this review with the fastidious trials of SMT for low-back pain where the therapist was a chiropractor. This may give a more over-arching answer to the question of the effectiveness of chiropractic interventions for low-back pain compared to other therapies.</P>
<P>Trials included in our review and more broadly those of previous reviews examining different therapies for low-back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Assendelft-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assendelft 2004</LINK>), have examined these therapies when directed at a symptom (non-specific low-back pain), and not a diagnosis. Previous systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Assendelft-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assendelft 2004</LINK>) have described the benefit of a broad range of physical and pharmacological interventions over natural history or placebo therapies, but have conceded that effect sizes are small, with little difference in outcomes observed when alternative therapies are compared. This apparent lack of effect may be due, at least in part, to the tendency to treat non-specific low-back pain as a homogenous condition, rather than a heterogeneous collection of as yet undefined but differing conditions, some of which might respond and others that do not respond to a particular therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Hancock-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancock 2009</LINK>). Research to identify diagnostic subsets within non-specific low-back pain may be worthy and if successful, individual therapies such as chiropractic may be better directed.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-03-16 14:44:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>This review has shown that while combined chiropractic interventions slightly improved pain and disability in the short-term and pain in the medium-term for acute and subacute low-back pain, current evidence neither supports nor refutes that these interventions provide a clinically meaningful difference for pain or disability in people with low-back pain when compared to other interventions. </P>
<P>Any demonstrated differences in effects are small and not clinically relevant compared to other treatments and any benefits do not appear to be long lasting. No study has been undertaken of combined chiropractic interventions compared to no treatment, hence no conclusion about this can be drawn. Most of the included studies were at high risk of bias and there is a need for more high quality trials in this area.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-03-15 16:27:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="VEP  ">
<P>Due to the challenges in comparing this type of intervention to a placebo (inability to blind patient and practitioner), and unless novel placebos are developed, further research should compare chiropractic interventions to other effective interventions for low-back pain to determine the effect of chiropractic interventions compared to these established therapies. Aspects that need to be addressed in future studies include: examining the relative effects of different frequencies of visits to chiropractors; research to identify diagnostic subsets within non-specific low-back pain that may more favourably respond to chiropractic interventions so that chiropractic may be better directed; the use of appropriate outcome measures including pain, disability, overall improvement, satisfaction with treatment and return-to-work; and cost-effectiveness studies comparing chiropractic interventions with other therapies.</P>

<P>Chiropractic: Series of flexion-distraction procedures performed on a specially constructed table with a moveable headpiece, a stationary thoraco-lumbar piece, and a moveable lower extremity piece. With the subject lying prone, the clinician places one hand over the lumbar region at the level of interest and uses the other hand to flex, laterally flex, and/or rotate the lower extremity section of the table. Technique repeated three times at each week, all clinically affected levels. Also ultrasound and ice.<BR/>Comparison: Active trunk exercise protocol (ATEP) was administered by licensed physical therapists and consisted of flexion or extension exercises, weight training, flexibility exercises, and cardiovascular exercises depending on patient symptoms. Biomechanically the ATEP did not concentrate on a specific joint level but sought to impact the lumbar spine as a whole. Also ultrasound and ice.</P>

<P>Population: Patients were required to be health maintenance organisation members with the medical group chosen as their health care provider, sought medical care from a health provider on staff at one of the three study sites during the enrolment period, presented with a complaint of low-back pain, had not received treatment for low-back pain within the previous month, and were at least 18 years old.<BR/>Settings: People presenting at three study (HMO) ambulatory care facilities<BR/>Mean Age: Not reported. Participants were required to be over 18 years of age. 10% were under 30 years, 20% in 30 to 39 years, 20% in 40 to 49 years, 20% in 50 to 59 years, 15% in 60 to 69 years, 20% in 70 plus years. Very little difference between treatment groups.<BR/>Work status: Almost 60% are employed full time. 8% employed part time. 25% are retired. Little difference across treatment groups.<BR/>Pain duration: 47% of participants had been in pain for longer than 1 year, 26% had been in pain for less than 3 weeks, 17% had been in pain for 3 weeks to 3 months, and 12% had been in pain for 3 months to 1 year. Differences ranged by 8% across treatment groups.</P>

<P>Chiropractic 1: Patients assigned to <I>chiropractic care only</I> received spinal manipulation or another spinal-adjusting technique, instruction in strengthening and flexibility exercises, instruction in proper back care. At 6 months average back pain-related visits were 5.3 in the chiropractic only group. Chiropractors spent an average of 15 minutes with patients at each visit.</P>
<P>Chiropractic 2: Patients assigned to the <I>chiropractic care with physical modalities</I> received care as described in &#8216;chiropractic care only&#8217;, as well as one or more of the following at the discretion of the chiropractor: heat or cold therapy, ultrasound and EMS. At 6 months average back pain-related visits were 5.7 in the chiropractic plus physical modalities group. Chiropractors spent an average of 15 minutes with patients at each visit</P>
<P>Comparison 1: Patients assigned to the <I>medical care only</I> group received one or more of the following at the discretion of the primary care provider: instruction in proper back care and strengthening and flexibility exercise, prescriptions for pain killers, muscle relaxants, anti-inflammatory agents, other medications to reduce or eliminate pain or discomfort, and recommendations regarding bed rest, weight loss and physical activities. At 6 months average back pain-related visits were 2.9 in the medical care only group. Medical providers spent an average of 15 minutes with patients at each visit.</P>
<P>Comparison 2: Patients assigned to the <I>medical care with physical therapy</I> received medical care as described in &#8216;medical care only&#8217;, plus one or more of the following at the discretion of the physical therapist: heat therapy, cold therapy, ultrasound, electrical muscle stimulation, soft tissue and joint mobilisation, traction, supervised therapeutic exercise, strengthening and flexibility exercises. At 6 months average back pain-related visits were 5.4 in the medical care plus physical modalities group. Physical therapy providers averaged 31 minutes per patient visit.</P>
<P>85% patients in the chiropractic groups received high velocity spinal manipulation. The physical modalities most often given to patients were heat therapy alone (28%), heat and EMS (25%), heat, EMS and ultrasound (23 %), and heat therapy and ultrasound (15%). 4% patients in the modalities group were not treated with any modalities and 13 % patients in the chiropractic-only group received modalities. The most common intervention in the physical therapy group were heat or cold therapy (71%), supervised physical exercise (59.5%), ultrasound (45%), EMS(33.6%), and mobilisation (20%). Prescription pain medications (58.5%), muscle relaxants (48.5%) and non prescription pain medications (30%) were the most frequent interventions in the medical groups.<BR/>Country of training: Not reported<BR/>Years in practice: Not reported</P>

McCarthy (co-author) revealed the following: "...<I>equal numbers of envelopes were created for each group. These were initially mixed together and then shuffled into each other and boxed. As patients became available the nurse registering the patients would select an envelope from the box and hand it to the patient. We did not use a random number list to generate the order as this could have also been abused (either by disturbing the order of the envelopes or moving patients into particular groups). Using this method led to a greater degree of uncertainty regarding the group allocated."</I>

<P>
<I>1. Was the method of randomization adequate?</I>
</P>
<P>A random (unpredictable) assignment sequence. Examples of adequate methods are coin toss (for studies with two groups), rolling a dice (for studies with two or more groups), drawing of balls of different colours, drawing of ballots with the study group labels from a dark bag, computer-generated random sequence, pre-ordered sealed envelops, sequentially-ordered vials, telephone call to a central office, and pre-ordered list of treatment assignments</P>
<P>Examples of inadequate methods are: alternation, birth date, social insurance/security number, date in which they are invited to participate in the study, and hospital registration number</P>
<P>
<I>2. Was the treatment allocation concealed?</I>
</P>
<P>Assignment generated by an independent person not responsible for determining the eligibility of the patients. This person has no information about the persons included in the trial and has no influence on the assignment sequence or on the decision about eligibility of the patient.</P>
<P>
<I>Was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study? </I>
</P>
<P>
<I>3. Was the outcome assessor blinded to the intervention?</I>
</P>
<P>Adequacy of blinding should be assessed for the primary outcomes.  This item should be scored  &#8220;yes&#8221; if the success of blinding was tested among the outcome assessors and it was successful or:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>for patient-reported outcomes </B>in which the patient is the outcome assessor (e.g., pain, disability): the blinding procedure is adequate for outcome assessors if participant blinding is scored &#8220;yes&#8221;</LI>
<LI>
<B>for outcome criteria assessed during scheduled visit and that supposes a contact between </B>workers<B> and outcome assessors </B>(e.g., clinical examination): the blinding procedure is adequate if patients are blinded, and the treatment or adverse effects of the treatment cannot be noticed during clinical examination</LI>
<LI>
<B>for outcome criteria that do not suppose a contact with </B>workers<B> </B>(e.g., radiography, magnetic resonance imaging): the blinding procedure is adequate if the treatment or adverse effects of the treatment cannot be noticed when assessing the main outcome</LI>
<LI>
<B>for outcome criteria that are clinical or therapeutic events </B>that will be determined by the interaction between patients and care providers (e.g., co-interventions, hospitalization length, treatment failure), in which the care provider is the outcome assessor: the blinding procedure is adequate for outcome assessors if item &#8220;caregivers&#8221; is scored &#8220;yes&#8221;</LI>
<LI>
<B>for outcome criteria that are assessed from data of the medical forms</B>: the blinding procedure is adequate if the treatment or adverse effects of the treatment cannot be noticed on the extracted data</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<I>4. Was the patient blinded to the intervention?</I>
</P>
<P>This item should be scored &#8220;yes&#8221; if the index and control groups are indistinguishable for the patients or if the success of blinding was tested among the patients and it was successful.</P>
<P> 5<I>. Was the care provider blinded to the intervention?</I>
</P>
<P>This item should be scored &#8220;yes&#8221; if the index and control groups are indistinguishable for the care providers or if the success of blinding was tested among the care providers and it was successful</P>
<P>
<I>Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? </I>
</P>
<P>
<I>6. Was the drop-out rate described and acceptable?</I>
</P>
<P>The number of workers who were included in the study but did not complete the observation period or were not included in the analysis must be described and reasons given. If the percentage of withdrawals and drop-outs does not exceed 20% for short-term follow-up and 30% for long-term follow-up and does not lead to substantial bias a 'yes' is scored. (N.B. these percentages are arbitrary, not supported by literature).</P>
<P>
<I>7. Were all randomized </I>workers<I> analysed in the group to which they were allocated?</I>
</P>
<P>All randomized patients are reported/analyzed in the group they were allocated to by randomization for the most important moments of effect measurement (minus missing values) irrespective of non-compliance and co-interventions.  <I> </I>
</P>
<P>
<I>8. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</I>
</P>
<P>In order to receive a &#8216;yes&#8217;, the review author determines if all the results from all pre-specified outcomes have been adequately reported in the published report of the trial.  This information is either obtained by comparing the protocol and the report, or in the absence of the protocol, assessing that the published report includes enough information to make this judgment.</P>
<P>
<I>Other sources of potential bias? </I>
</P>
<P>
<I>9.  Were the groups similar at baseline regarding the most important prognostic indicators?</I>
</P>
<P>In order to receive a &#8220;yes&#8221;, groups have to be similar at baseline regarding demographic factors, duration and severity of complaints, percentage of patients with neurological symptoms, and value of main outcome measure(s).</P>
<P>
<I>10. Were co-interventions avoided or similar?</I>
</P>
<P>This item should be scored &#8220;yes&#8221; if there were no co-interventions or they were similar between the index and control groups.</P>
<P>
<I>11. Was the compliance acceptable in all groups?</I>
</P>
<P>The reviewer determines if the compliance with the interventions is acceptable, based on the reported intensity, duration, number and frequency of sessions for both the index intervention and control intervention(s). For example, physiotherapy treatment is usually administered over several sessions; therefore it is necessary to assess how many sessions each patient attended. For single-session interventions (for ex: surgery), this item is irrelevant.</P>
<P>
<I>12. Was the timing of the outcome assessment similar in all groups?</I>
</P>
<P>Timing of outcome assessment should be identical for all intervention groups and for all important outcome assessments.</P>
