<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Oral hormone therapies help reduce the frequency and severity of hot flushes and night sweats caused by menopause.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Hot flushes and night sweats are common symptoms around the menopause (the end of menstrual periods in a woman's life). During menopause there is a major reduction in sex hormones produced by the ovaries that cause these symptoms. The review of scientifically well conducted trials found that taking oral oestrogen or combined oestrogen and progestogen hormone replacement therapy greatly reduces the frequency and severity of these symptoms. This effect was significantly greater than the reduction of symptoms seen with placebo (dummy tablets) over time. No adverse effects were found but as the trials were only short term, more research is needed.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Hot flushes and night sweats are common symptoms experienced by menopausal women. Hormone therapy (HT), containing oestrogens alone or oestrogens together with progestogens in a cyclic or continuous regimen, is often recommended for their alleviation.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine the effect of oral HT compared to placebo on these vasomotor symptoms and the risk of early onset side-effects.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders Group and Subfertility Group trials register (searched May 2002). This register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, the handsearching of 20 relevant journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources. We also contacted all relevant pharmaceutical companies, The Journal of the International Menopause Society and Climacteric.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of oral HT for at least three months duration. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study quality and outcome data were assessed independently. Random effects models were considered appropriate due to the variety of trial methodologies. The meta-analyses were explored for sensitivity to trial quality and therapy duration. Symptom frequency and severity were assessed separately, together with withdrawals and side-effects. Frequency data were analysed using the Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) between treatment and placebo outcomes. For severity data, odds ratios were estimated from the proportional odds model. From 115 references originally identified, 24 trials meeting the selection criteria were included in the review. Study participants totaled 3,329. Trial duration ranged from three months to three years. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>There was a significant reduction in the weekly hot flush frequency for HT compared to placebo (WMD -17.92, 95% CI -22.86 to -12.99). This was equivalent to a 75% reduction in frequency (95% CI 64.3 to 82.3) for HT relative to placebo. Symptom severity was also significantly reduced compared to placebo (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.23). Withdrawal for lack of efficacy occurred significantly more often on placebo therapy (OR 10.51, 95% CI 5.00 to 22.09). Withdrawal for adverse events, commonly breast tenderness, oedema, joint pain and psychological symptoms, was not significantly increased (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.90), although the occurrence of any adverse events was significantly increased for HT (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.99). In women who were randomised to placebo treatment, a 57.7% (95% CI 45.1 to 67.7) reduction in hot flushes was observed between baseline and end of study. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Oral HT is highly effective in alleviating hot flushes and night sweats. Therapies purported to reduce such symptoms must be assessed in blinded trials against a placebo or a validated therapy because of the large placebo effect seen in well conducted randomised controlled trials, and also because during menopause symptoms may fluctuate and after menopause symptoms often decline. Withdrawals due to side-effects were only marginally increased in the HT groups despite the inability to tailor HT in these fixed dose trials. Comparisons of hormonal doses, product types or regimens require analysis of trials with these specific "within study" comparisons. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-13 09:20:28 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The hot flush (or flash) is the most characteristic manifestation of the climacteric. The climacteric can be defined as all the physiological and pathological events that directly follow the onset of reduced ovarian function, both before and after the last menstrual period (the menopause). The aetiology of the hot flush is complex and is still uncertain but is probably caused by lability in the thermoregulatory centre of the hypothalamus induced by falling oestrogen and progesterone levels (<LINK REF="REF-Freedman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freedman 1995</LINK>). Instability of the thermoregulatory centre leads to sudden, transient and erratic peripheral vasodilation in the skin blood vessels with a concomitant sensation of flushing and a measurable increase in skin temperature. Hot flushes can occur with differing severity and at different frequency during the day or night (<LINK REF="REF-Porter-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porter 1996</LINK>). At night, these changes may be recognised and referred to as night sweats. Together, hot flushes and night sweats are described as vasomotor symptoms. Hot flushes are not unique to the menopause or to hormonal fluctuations (<LINK REF="REF-Mohyi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohyi 1997</LINK>) but they are a very common symptom in the peri-menopausal and early post-menopausal phases of life with up to 75% of women experiencing differing degrees of this symptom (<LINK REF="REF-Sturdee-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturdee 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Oestrogens and progestogens, either in combination or separately, have been used to ameliorate or eliminate vasomotor symptoms around the menopause. It is not clear if a combination of an oestrogen and a progestogen has an additive or synergistic effect on the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms. Nor is it clear if these hormones are more or less effective in controlling these symptoms during the peri-menopausal years immediately prior to menopause when ovarian hormonal production is erratic and declining compared to their effect after menopause when ovarian oestrogen production has ceased and endogenous fluctuations are unlikely. </P>
<P>Oestrogen and progestogen therapy may potentially be associated with the onset of early side-effects such as breast tenderness, nausea, atypical uterine bleeding, bloating and a perception of weight gain. Longer term potential adverse outcomes such as any cancer, thromboembolism, stroke and gall bladder disease require assessment in long term randomised control trials such as the Women's Health Initiative (<LINK REF="REF-WHI-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHI 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHI-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHI 2004</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effectiveness of oral oestrogens alone or in combination with a progestogen, in the amelioration of hot flushes. Hormone Therapy (HT) will be defined as oestrogen therapy or oestrogen therapy with combined, cyclic or continuous progestogen therapy. HT was previously known as hormone replacement therapy but as only selected hormones are given at maintenance doses and do not usually achieve premenopausal serum levels, hormone therapy is a more accurate term (<LINK REF="REF-Sturdee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturdee 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>We wish to examine the following.</P>
<P>(1) The effect of oral HT on hot flushes when compared to placebo.</P>
<P>(2) The separate effects on hot flushes of unopposed oestrogen (E) therapies and combined oestrogen and progestogen therapies (E+P) versus placebo.</P>
<P>(3) The separate effect of these therapies (E and E+P) during the peri-menopause and the post-menopause versus placebo.</P>
<P>(4) To assess the risk of early onset side-effects (as delineated in "Types of Outcome Measures" section) associated with these therapies (E and E+P) versus placebo. </P>
<P>(5) To assess the reduction in hot flushes between baseline and end of study in women randomised to placebo therapy.</P>

<P>
<B>Selection of studies</B>
<BR/>Each study identified by the search strategy was assessed against the inclusion criteria by one of the reviewers (AHM for the original and JB for the update). This assessment was performed unblinded. Where there was uncertainty regarding eligibility, a second reviewer (SL for both the original and the update) also assessed the study and a decision reached through discussion.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality assessment</B>
<BR/>Quality assessment of studies that met the inclusion criteria was performed by two independent reviewers, one content expert (AHM) and two non-content experts (SH for the original and JB for the update). Any disagreements in quality ratings were resolved by discussion. Although only double-blind trials were considered for this review, standards for blinding may vary, so studies were assessed with regard to these procedures. The quality related attributes of studies were graded as outlined in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction</B>
<BR/>Further details related to the characteristics of the included studies were collected independently by two reviewers (AHM and SL for the original, JB for the update).</P>
<P>Outcome data were extracted independently by two reviewers (VM and SL for the original, JB and SL for the update), using a pro forma, and checked for agreement. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>Where necessary, additional information was sought from the principal investigators of the study. A number of requests for information are currently outstanding and, if and when received, will be included in an updated version of this review.</P>
<P>The original review included eligible trials that had been located as of January 2000. This current update includes subsequent eligible trials located as of May 2002.</P>
<P>
<B>Analysis</B>
<BR/>Statistical analyses were undertaken following the guidelines developed by the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Review Group. For cross-over trials, only results from the end of the first phase (before the treatment cross-over) were used because of the potential carry-over effect of HT from the first treatment phase. Treatment effects were defined as the difference between the HT and placebo group outcomes at the end of study, and measures of the difference between the changes from baseline for the two groups were not used (except for evaluation of the placebo effect). Participants from individual trials were included only once in each comparison and multiple HT arms within each trial were combined as appropriate. For continuous data, multiple HT arms were combined by estimating common means and variances. For dichotomous data, HT arms were combined by simple summation. For studies which reported sequential trials on the same participants, one trial was selected (the first trial reporting vasomotor outcomes) for inclusion.</P>
<P>Odds ratios (OR) were the outcome measure of choice for dichotomous data for hot flush outcomes, as this review includes trials with a differing degree of baseline "risk" of hot flushes (i.e. some studies specifically selected women with hot flushes and some studies did not). Random effects models were considered appropriate as there were many differences between trials (e.g. participant inclusion criteria, menopausal status, treatment types and dosages) that may potentially influence the size of the treatment effect, although the heterogeneity associated with fixed effects models was always assessed. Fixed effects results were only reported when a random effects analysis could not be performed due to negative "between study" variance for analyses using the inverse variance weighting method. The meta-analyses were explored for sensitivity to individual studies, quality aspects (allocation score and losses), and duration of therapy. Sensitivity to individual studies was assessed by examining their individual contribution to both the overall treatment effect and heterogeneity by the method of <LINK REF="REF-Baujat-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baujat 1999</LINK>. Concealment of treatment allocation (adequate, not adequate or not specified), losses (&lt;10%, &gt;10%) and duration of therapy beyond three months were each assessed by "between studies" meta-regression with a single covariate, using a moment estimator for between study variance (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data were collected at three months and/or end of study for the following outcomes:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Hot flush frequency - continuous</LI>
<LI>Hot flush weekly weighted score - continuous</LI>
<LI>Hot flush severity - continuous, dichotomous (present versus absent, moderate-severe versus mild-absent) or categorical (i.e. the number of women in each severity category)</LI>
<LI>Withdrawals from treatment due to lack of effect (dichotomous)</LI>
<LI>Withdrawals from treatment due to any adverse events (dichotomous)</LI>
<LI>Quality of life scale (e.g. GHQ-11) - continuous</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Hot flush frequency data were reported in a variety of formats from daily to weekly to fortnightly frequencies. These data were adjusted to a weekly equivalence by the appropriate multiplicative scaling factor to enable weighted mean differences (WMD) to be used for the comparison. There was evidence of skew ness in these data as assessed by the ratio of mean: standard deviation &lt; 1.64, indicating that natural logarithm (log) transformations may be appropriate. However, transformation of such data requires a prior linear transformation of the continuous data (i.e. x+1), as the log distribution is undefined at x = 0. Log transformations were performed on individual participant data when available. When such data were not available, the mean and standard deviations of the log transformed data were approximated from the original summary statistics by the method-of-moments approach (<LINK REF="REF-Whitehead-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehead 1999a</LINK>). The WMD estimate from the log transformed data were then back-transformed to express the treatment effect as the percent change relative to placebo. The formula for back transformation for the % change is <I>100*{exp(WMD) - 1}</I>.</P>
<P>The hot flush weekly weighted score (HFWWS) weights the hot flush frequency by the severity score and was treated as a separate outcome. This continuous outcome was also log transformed.</P>
<P>Hot flush severity was predominantly scored on the Kupperman's four point (0 to 3) severity scale, although the Greene's vasomotor sub scale was also included. These data are problematical as they were variously reported as continuous, dichotomous splits and ordinal categorical data. These data were used in three "separate" outcomes in RevMan (continuous severity score, dichotomous presence versus absence of symptoms and dichotomous moderate-severe versus mild-absent symptoms) which resulted in a fragmented analysis. Data from these studies were combined for meta-analysis using the proportional odds model (<LINK REF="REF-Whitehead-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehead 1999a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Proportional odds is a property of the logistic distribution (which is very similar to the normal distribution) and by definition, implies that the data can be described by a single odds ratio which is the same for all possible dichotomous splits of the data. Proportional odds ratios were estimated from ordinal data by logistic regression utilising all informative binary splits. Categories where there were no women in either the placebo or HT groups were ignored, and if there were zero cell counts in any other categories, a constant of 0.5 was added to all cells. Standard odds ratios were estimated from dichotomous data and again a constant of 0.5 was added to all cells if there were any zero cell counts. Odds ratios from the summary statistics of continuous data were estimated using an approximation (<LINK REF="REF-Whitehead-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehead 1999b</LINK>) which assumed the underlying logistic distribution had variance equal to the pooled variance (<I>sp<SUP>2</SUP>
</I>) of the HT and placebo groups. The logistic distribution shape parameter (beta) could then be estimated from the formula, <I>&#946; = (sp/&#960;) *1.732</I>, and the log odds ratio (LOR) estimated from the formula, <I>LOR = (&#956;1-&#956;2)/&#946;</I>(where &#956;1 and &#956;2 are the means of the HT and placebo groups respectively). The variance was approximated using the logistic density function to fit the number of observations in each group above and below the common mean and estimated in the usual manner.</P>
<P>Adherence to therapy was assessed by meta-analysis for both the number of withdrawals from therapy due to lack of effect and any adverse events. As these are correlated outcomes, independent treatment effects for each outcome were estimated by odds ratios calculated against the same baseline (the number of women completing the trial).<BR/>Side-effect data were poorly reported and generally unsuitable for meta-analysis of individual symptoms. These data were handled by a qualitative summary of the trials.</P>
<P>Any recognised, validated quality of life scale reported in the included studies was included for this outcome.</P>
<P>The weighted mean difference between baseline and end of study results for women randomised to the placebo group was estimated for vasomotor outcomes analysed as continuous variables without adjustment for correlation between paired samples. Ignoring the correlation between paired samples is expected to overestimate the standard errors of the difference and hence result in a conservative estimate. Analysis of the placebo effect was not attempted for categorical hot flush severity data as the implications of ignoring the correlation between paired samples for odds ratios is not as clear.</P>
<P>
<B>Minor changes to the protocol<BR/>
</B>During the course of preparing this review, there were minor changes made to the protocol. The overall aims remained the same, but a question about the magnitude of the reduction in vasomotor symptoms in women randomised to placebo therapy was added as this is of interest in interpreting results from trials evaluating other menopausal therapies that may not have included a placebo or other reference treatment group. We also realised that the protocol is not optimal for definitively comparing oestrogen alone with combined oestrogen and progestogen therapies as the review requirement for a placebo group will exclude some informative trials. However, the comparison of oestrogen only and combined oestrogen plus progestogen trials was retained in the protocol as it is valid to explore this as a potential source of heterogeneity between the trials included in the review.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>One hundred and fifteen references were assessed for inclusion in the review up until September 2002. Sixty six trials (a total of 73 references) were excluded. The predominant reasons for exclusion were: no placebo (23 studies), treatment period less than three months (13 studies), no oral oestrogen administered (11 studies), and no vasomotor/hot flush outcomes (11 studies). Twenty four trials (a total of 37 references) were included in the review. There are a further three trials awaiting assessment pending publication and contact with the authors. The biggest trial to date, namely the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), discouraged women with vasomotor symptoms entering the trial and therefore was not eligible to be included in this review.</P>
<P>Six of the 24 included trials reported results for multiple trials or treatment arms that were not all included in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1976</LINK> reported results for two trials of which only Study II was included as the treatment phase of Study I was only two months. Two arms (an HT arm and a placebo arm) from <LINK REF="STD-Hagen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 1982</LINK> were excluded as both these groups were given thiazide. A progestogen only treatment arm from <LINK REF="STD-Dennerstein-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Dennerstein 1978</LINK> was also excluded. <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-J-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen J 1983</LINK> reported the results from four sequential studies on the same participants. Study III and Study IV were ineligible for this review as there was no HT administered in Study III and the participants in Study IV had taken HT within one month. Study I and Study II were both eligible, but could not both be included as the Study II participants were the placebo group from Study I. Study II was chosen for inclusion as hot flush outcomes were not reported for Study I. <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-P-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen P 1987</LINK> reported four HT groups of which only two were oral HT and <LINK REF="STD-Marslew-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marslew 1992</LINK> reported two consecutive studies both with multiple treatment arms. Treatment group A2 from Study A and all of Study B were excluded as they were single-blind (i.e. HT and placebo not identical).</P>
<P>The included studies represent a total of 3329 participants randomised (median 91, range 23 to 875) and 2992 participants analysed (median 83, range 20 to 846), although not all hot flush outcomes were reported in a form suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis for all participants.</P>
<P>All of the trials were double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trials, although for both the <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-J-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen J 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hagen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 1982</LINK> trials, double-blinding was implied rather than explicitly stated.

<P>The majority of studies recruited healthy menopausal women from a clinical setting (predominantly menopause clinics), three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bech-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bech 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dennerstein-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Dennerstein 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-J-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen J 1983</LINK>) recruited women from a population base through advertisements etc and <LINK REF="STD-Notelovitz-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Notelovitz 2000a</LINK> recruited women from both. Menopausal status was commonly defined through a combination of age, amenorrhea and symptoms attributable to menopause.

These studies may not have entirely conformed to the review protocol.</P>
<P>The overall age range of participants was 34 to 64 years, with mean age in the majority of trials approximately 50 years, although two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Baumgardner-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Baumgardner 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bech-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bech 1998</LINK>) did not report the age of participants. In terms of mean age, participants from the <LINK REF="STD-Chung-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1996</LINK> study were the youngest (mean = 43.8 years, standard deviation (SD) = 4.9) and the oldest participants were from the <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> study (mean = 56.1 years, SD = 4.3 years).

The predominant oestrogens were oestradiol (23 HT arms), conjugated equine oestrogens (CEE, 9 HT arms) and ethinyl oestradiol (9 HT arms) although Mestranol (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paterson-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Paterson 1982a</LINK>), Quinestrol (<LINK REF="STD-Baumgardner-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Baumgardner 1978</LINK>) and piperazine oestrone sulphate (<LINK REF="STD-Coope-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Coope 1981</LINK>) were also used.

Thirty of the HT arms were oestrogen plus progestogen (E+P) compared to seventeen with oestrogen therapy alone (E only). Sixteen of the E+P arms were cyclic/sequential therapy as opposed to fourteen with continuous combined therapy. The predominant progestogens used were 19-nor testosterone derivatives (norethisterone acetate, norethisterone, levonorgestrel, nomogestrol acetate) but others included medroxyprogesterone acetate (<LINK REF="STD-Blumel-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Blumel 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK>), cyproterone acetate (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-P-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen P 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marslew-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marslew 1992</LINK>) and micronized progesterone (<LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK>).

</B>These results have been discussed previously in the Methodological risk of bias of included studies section.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison 2: Any HT versus placebo: vasomotor outcomes at end of study<BR/>
</B>There were data from nine trials (<LINK REF="STD-Baerug-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Baerug 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Conard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Conard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coope-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Coope 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coope-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Coope 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Derman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Derman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Notelovitz-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Notelovitz 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Symons-2000-Study-1" TYPE="STUDY">Symons 2000 Study 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Symons-2000-Study-2" TYPE="STUDY">Symons 2000 Study 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Viklylaeva-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Viklylaeva 1997</LINK>) with a total of 1104 participants, for hot flush frequency (Comparison 2.1). All of the trials demonstrated a reduction in hot flush frequency for HT compared to the placebo which was statistically significant in eight of the trials, and of borderline significance (p = 0.05) in the ninth trial (<LINK REF="STD-Coope-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Coope 1981</LINK>). There was a significant mean reduction of approximately 18 hot flushes per week for HT compared to placebo (WMD -17.9, 95% CI -22.9 to -13.0, random effects). The fixed effects analysis indicated substantial heterogeneity (Q = 17.38, df = 8, P = 0.03). It is plausible that the absolute reduction in hot flushes may be positively correlated with the untreated hot flush frequency. In support of this, the treatment effect was significantly greater (P = 0.009) in the three studies with the highest mean placebo group hot flush frequency (&gt;30 hot flushes/week) at the end of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Baerug-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Baerug 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Conard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Conard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Symons-2000-Study-2" TYPE="STUDY">Symons 2000 Study 2</LINK>). Sensitivity analysis indicated that differences in trial duration, allocation score and losses to follow- up did not significantly influence the results.</P>
<P>The log-transformed hot flush frequency data (Comparison 2.2) showed a significant mean percent reduction of approximately 75% (% reduction 75.3, 95% CI 64.3 to 82.3 random effects). These results must be interpreted with caution as an approximation from the summary statistics was used for the log transformation for the majority of trials. However, individual data were available for two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Conard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Conard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coope-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Coope 1975</LINK>) and the estimate from these two trials (% reduction 73.5, 95% CI 59.5 to 82.6, fixed effects) was in close agreement with the overall estimate. Again, the fixed effects analysis was substantially heterogeneous (Q = 50.11, df = 8, P &lt; 0.0001). No formal analysis of heterogeneity was performed as the approximation used for the log transformations may have contributed to this result.<BR/>
<BR/>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Baerug-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Baerug 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Notelovitz-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Notelovitz 2000a</LINK>) reported the effect of HT on the HFWWS (Comparisons 2.3, 2.4). Although heterogeneous, the results indicated a significant reduction for HT compared to placebo therapy (% reduction 78.8, 95% CI 17.3 to 94.6, random effects).</P>
<P>Data were available from seven trials for analysis of hot flush severity score as a continuous variable (Comparison 2.5). One of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Derman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Derman 1995</LINK>) employed a different severity scoring scale (0 to 12) instead of the four point scale (0 to 3) employed by the other studies. The standardised mean difference (SMD) is therefore the appropriate statistic for comparisons where this trial is included, otherwise, the weighted mean difference (WMD) is appropriate.</P>
<P>Data were available from eight trials for the present versus absent dichotomous split (Comparison 2.6.1) and for four trials for the moderate-severe versus mild-absent dichotomous split (Comparison 2.6.2) of the severity data. The moderate-severe versus mild-absent dichotomous split was imprecisely estimated as there were relatively low numbers of women with moderate-severe symptoms in three of the four studies. There was a significant reduction in hot flush severity for HT compared to placebo for each of these measures.</P>
<P>The use of the proportional odds model, as outlined in the Methods, enabled the combination of these results for an overall meta-analysis with 13 trials and a total of 1718 participants (Comparison 2.7). There was a significant reduction in vasomotor severity for HT compared to placebo as assessed by the proportional odds ratios (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.23, random effects), and the fixed effects analysis revealed substantial heterogeneity (Q = 68.48, df = 12, P &lt; 0.0001). This result for 13 trials is virtually identical to the result obtained for the dichotomous present versus absent data (Outcome 07, Sub-category 01) for eight trials (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.27, random effects).</P>
<P>Analysis of the sensitivity to individual trials by the method of <LINK REF="REF-Baujat-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baujat 1999</LINK> indicated that the <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> trial, which demonstrated the smallest (but highly significant) treatment effect, contributed substantially to both the odds ratio and heterogeneity in the fixed effects analysis. However, exclusion of this trial did not substantially change the estimate (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.18, random effects) and there was still evidence of some heterogeneity in the fixed effects analysis (Q = 19.41, df = 11, P = 0.05).</P>
<P>There are several distinguishing features of the <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> trial. It was by far the largest trial with a total of 846 participants, thereby contributing approximately half the participants to the overall analysis. It was one of only three trials analysed on an intention-to-treat basis, and used a dosage of 0.625 mg/day of conjugated equine oestrogens (with and without progestogen) which may be considered in the lower dosage range. It was also by far the longest study with data for 36 months duration of HT. Two trials in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-P-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen P 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marslew-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marslew 1992</LINK>) were of 24 months duration of HT and the remaining trials were of 12 months or less duration of HT. In this context, the authors of the <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> trial reported an apparent decrease in the size of the treatment effect (as assessed by covariate adjusted odds ratios) between 12 months and 36 months, the only outcome in this trial to do so. The participants in the <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> trial were all post-menopausal women (as were participants from the <LINK REF="STD-Chung-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-J-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen J 1983</LINK> trials; the remaining trials included a mixture of peri- and post-menopausal women) and were, on average, the oldest participants across all of the trials, a difference which would be compounded by the relatively long duration of the trial. Furthermore, women with severe vasomotor symptoms were specifically excluded from the trial.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis by meta-regression using therapy duration, allocation score and losses in turn as covariates indicated that these covariates were apparently significant in a fixed effects analysis, but not significant in a random effects analysis. This disparity was due to the <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> trial as there was no evidence of any effect of these covariates in either a fixed or random effects re-analysis after exclusion of this trial.</P>
<P>Overall, a highly significant benefit of HT compared to placebo was demonstrated for hot flush frequency and severity outcomes, although there was evidence of significant heterogeneity in the size of the treatment effect between trials. The results from trials included in this review, but with hot flush data unsuitable for the meta-analysis (Comparison 2.8), are consistent with this analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison 3: Any HT versus placebo: vasomotor outcomes at 3 months<BR/>
</B>In addition to the six trials with HT duration ending at three months (<LINK REF="STD-Conard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Conard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coope-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Coope 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baerug-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Baerug 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Notelovitz-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Notelovitz 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paterson-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Paterson 1982a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Symons-2000-Study-2" TYPE="STUDY">Symons 2000 Study 2</LINK>), data were available at three months from five additional trials of longer duration (<LINK REF="STD-Baumgardner-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Baumgardner 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blumel-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Blumel 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-J-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen J 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-P-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen P 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Symons-2000-Study-1" TYPE="STUDY">Symons 2000 Study 1</LINK>) resulting in a total of 1,289 participants. Not all trials reported all hot flush outcomes. The meta-analysis of three month data included hot flush frequency (Comparisons 3.1, 3.2), HFWWS (Comparisons 3.3, 3.4) hot flush severity (WMD, Comparison 3.5), odds ratios for the presence versus absence of hot flushes (Comparison 3.6.1) and moderate-severe versus present-absent (Comparison 3.6.2), and proportional odds ratios (Comparison 3.7, Table 02). These results at three months duration of HT are comparable to the overall results for all trials at end of study. This indicates that the benefit of HT therapy on hot flushes is evident at three months, and as noted earlier, the duration of therapy, with the possible exception of the 36 month <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> trial, does not appear to have contributed significantly to heterogeneity in the treatment effect as assessed over all the trials included in this review.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Comparison 4: Unopposed oestrogen (E only) versus placebo and oestrogen + progestogen (E + P) versus placebo for vasomotor outcomes<BR/>
</B>The most appropriate method to compare E-only and E+P therapies is a meta-analysis of direct "within studies" comparisons. This cannot be performed definitively in this review as we may have excluded appropriate studies through the placebo requirement. Between studies comparisons are difficult to interpret because other characteristics that differ between the studies may influence the results. Nevertheless, between studies comparisons were performed for E versus placebo and E+P versus placebo trials (Comparisons 4.1 to 4.7). For the <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> trial, the relevant treatment arms from the trial were included in both the E and E+P analysis.</P>
<P>For the hot flush frequency outcomes, there were data for three E-only trials and six E+P trials. The treatment effect for the reduction in weekly hot flush frequency was slightly greater for the E+P versus placebo analysis compared to the E only versus placebo analysis (Comparisons 4.1, 4.2), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.46). There was no evidence of heterogeneity between the three E only trials, but there was evidence of heterogeneity between the six E+P trials.</P>
<P>There were insufficient data for between studies (E versus placebo and E+P versus placebo) analyses for HFWWS (Comparisons 4.3, 4.4).</P>
<P>The analysis of hot flush severity included mean severity score (Comparison 4.5, one E only , six E+P), odds ratios for presence versus absence of hot flushes (Comparison 4.6.1, three E only, six E+P) and moderate-severe versus mild-absent hot flushes (Comparison 4.6.2, two E only, two E+P) and did not show clear differences. However, when all trials with severity data (four E only, ten E+P) were combined using proportional odds ratios (Comparison 4.7, Table 02), there was an apparent different in the size of the treatment effects between the E versus placebo and E+P versus placebo analyses because the confidence intervals for the two separate comparisons did not overlap. The estimate for the E+P versus placebo analysis was OR 0.10 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.19, random effects) compared to OR 0.35 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.56, random effects) for the E versus placebo analysis. While there was no evidence of heterogeneity between the four E only versus placebo trials (Q = 4.53, df = 3, P = 0.21), there was substantial heterogeneity between the ten E+P versus placebo trials (Q = 31.40, df = 9, P = 0.0003). Again the <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> trial was identified as contributing substantially to this heterogeneity. Removal of this trial (Table 02) did not appreciably alter the results but reduced the remaining heterogeneity. The remaining heterogeneity was so low that random effects models could not be estimated due to negative "between study" variance.</P>
<P>The apparent difference in the size of the treatment effect between E only versus placebo and E+P versus placebo trials must be interpreted with caution. Other "between trial" covariates that may have contributed to this apparent effect are the type of oestrogen (the E only versus placebo trials used predominantly conjugated equine oestrogen compared to the predominant use of oestradiol in the E+P versus placebo trials) and differences in participants (the four E only trials included surgical menopause women compared to only two of the ten E+P trials). Relative differences can only be truly assessed within trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison 5: Perimenopausal and post-menopausal women: any HT versus placebo (vasomotor outcomes)<BR/>
</B>It was not possible to compare the meta-analyses of HT versus placebo treatment effects for hot flush outcomes in trials with peri-menopausal women and trials with post-menopausal women as the majority of the trials included a mixture of peri- and post-menopausal women. However, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Baerug-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Baerug 1998</LINK>), in an apparently pre-planned analysis, grouped participants into peri- and post-menopausal for analysis of the hot flush weekly weighted score (Comparisons 5.3, 5.4). There was a greater absolute reduction in the HFWWS in the post-menopausal women (post-menopausal: WMD -70.1, 95% CI -76.2 to -64.0; peri-menopausal: WMD -35.5, 95%CI -41.8 to -29.2). However, back transformation of the log transformed data indicated comparable treatment effects when expressed as the percent reduction compared to placebo (post-menopausal: % reduction 88.6, 95% CI 86.9 to 90.0; peri-menopausal: % reduction 91.5, 95%CI 89.6 to 93.2).</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison 6: Other outcomes<BR/>
</B>There was an increased risk of withdrawals explicitly due to lack of effect for women randomised to placebo therapy compared to women randomised to placebo HT (Comparison 6.1: OR 10.51, 95% CI 5.00 to 22.09, random effects). <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1971</LINK> analysed prior data from participants who withdrew due to lack of effect and these women had more severe vasomotor symptoms than women who remained in the trial (P &lt; 0.001). In the <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> trial, approximately 11% of women randomised to placebo therapy had begun taking privately prescribed HT by the end of the trial. This bias in withdrawals due to lack of effect has potential to bias against an HT treatment effect and is a methodological problem with these trials which is difficult to address. Analysis of withdrawals due to any adverse events (Comparison 6.2) indicates a small, non-significantly increased risk for women randomised to HT compared to women randomised to placebo therapy (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.90, random effects). However, reasons for withdrawals from therapy were poorly reported and not fully ascertained. Consequently, these analyses may be subject to reporting and ascertainment bias.</P>
<P>While withdrawal from therapy due to adverse events was not significantly greater with HT therapy, HT was associated with a significantly increased risk in the occurrence of any adverse events (Comparison 6.3: OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.99, P = 0.05, random effects). Adverse events and side-effect data were, in general, anecdotally reported, and not suitable for meta-analysis. Summaries of these data for each trial are listed in Comparison 6.4. Recurrent reasons for withdrawals due to adverse events included breast tenderness, oedema, joint pain and nervous/psychiatric problems. The incidence of serious adverse events was apparently low. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Coope-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Coope 1981</LINK>) reported any participant mortality. Two deaths occurred in this study, one from recurrent gastric carcinoma and one from epileptic seizure and whether these deaths occurred in the HT or placebo phase of this cross-over trial was not reported. Thrombosis was apparently rare but was reported in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Coope-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Coope 1981</LINK> - one case, not clear if associated with HT; <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> - two cases, both on HT). Breast cancer was reported in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bech-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bech 1998</LINK> - two cases, both on HT; <LINK REF="STD-Hagen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 1982</LINK> - three cases, two in placebo group, one on HT; <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> - six cases, all on HT). In the <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> trial, four of the six cases of breast cancer were associated with the micronised progestogen combined HT treatment group.<BR/>Without meta-analysis it is difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions regarding side-effects. However, as expected, many trials reported withdrawal bleeding associated with combined HT, which was possibly associated with the menopausal status of the participants (<LINK REF="STD-Baerug-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Baerug 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coope-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Coope 1975</LINK>). Breast tenderness was also common and four studies reported a significant increase with HT compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Conard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Conard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bech-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bech 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hagen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK>) which was possibly associated with oestrogen dose (<LINK REF="STD-Archer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Archer 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1971</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one trial reported quality of life data (<LINK REF="STD-Bech-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bech 1998</LINK>, GHQ-11, Comparison 6.5). These results showed a small, non-significantly improved quality of life on HT therapy compared to placebo therapy. Quality of life was a secondary outcome in the <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> trial. These data have been requested and will be added to the review if and when it becomes available.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison 7: Comparison of end of study and baseline vasomotor outcomes for women randomised to placebo therapy<BR/>
</B>In Comparisons 7.1 to 7.5, vasomotor outcomes at baseline and end of study for women randomised to placebo therapy were analysed. These comparisons have ignored the fact that the comparisons are actually paired data (i.e. measured on the same participants), therefore the standard error for each within study comparison is likely to be overestimated, which will result in a conservative overall estimate.</P>
<P>There was a substantial, significant reduction in hot flush frequency and severity outcomes at end of study compared to baseline in women randomised to placebo therapy. For example, back transformation of the log transformed hot flush frequency data (Comparison 7.2) suggests that an approximate 58% reduction in the hot flush frequency for placebo therapy at end of study compared to baseline (% reduction 57.7, 95%CI 45.1 to 67.7, random effects) is characteristic of these trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison 8: Investigation of assumptions<BR/>
</B>The proportional odds assumption and the approximation used for estimation the log odds ratio (LOR) from summary statistics requires investigation. Full categorical (0 to 3 scale) severity data were available for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Conard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Conard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chung-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blumel-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Blumel 1994</LINK>) at both baseline and end of study with additional three month data (as well as end of study data) available for <LINK REF="STD-Blumel-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Blumel 1994</LINK>. There were a total of three baseline data sets and four treatment data sets for evaluation of both the proportional odds assumption and the odds ratio approximation used for estimating the odds ratio from the summary statistics (Comparison 8.1). There was no indication of lack of fit due to the proportional odds assumption, as estimated by the residual deviance from the logistic regression model (<LINK REF="REF-Whitehead-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehead 1999a</LINK>), in each of these data sets. The approximation to the log odds ratio (LOR) from the summary statistics was generally in close agreement with that derived by logistic regression from the categorical data. Therefore, the proportional odds assumption and its method of approximation from summary statistics, appear valid for these data.<BR/>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This was the first systematic review of the effect of HT on vasomotor symptoms. This update which adds three more trials reinforces but does not change the conclusion of the original review that HT is highly effective in the control of vasomotor symptoms. There were a large number of studies in the international literature on the topic. Due to the variety of modes of HT and the variable quality of the studies, it was decided to limit the review to the effect of oral HT versus placebo on hot flushes and night sweats in well conducted, double-blind, randomised trials of at least three months duration prior to any cross-over of therapies. There also had to be no confounding from concurrent therapies in the experimental protocol. These criteria eliminated many otherwise well conducted studies that lacked, for instance, a placebo group or where therapy continued for less than three months. The quality of the included studies was generally high in regard to concealment of treatment allocation, outcome assessment and baseline equality. However, several included studies had a greater then 10% loss to follow- up, and the majority of studies did not analyse the data on an intention-to-treat basis. Failure to conduct an intention-to-treat analysis has the potential to underestimate the treatment effect if there are more withdrawals from the placebo group due to a perceived failure to alleviate vasomotor symptoms. Similarly, this methodological weakness may also underestimate the number of side-effects if these were the reasons for withdrawal in the participants not followed up.</P>
<P>Overall the withdrawal rate was relatively low. When withdrawals were documented as due to lack of therapeutic effect, they were more common in the placebo group (Comparison 6.1). This was the case in both the meta-analysis of all the trials with such data and in the three trials with intention-to-treat . Withdrawals due to adverse events were more common in the HT group and reached significance in the PEPI trial where intention-to-treat analysis was performed.</P>
<P>An approximate 58% reduction in hot flush frequency between baseline and end of study was observed in women randomised to placebo therapy in the trials included in this review. This reduction may be due to a variety of reasons including fluctuating endogenous oestrogen levels and symptoms during the perimenopause, a natural decline in symptoms over time postmenopausally, relief of anxiety over symptoms due to counseling received during the course of the trial, or systematic differences in the self-recording of symptoms over time. These data illustrate the importance of blinded trials which include a placebo or reference treatment group for evaluation of therapy for vasomotor symptoms. Thus, it is very important for the effect of HT or any other therapeutic modality prescribed for vasomotor symptoms to be assessed in a blinded manner against a placebo or reference therapy lest a false impression of efficacy be claimed. Claims of around a 50% effectiveness in the reduction of hot flushes from baseline may be seen in uncontrolled studies for therapies such as phytoestrogens (<LINK REF="REF-Nachtigall-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nachtigall 1999</LINK>). Such degrees of effect are not better than the placebo effect commonly seen in rigorous double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trials assessing these outcomes.</P>
<P>This review shows that oral HT is highly effective in alleviating hot flushes and night sweats compared to placebo. The results were analysed for "end of study" data (ranging from three months to three years) and for three months HT only and these results were comparable. All studies were consistent in showing benefit of HT compared to placebo for vasomotor symptoms, but there was evidence of heterogeneity indicating differences in the size of the effect between studies. For example, for the hot flush severity analysis for the thirteen trials with severity data, there was substantial heterogeneity. The<LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> trial, which contributed 37.5% to the total weight of the analysis for the end of study data (Comparison 2.8), contributed substantially to this heterogeneity. The <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> trial showed a significant reduction in vasomotor symptoms (OR = 0.42), but this was of a smaller magnitude compared to the effect seen in the other combined trials (OR = 0.12). Reasons why the treatment effect was apparently less in the <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> trial may be possibly related to the older participants and/or the longer duration of the trial. Women with severe vasomotor symptoms were specifically excluded from the <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> trial, and the participants (with a mean age at baseline of 56 years) were older than the mean age of participants of other trials at baseline. The PEPI study was also by far the longest duration trial (three years) which, in an end of study analysis, would compound this age difference. This age difference may be important as vasomotor symptoms are primarily a feature of the early post-menopausal years and generally disappear over time. </P>
<P>There is potential for publication bias due to selective reporting of vasomotor symptoms in this meta-analysis as nine trials reporting no vasomotor outcomes were excluded from this review. However, the extent of such publication bias is impossible to assess. The clinical effect of HT is broad, not only in relation to the alleviation of symptoms at menopause (of which vasomotor symptoms are only a part), but in relation to other outcomes such as the effect on the endometrium, bowel and breast, bone metabolism, cardiovascular disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, cognitive function and dementia. The methodologies of all trials were scrutinised carefully for any indication of whether vasomotor symptoms were recorded. Only the large, well funded trials can attempt to assess a broad range of outcomes and it is expected that there are a considerable number of trials which have not addressed vasomotor symptoms. Of the two large trials considered for inclusion in this review, vasomotor data were obtained from the <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> trial, and the authors of the <LINK REF="STD-CHART-1996" TYPE="STUDY">CHART 1996</LINK> study confirmed that vasomotor outcomes were not recorded in that trial. The largest trial of HT, WHI, excluded women with prevalent vasomotor symptoms at entry and although menopausal symptoms were recorded in a small minority, this was not a suitable trial to assess the effect of HT on vasomotor symptoms.
<BR/>

<BR/>Comparing the size of effect in trials that only used combined oestrogen plus progestogen HT versus placebo with trials that only used oestrogen versus placebo has obvious limitations due to possible inter-trial differences in regard to populations, protocols etc. However, an apparently significant trend was seen for combined HT to have a greater effect than oestrogen alone for hot flush severity. When all trials, including PEPI, were combined for severity data (Comparison 4.7), the estimate for oestrogen only therapies versus placebo was OR 0.35 (95% CI 0.22, 0.56) and for combined HT versus placebo, the estimate was OR 0.10 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.19). There was a similar trend in the hot flush frequency analysis, which contained fewer trials, which was not statistically significant (Comparisons 4.1,4.2). These data are suggestive of an additive ameliorative effect on hot flush severity when progestogen is added to oestrogen, but is not conclusive. The most appropriate analysis for comparison of oestrogen alone to combined oestrogen and progestogen therapy is direct, within trial comparisons. Such an analysis could not be performed for this review as we may have excluded informative studies through the placebo requirement. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dennerstein-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Dennerstein 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK>) in this review did include all three arms in the one trial. The <LINK REF="STD-Dennerstein-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Dennerstein 1978</LINK> trial reported no statistically significant difference between the oestrogen alone and combined oestrogen and progestogen arms for hot flush frequency. The <LINK REF="STD-PEPI-1998" TYPE="STUDY">PEPI 1998</LINK> trial data suggested some increase in effectiveness of combined HT versus placebo (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.58) over oestrogen alone versus placebo (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.89), for hot flush severity, but a direct comparison of combined HT versus oestrogen only HT did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.085). The frequency of hot flushes was not assessed in this trial. A separate review is required to examine the relative effectiveness of combined oestrogen and progestogen compared to oestrogen alone.</P>
<P>The oestrogens used in the trials were varied. Twenty trials used oestradiol and nine used conjugated equine oestrogens and ethinyl oestradiol, Mestranol, Quinestrol and piperazine oestrone sulphate were all used at least once in separate trials. Assessment of different oestrogen types and dosages is most appropriately obtained from a meta-analysis of appropriate "within studies" comparisons. The protocol of this review included only placebo-controlled studies and there are separate studies in the literature which compare different oestrogen dosages but do not have a placebo control. A separate review could examine the minimum, clinically effective dose of each oestrogen. However, in clinical practice, each woman absorbs oral oestrogen differently (<LINK REF="REF-Helton-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helton 1977</LINK>) and has an individual response to oestrogen such that it is important to use a flexible regimen to find the individual's ideal dose that keeps her between menopausal symptoms and oestrogenic side-effects such as sore breasts or nausea. In clinical practice, younger women in general need higher doses for symptomatic relief than older women and an empirical starting dose can be selected on this basis and varied with the clinical response. Clinical trials of fixed regimens are usually not ideal regimens in clinical practice as flexibility and individualisation of therapy is required to achieve the best clinical response and the greatest chances of adherence to therapy. The optimal dose found in a trial population may not be the optimal dose for an individual and tailoring of hormone replacement regimens and doses is likely to give a better balance between symptoms and side-effects.</P>
<P>The progestogens used in the trials in this review were norethisterone, norethisterone acetate, levonorgestrel, nomogestrol acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, cyproterone acetate and micronized progesterone. As with comparisons of oestrogens and oestrogen doses, evaluation of the effect of different types, doses and modes of progestogen therapy on vasomotor symptoms would be best estimated in a separate review with trials selected specifically to address these questions.<BR/>
<BR/>Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Baerug-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Baerug 1998</LINK>) grouped participants as peri-menopausal or post-menopausal. There were more symptoms in the recently post-menopausal women as assessed by the hot flush weekly weighted score. However, there was no apparent difference in the HT treatment effect when analysed as the percentage reduction relative to the placebo group between peri- and post-menopausal women. Many trials included both peri- and post-menopausal women but did not analyse for this variable. There were insufficient data overall to ascertain whether HT had any greater or lesser effect on vasomotor symptoms before or after menopause.</P>
<P>There were data on quality of life assessment in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bech-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bech 1998</LINK>). These data showed a small, non-significantly improved quality of life on HT compared to placebo therapy. </P>
<P>The description of possible side-effects and adverse events in the trials assessed was inconsistently reported and often not expressed numerically to allow meta-analysis of these events. The data and descriptions available have been summarised in Comparison 6.4. The incidence of any adverse events was significantly higher (Comparison 6.3), and rates of withdrawal from therapy due to adverse events were marginally, but not significantly, higher for women randomised to HT compared to women randomised to placebo therapy (Comparison 6.2). Uterine bleeding in women on continuous combined HT, nausea and breast tenderness were the commonest reported side-effects. This has been reported further in a recent Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Lethaby-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lethaby 2004</LINK>). With the exception of uterine bleeding in women on continuous combined HT regimens, most studies reported a low prevalence of side-effects. Clinical practice and other trials (<LINK REF="REF-MacLennan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLennan 1993</LINK>) with continuous combined HT show that initial bleeding or spotting is very common but mostly disappears after several months. Headaches were not clearly influenced by HT with some studies reporting a reduction in baseline headaches with HT but a small increase in women on HT who had no headaches at baseline. Headaches as a potential menopausal symptom and the effect of HT on headaches and migraine deserves a formal systematic review of its own where trials have defined this symptom at entry and as an outcome. Similarly, weight gain or loss on HT has been the topic of a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Norman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 1999</LINK>) and no change in weight or body mass index compared to placebo therapy was seen in trials where this was a measured outcome. Other reported side-effects and serious adverse events in placebo and treatment groups were reported rarely without any apparent preponderance in either group. Nausea and sore breasts are often described as a start up symptom especially in older women taking HT for the first time. In clinical practice, where these symptoms persist, HT dosages are usually reduced to try to eliminate these side-effects. An artificial aspect of most clinical trials is that during the trial, the dose of HT is fixed. Thus there may be more withdrawals from therapy due to side-effects than might happen if tailoring of the dose to the individual was allowed. The incidence of rarer, more serious side effects such as breast cancer and stroke have recently been reported for the combined HT and oestrogen only arms of WHI (<LINK REF="REF-WHI-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHI 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHI-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHI 2004</LINK>). It is important to differentiate between the global index of major adverse outcomes under age 60, when most HT is used and the higher incidence of these morbidities seen when HT was initiated in the older age groups of WHI.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>HT is a highly effective therapy for the treatment of hot flushes and night sweats and its effect was sustained in trials of three months to three years duration. Apart from bleeding on combined continuous HT, side-effects were not commonly reported. There were no reports of serious adverse events during these short term trials. The effectiveness and short term safety of oral HT for the alleviation of hot flushes and night sweats appears to be well established in trials performed to date in symptomatic women around menopause. Longer term safety has been addressed in other trials (<LINK REF="REF-WHI-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHI 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHI-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHI 2004</LINK>), and this may be an issue for women wanting to take HT for longer periods to control symptoms. It is beyond the scope of this review to differentiate between oral HT products, combinations, doses or regimens.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More research is not necessary to confirm the efficacy of oestrogen or combined oestrogen and progestogen in ameliorating hot flushes and night sweats. The effect is very strong. However, further research is merited on the lowest effective doses of HT and whether combinations of low dose oestrogen and progestogens may achieve the equivalent effect of a higher dose of oestrogen when used alone. Although it may be difficult to define equipotency between different oestrogens and progestogens, trials of product versus product and regimen versus regimen would also be helpful to detect any clinical differences, advantages and disadvantages. It would be helpful if such trials used a validated symptom scoring system and methods of describing frequency and severity were standardised and combined into one numerical score. Such trials should carefully monitor reasons for withdrawal for the study and intention-to-treat analysis should be conducted. In time, similar systematic reviews of the effect of HT on other putative menopausal symptoms should be performed e.g. psychological, locomotor and urogenital symptoms, such as a recent Cochrane review which has examined the use of local oestrogen for vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Suckling-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suckling 2004</LINK>). The effect of other routes of HT e.g. transdermal and other menopausal therapies e.g. tibolone, also require such reviews.</P>

<P>In addition to vasomotor symptoms and the Kupperman's Index, the paper by Bech 1998 also reported on psychometric measures such as the Beck Depression Inventory and General Health Questionnaire. The study by Obel 1993 is apparently the same study but reports on biochemical parameters such as FHS, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and serum E2 over a longer (2 year as opposed to 12 months) follow up.</P>

<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>This study was part of a larger study with primary outcomes relating to bone loss. Participants were recruited from a population base and inclusion criteria did not include menopause symptoms. The Jensen 1983 reference reports the results of four studies in which participants overlapped in sequential studies. Only Study I and Study II were eligible for inclusion in this review (Study III had no HRT therapy and Study IV participants had received HRT within 1 month). The Study II participants were the placebo group from Study I. According to the review protocol, only one such study is eligible for inclusion in the review and as vasomotor outcome data was only available for Study II, this was selected for inclusion. Study II was apparently the same study as reported by Christensen 1982. There were some discrepancies between the two papers in terms of the number of patients initially randomised, and subsequently, losses to follow up. The data from Christensen 1982 was used in this instance as this paper contained more detailed information. Neither of the studies contained a clear reference to the study being double blinded although this was inferred.Attempts were made to contact the author(s) but no response was obtained.</P>

Other outcomes included climacteric symptoms, effects on bone, calcium and lipid metabolism, bleeding and adverse effects attributable to progestogen. There was a third treatment group (HRT) in the primary reference which was excluded from this review as it was apparently not double blinded (the tablets were different to the placebo group).

</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>The participants in this study were selected for vasomotor symptoms. The majority of participants had been treated with HRT prior to the study commencement and therefore the study design included an initial 8 week placebo "wash-out" phase for all women. There was a high withdrawal rate from therapy in the placebo group attributed to lack of symptom control. Analysis confirmed that the women who withdrew from the placebo group had more severe hot flushes at baseline than those who remained, introducing a bias against the treatment effect. Attempts to contact the author were unsuccessful.</P>
