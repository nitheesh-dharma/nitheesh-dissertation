<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-01-28 12:00:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Drug dependent heroin users are preoccupied with the desire to obtain and take heroin and so have persistent drug-seeking behaviours. Those with a long history of treatment attempts and failures may benefit from the provision of heroin and flexible doses of methadone in a maintenance program. When accepted, this treatment may help them to remain in treatment, limit the use of street drugs, reduce illegal activities and possibly reduce mortality. The authors of the review identified eight randomised studies involving 2007 adult patients with a history of previous treatment failures in outpatient settings. The heroin users on the programs were requested to attend the clinic to receive and inject prescribed heroin from two to three times a day. Adverse events were consistently more frequent in the heroin groups. The trialists recommend that the treatment should be properly established so that necessary intensive care can be provided in an emergency. According with the current evidence, heroin prescription should be indicated to people who is currently or have previously failed maintenance treatment, and it should be provided in clinical settings where proper follow-up is ensured.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-01 14:59:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight studies involving 2007 patients met the inclusion criteria. Five studies compared supervised injected heroin plus flexible dosages of methadone treatment to oral methadone only and showed that heroin helps patients to remain in treatment (valid data from 4 studies, N=1388 Risk Ratio 1.44 (95%CI 1.19-1.75) heterogeneity P=0.03), and to reduce use of illicit drugs. Maintenance with supervised injected heroin has a not statistically significant protective effect on mortality (4 studies, N=1477 Risk Ratio 0.65 (95% CI 0.25-1.69) heterogeneity P=0.89), but it exposes at a greater risk of adverse events related to study medication (3 studies N=373 Risk Ratio 13.50 (95% CI 2.55-71.53) heterogeneity P=0.52). Results on criminal activity and incarceration were not possible to be pooled but where the outcome were measured results of single studies do provide evidence that heroin provision can reduce criminal activity and incarceration/imprisonment. Social functioning improved in all the intervention groups with heroin groups having slightly better results. If all the studies comparing heroin provision in any conditions vs any other treatment are pooled the direction of effect remain in favour of heroin.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-05-06 13:36:46 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available evidence suggests an added value of heroin prescribed alongside flexible doses of methadone for long-term, treatment refractory, opioid users, to reach a decrease in the use of illicit substances, involvement in criminal activity and incarceration, a possible reduction in mortaliity; and an increase in retention in treatment. Due to the higher rate of serious adverse events, heroin prescription should remain a treatment for people who are currently or have in the past failed maintenance treatment, and it should be provided in clinical settings where proper follow-up is ensured.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-06 13:59:57 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-05-06 13:59:57 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Substance dependence continues to be a major clinical and social problem affecting millions of people worldwide and causing substantial costs to society.<BR/>Drug dependence has been described by the World Health Organization as "a cluster of physiological, behavioural and cognitive phenomena of variable intensity, in which the use of a psychoactive drug (or drugs) takes on a high priority. The necessary descriptive characteristics are preoccupation with a desire to obtain and take the drug and persistent drug-seeking behaviour. Determinants and the problematic consequences of drug dependence may be biological, physiological or social, and usually interact." (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Heroin is a opioid. Opioids include natural opioids (e.g. morphine), semisynthetics (e.g. heroin), and synthetics with morphine-like action (e.g. codeine, hydromorphone, methadone, oxycodone, meperidine, fentanyl) (<LINK REF="REF-DSM_x002d_IV-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM-IV 1994</LINK>). Opioids are prescribed as analgesics, anaesthetics, antidiarrhoeal agents, or cough suppressants (<LINK REF="REF-Katzung-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katzung 1999</LINK>). Heroin is one of the most commonly abused drugs of this class and may be smoked, snorted or injected (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2010-a" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2010 a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Heroin is abused in many countries. The UNODC estimates the total number of opiates users at the global level between 15.2-21.1 million people (<LINK REF="REF-UNODC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNODC 2007</LINK>). More than half of the world&#8217;s opiates using population are thought to live in Asia. The highest levels of use (in terms of the proportion of the population aged 15-64 years) are found along the main drug trafficking routes out of Afghanistan.</P>
<P>Trends in use appear to indicate a stabilisation of the overall number of heroin users in Europe, but recent data on drug induced deaths are mostly associated with opioid use (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2009</LINK>). The largest heroin using population in the Americas is found in the USA where approximately 1.2 million heroin users (0.6% of the population aged 15-64) have been estimated (<LINK REF="REF-UNODC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNODC 2010</LINK>) stable since 2002.</P>
<P>The pattern of use described in the USA and in Europe seems to indicate a preference for intravenous use by the elder population of heroin users. Heroin injectors are becoming a largely ageing population with serious health, social and psychiatric problems (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2010-b" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2010 b</LINK>). In The Netherlands and in Andalucia, Spain, a prevalence of heroin inhaling users by "chasing the dragon" was reported (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Brink-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Brink 1999</LINK>). This practice foresees that the heroin is heated on tinfoil and the vapours are inhaled (<LINK REF="REF-Weil-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weil 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dependent heroin users are characterised by the persistence of use in spite of the difficulties they experience with health, law, social achievements and personal relationships (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1999</LINK>). Those who seek treatment may have been using heroin for decades (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hser-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hser 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Brink-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Brink 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1999</LINK>), experiencing a number of criminal offences, heroin overdoses, and attempts and failures of detoxification.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-07-07 09:17:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is well recognised that heroin dependence should be treated as a chronic condition. The course and response to medications and the potential heritability suggest that people who are drug dependent would benefit from patterns of treatment similar to those provided to chronic patients, with continuing care and monitoring over time (<LINK REF="REF-McLellan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLellan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Along with prevention, treatment is essential for reducing problems related to heroin dependence. The ultimate goal of interventions is the full reintegration into society of people affected by dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Bammer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bammer 1999</LINK>), regardless of the intermediate achievements which may differ substantially (<LINK REF="REF-Davoli-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davoli 2000</LINK>). The types of available interventions can be divided into the following main categories:</P>
<UL>
<LI>emergency (for overdoses);</LI>
<LI>detoxification (to reach a drug free condition in a short period);</LI>
<LI>maintenance (to reduces illicit drug use, criminal offences and to improve health and social behaviour) (Farrell 1998; Ward 1999);</LI>
<LI>rehabilitation (to achieve the reintegration into the social community).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The present review will consider maintenance treatment, in which the patients enter programs of heroin administration to achieve stabilisation.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-12-22 12:43:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The first experiences with the prescription of heroin were in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="STD-Metrebian-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Metrebian 1998</LINK>). In 1926, the Rolleston Committee (<LINK REF="REF-Strang-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strang 1994</LINK>) supported the role of physicians in the prescription of opiates in the management of chronic opioid dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Rolleston-1926" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolleston 1926</LINK>). However, in the 1960s, the population of heroin users rapidly increased, and the black market for pharmaceutical heroin grew rapidly and some restrictions were introduced (<LINK REF="STD-Hartnoll-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hartnoll 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>After the clinical trials conducted in Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, a debate arose (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Venning-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venning 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wodak-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wodak 1998</LINK>) about the opportunity to introduce the heroin treatment for heroin users.</P>
<P>Some researchers have argued that more resources should be devoted to the consolidation of treatment for which more reliable evidence is already available, such as methadone (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 1998</LINK>). The general debate has focused on some crucial points: do not offer heroin prescription instead of or at the expense of methadone maintenance, do not prescribe heroin to young users or people with a short history of heroin dependence, do not prescribe heroin as a first choice treatment and minimise the possibility that prescribed heroin will leak into illicit market (<LINK REF="REF-Hartnoll-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartnoll 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>By the time this review was first published (2003), authorization for heroin trials were obtained in Spain, Germany and Canada while Denmark and Luxembourg were considering the implementation of similar trials. The update of the present review integrate the results with the German trial, the British, the Spanish and the Canadian trials.</P>
<P>The most recent studies were aimed at assessing the provision of supervised self administration of heroin as a treatment for those patients who are severely dependent on heroin and did not show improvement with other treatment options.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-05-09 12:17:35 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>The risk of bias assessment  for RCTs and CCTs in this review was performed using the 5 criteria recommended by the Cochrane Handbbok (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). The recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane Review is a two-part tool, addressing five specific domains (namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting). The first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement, in terms of "low ", "high" or unclear, relating to the risk of bias for that entry. To make these judgments we will use the criteria indicated by the handbook adapted to  the addiction field. <I>See</I> <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK> for details.</P>
<P>The domains of sequence generation and  allocation concealment (avoidance of selection bias) was addressed in the tool by a single entry for each study.</P>
<P>Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessor (avoidance of performance bias and detection bias) was considered separately for objective outcomes (drop out, use of substance of abuse measured by urine-analysis, subjects relapsed at the end of follow up, subjects engaged in further treatments) and subjective outcomes (duration and severity of signs and symptoms of withdrawal, including patient self-rating, side effects, social functioning as integration at school or at work, family relationship).</P>
<P>Incomplete outcome data (avoidance of attrition bias) was considered for all outcomes except for the drop out from the treatment, which is very often the primary outcome measure in trials on addiction. It have been assessed separately for results at the end of the study period and for results at follow up.</P>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the internal validity of the included studies. Any disagreement between the review authors was resolved by discussion, including input from a third independent reviewer if required. Risk of bias assessment was not blinded to trial authors, institutions or journals.</P>

<P>Three of the included studies were multiple arms studies: 1. CCBH (B) had a third arm in which patients were provided methadone only for the first six months and then they were switched to methadone plus inhaled heroin, and this arm was excluded by the meta-analysis after an assessment of its contribution to the overall available information. 2. Haasen 2007 is a factorial randomised controlled trial in which the patiens in the heroin + methadone group and in the methadone only group were then provided either with education or with case management. We enclosed in the meta-analysis the comparison between the two main arms: heroin plus methadone and methadone only . 3. RIOTT 2010 compared heroin+ methadone with oral methadone and injected methadone with oral methadone.We used the first comparison arms (supervised injectable heroin plus methadone vs oral methadone) only.</P>

<B>Setting</B>
</P>
<P>In all the enclosed studies treatment was provided in outpatients setting. In seven studies the provision of heroin was supervised and patients were observed before injecting and up to 30 minutes after self injection.</P>
<P>
<B>Countries where the studies were conducted</B>
</P>
<P>The oldest and the most recent study were conducted in the United Kingdom (respectively in 1972-75 and in 2004-8), one study was conducted in Switzerland 1995-96, two in the Netherlands 1998-2001 and one in Germany in 2002-2004. One study was conducted in Canada in 2005-2008 and one in Spain 2003-2004.</P>
<P>
<B>Duration of the trials</B>
</P>
<P>The period of participants inclusion in the trials ranged from 6 to 24 months.</P>
<P>The Swiss study (<LINK REF="STD-Perneger-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Perneger 1998</LINK>) and the recent British study (<LINK REF="STD-RIOTT-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RIOTT 2010</LINK>) provided treatment for participants for 6 months.The older British (<LINK REF="STD-Hartnoll-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hartnoll 1980</LINK>) , the Dutch (<LINK REF="STD-CCBH-_x0028_A_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CCBH (A) 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-CCBH-_x0028_B_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CCBH (B) 2002</LINK>), the Spanish (<LINK REF="STD-PEPSA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">PEPSA 2006</LINK>) and the Canadian (<LINK REF="STD-NAOMI-2009" TYPE="STUDY">NAOMI 2009</LINK>) studies provided treatment for participants for 12 months, the German study (<LINK REF="STD-Haasen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Haasen 2007</LINK>) for 12 months in the first phase followed by another 12 months. The first phase of 12 months was a stratified into 4 x 2 randomised control groups comparing heroin (plus availability of methadone at night) treatment to methadone only treatment in similar settings.The subsequent phase 2 consisted of a follow-up study to monitor long term effects of the treatment and integration into drug addiction services. All patients in the experimental group were provided treatment in phase 2 of the study and only a randomly selected group of the control patients, were offered the vacant heroin treatment places after 12 months of treatment. According to the scope of the present review, only the first 12 month phase results will be considered in the result section.</P>
<P>
<B>Participants</B>
</P>
<P>To be enrolled in the studies participants needed to be resident in the area of the treatment centres for at least two years (but in some studies duration was not specified), they had to be daily heroin users (for the past 2 to 6 years). Age for enrolment was minimum 18 years (1 study) up to 25 years or older (1 study). In all the studies participants qualified for inclusion if they had a history of previous treatment failures. The Dutch study also included patients who had been prescribed "effective dose methadone" for at least four consecutive weeks in the past five years and had been in regular contact with a methadone maintenance program in the preceding six months.The German study also included patients who have not been in treatment in the previous 6 months. In the RIOTT study the patients, were enrolled in the study if despite receiving conventional oral maintenance treatment (at least 6 months), continued to inject illicit heroin regularly (50% days in preceding 3 months). Exclusion criteria, where specified, were having severe psychiatric disorders, having a pending jail sentence, those who had been abstinent for 2 or more months in the past 12 months and those with a severe physical disorder such as renal or hepatic failure, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias, chronic obstructive pulmonary problems, or being pregnant or breast-feeding women.</P>

<B>2.Relapse to street heroin use</B> (number and proportion of people who self reported use of heroin during the study for each arm)</P>
<P>The majority of the studies measured the reduction in illicit drug use, and we therefore renamed this outcome accordingly (see section changes from protocol). The diversity of the criteria adopted at study level to measure this outcome made the meta-analysis debatable and it was therefore decided to report the results for each individual study.</P>
<P>Each study found a superior reduction in illicit drug use in the heroin arm rather than in the methadone arm. This reduction is measured in different ways and the measures of effect obtained are consistently statistically significant.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison 1, supervised injectable heroin plus flexible dose of methadone vs oral methadone maintenance</B>:</P>
<P>RIOTT defined a reduction of regular use of street heroin as "50% or more of negative specimens on urinalysis during weeks 14&#8211;26". The intention to treat analysis found that more patients in the injectable heroin arm were responders than in the oral methadone respectively 31/43 (72%) and 11/42 (27%) OR 7.42, 95% CI 2.69-20.46.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-NAOMI-2009" TYPE="STUDY">NAOMI 2009</LINK> the reduction in illicit-drug use (or other illegal activities) was the second primary outcome and it was measured with the European Addiction Severity Index. Patients were responders at 12 months if they had an improvement of at least 20% from the baseline score for illicit-drug use or legal status (or both). The reduction in rates of illicit-drug use or other illegal activity was 67.0% in the diacetylmorphine group and 47.7% in the methadone group (rate ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.77; P = 0.004). Personal communication with the principal investigator of the study brought to our attention that use of street heroin in at least one day in the month preceding the 12 month assessment occurred in 54/115 patients in the dyacetilmorphine arm and 79/111 patients in the methadone arm producing a protective effect for heroin prescription RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.53-0.83).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Haasen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Haasen 2007</LINK> reduction in illegal drug use was the second primary outcome and people were considered responders if they showed a reduction in the use of street heroin with at least 3 of 5 urine samples negative for the drug in the month prior to the 12-month assessment and no increase in cocaine use (hair analysis) with predefined methods to deal with missing data. Were responders 356 patients in the heroin arm (69.1%) and 276 patients ( 55.2%) in the methadone arm with a OR 1.85 (95% CI 1.43-2.40). The authors adjusted the analysis for target group, study centre and type of psychosocial care and the effect of heroin provision remained significant OR 1.91 ( CI 95%1.30&#8211;2.79).</P>

The dimensions were measured with the Maudsley addiction profile (MAP-HSS), the symptom checklist (SCL-90) and self reported data on cocaine consumption were validated against urinalysis . The authors provided unpublished data about heroin consumption (mean days of illicit heroin use during the 30 days before baseline and 12 month assessment) and the mean difference was significantly in favour of injected heroin arm (Mean Difference -12.96 (CI 95%-16.32 to -9.6)).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-05-09 12:33:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Heroin provision has been studied during the last thirty years in several European countries and in Canada. Even though all the studies have acceptable methods, the most recently published studies have more rigorous methodologies, especially considering the availability of study protocols, which allow the assessment of possible selection and reporting bias.</P>
<P>Each of the studies provided some unique piece of information. The German study obtained a considerable number of patients included, and the study from the UK compared heroin provision with a optimised dose of oral methadone clarifying the doubts about methadone dosages provided in the comparison arms in some of the previous studies. In fact, the &gt;=80-180 mg dosages reported in <LINK REF="STD-RIOTT-2010" TYPE="STUDY">RIOTT 2010</LINK> and the PEPSA study (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) include those recommended in the recent evidence-based guidelines (WHO 2009).</P>
<P>The available results showed statistically significant positive effects of supervised injectable heroin plus flexible dosages of methadone in retention in treatment and reduction of illicit drug use, criminal offence and incarceration. A non statistically significant protective effect on mortality was also observed.</P>
<P>This intervention is intended to offer an alternative to those patients that have failed methadone maintenance treatments. Patients are required to attend the clinic to receive and inject the prescribed heroin between 2 to 3 times per day and this might hinder social reintegration and family life, which were supposed to be improved by participating in the treatment.</P>
<P>All the authors of the studies highlight the risks of adverse events that warrant the provision of heroin only to patients that clearly had failed methadone treatment and only in centres that are equipped to respond to emergencies.</P>
<P>Drug addiction has been widely accepted as a chronic medical illness, such as hypertension and diabetes, for which adherence and ultimately outcome are poorest by definition in particular among patients with low socioeconomic status, lack of family and social support. Poverty, lack of family support, and psychiatric comorbidity were described as major predictors of noncompliance and relapse across all the chronic illnesses mentioned.</P>
<P>It remains therefore necessary to identify the definition of treatment failure, which could form the basis for indication to heroin prescription.</P>
<P>Besides, as in all the countries (at different level) the resources for treatment are limited, the open question is wether it is advisable to allocate patients to the provision of more expensive medications instead of trying to address more effectively the identified health and social predictors of non-compliance and relapse. Nevertheless some specific publications are available to expand the assessment of cost utility of heroin provision (<LINK REF="REF-Dijkgraaf-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dijkgraaf 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gutzwiller-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutzwiller 2000</LINK>) and other publications are expected as complementary analysis of the existing studies. A meta-analysis of the relevant results will contribute to a clearer picture of the cost-utility of such an intervention.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-06 15:06:45 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Supervised injected heroin plus flexible dosages of methadone treatment compared to oral methadone only</B> helps patients to remain in treatment (4 studies, N=1388 Risk Ratio 1.44 (95%CI 1.19-1.75)), and helps patients to reduce use of illicit drugs. It also have a not statistically significant protective effects on mortality (4 studies, N=1477 Risk Ratio 0.65 (95% CI 0.25-1.69)), but it exposes at a greater risk of adverse events related to study medication (3 studies N=373 RR=14.42 95% CI 2.74-75.95). Heroin provision can also have a protective effect for criminal activity and incarceration/imprisonement. Social functioning improved in all the interventions group with heroin groups having slightly better results, although it is difficult to assess this type of outcome in the relatively short timeframe of an experimental study.</P>
<P>
<B>Heroin provision in any conditions vs any other treatment. </B>When considering altoghether the studies comparing heroin provision in any route of administration to other treatments they reach the same effects of those on supervised injected heroin vs oral methadone, but the measures of effects are slightly lower.

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-05-06 15:07:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies included in the present review answer the main questions posed by this review. They were carried out in different countries and in some cases in multi-site centres. The characteristics of patients that would most benefit from this intervention (more than from the methadone maintenance) might be better clarified.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-01-28 15:54:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall the risk of bias in the included studies appears sufficiently reduced.The number of participants enrolled in the 8 considered studies range from 50 to 1000. The results are consistent across studies. The most recent studies, thanks to the publication of the protocols, provide full information about the process of enrolling patients and randomly assigning them to the intervention arms. For the study conducted in the Netherlands the existence of stricter disciplinary discharge rules in the heroin group was argued as a reason for biasing the results about retention in treatment. ("Altogether 11% of patients were removed from the program as a result of repeated violations of the house rules, or were not able to visit the program anymore due to incarceration. In the control condition, on the other hand, patients had no alternative, because methadone maintenance treatment was already their last treatment option" <LINK REF="STD-CCBH-_x0028_A_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CCBH (A) 2002</LINK>).<BR/>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-01-28 15:56:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The present review has been updated three times over nine years. It is likely that all the relevant available studies have been enclosed. Most of the studies adopted composite outcomes and measured them with standardised questionnaires, reporting the scoring as continuous variables. Individual patient data might be obtained from the most recent studies and a deeper analysis could be performed.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-05-06 15:08:57 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As far as we know there are not at the moment other systematic meta-analyses on this topic. A review on substitution treatment for reducing criminal activities among drug users (<LINK REF="REF-Egli-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egli 2009</LINK>) found positive effect of heroin provision. A project is being undertaken by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in collaboration with the National Addiction Centre. The project entitled "Heroin (diacetylmorphine) assisted treatment: evidence and current practices in Europe and beyond" will integrate the results of this review with information from observational data. A recent publication about a sub-analysis of the results from the German study assessed this intervention for patients that were seriously addicted to heroin but had not undergone previous methadone treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Haasen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haasen 2010</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-01-06 19:07:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Heroin provision provides added value to methadone treatment. Considering the higher rate of serious adverse events, the eventual risk-benefit balance of heroin prescription should be carefully evaluated before its implementation in clinical practice. Heroin prescription should be considered for people who have failed maintenance treatment and it should be provided in clinical settings where proper follow-up is ensured. The capacity of addiction services and the economical sustainability should be carefully assessed before undertaking such an intervention.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-05-09 12:17:36 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>As heroin provision is now currently provided in several countries, studies based on data collected at treatment centres level could provide valuable information on the effectiveness of this approach in real-world conditions. </P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>For the primary outcome measure, missing data were handled using multiple imputation in cases where missing urines occurred due to hospitalisation, imprisonment, pre-agreed absence (holiday), safety reasons or clinical omission/error. Missing urines from a patient who attempted abstinence were similarly managed. Urine samples not provided due to non-compliance (refusal to provide or unplanned non-attendance) were presumed positive.</P>
<P>Data were analysed on an Intention-To-Treat basis for the primary analysis (all patients randomised included in analyses). Per-Protocol analyses (only patients who received trial interventions according to protocol) were also conducted: any substantial differences in findings are reported alongside the primary ITT analyses.</P>
<P>All the data for each of the groups to which participants were randomised were presented so that the risk of bias of multiple-intervention study are minimised.</P>

<P>was compliant with study medication (DAM, HMO and/or MMT) on at least 10 of 14 days prior to the 12-month date; or</P>
<P>was confirmed to be enrolled in detoxification program at the 12-month date; or</P>
<P>was confirmed to be enrolled in a drug-free program at the 12-month date; or</P>
<P>was confirmed to be abstinent at the 12-month date.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The first primary outcome was retention in addiction treatment at 12 months (defined as receipt of the study medication<BR/>on at least 10 of the 14 days before the 12-month assessment, or confirmation of retention in any other treatment program or abstinence from opioids during this interval).</P>
<P/>
<P>The second primary outcome was reduction in illicit-drug use or other illegal activities. On the basis of composite scores on<BR/>the European Addiction Severity Index17 patients were considered to have a response at 12 months if they had an improvement of at least 20% from the baseline score for illicit-drug use or legal status (or both).</P>

<P>After the publication of the last update of the present systematic review (August 2010) the contact author received individual messages with comments and criticisms from the authors of the most recent trials: M. Schetcher, W. van Den Brink, C.Haasen and J.Strang.</P>
<P>The comments can be synthetised as follows:</P>
<P>-about the retention in treatment results some possible explanation of the behaviour of people assigned to the heroin or the methadone arms, were proposed.</P>
<P>- it was discussed whether it was the case for providing the meta-analysis of the relapse to street heroin use as the outcomes were measured in different ways across the studies and sometimes without distinguishing between heroin and other illicit drugs;</P>
<P>- the same discussion applied, as a consequence, to the meta-analysis of the results of other illicit drugs use.</P>
<P>- it was commented that the most recent studies compared the provision of supervised injected heroin versus oral methadone and this comparison should have been made clearer by restricting the analysis to the studies focusing on it.</P>
<P>- it was argued that only the adverse events considered to be related to the study medications should have been included in the meta-analisis. It was also pointed out that it was more likely to register adverse events in the heroin arms patients who were observed 2-3 times per day than in the methadone patients who were seen only 1 time per day.</P>
<P>- it was underlined that the studies were powered to measure their prespecified outcomes and this was not reflected in the systematic review.</P>
<P>-it was discussed that in the RIOTT study the comparison with the injectable methadone arm should not have been included in the meta-analysis as this was an experimental arm not to be compared with the injected heroin one.</P>
<P>-it was criticised that mentioning the higher cost of heroin as medication for stabilisation in the discussion was inappropriate as some studies about cost-utility of heroin provision provided positive results.</P>

<P>Each single comment was answered individually to the sender and they are available from the first author of the present review. The comments have been considered as a base for the present update which includes the following:</P>
<P>The results of the review are presented in two main comparisons: one about supervised injected heroin plus flexible doses of methadone versus oral methadone, and the second comparison about provision of heroin in any route of administration compared with any other treatments.</P>
<P>The retention in treatment results were maintained as before but the exclusion of the two studies in which the data were not comparable was made clearer. An extended individual answer based on a debate about the possible motivation of patients assigned to different interventions (<A HREF="http://www.bmj.com/content/327/7410/310.abridged/reply#bmj_el_35634">http://www.bmj.com/content/327/7410/310.abridged/reply#bmj_el_35634</A>) concluded that a systematic review (and surely a meta-analysis) might not be the right place to deepen the analysis of motivations to behave.</P>
<P>The outcome "relapse to street heroin use" was renamed "reduction in illicit drug use" and the meta-analysis was substituted by a description of the results at study level. The meta-analysis of the use of other substances was withdrawn.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis of the adverse events was restricted to the only cases associated with the study medications. For the higher probability of registering adverse events in the experimental arms, it was answered that this is due to ascertainment bias and this can only be dealt at study level.</P>
<P>The injected methadone comparison arm (RIOTT study) was excluded by the analysis.</P>
<P>An additional paragraph and one additional table describe the primary outcomes for which the studies were powered and their results.</P>
<P>The references to the cost-utility studies on heroin provision were included in the discussion.</P>
<P>The conclusions were slightly modified to reflect the different comparisons provided.</P>
