<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>What are the best forms of treatment for engorged breasts in breastfeeding women?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Breast engorgement is the overfilling of breasts with milk leading to swollen, hard and painful breasts. Many women experience this during the first few days after giving birth, although it can occur later. It is more common when the timing of breastfeeding is restricted or the baby has difficulty sucking or the mother is separated from her newborn. This leads to the breasts not being emptied properly. Breast engorgement may make it difficult for women to breastfeed. It may lead to complications such as inflammation of the breast, infection and sore/cracked nipples. So far, consistent evidence for effective forms of treatment is lacking.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for trials on any treatments for breast engorgement in breastfeeding women. We looked at 13 trials including 919 breastfeeding women who had engorged breasts. The trials looked at treatments including acupuncture, acupressure, cabbage leaves, cold packs, medication, massage and ultrasound. Four of the studies were funded by an agency with a commercial interest in the results of the studies, two received charitable funding and two were funded by government agencies. The other five did not declare the source of funding.</P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
</P>
<P>One study comparing acupuncture with usual care (advice and oxytocin spray) found no difference in terms of stopping breastfeeding. However, women in the acupuncture group were less likely to develop an abscess, had less severe symptoms on day five and had a lower rate of fever than women in the usual care group. Three trials looking at cabbage leaves showed no difference between room temperature and chilled cabbage leaves, between chilled cabbage leaves and gel packs and between cabbage cream and the inactive cream; however, all forms of treatment provided some relief. Hot/cold packs were found to be more effective than acupressure. <I>Gua Sha </I>scraping therapy was found to be more effective than hot packs and massage in reducing symptoms of breast engorgement, though both forms of treatment decreased breast temperature, engorgement, pain and discomfort at five and 30 minutes after treatment. A study on ultrasound therapy had the same, minimal effect as the fake ultrasound, whereas oxytocin injections in another study provided no relief at all. When breast-shaped cold gel packs were compared with routine care, women who used gel packs seemed to have less pain; however, the study was of very low quality making the results unreliable.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence was low due to the small number of participants in the included studies and limited number of studies looking at the same outcomes. More robust research is urgently needed on the treatment of breast engorgement.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-18 04:41:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Breast engorgement is a painful condition affecting large numbers of women in the early postpartum period. It may lead to premature weaning, cracked nipples, mastitis and breast abscess. Various forms of treatment for engorgement have been studied but so far little evidence has been found on an effective intervention.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-05-24 20:35:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a systematic review first published by Snowden et al. in 2001 and subsequently published in 2010. The objective of this update is to seek new information on the best forms of treatment for breast engorgement in lactating women.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-06-17 13:13:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We identified studies for inclusion through the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2015) and searched reference lists of retrieved studies.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility, extracted data and conducted 'Risk of bias' assessments.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-07-01 15:57:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In total, we included 13 studies with 919 women. In 10 studies individual women were the unit of analysis and in three studies, individual breasts were the unit of analysis. Four out of 13 studies were funded by an agency with a commercial interest, two received charitable funding, and two were funded by government agencies.</P>
<P>Trials examined interventions including non-medical treatments: cabbage leaves (three studies), acupuncture (two studies), ultrasound (one study), acupressure (one study), scraping therapy (<I>Gua Sha</I>) (one study), cold breast-packs and electromechanical massage (one study), and medical treatments: serrapeptase (one study), protease (one study) and subcutaneous oxytocin (one study). The studies were small and used different comparisons with only single studies contributing data to outcomes of this review. We were unable to pool results in meta-analysis and only seven studies provided outcome data that could be included in data and analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Non-medical</B>
</P>
<P>No differences were observed in the one study comparing acupuncture with usual care (advice and oxytocin spray) (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 1.92; one study; 140 women) in terms of <B>cessation of breastfeeding</B>. However, women in the acupuncture group were less likely to develop an <B>abscess</B> (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.01; one study; 210 women), had less severe symptoms on day five (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99), and had a lower rate of <B>pyrexia</B> (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94) than women in the usual care group.</P>
<P>In another study with 39 women comparing cabbage leaf extract with placebo, no differences were observed in <B>breast pain</B> (mean difference (MD) 0.40, 95% CI -0.67 to 1.47; <I>low-quality evidence</I>) or <B>breast engorgement</B> (MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.58; <I>low-quality evidence</I>). There was no difference between ultrasound and sham treatment in <B>analgesic requirement </B>(RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.51; one study; 45 women; <I>low-quality evidence</I>). A study comparing Gua-Sha therapy with hot packs and massage found a marked difference in <B>breast engorgement</B> (MD -2.42, 95% CI -2.98 to -1.86; one study; 54 women), <B>breast pain</B> (MD -2.01, 95% CI -2.60 to -1.42; one study; 54 women) and <B>breast discomfort</B> (MD -2.33, 95% CI -2.81 to -1.85; one study; 54 women) in favour of Gua-Sha therapy five minutes post-intervention, though both interventions significantly decreased breast temperature, engorgement, pain and discomfort at five and 30 minutes post-treatment.</P>
<P>Results from individual trials that could not be included in data analysis suggested that there were no differences between room temperature and chilled cabbage leaves and between chilled cabbage leaves and gel packs, with all interventions producing some relief. Intermittent hot/cold packs applied for 20 minutes twice a day were found to be more effective than acupressure (P &lt; 0.001). Acupuncture did not improve maternal satisfaction with breastfeeding. In another study, women who received breast-shaped cold packs were more likely to experience a reduction in pain intensity than women who received usual care; however, the differences between groups at baseline, and the failure to observe randomisation, make this study at high risk of bias. One study found a decrease in breast temperature (P = 0.03) following electromechanical massage and pumping in comparison to manual methods; however, the high level of attrition and alternating method of sequence generation place this study at high risk of bias.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-06-24 06:08:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In recognition of the importance of breastfeeding for maternal and infant well-being, and for society at large, the World Health Organization recommends that all babies should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life and then continue to receive breast milk, along with appropriate complementary foods, up to two years of age or beyond (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). Despite this, less than 3% of women breastfeed their infants for 24 months (<LINK REF="REF-Carletti-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carletti 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hure-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hure 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2013</LINK>). One of the most common factors associated with premature cessation of breastfeeding is difficulty with lactation (<LINK REF="REF-Odom-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odom 2013</LINK>), including breast engorgement (<LINK REF="REF-Hauck-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauck 2011</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-06-24 06:08:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Breast engorgement is the pathological overfilling of the breasts with milk, characterised by hard, painful, tight breasts and difficulty breastfeeding. It is usually due to compromised milk removal, either from restrictive feeding practices and/or ineffective sucking, or less commonly overproduction of milk. Augmentation mammoplasty (surgical enlargement of breasts) may also predispose to engorgement (<LINK REF="REF-Acarturk--2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acarturk 2005</LINK>). It should be differentiated from normal breast fullness, often called physiological breast engorgement (<LINK REF="STD-Nikodem-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nikodem 1993</LINK>), occurring between day two to three postpartum, in which secretory activation of the breast is triggered by the delivery of the placenta (progesterone withdrawal) and subsequent rise in prolactin levels (<LINK REF="REF-Hale-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 2007</LINK>). Increased milk production and interstitial tissue oedema ensue resulting in visibly larger, warmer and slightly uncomfortable breasts. In women with normal breast fullness, milk flow from the breast is not hindered and with frequent, efficient breastfeeding, discomfort resolves within a few days.</P>
<P>Breast engorgement, on the other hand, is a distressing and debilitating condition affecting between 15% and 50% of women (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1994</LINK>). Prevalence may be even higher depending on the definition used. Where engorgement was described as part of an inflammatory process (any mixture of erythema, pain, pyrexia, breast tension and resistance in breast tissue), 75% of women in a Swedish study experienced symptoms within eight weeks postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2004</LINK>). Some level of breast tenderness during the first five days after birth was experienced by 72% of women in a study by Hill and Humenick. Engorgement symptoms occur most commonly between the second and fifth days postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995a</LINK>), peaking at day five (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1994</LINK>), but may occur as late as day 14 (<LINK REF="REF-Humenick-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humenick 1994</LINK>), and are usually diffuse, bilateral and may be associated with a low-grade fever. Complications are common and include sore/damaged nipples, mastitis, abscess formation, decreased milk supply (<LINK REF="REF-Giugliani-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giugliani 2004</LINK>), premature introduction of breast milk substitutes, and premature cessation of breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Mass-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mass 2004</LINK>). Difficulty in feeding the baby occurs in up to 82% of mothers with breast engorgement (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995a</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-06-17 13:25:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Many interventions for the treatment of breast engorgement have been suggested in the past. Some treatments have been abandoned, such as mechanical compression (binding) of the breast, complete manual emptying of the breast, fluid restriction, the use of diuretics, oestrogens and bromocriptine, due to safety concerns. Others, such as some anti-inflammatory medications (bromelain, serrapeptase) have been tested on small sample sizes only, with no long-term safety data, and hence have not been widely accepted. Oxytocin, due to its role in inducing the milk-ejection reflex, has also been proposed as an efficacious agent for the relief of postpartum breast engorgement. Other modalities, such as ultrasound therapy, acupuncture and acupressure have also been explored. A popular form of treatment of breast engorgement is the application of cabbage leaves. Even though no active pharmacological substance in cabbage leaves has been identified in the literature, its convenient shape, low cost, wide availability and purportedly soothing effect make it a sought after treatment. Reverse pressure softening, a technique that uses gentle positive pressure with the finger-tips to soften the areola, has been shown to improve attachment of the infant to the breast during engorgement (<LINK REF="REF-Cotterman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotterman 2004</LINK>), hence making it a potential tool for the treatment of breast engorgement, but relevant outcomes have not been tested in a controlled setting.</P>
<P>Current recommendations for the treatment of breast engorgement include various measures aimed at emptying the breast sufficiently to alleviate discomfort, facilitate breastfeeding and prevent complications. These include applying moist heat to the breast prior to feeding to aid oxytocin uptake, frequent feeding, softening the areola prior to attachment, correct positioning and attachment of the baby to the breast during breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Mass-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mass 2004</LINK>), gentle massage during feeding, and applying cold compresses after feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Core-Curriculum-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Core Curriculum 2013</LINK>), along with analgesics (e.g. paracetamol) and anti-inflammatory medication (e.g. ibuprofen), if needed (<LINK REF="REF-ABM-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ABM 2009</LINK>). If breastfeeding is not possible, hand-expressing or pumping milk to comfort is recommended, along with other symptomatic measures.</P>
<P>In some countries, such as Sweden, oxytocin spray is routinely used in an attempt to enhance drainage of engorged breasts. A postal survey of all 57 breastfeeding clinics in Sweden, revealed that oxytocin spray, unrefined cotton wool (as a comfort measure) and acupuncture were used by 87%, 72% and 56% of responding clinics, respectively, for the treatment of breast inflammatory conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2004</LINK>). In other countries, such as Taiwan, cold therapies for breast engorgement are discouraged during the month following delivery. Instead, milk expression after the application of hot packs is widely used, as are traditional Chinese therapies.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-06-17 13:29:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Ideally, treatment of breast engorgement should: 1) provide rapid relief of breast pain; 2) enable successful attachment of the baby to the breast; 3) facilitate efficient drainage of milk from the breasts; and 4) prevent known complications such as mastitis and breast abscess. Optimal treatment should rapidly result in relatively soft, non-tender breasts from which the mother can easily and successfully feed her infant. Numerous treatments have been studied in an attempt to achieve these goals. The interventions studied in this review are based on the following assumptions:</P>
<OL>
<LI>administration of <I>exogenous</I> oxytocin: release of <I>endogenous</I> oxytocin, from the posterior pituitary gland, is known to cause contraction of the mammary myoepithelial cells, which surround milk-producing alveoli, resulting in expulsion of milk towards the nipple, known as the milk-ejection reflex. In engorgement, the milk-ejection reflex may be inhibited due to vascular congestion in the breast preventing oxytocin from reaching the myoepithelial cells;</LI>
<LI>acupuncture: the stimulation of certain acupuncture points along the skin of the body with acupuncture needles is believed, according to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), to relieve obstructions in the flow of energy, enabling the body to heal, leading to improved microcirculation and flow of milk;</LI>
<LI>scraping therapy (<I>Gua-Sha</I>): the stimulation of acupoints, using a scraping motion on the skin, is believed, according to TCM, to improve circulation and metabolism by removing obstructions and revitalising meridians. In TCM, 14 channels of energy, known as <I>meridians</I>, are believed to run throughout the body. Meridians passing just under the skin surface present acupoints;</LI>
<LI>thermal (continuous) ultrasound therapy: it is thought treatment may facilitate the removal of milk from the engorged breast by facilitating milk let-down, leading to less pain and hardness;</LI>
<LI>enzyme therapy: believed to be able to suppress inflammation, abate and alleviate pain and oedema and accelerate the circulation of blood and lymph;</LI>
<LI>anti-inflammatory medication: known to reduce symptoms of inflammation, such as pain, redness and swelling, therefore assumed to relieve the symptoms of engorgement;</LI>
<LI>cabbage leaves: thought to possibly contain a chemical that the mother's skin absorbs, thus reducing oedema and increasing milk flow. Usually applied chilled which induces vasoconstriction and further decreases oedema;</LI>
<LI>cold packs: the application of cold is thought to be soothing and to decrease the blood flow to the skin by vasoconstriction, which in turn is believed to decrease engorgement;</LI>
<LI>massage: gentle breast massage is thought to induce the milk-ejection reflex, mobilise the milk and hence reduce the symptoms of breast engorgement.</LI>
</OL>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-06-17 13:30:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Breastfeeding is the normal way to feed infants, resulting in optimal growth and development. In addition, it provides a stimulus for the bonding process between a mother and her baby, as well as protecting them both from disease. A mother's choice to breastfeed is often hampered by breastfeeding difficulties. Breast engorgement is a common condition affecting up to half of all women who choose to breastfeed (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1994</LINK>). Apart from causing distressing symptoms for the mother, it can lead to serious complications for the breastfeeding dyad, including the premature cessation of breastfeeding. Earlier systematic reviews on this topic have found insufficient evidence on effective treatments for breast engorgement but in the interim, several new studies have been reported which may assist in finding an effective treatment for this troubling condition. Additionally, in the era of HIV, exclusive breastfeeding has received attention in an effort to prevent mother-to-child transmission. Failure to identify the best forms of treatment of breast engorgement may result in women mixing breast and formula feeding, thus increasing their risk of HIV transmission.</P>
<P>This Cochrane systematic review is an update of the one first published by <LINK REF="REF-Snowden-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snowden 2001</LINK>, and subsequently re-published in 2010. The previous reviews called for robust research to address the lack of evidence for the treatment of breast engorgement. This review seeks to evaluate current evidence on the best forms of treatment available.</P>

<LI>Breast induration/hardness</LI>
<LI>Breast swelling</LI>
<LI>Breast engorgement</LI>
<LI>Analgesic requirement</LI>

A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>We had planned to include cluster-randomised trials but we identified none. In future updates of this review, if we identify any eligible cluster-randomised trials we will include them in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> <I>[Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6]</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.</P>

<P>Several of the studies included in the review used breasts rather than women as the unit of analysis (<LINK REF="STD-McLachlan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">McLachlan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995a</LINK>). We are aware that a woman's breasts (engorged or not) are unlikely to be independent of each other and such non-independent data require special methods of analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2007</LINK>). In this version of the review, data were not presented in a way that allowed us to include them in the data tables and so we have presented a brief narrative description of results.

<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-06-17 13:34:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>In this version of the review, as so few trials contributed data and each examined different interventions, we were unable to combine results in meta-analyses. In future updates of the review if more data are added, we plan to assess heterogeneity among trials. We will assess statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau², I² and Chi² statistics. We will regard heterogeneity as substantial if an I² is greater than 30% and either a Tau² is greater than zero, or there is a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity. </P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>).

In future updates, if more data are available, we plan to use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data in the absence of moderate or high levels of heterogeneity.</P>
<P>In future updates, if there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary will be treated as the average of the range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful, we will not combine trials. If we use random-effects analyses, the results will be presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau² and I².</P>

<P>Using the search strategy, we identified 26 reports of 22 studies, examining treatments for breast engorgement in breastfeeding women. After assessing eligibility we included 13 studies (16 reports), one of which was in the form of an abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmadi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmadi 2011</LINK>).

<P>We have included 13 studies carried out over a period of more than 60 years (from <LINK REF="STD-Ingelman_x002d_Sundberg-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Ingelman-Sundberg 1953</LINK> to <LINK REF="STD-Batista-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Batista 2014</LINK>), during which attitudes towards breastfeeding and the types and availability of treatments for women with breast engorgement have changed considerably.</P>
<P>All of the included studies focused on women with signs and symptoms of breast engorgement. In most of the studies, women with swollen, hard, painful breasts (and sometimes with pyrexia) were generally recruited in the early postnatal period (two to 10 days postpartum). In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2007</LINK> women were recruited at breastfeeding clinics rather than in hospital postnatal wards, and may have been breastfeeding for some time, although the majority were seen within two weeks of giving birth. In one study, the focus was specifically on women who had caesarean births (<LINK REF="STD-Robson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Robson 1990</LINK>), and in another on women who sought care at a human milk bank.(<LINK REF="STD-Batista-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Batista 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The studies we have included in the review examined the effects of a broad range of interventions, and data were sometimes presented in a way that did not allow us to enter them into RevMan tables (<LINK REF="STD-Batista-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Batista 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murata-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Murata 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Robson 1990</LINK>); for these studies we have presented a brief narrative summary of findings.

<P>We excluded nine studies (10 reports) identified by the search strategy. The main reasons for exclusion were that studies examined the prevention of breast engorgement (<LINK REF="STD-Nikodem-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nikodem 1993</LINK>) in women whose breasts were not yet engorged, or examined interventions to suppress lactation in women who did not intend to breastfeed, rather than examining interventions to treat the symptoms of engorgement in women who were breastfeeding their babies (<LINK REF="STD-Booker-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Booker 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Filteau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Filteau 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garry-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Garry 1956</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-1958" TYPE="STUDY">King 1958</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roser-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Roser 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ryan-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Ryan 1962</LINK>).

<P>Approximately half of the women recruited in the <LINK REF="STD-Nikodem-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nikodem 1993</LINK> study did not have symptoms of breast engorgement and the intervention aimed to prevent rather than treat symptoms in these women.

<P>We found it difficult to assess risk of bias in the included studies as the methods used in the trials were not generally well-described. Most authors reported that the trial was a randomised controlled trial but did not describe how sequence generation or allocation concealment was performed.

<P>In two studies we judged that the methods used to conceal group allocation at the point of randomisation were adequate; in these studies group assignments were concealed in sealed opaque sequentially numbered envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2007</LINK>). In all of the remaining studies, we assessed that methods to conceal allocation were inadequate or unclear. Quasi-randomisation was used in four trials; group allocation was by odd or even case-note number in the <LINK REF="STD-Ingelman_x002d_Sundberg-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Ingelman-Sundberg 1953</LINK> trial, by day of the week in the <LINK REF="STD-Murata-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Murata 1965</LINK> trial, and in the two studies by Roberts (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995a</LINK>), all women received both the experimental and control interventions, as breasts rather than women were randomised. In one study a "balanced block randomisation sequence" was used, but it was not clear what methods were used to conceal group allocation (<LINK REF="STD-McLachlan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">McLachlan 1991</LINK>). Similarly, a "computer-generated block randomisation list" was produced by <LINK REF="STD-Chiu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 2010</LINK>, but the method of allocation concealment was not described. One of the study authors was contacted for clarification but information on sequence generation only was provided. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmadi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmadi 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kee-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kee 1989</LINK>) were characterised as randomised controlled trials but neither sequence generation nor allocation concealment were reported; the Ahmadi paper only states that the women were randomly assigned to one intervention or the other in a way that would create two intervention groups of equal size. Even distribution of baseline characteristics (education level, career, number of births and type of birth) suggests that randomisation was adequate, but incomplete reporting resulted in the study being categorised as unclear. Attempts were made to contact the Kee study authors to clarify selection bias but neither the journal in which the paper was published, nor the affiliated institution knew of the authors whereabouts. Allocation concealment was classified as unclear in the <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1998</LINK> study because even though group assignments were placed in sealed envelopes, it is not stated whether they were opaque or non-opaque. Although coin toss was used for initial random sequence generation in the <LINK REF="STD-Batista-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Batista 2014</LINK> study, intervention options were alternated thereafter, placing this study at high risk of selection bias. Finally, in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Robson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Robson 1990</LINK> there were serious problems with the way randomisation was carried out; a table of random numbers was used to decide the randomisation sequence but the allocation sequence was not necessarily observed, so, for example, women with the most distressing symptoms assigned to the control group were moved into the intervention group, and there was no intention-to-treat analysis.</P>

<P>In studies where different types of interventions were compared, blinding participants and clinical staff would not be feasible and was not attempted (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmadi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmadi 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Batista-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Batista 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chiu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 2010;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Robson 1990</LINK>). The lack of blinding (of women, staff and outcome assessors) in these studies may represent a serious source of bias, as many of the outcomes measured (subjective views about treatment and assessment of symptoms) may have been influenced by knowledge of treatment assignment. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-McLachlan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">McLachlan 1991</LINK> comparing ultrasound versus sham ultrasound, it was reported that women and staff were blind to which machine was which. However, in this study breasts rather than women were randomised and one breast may have been randomised to receive ultrasound and the other sham treatment. It was reported that the same machine was always used to treat the same breast. It is not clear how convincing to women and staff this attempt at blinding was, and it is difficult to imagine full compliance with this blinding procedure in the context of busy postnatal wards. Four other studies used placebo methods: in <LINK REF="STD-Murata-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Murata 1965</LINK>, protease complex tablets were compared with lactose-containing placebo tablets; in the <LINK REF="STD-Ingelman_x002d_Sundberg-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Ingelman-Sundberg 1953</LINK>, subcutaneous oxytocin was compared with physiological saline injections; in <LINK REF="STD-Kee-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kee 1989</LINK>, oral serrapeptase was compared with specially made control tablets that were identical in appearance and given according to the same regimen; and in the <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1998</LINK> trial a cream containing cabbage leaf extract was compared with a base/placebo cream, with rosewater added to both creams to camouflage the residual odour of cabbage. It is unclear from the <LINK REF="STD-Murata-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Murata 1965</LINK> report whether the tablets used were identical, hence we have categorised this study as unclear, as opposed to the other studies which were judged to be at low risk of performance bias.</P>
<P>In terms of outcome assessment, there was no mention of blinding of outcome assessors in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Batista-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Batista 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ingelman_x002d_Sundberg-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Ingelman-Sundberg 1953</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2007</LINK>).

There is an unclear risk of bias in two studies: <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1998</LINK> because whilst the authors have mentioned the outcomes they intended to assess, they presented the results with the two groups combined; in <LINK REF="STD-Ingelman_x002d_Sundberg-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Ingelman-Sundberg 1953</LINK>, the authors report their outcomes in percentages, not in numbers out of the totals, which made it difficult to determine the denominators. <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2004</LINK> carries a risk of bias as the authors mention that the study had to be stopped prematurely but no data are given. Also, they do not mention in the results one of the outcomes (resistance of breast tissue), which was listed in the methods' section. Other outcomes are mentioned, as non-significant results, but are not reported adequately.

<OTHER_BIAS_SOURCES MODIFIED="2016-06-21 15:04:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was considerable baseline imbalance in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Robson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Robson 1990</LINK>. Women in the control group had much lower pre-test pain scores. There was also some deviation from protocol in this study: three women who were described as having "heightened distress levels" assigned to the intervention group were moved into the control group as this was perceived as being less demanding of their time, and one mother with severe discomfort asked to be assigned to the intervention group. In all, the randomisation schedule was not observed in eight cases. This represents a serious source of bias. There was no intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>In another study (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1998</LINK>), a significant baseline imbalance was found in the number of primiparas. Authors were contacted but no explanation was found. This may have been due to chance or a small sample size but may also have been due to possible problems with allocation concealment or compromised blinding, hence we made a judgement of possible high risk of bias.</P>
<P>There was considerable risk of bias in <LINK REF="STD-Batista-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Batista 2014</LINK>; no baseline characteristics were provided for included participants, although varying degrees of engorgement were alluded to, implying the possibility of baseline imbalance. Additionally, the study was severely underpowered, limiting its precision. No statement of conflict of interest or sponsorship was provided, raising the possibility of industry funding.</P>
<P>In three of the included studies, randomisation and analysis was at the level of breasts rather than women (<LINK REF="STD-McLachlan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">McLachlan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995a</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-McLachlan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">McLachlan 1991</LINK> state that in their study, when the visual analogue scale was used, it was not always easy for women to make a clear distinction between the left and right breast. This may be an indication that having an individual breast as a unit of analysis is not ideal. In the studies there was no adjustment made for the non-independence of breasts, and we found interpretation of results difficult. This difficulty was exacerbated in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995</LINK>, because the pretest rating of symptoms was for both breasts together (an overall rating), whereas at post-test, women provided ratings for separate breasts. It was therefore not possible for us to understand the possible differences between pre- and post-test scores.</P>
<P>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2004</LINK>), insufficient information was available, due to lack of clarity in reporting, to assess whether an important risk of bias exists. In the <LINK REF="STD-Murata-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Murata 1965</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kee-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kee 1989</LINK> studies the active tablets used in the trial were supplied by a pharmaceutical company, hence it was unclear whether a vested interest may have influenced study results. The remaining studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmadi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmadi 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chiu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ingelman_x002d_Sundberg-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Ingelman-Sundberg 1953</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2007</LINK>) appeared to be free of other sources of bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions to treat breast engorgement: 13 studies with 919 women</HEADING>
<P>We included 13 studies with 919 breastfeeding women; 171 of whom were analysed at the individual breast level (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmadi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmadi 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLachlan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">McLachlan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995a</LINK>). We were unable to pool any results from studies in meta-analysis because of the broad range of interventions examined, and the way in which outcomes were assessed and reported in these trials. We have set out separate comparisons for each type of intervention in the text below, and in the data tables; in some studies we were not able to include all outcome data in tables because of the form in which results were presented in research reports; for these outcomes we provide a brief description of findings as reported by the trial authors. Most of the studies did not provide usable information on the review's primary outcomes (pain, breast engorgement, breast swelling and breast induration), and so we have set out findings for both primary and secondary outcomes together.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Acupuncture to treat breast engorgement: two studies with 293 women</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Primary and secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Two studies examined the effects of acupuncture on breast engorgement (<LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2007</LINK>). In both studies there were three treatment groups: advice and usual care (which might include the use of oxytocin nasal spray at the discretion of the midwife); advice and acupuncture, excluding the SP6 acupoint; and advice and acupuncture, including the SP6 point. Advice consisted of information on breastfeeding frequency, duration and technique, breast emptying, and the application of unrefined cotton wool as needed. Results for resolution of symptoms were very similar for women in the two acupuncture groups in the <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2007</LINK> study, so we have combined them in the data tables.</P>
<P>We were unable to include data from the <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2004</LINK> study in analyses because results were not set out separately for the three randomised groups in the published report and were not available from the authors. The authors however report that there were no significant differences on day three of treatment between the three groups in the severity index (a sum score for <B>breast tension, erythema</B> and <B>pain</B>) or for maternal satisfaction with breastfeeding. The percentage of mothers in Group 1 who were prescribed oxytocin nasal spray by the midwives was 86%. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2004</LINK> was discontinued prematurely because the authors felt it necessary to include cultivation of breast milk from all participants and follow-up of the mothers after six weeks. In <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2007</LINK>, the two intervention groups were combined during data analysis as suggested in section 16.5 of the Cochrane <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). There was no difference in <B>cessation of breastfeeding</B> where six women stopped breastfeeding in the group where oxytocin nasal spray was used (the midwives gave oxytocin nasal spray to 100% of the mothers in Group 1) compared to three women in the group where acupuncture (excluding SP-6 acupoint) was used (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 1.92; one study; 140 women - data not shown).</P>
<P>Both studies provided information on the review's primary outcomes in the form of a severity index (SI), which included <B>breast tension</B> and <B>pain</B>. Significantly more mothers in the acupuncture group had less severe breast symptoms on days three and four of treatment in comparison with the non-acupuncture group. The mothers' expression of <B>satisfaction with the breastfeeding experience</B> did not differ significantly between the groups.The number of women prescribed antibiotics may represent a proxy measure of <B>mastitis</B>; results from <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2007</LINK> show that there was no difference between acupuncture and control groups in prescription antibiotics (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.16; data not shown).</P>
<P>The number of women with <B>breast abscess</B> was reported in <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2007</LINK>; women in the acupuncture group were less likely to develop an abscess compared to women receiving routine care (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.01; one study; 210 women), <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Findings in the <LINK REF="STD-Kvist-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kvist 2007</LINK> study favoured the acupuncture group, with more women in the acupuncture group, having <B>less severe symptoms</B> on days four and five of contact, compared to women in the control group (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99; one study; 210 women), <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cabbage leaves to treat breast engorgement: three studies with 101 women</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Primary and secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Three studies by the same first author examined cabbage leaves to reduce symptoms of breast engorgement, and collected information on pre- and post-treatment pain scores in randomised trials. Two studies assessed the use of cabbage leaves: chilled versus room temperature cabbage leaves (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995</LINK>), and chilled cabbage leaves versus chilled gel packs (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995a</LINK>), whilst the third study evaluated the use of cabbage leaf extract, in the form of a cream, versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1998</LINK>). In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995a</LINK>), breasts rather than women were randomised, and results were not reported in a way that allowed us to enter data into <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>. In the study comparing chilled cabbage leaves and chilled gel packs (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995a</LINK>), it was reported that women in both groups had significant reductions in pain scores following treatment (30% for the cabbage leaves and 39% for the gel packs), but that there were no differences between groups (data not shown). While both treatments appeared to produce some alleviation of discomfort, it is likely that the subjective ratings on the pain ruler were susceptible to a placebo effect. Two-thirds of women stated that they preferred the cabbage leaves because they gave a more immediate effect, while others felt that the chilled gel packs gave a more lasting effect. In the second study comparing chilled versus room temperature cabbage leaves, again authors reported that both groups had significantly less pain following treatment (37% reduction in pain with room temperature cabbage leaves and a 38% reduction with chilled cabbage leaves), but that there was no difference at all between the randomised groups (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995</LINK>) (data not shown). The lack of difference in the pain ratings suggests that chilling does not influence the purported effectiveness of cabbage leaves. Study authors felt that the drop in pain ratings could have been at least partially caused by a placebo effect. The attention of clinicians could have reduced anxiety in the new mothers and consequently reduced pain levels. Study authors concluded that it is not necessary to chill cabbage leaves before using them, since chilling has no effect on the efficacy of the treatment.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1998</LINK> there was no significant difference between the cabbage leaf extract group and the placebo group with regards to <B>breast engorgement</B> (mean difference (MD) 0.20, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.58; one study; 39 women; <I>low-quality evidence</I>), <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>. Both groups perceived the creams as having some efficacy but the lack of significant difference between the <B>mean pain scores</B> of the experimental and control groups (MD 0.40, 95% CI -0.67 to 1.47; one study; 39 women; <I>low-quality evidence</I>), <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>, on any of the indicators, suggests that any action of the cabbage leaf extract tested is likely to be a placebo effect. The perception of the control group mothers that the discomfort and hardness were decreasing supports this inference. Furthermore, the magnitude of this perceived relief was low and in the range of a placebo effect. Of note is that breastfeeding was observed to have significantly more effect than cabbage cream on the perception of hardness of breast tissue and discomfort (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>In the study comparing Gua-Sha (scraping) therapy with hot packs and massage (<LINK REF="STD-Chiu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 2010</LINK>), Gua-Sha therapy, applied to acupoints ST16, ST18, SP17 and CV17, was more beneficial than hot packs and massage for the relief of breast engorgement, though both interventions significantly decreased breast temperature, engorgement, pain and discomfort at five and 30 minutes post-treatment. There was marked difference in the intervention group at first five minutes post-intervention: <B>breast engorgement</B> scale 4.01 (standard deviation (SD) 0.91) for the intervention group compared to 6.43 (SD: 1.17) for the hot packs and massage group (MD -2.42, 95% CI -2.98 to -1.86; one study; 54 women), <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>. <B>Breast pain</B> was markedly improved at five minutes in the Gua-Sha therapy group: 4.25 (SD: 1.07) compared to 6.26 (SD 1.14) in the control group (MD -2.01, 95% CI -2.60 to -1.42; one study; 54 women), <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-McLachlan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">McLachlan 1991</LINK> examined ultrasound versus sham ultrasound in a study where breasts rather than women were randomised (women may have had active treatment on both breasts, sham treatment on both breasts, or one breast receiving active, and the other receiving sham ultrasound). No adjustment was made for the non-independence of breasts and most of the results were difficult to interpret. When women who had the same treatment (either active or sham ultrasound) to both breasts were compared, the numbers <B>requiring analgesia</B> were very similar (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.51; one study; 45 women; <I>low-quality evidence</I>), <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>. Trial authors report that both sham and active treatment were associated with significant reductions in subjective ratings of <B>pain</B> and hardness, based on visual analogue scales comparing the paired pre-treatment and post-treatment ratings for each breast, but there were no differences between groups at the end of treatment. The effect of treatment on hardness, as measured by tonometry, was small and inconsistent providing further evidence of a placebo effect. It was also reported that there were no differences in the duration of breastfeeding (18 weeks) for women in the different treatment groups, but actual rates in each group were not reported. The therapeutic effect observed in both groups was attributed to the warmth, rest, massage, attention and emotional, practical and informational support provided by the physiotherapists in the course of treatment. In addition, the study authors thought that the perceived benefit of being the recipient of modern technology may have contributed to the observed placebo effect.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-06-17 13:45:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>In this review we have included data from 13 randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials, involving 919 breastfeeding women, looking at 10 different types of interventions for treating breast engorgement.</P>
<P>For several interventions with sham or placebo comparisons (ultrasound, cabbage leaf extract cream, and subcutaneous oxytocin), there was no evidence that interventions were associated with a more rapid or effective resolution of symptoms; in these studies women tended to have improvements in pain and other symptoms over time whether or not they received active treatment. The improvement in symptoms may be partly explained by the placebo effect or, it may be due to the fact that symptoms resolved spontaneously as women continued to breastfeed.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Non-medical interventions</HEADING>
<P>No differences were observed in the one study comparing acupuncture with usual care (advice and oxytocin spray) in terms of cessation of breastfeeding. In another study comparing cabbage leaf extract with placebo, no differences were observed in breast pain or breast engorgement. In one study comparing Gua-Sha therapy with hot packs and massage, improvements were observed in both breast pain and breast engorgement. There was no difference between ultrasound and sham treatment in analgesic requirement.</P>
<P>Results from individual trials that could not be included in data analysis suggested that there were no differences between room temperature and chilled cabbage leaves and between chilled cabbage leaves and gel packs, with all interventions producing some relief. Intermittent hot/cold packs applied for 20 minutes twice a day were found to be significantly more effective than acupressure. Acupuncture did not improve maternal satisfaction with breastfeeding, but in one study women reported less severe symptoms and were less likely to develop a breast abscess. In another study, women who received breast-shaped cold packs were more likely to experience a reduction in pain intensity than women who received usual care; however, the differences between groups at baseline, and the failure to observe randomisation, make this study at high risk of bias. One study found a decrease in breast temperature (P = 0.03) following electromechanical massage and pumping in comparison to manual methods; however, the alternating method of sequence generation, lack of blinding, and possible selective reporting, place this study at high risk of bias.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Medical interventions</HEADING>
<P>Women treated with protease complex were less likely to have no improvement in pain and swelling on the fourth day of treatment and less likely to experience no overall change in their symptoms or worsening of symptoms. It should be noted that it is more than 40 years since the study was carried out, and we are not aware that this preparation is used in current practice. Subcutaneous oxytocin provided no relief at all in symptoms at three days. Serrapeptase was found to produce some relief in breast pain, induration and swelling, when compared to placebo, with a high number of participants given serrapeptase experiencing slight to no improvement in overall breast engorgement, swelling and breast pain, but differences were not significant.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-06-17 13:45:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>All available randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials investigating the treatment of breast engorgement in breastfeeding women were included in this review, with no language restrictions. We attempted to be as inclusive as possible by going to great lengths to contact authors of reports requiring clarification of methodology or results.</P>
<P>The studies included in this review were conducted in a variety of countries (Australia, Brazil, Iran, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, Taiwan, USA); however all but two were from high-resource settings, hence limiting the applicability of the findings.</P>
<P>There is also little information on what women think of particular interventions; cold packs, for example, may be soothing for some women or may be uncomfortable for others; trials included in the review did not tend to report what women's views and preferences regarding treatment options were, apart from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995</LINK>) in which two-thirds of women stated that they preferred cabbage leaves to gel packs, with some mothers volunteering the information that cabbage leaves gave a stronger, more immediate effect, while others felt that chilled gel packs gave a more lasting effect in the treatment of breast engorgement.</P>
<P>The studies included in this review looked at a broad range of different interventions, and most of the studies did not report findings on key outcomes such as breast engorgement, breast pain, breast swelling, induration, impact of interventions on infection, breastfeeding practices, and cessation of breastfeeding. Whilst studies did examine improvement in symptoms, and this is certainly an outcome that is likely to be important to women, this outcome is difficult to interpret as symptoms are subjective and are likely to change over time with or without active intervention.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-06-27 10:12:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the contributions made by the authors and study participants in the 13 studies included in this review, we found the evidence for most outcomes to be at high risk of bias due to the small sample sizes (imprecision), inadequate sequence generation and allocation concealment (selection bias), lack of blinding of women, staff and outcome assessors (performance bias and detection bias), and potential conflict of interest, with four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kee-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kee 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLachlan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">McLachlan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murata-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Murata 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1998</LINK>) receiving funding from industry.</P>
<P>The lack of blinding in studies may mean that evidence regarding symptoms (reported by women or assessed by clinicians) may be at high risk of bias. Even though blinding of women and clinicians cannot always be conducted, where a placebo is not available, blinding of outcome assessors should be ensured to keep detection bias to a minimum. Most of the studies did not have sufficient statistical power to detect differences between groups and so results are not conclusive, and while outcomes that occur relatively infrequently were not generally reported, it is unlikely that these studies would have been large enough to show possible differences. The studies also had relatively short follow-up periods (as outcomes such as symptom improvement are apparent within a few days), which meant that information on longer-term outcomes such as duration of exclusive breastfeeding, or breastfeeding cessation was not available. Randomisation of breasts in some studies may mean that results are at high risk of bias as breasts are not independent; asking mothers who are not blinded to breast assignments to rate individual breasts (when at pre-test they provided a single rating for both breasts) may lead to findings that are at best, difficult to interpret, and at worst, not valid.</P>
<P>Three of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-McLachlan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">McLachlan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995a</LINK>) were very difficult to interpret as analysis was by individual breast and not by individual women. As reported by authors, it was not always easy for women to make a clear distinction between the left and right breast, making the evidence questionable. In <LINK REF="STD-Robson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Robson 1990</LINK>, the randomisation procedure was not adhered to: women with the most distressing symptoms assigned to the control group were moved into the intervention group.</P>
<P>The overall quality as assessed using the GRADE approach was found to be low for the comparison of cabbage cream versus placebo for breast pain and breast engorgement. This was due to limitations in study design and the small number of women in the single study contributing data to this analysis.

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-06-17 13:45:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We acknowledge that there is potential for bias in the review process as assessment of risk of bias, for example, is not an exact science and is subject to individual interpretation. We attempted to minimise this by: 1) having two review authors independently assess risk of bias and carry out data extraction; 2) contacting study authors if study methods or results were unclear; and 3) consulting a third party if we were unable to resolve dilemmas.</P>

<P>Clinical practice guidelines in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2006</LINK>) broadly agree with this review concluding that cabbage leaves and cold packs may be helpful for symptom relief, but that evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions is not strong. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-12-14 01:19:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence from trials to recommend the widespread implementation of a particular treatment for breast engorgement. At the same time, treatments such as hot/cold packs or cabbage leaves applied to the breast may be soothing, are unlikely to be harmful, are inexpensive and readily available. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-06-17 13:46:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There has been relatively little research in this area with only three new clinical trials being published in the last five years. Consequently, current treatment recommendations are largely based on anecdotal evidence and theoretical assumptions. The fact that they have remained unchanged over the last 20 years, attests to the urgent need for research in this field. What evidence is available, has methodological limitations resulting in a high risk of bias. Studies where individual breasts have been randomised are particularly difficult to interpret due to the unreliability of the results; hence this study design should be avoided in future research. Overcoming problems associated with lack of blinding and subsequent placebo effect is a particular challenge in this area. Comparing alternative treatment options using a cluster-randomised design rather than randomising individual women may be a possible way forward to ensure bigger numbers and to avoid contamination. In cases where cluster-randomised trials are not feasible, using an objective instrument for measuring breast engorgement, such as tonometry for measuring breast induration/hardness, may be a solution. At the same time, studies should also measure patient-important outcomes, such as breast pain and difficulty breastfeeding. Using the CONSORT statement for the reporting of randomised controlled trials, will also aid in interpretation and comparison of future studies. Finally, more robust research is necessary to confirm or dispute the promising effect of interventions such as serrapeptase, protease complex, hot/cold packs, scraping therapy, acupuncture and cabbage leaves for the treatment of breast engorgement in breastfeeding women. In addition, research evidence in the form of randomised controlled trials is needed to support current treatment recommendations.</P>

<P>The protocol <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK> section has been updated. The following outcomes, which were not in the original protocol, were added because they had not been adequately addressed in the previous version of the review, and were felt to be important for women with breast engorgement.</P>
<P>
<B>Primary outcomes: </B>breast pain, breast induration/hardness, breast swelling, breast engorgement.</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcome: </B>pyrexia (as defined by trial authors) was added to replace temperature higher than 38 degrees celsius.</P>
<P>Methods for GRADE assessment of the quality of the evidence have been added for this update and a 'Summary of findings' table has been incorporated.</P>
<P>Due to the lack of trials and the way in which outcomes were assessed and reported in these trials we were unable to carry out some of our pre-specified methods.</P>
<P>Data were not presented in a way that allowed us to include them in the data tables. We were unable to combine results in meta-analyses or investigate subgroup analysis and assessment of heterogeneity. The small number of included studies with diverse interventions prevented us from carrying out meaningful sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For this version of the review we did not identify any cluster-randomised trials.</P>

<P>This study included 120 women on postnatal wards of a Johannesburg hospital, South Africa. Women were recruited 72 hrs after delivery. Women in the intervention group received cabbage leaves to their breasts versus routine care (&#733;breast exercises&#733;) in the control group. The study was excluded as only approximately half of the sample perceived that they had symptoms of breast engorgement at baseline assessment. Cabbage leaves were therefore used as an intervention to prevent, as well as to treat, engorgement. Separate figures were not available for those women that had engorgement at the outset and were treated for symptoms. Results of this study suggested that women in the intervention group were more likely than those in the usual care group to be exclusively breastfeeding at 6 weeks (76% versus 58%).</P>
