<P>This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of non-surgical treatments for pes planus (flat feet) in children.</P>
<P>The review shows that in children with flat feet and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, custom foot orthoses:</P>
<P>-may improve pain and function slightly</P>
<P>-harms and side effects were not measured</P>
<P>We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. </P>
<P>
<B>What are flat feet and what are non-surgical treatments?</B>
</P>
<P>Children with flat feet, also called pes planus, do not have a normal arch. It means that when the child is standing, the whole foot touches the ground. Sometimes, this condition can cause pain, or change the way a child walks.</P>
<P>There are many types of non-surgical treatments for the pain and disability caused by flat feet such as foot orthoses (shoe inserts), stretching, footwear selection and modifications, activity modifications, manipulation, applying a series of casts, losing weight (if appropriate) and medication for pain and inflammation.</P>
<P>This review found information mainly on custom foot orthoses or shoe inserts. A custom foot orthosis is a medical device that is made from a custom mould of the child&#8217;s foot, prescribed by a qualified health-care professional and which is designed by that professional to allow more normal foot and leg function and to decrease the pressure on parts of the foot that might be causing pain.</P>
<P>Best estimate of what happens to children with flat feet: </P>
<P>Pain:</P>
<P>-children who used a custom-made foot orthoses in their shoes rated their pain to be 1.5<B> </B>on a scale of 0-10;</P>
<P>-children who wore their shoes only rated their pain to be 3 on a scale of 0-100;</P>
<P>-children who used a custom-made foot orthoses in their shoes rated their pain to be 1.5 points better (Absolute improvement: 15%).</P>
<P>Physical Function:</P>
<P>-children who used a custom-made foot orthoses in their shoes rated their disability level to be 15<B> </B>on a scale of 0-100;</P>
<P>-children who wore their shoes rated their disability to be 34 on a scale of 0-100;</P>
<P>-children who used a custom-made foot orthoses in their shoes rated their disability to be 19 points better (Absolute improvement: 19%).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-05-24 10:26:34 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three trials involving 305 children were included in this review. Due to clinical heterogeneity, data were not pooled. All trials had potential for bias. Data from one trial (40 children with juvenile arthritis and foot pain) indicated that use of custom-made orthoses compared with supportive shoes alone resulted in significantly greater reduction in pain intensity (mean difference (MD) -1.5 points on a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS), 95% CI -2.8 to -0.2; number need to treat to benefit (NNTB) 3, 95% CI 2 to 23), and reduction in disability (measured using the disability subscale of the Foot Function Index on a 100mm scale (MD -18.65mm, 95% CI -34.42 to -2.68mm). The second trial of seven to 11 year old children with bilateral flat feet (n = 178) found no difference in the number of participants with foot pain between custom-made orthoses, prefabricated orthoses and the control group who received no treatment. A third trial of one to five year olds with bilateral flat feet (n=129) did not report pain at baseline but reported the subjective impression of pain reduction after wearing shoes. No adverse effects were reported in the three trials.</P>

<P>The evidence from randomised controlled trials is currently too limited to draw definitive conclusions about the use of non-surgical interventions for paediatric pes planus. Future high quality trials are warranted in this field.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-05-24 10:35:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pes planus ('flat feet') is one of the most common conditions observed in paediatric health practice (<LINK REF="REF-Luhmann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luhmann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Garcia-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 1999</LINK> reported a prevalence rate of 2.7% in 1181 children aged between two and 13 years. <LINK REF="REF-Pfeiffer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfeiffer 2006</LINK> reported that the prevalence of flexible flatfoot in three to six year old children was 44%, but prevalence of pathological flatfoot was less than 1%. As a frequently reported condition it has significant implications. These are not only for the individual, where pain or the appearance of the foot is outside normal expectations, but also for the clinician in terms of treatment and management. Here the challenge is around functionality, where the clinician is requested to align the foot back to within normal foot functioning parameters. There is no universally accepted definition for pes planus. Clinically, a pes planus is a foot that has a low or absent longitudinal arch. A flexible flat foot has an arch that is present in open kinetic chain (non-weight bearing) and lost in closed kinetic chain (weight bearing). A rigid flatfoot has loss of the longitudinal arch height in open and closed kinetic chain (<LINK REF="REF-Napolitano-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Napolitano 2000</LINK>). Normally developing infants have a flexible flatfoot and gradually develop a normal arch during the first decade of life (<LINK REF="REF-Capello-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Capello 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Luhmann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luhmann 2000</LINK> suggested that the flexible type is a common diagnosis and is one which is usually not problematic and rarely needs treatment.The debate between treating and monitoring asymptomatic and symptomatic pes planus is on-going with no gold standard for treating children with pes planus (<LINK REF="REF-Bresnahan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bresnahan 2009</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2010</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a wide spectrum of severity and different aetiologies described in the literature for paediatric pes planus (<LINK REF="REF-Capello-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Capello 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Staheli-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staheli 1987</LINK> proposed a generic classification of flat foot deformities that differentiated between flat feet due to physiological and pathological aetiologies. <LINK REF="REF-Harris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2004</LINK> reported that pes planus may exist as an isolated pathology or as part of more widespread clinical pathologies such as generalised ligamentous laxity, neurological and muscular abnormalities, genetic conditions and syndromes, and collagen disorders. <LINK REF="REF-Luhmann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luhmann 2000</LINK> stated that tarsal coalitions are the most common cause of rigid flat feet in children and adolescents. <LINK REF="REF-Napolitano-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Napolitano 2000</LINK> postulated that obesity, rotational deformities producing in-toeing or out-toeing, accessory navicular, ankle equinus, and varus and valgus deformities of the tibia, and its relationship to the weight-bearing surface, are risk factors that may play a role in the development and function of the foot.</P>
<P>Not withstanding the underlying pathology of pes planus, there are conflicting opinions on the intervention of paediatric pes planus (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 1999</LINK>). The primary goals of treatment of flat feet are relief of pain or disability and the prevention of future disability (<LINK REF="REF-Capello-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Capello 1998</LINK>). While some experts consider that pes planus is normal in early childhood and that the condition usually resolves spontaneously without treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Volpon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volpon 1994</LINK>), other experts suggest treatment of the flexible form of pes planus is necessary as it may lead to disability, joint damage and, in later life, a rigid fixed foot deformity (<LINK REF="REF-Aharonson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aharonson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Connors-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connors 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Luhmann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luhmann 2000</LINK> suggested that the flexible type is a common diagnosis and is one which is usually not problematic and rarely needs treatment. The debate between treating and monitoring asymptomatic pes planus is on-going (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evans-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harris-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2004</LINK>) has published clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of paediatric pes planus. <LINK REF="REF-Labovitz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labovitz 2006</LINK> conducted a roundtable on the conservative and surgical management of difficult and controversial paediatric cases that included pes planus. An overriding concern is that flatfoot can cause debilitating foot pain in adults and should be diagnosed early and treated appropriately. The controversy about the management of pes planus arises from the contradictory opinions expressed by different authors. <LINK REF="REF-Glimore-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glimore 2002</LINK> reported that flexible paediatric pes planus should be observed unless painful, which requires a more extensive evaluation to determine the exact cause. <LINK REF="REF-Luhmann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luhmann 2000</LINK> reported that a rigid pes planus is often symptomatic and requires treatment. A flexible pes planus may be either asymptomatic or symptomatic (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The treatment of this condition can vary from conservative management to surgical approaches. The latter are used rarely and generally only after failure of conservative management. A plethora of conservative (non-surgical) interventions has been reported in the literature including advice, foot orthoses (shoe inserts), stretching, footwear selection and modifications, activity modifications, manipulation, serial casting, appropriate weight reduction and anti-inflammatory medications. Given the many and varied treatment options, there is a need to identify and evaluate the evidence from randomised trials of non-surgical interventions to inform the management of paediatric pes planus.</P>

<P>Since there is no universally accepted definition for pes planus, pes planus in this review is the term used to describe a recognizable clinical deformity created by malalignment at several adjacent joints of the foot (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2004</LINK>). We included trials involving children under 16 years old with a diagnosis or history of pes planus. Studies of various soft tissue diseases and pain due to tendinitis at all sites were eligible for inclusion provided that the pes planus pain results were presented separately. Studies where participants had plantar heel pain, stress fractures of the metatarsals, ankle fractures, rheumatoid foot pathologies, diabetic foot or neuromuscular conditions were also eligible for inclusion, that included children with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, Down's, Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Juvenile arthritis was included as pes planus is a common clinical feature of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>For each study, we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous outcomes. We planned to conduct meta-analyses; however we found insufficient data for meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of findings tables</HEADING>
<P>The main results of the review (pain reduction, function or disability, and number of patients experiencing any intervention-specific adverse event) were presented for the comparison custom-made foot orthoses versus control (shoe only) in a 'Summary of findings' table, which provides key information concerning the quality of evidence, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined and the sum of available data on the main outcomes, as recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2008a</LINK>). In addition to the absolute and relative magnitude of effect provided in the 'Summary of findings' table, the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) and number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) were calculated for each statistically significant estimate of effect, for any outcome. For dichotomous outcomes, NNT was to be calculated from the control group event rate and the relative risk using the Visual Rx NNT calculator (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2004</LINK>); however, relevant dichotomous outcomes were not reported in the included trials. For continuous outcomes (for example reduction in pain), the NNTB was calculated using the Wells calculator software available at the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group (CMSG) editorial office (http://www.cochranemsk.org/). The minimal clinically important differences (MCID) are used in the calculator: we assumed a MCID of 0.9 points for pain measured by a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) and 7 points for disability measured by the 100-point Disability subscale of the Foot Function Index, as calculated by <LINK REF="REF-Landorf-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landorf 2008</LINK>. Absolute change (benefit) was calculated from the mean difference and expressed as a percent and in the original units, and relative difference in the change from baseline was calculated as the absolute benefit divided by the baseline mean of the control group. The 'Summary of findings' table includes an overall grading of the evidence related to each of the main outcomes, using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2008b</LINK>).</P>

<P>Fifteen studies were originally identified for this review, with only three studies meeting the eligibility criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitford-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whitford 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wenger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wenger 1989</LINK>). One RCT was excluded as the intervention related to juvenile hallux valgus (<LINK REF="STD-Kilmartin-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kilmartin 1994</LINK>). Another RCT was excluded as the intervention specifically relating to metatarsus primus varus (<LINK REF="STD-Camin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Camin 2004</LINK>).

Additional information details of each of these excluded studies are reported in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table.</P>
<P>The three studies that were included were conducted in two countries (USA and Australia) and published in English.</P>
<P>One study evaluated 40 children, aged 5 to19 years, with diagnosed juvenile chronic arthritis with pes planus with pain (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2005</LINK>). The primary outcome measure was pain reduction using a Paediatric Pain questionnaire, measured on a 100 mm VAS. Secondary outcome measures included the Physical Functioning subscale of the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Varni-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varni 2002</LINK>). Foot function was assessed using the Foot Function Index (<LINK REF="REF-Budiman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Budiman 1991</LINK>). The Foot Function Index was developed to measure the impact of foot pathology on function in terms of pain, disability and activity restriction. A 50-foot timed walk was also evaluated. Each child was randomised into one of three intervention groups: (1) custom-made semi-rigid orthotics made of metal-particle reinforced plastic with shock-absorbing posts; (2) prefabricated shoe inserts made from flat neoprene; and (3) new supportive athletic shoes with a medial longitudinal arch and shock-absorbing insoles. All children received new athletic shoes at the beginning of the study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wenger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wenger 1989</LINK> evaluated 129 children, aged 1 to 6 years, with clinically diagnosed pes planus and no pain. Bilateral pes planus was diagnosed by visual observation of the valgus position of the heel and the low appearance of the arch upon weight bearing. Outcome measures included anterior-posterior radiographs and goniometric measurements of ankle joint dorsifllexion, an assessment for muscle tightness of the primary ankle plantarflexion muscles and joint laxity. Each child was randomised into one of four groups: (1) orthopaedic shoes with no corrective features, the shoes were normal in contour and contained a steel shank; (2) shoes with a Thomas heel, a long medial counter and a navicular pad; (3) shoes with a Thomas heel, a long medial counter and a heel cup; (4) shoes that had a University of California Biomechanics Laboratory (UCBL) custom-made plastic insert.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Whitford-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whitford 2007</LINK> evaluated 178 children, aged 7 to 11 years, with clinically diagnosed pes planus and no pain. Bilateral pes planus was diagnosed by the assessment of calcaneal eversion in the relaxed calcaneal stance position and by the navicular drop test. The navicular drop test measures the extent of excessive foot pronation. The primary outcomes measures included a motor proficiency test using the Bruininks Oseretsky Test (<LINK REF="REF-Reeves-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 1999</LINK>). This test consists of four subscales: running speed and agility, balance, bilateral co-ordination, and strength. Pain was assessed on a VAS for current pain using the Child Form of the Varni Thompson Paediatric Pain questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Varni-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varni 1996</LINK>). Self-perception was also measured using the 'Self-perception profile for children' (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Bergh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Bergh 2003</LINK>). Other variables measured included body mass index, ligamentous laxity and evaluation of ankle joint plantar flexors. Ligamentous laxity was measured using a joint hypermobility scale (<LINK REF="REF-Gedalia-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gedalia 1993</LINK>) and ankle joint dorsifllexion was measured with the knee both extended and flexed. Each child was randomised into one of three groups: (1) custom-made foot orthoses made from a rigid thermoplastic material with a vinyl cover; (2) prefabricated foot orthoses made from a semi-rigid thermoplastic material with a standard intrinsic heel postings of 4 ° and a 5 mm metatarsal rise; (3) no treatment. All children with shortened ankle joint plantar flexors were taught how to conduct calf muscle stretches at home and the researchers discussed suitable shoes with the parents.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2010-05-24 10:46:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All three trials reported that participants were randomised to an intervention, but only one trial adequately described the method used to generate the random sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Whitford-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whitford 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Wenger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wenger 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Whitford-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whitford 2007</LINK> did not describe if allocation of treatment was concealed. <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2005</LINK> attempted to conceal allocation but did not report the method used in enough detail for us to judge if concealment was adequate.</P>
<P>All three trials reported on the reasons patients withdrew from the study. Two studies were unlikely to have biased results due to participant withdrawals (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitford-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whitford 2007</LINK>). It is unclear if the exclusion of 25 non-compliant participants from <LINK REF="STD-Wenger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wenger 1989</LINK> biased the results of the study as the trial authors did not report which treatment groups these participants were from. We were unable to compare baseline characteristics such as age.</P>
<P>In all studies the outcome assessors were clearly blinded to participant status. Due to the nature of the interventions the criterion 'patient blinded' could not be achieved. In the three studies, treatment and control groups were likely similar at baseline, based on the shared characteristics of the study population, for example children who met the variable criteria of flexible flatfeet.</P>
<P>Care programmes other than the trial options were the same in all treatment groups. <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2005</LINK> issued athletic shoes to all children, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Whitford-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whitford 2007</LINK> gave advice to all parents about suitable shoes. <LINK REF="STD-Wenger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wenger 1989</LINK> provided a pedorthotist for all follow-up visits to ensure that all the corrective shoes were fitted according to the standards and specifications of the Prescription Footwear Association. <LINK REF="STD-Whitford-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whitford 2007</LINK> also prescribed calf muscle stretches to children who required stretching. The inclusion and exclusion criteria used in all studies were clearly defined.</P>
<P>The primary outcome measure of pain reduction was reported in <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2005</LINK>; measured, but not reported in a form that could be extracted into meta-analysis in <LINK REF="STD-Whitford-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whitford 2007</LINK>; and not reported in <LINK REF="STD-Wenger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wenger 1989</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Whitford-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whitford 2007</LINK> measured pain using a continuous outcome measure (VAS scale) but reported the proportions of participants with or without pain at follow up. <LINK REF="STD-Wenger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wenger 1989</LINK> stated that parents reported a reduction in pain symptoms in children with flat feet across the four groups (corrective shoes, heel cup, UCBL insert and the control group) but no data were provided.</P>
<P>However, secondary outcome measures were not clearly defined in the trials. Follow up was varied in all three studies. Two trials were conducted over 12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitford-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whitford 2007</LINK>); <LINK REF="STD-Wenger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wenger 1989</LINK> was conducted over 36 weeks.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-08-10 14:32:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a lack of good quality studies that have evaluated non-surgical interventions for paediatric pes planus. Evidence from a single trial indicates that custom-made foot orthoses may improve pain and disability in children with juvenile chronic arthritis and pes planus (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2005</LINK>), <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, but the clinical importance of the improvements are questionable, and further studies are likely to change the conclusions. There was clinical and methodological heterogeneity across studies that precluded meta-analysis and robust overall conclusions. Furthermore, the small number of relevant trials and limited sample sizes precludes firm conclusions regarding any one intervention. Sources of heterogeneity include the age ranges studied, co-morbidities, interventions, and outcome measures chosen.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Methodological issues</HEADING>
<P>The sample size of the treatment trials ranged from 40 to 164, with two trials having less than 100 participants. With such small sample sizes it is not possible to draw robust conclusions. This is primarily due to a number of factors including limited number of studies per interventions compared combined with the small sample sizes of the studies. Therefore, as a consequence of data heterogeneity no meta-analysis could be meaningfully conducted.</P>
<P>The three studies were single-blind trials with the investigators being aware of the type of intervention received, which may have resulted in performance and detection (assessor) bias. Blinded healthcare providers may also differ from non-blinded ones in their degree of attention to patients, or in their use of alternative forms of care. Time frames varied across the three trials, ranging from three to 36 weeks, therefore making comparisons difficult.</P>
<P>The age ranges differed across the three studies and it is therefore difficult to generalise about non-surgical intervention for paediatric pes planus in children. For example, one studied five to 19 year olds, one studied seven to 11 year olds, and the other studied one to six year olds. One of the studies included children with juvenile chronic arthritis (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2005</LINK>) while the other two studies included otherwise healthy children with flat feet (<LINK REF="STD-Wenger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wenger 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitford-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whitford 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The current review demonstrated a limited range of non-surgical interventions for paediatric pes planus. The only studies eligible for inclusion in this systematic review utilised foot orthoses and shoes. The range of foot orthoses reported on included prefabricated, custom-made othoses and heel cups specifically designed for paediatric pes planus (<LINK REF="STD-Wenger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wenger 1989</LINK>). There was limited technical information about the manufacturing process, construction and prescription of the foot orthoses. The type of shoes included orthopaedic shoes (<LINK REF="STD-Wenger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wenger 1989</LINK>), new supportive athletic shoes (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2005</LINK>), and a child's own shoes worn at the time of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Whitford-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whitford 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one trial reported on adverse effects and the authors reported no adverse effects with the use of foot orthoses and shoes (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2005</LINK>). However, with only one trial reporting on this variable, and given the limitations of the data available, a degree of caution must be noted. No trial reported patient comfort. <LINK REF="REF-Landorf-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landorf 2007</LINK>
<B> </B>wrote that orthotic comfort may be an important variable and may explain the efficacy (or perceived efficacy) of foot orthoses for any intervention programme. Future research may consider evaluating self-reported comfort.</P>
<P>Previous systematic reviews have reported on the efficacy of foot orthoses by performing either kinematic or kinetic gait analysis, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hawke-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawke 2008</LINK>;<B> </B>
<LINK REF="REF-Hawke--2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawke 2009</LINK>). In the current review only hand-held goniometry was performed, in two studies, and data were not available to conduct any analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Wenger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wenger 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitford-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whitford 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>A number of outcome measures were reported in the three trials. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitford-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whitford 2007</LINK>) investigated the primary outcome specified by this review (pain reduction) but over three months and 12 months, respectively. It is unclear if the Varni Thompson Paediatric Pain questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Varni-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varni 2002</LINK>) used by <LINK REF="STD-Whitford-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whitford 2007</LINK> related to symptoms in the children's feet and lower extremities only, or if whole body pain was included. One trial conducted a subgroup analysis of pain reduction for those children who reported lower-limb pain at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Whitford-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whitford 2007</LINK>). However, the study design did not have an a priori hypothesis to specifically test the effects of functional foot orthoses on the treatment of painful pes planus.</P>
<P>The three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wenger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wenger 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitford-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Whitford 2007</LINK>) did not use the same secondary outcome measures, which made it difficult to combine the results. A number of secondary outcome measures in the three trials were generic outcome measures not specific to the foot and may not be specific to symptomatic flatfoot. Radiographic evaluation was reported in one study but it was not nominated as an outcome in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Wenger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wenger 1989</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-05-06 15:48:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence from one randomised controlled trial investigating children with chronic juvenile arthritis suggests that custom-made foot orthoses may be effective in reducing pain compared with compared with prefabricated and newly supportive athletic shoes after three months. Based on the results of this review we also conclude that there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials on the efficacy of foot orthoses for asymptomatic paediatric pes planus. Furthermore, there is no evidence from randomised trials for any other non-surgical intervention. Intervention with foot orthoses has few side effects, but the optimal choice of orthoses remains unclear and long-term implications are lacking.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-04-18 12:43:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pes planus is a common musculoskeletal condition that often presents itself in clinical practice. The methodological quality of studies investigating the effectiveness of non-surgical interventions has to be improved. From a methodological perspective, one general foot score would allow pooling of the results.</P>
<P>Future studies should focus on the most clinically relevant outcomes, which may include pain reduction and indices that evaluate function and disability. It is only through the use of similar outcome measures that studies can be combined and hence we will be able to obtain pooled estimates. We can then obtain some consensus on the varied non-surgical intervention options.</P>
<P>Further trials are required examining both the short-term and long-term benefits of non-surgical interventions such as foot orthoses or footwear. Future trials are required, with more participants, to evaluate if the differences are real and clinically worthwhile. Short-term benefit needs to be established first in order to justify the considerable resources required, as well as the ethical implications involved, for a lengthy study in this area. Subsequently, a follow-up period of at least five years is needed because of the bony changes within the lower limb and foot in children of this age to observe if pes planus in children predispose to problems in adults. If there no differences are observed then there would be no need to treat asymptomatic pes planus.</P>
<P>Further studies are required to evaluate intervention comparisons, that is interventions need to be evaluated against standard conservative care. If feasible, foot orthoses should be compared with other modalities such as shoe designs, muscle stretching and strengthening, strapping and joint range of motion exercises. Future studies should also report on the technical information of the foot orthoses, commencing with the manufacturing process and extending to the materials used in the construction of foot orthoses.</P>

<P>Personal Description: Occupation UK Podiatrist</P>
<P>Feedback: When one of my daughters was born 32 years ago the first hing I noticed (as soon as she was delivered) was her left foot laying flat against the tibia, and fibular - so much so that a clear imprint of the outline of the bones was observed. At the time I was at Podiatry college in my 2nd year. The condition was undoubtedly T.Calcaneovalgus, and in my opinion severe. The foot was dorisflexed, abducted in my view as an adult it would have exhibited severe abnormal pronation, with an everted calcaneum, a flat arch with the whole of the mid tarsal joint contacting the ground plantar grade. An orthopaedic surgeon was asked to look at the feet, and as he felt all the components of the foot were there we were referred to a physiotherapist for treatment. The treatment was of course manipulation of the foot, with splinting for several months. The splint was removed 6 or 7 times a day, and the foot manipulated. Today looking at my daughter's feet there is no difference between either of them, and both stand correctly in their neutral position. Interestingly, on our last appointment with the physiotherapist she had asked a father to bring in his child with the same condition, and born at the same time. The child had not received manipulation, and in consequence there was no real change in the foot's appearance from birth. Over my 30 years of practice I have seen many conditions of pes planus, and wondered if there is a relationship between this and untreated mild, moderate or severe T.calcaneovalgus: does this go unseen, and untreated. If it was picked up by the podiatrist at birth is it possible the condition of pes planus in many folk could be eliminated. Just recently a toddler was referred to me with bi-lateral flat feet: heels everted, feet abducted, with metatarsals, and metatarsal joints appearing to be either close, or contacting the ground. The father has almost a cavoid foot, and the mother's foot is quite normal. Bearing in mind the limited evidence for many treatments I think I shall recommend small orthosis together with some manipulation. When I have enquired of old, and older clients in the past the treatment appears to be just exercises, which seem to have made no difference to the adult foot at all.</P>

<P>Dear Mr Cooper</P>
<P>Thank you for your response relating to the Cochrane review. Dealing with children&#8217;s feet is an issue. Dr Evans has recently described a traffic light system for treating flatfeet that has been strongly debated [1-3]. From a clinical viewpoint identifying a foot problem at a very young age is still based upon clinical expertise and personal choice in terms of management [4]. Unfortunately, this is the lowest form of evidence [5] and further work is needed in this area to ensure that clinicians are using an evidence-base approach to manage flatfeet in children.</P>
<P>From the Cochrane review we found only the use of foot orthoses for the management of paediatric flatfeet [4]. The use of manipulation as a form of treatment has not been reported in the literature. However, in a recent critical review [6] we found one article that evaluated a group of children who followed a rehabilitative programme versus a historical group of children who had been treated with insoles and orthopaedic footwear [7]. Over a 2 year period, 300 children (mean age was 3.4 years; 184 male, 116 female) with bilateral flexible flatfoot (600 feet) were recruited and underwent a rehabilitative programme for a mean period of 2.8 years. The rehabilitative programme consisted of simple therapeutic exercises, which could be easily learnt by both patients and their caregivers. These children were compared to a historical group of children (674 feet) who had been treated in a paediatric department for infantile flexible flatfoot with the use of foot orthoses. The results demonstrated that in the two groups (children treated with rehabilitation and children treated with foot orthoses), the rehabilitative approach seems to be more effective. The authors suggested that rehabilitation has a marginal influence on the natural history of paediatric valgus flexible flatfoot even though it plays a role in maintaining good flexibility of the flatfoot thus limiting functional impairment.</P>
<P>In summary, the use of exercise is commonly reported but the evidence is limited. Future studies need to further investigate the potential effect of rehabilitative exercises, foot manipulation, and continue to investigate the efficacy of foot orthoses, footwear modifications, and consider the effect of other contemporary clinical interventions.</P>

<P>Personal Description: Occupation General Practice Resident</P>
<P>Feedback: During our residency all students are required to make an "critically appraised topic" based on a personal case during practice. The problem of painful flat feet or pes planus came to my attention, so I was very pleased to find this review on the subject and would like to thank you for your clear insighted review. Clearly much more research needs to be done to make evidence. I have one question though about the included article of Powell (2005). As I understood inclusion criterium amongst others was patients with pes planus. In the short description of the article Powell (2005) was stated that it included cases of pes planus with juvenile idiopatic arthritis, although in this article this was not clear to me. Could you perhaps give more details on why the participants of this study would have pes planus?</P>

<P>Pes planus (or a valgus/pronated rearfoot posture) is by far the most common presentation in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, but hindfoot varus posture can also occur and is usually associated with significantly reduced joint range of motion.  I have included three references that may assist you:</P>

<P>The Cochrane review team, at the time of reviewing the literature made a decision to include the Powell et al (2005) study based upon the current evidence of pes planus in this population. </P>
<P>One issue that has not been addressed, and is debated in the Cochrane review and other articles we have published, is the definition of pes planus. Perhaps one day a consensus of opinion will address the problem.</P>
