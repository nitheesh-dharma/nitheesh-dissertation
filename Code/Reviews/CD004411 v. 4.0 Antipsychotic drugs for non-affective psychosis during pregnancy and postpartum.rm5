<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Women who suffer with psychotic conditions who become pregnant are usually treated with antipsychotic drugs. The risks of harm to the offspring associated with exposure to these drugs, in utero or through breast-feeding, are unknown. We aimed to find good quality evidence from randomised controlled trials on the risks and benefits of antipsychotic drugs during pregnancy and breastfeeding for both the woman and the foetus/infant. We found none. Ethical constraints concerning randomisation of treatment for pregnant and breastfeeding women, the logistics of such a study and a lack of impetus from the pharmaceutical industry in this area may explain the lack of research. However, the continued use of antipsychotic drugs in these women during pregnancy and lactation without sound evidence raises serious clinical and ethical concerns.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Antipsychotics are commonly prescribed for women suffering psychotic illnesses during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The potential adverse consequences of these different options are multiple and complex, impacting on the foetus, neonate, infant and early development of the child as well as the woman herself.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To establish whether the benefits of taking antipsychotic drugs outweigh the risks for pregnant or post partum women.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (January 2003) was searched in order to identify all published trials of women during pregnancy or the postpartum period. We inspected all references of all identified studies. If any studies had been found, the first authors of each included study would have been contacted.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled clinical trials investigating the effects of any type of antipsychotic drug compared with any other treatment option (including standard psychosocial care, any other antipsychotic drug, or an alternative therapy such as electro-convulsive therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy) and involving pregnant women and/or women during the postpartum period diagnosed with a non-affective psychotic disorder.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Citations, and where possible, abstracts were independently inspected by reviewers and the papers ordered were scrutinised and quality assessed. Data would have been extracted independently by at least two reviewers. Binary outcomes were to have been analysed using Relative Risks (RR) and their 95% Confidence Intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We found no trials that met the broad inclusion criteria.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Current guidelines and clinical practice for the use of antipsychotic drugs in women with non-affective disorders during pregnancy and postpartum are not based on evidence from randomised controlled trials. Although ethical concerns have to date precluded the use of randomised controlled trials to address this research topic, the continued use of antipsychotic drugs in this group of women in itself poses significant clinical and ethical problems. Evidence is required from large pragmatic trials that reflect routine clinical practice, examine a broad range of outcomes and accurately quantify risks and benefits to both mothers and their offspring, so that comparison between different treatment options can be made.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-02 16:00:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Around 2% of women aged 16-44 years (<LINK REF="REF-McCormick-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 1995</LINK>) suffer from a non-affective psychotic illness. Of this 2%, it has been estimated that more than half give birth (<LINK REF="REF-McGrath-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGrath 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Howard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2002</LINK>). However, there is currently very little evidence regarding the use of antipsychotics for non-affective psychosis during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Weighing the risks and benefits of treating mothers with antipsychotics requires assessment of clinical effectiveness versus the risks of toxicity to mother, foetus and neonate. This must be compared with: i. the risks to mother, foetus, neonate, infant and child of medically untreated psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-Altshuler-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altshuler 1996</LINK>); ii. the risks and benefits of using alternative therapies, for example, cognitive behavioural therapy or electro-convulsive therapy. It is widely agreed that no treatment option is free of risk (<LINK REF="REF-Pinkofsky-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinkofsky 2002</LINK>). Despite this lack of evidence it is likely that most women with schizophrenia-like illnesses are treated with antipsychotics throughout pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 2001</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>There are multiple potential risks of toxicity from exposure to antipsychotic drugs during pregnancy and the period after delivery. These include obstetric complications, birth defects, neurobehavioural and neonatal adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Pinkofsky-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinkofsky 2002</LINK>). The decision to withhold medication, however, may result in exacerbation of existing symptoms, relapse, and increased risk of deliberate self-harm or suicide.There is also some evidence to suggest that untreated psychiatric disorder may potentially affect fetoplacental integrity and foetal central nervous system development (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1998</LINK>). Poor clinical outcomes for mothers may in turn result in poorer mother-infant interaction and deficits in infant/child development.<BR/>
<BR/>The gap in the evidence base is partly attributable to ethical and methodological problems. To date, ethical issues have restricted the use of randomisation in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Austin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 1998</LINK>), and the study of longer-term neurobehavioural and developmental outcomes is problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2002</LINK>). This lack of evidence raises questions regarding appropriate management and treatment of an already vulnerable group of women and children.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To establish the risks and benefits of taking any antipsychotic drug during pregnancy.</P>
<P>To establish the risks and benefits of different classes of antipsychotic drugs (i.e. 'atypical' versus 'typical' types, depot versus oral medication).</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All relevant randomised controlled trials. Where a trial was described as 'double-blind' but it was implied that the study was randomised, these trials would have been included in a sensitivity analysis. If there was no substantive difference within primary outcomes (see types of outcome measures) when these 'implied randomisation' studies were added, then they would have been included in the final analysis. If there was a substantive difference, only clearly randomised trials would have been utilised and the results of the sensitivity analysis described in the text. Quasi-randomised studies, such as those allocating by using alternate days of the week, were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Women during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period, with a newly or previously diagnosed (using any criteria) non-affective psychotic disorder. </P>
<P>A 'non-affective psychotic disorder' was defined as a specific diagnosis of schizophrenia or as a variant of this such as a 'schizotypal', 'schizoaffective', or 'persistent delusional' disorder, however defined. </P>
<P>Studies using broad diagnostic groupings (such as 'serious/chronic mental illness', 'psychosis/psychotic illness') would have been included and, where possible, primary authors contacted to establish what proportion of all participants had non-affective types of psychosis. Data would have been included in the review provided that 75% or more of the participants had a non-affective psychotic disorder. Bipolar disorder/manic depression, depressive illnesses and problems primarily associated with alcohol &amp; substance misuse were excluded.</P>
<P>We defined 'postpartum period' in the standard way, i.e. six-weeks post delivery, or accepted the definition as given in the primary studies.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Any antipsychotic drug listed in Martindale's Extra Pharmacopoeia (<LINK REF="REF-Martindale-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martindale 1996</LINK>) was included. The interventions were categorised as follows:</P>

<P>2. Atypical antipsychotic drugs: amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, sulpiride, thioridazine, ziprasidone, zotepine.</P>
<P>3. Typical antipsychotic drugs: benperidol, chlorpromazine hydrochloride, droperidol, flupenthixol, fluphenazine hypdrochloride, haloperidol, loxapine, methotrimeprazine, oxypertine, pericyazine, perphenazine, pimozide, prochlorperazine, promazine hydrochloride, trifluoperazine, zuclopenthixol acetate and dihydrochloride.</P>
<P>4. Depot antipsychotic drugs: flupenthixol decanoate, fluphenazine decanoate, haloperidol decanoate, pipothiazine palmitate, risperidone (depot), zuclopenthixol decanoate.</P>
<P>5. Oral antipsychotic drugs.</P>
<P>6. Routine/standard psychosocial care delivered by primary care/community mental health teams (i.e. not a discrete named package of care).</P>
<P>7. Discrete named package of care such as family intervention or cognitive behavioural therapy.</P>
<P>8. Electro-convulsive therapy.</P>

<P>2. Reference searching<BR/>The references of all identified studies were also inspected for more studies.</P>
<P>3. Personal contact<BR/>The first author of each included study would have been contacted for information regarding unpublished trials and extra data on the published trials.</P>
</OTHER_SEARCHES>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>1. Selection of studies<BR/>Two reviewers (RW, KA) independently inspected all citations of studies identified by the search, with cases of disagreement resolved by discussion. In the event of a failure to reach complete agreement, the full article was acquired for further inspection, with the decision regarding inclusion again based on consent among the three reviewers. If no decision was reached on the basis of published information, primary authors were contacted to seek clarification. </P>
<P>2. Quality assessment<BR/>Two sets of criteria, the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2002</LINK>) and the Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) were used to assess the quality of selected studies. The first set is based on evidence of a strong association between poor concealment of allocation schedule and overestimation of effect sizes (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>), and is defined as follows:</P>
<P>a. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>b. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results)<BR/>c. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment)</P>
<P>The Jadad Scale measures a wider range of factors that impact on the quality of a trial, and includes the following items:</P>
<P>1. Was the study described as 'randomised'?<BR/>2. Was the study described as 'double-blind'?<BR/>3. Was there a description of loss to follow-up?</P>
<P>Each item scores one point if the answer is positive, and for the first two items only, an additional point is given if the randomisation / blinding procedures are described. Thus scores on items 1 and 2 can be 0, 1 or 2; scores for item 3 can be 0 or 1.</P>
<P>For the purposes of this review, trials would have been included if they met either criteria A or B as described in the Cochrane Reviewers Handbook. The Jadad scale was not used for inclusion/exclusion purposes, but was instead used in sensitivity analyses to explore heterogeneity of results according to study quality.</P>
<P>3. Data extraction<BR/>Two reviewers (RW, KA) independently extracted data from included trials, with any disagreements resolved by discussion. In the event of any disagreement persisting, the authors of the primary study were contacted to seek clarification. Full documentation was made of all decisions regarding study selection, quality assessment or data extraction.</P>
<P>4. Data syntheses/analyses</P>
<P>4.1 Attrition rates<BR/>For all outcomes other than 'leaving the study early', a loss to follow-up rate of up to 50% for short/medium term outcomes, and 60% or less for long-term outcomes, was deemed acceptable. Above these rates, data were not included. </P>
<P>4.2 Intention-to-treat (ITT)<BR/>All review analyses would have been performed by ITT unless stated otherwise. Provided that at least 50% of people in short/medium-term and 40% in long-term studies completed the trial, all people allocated to intervention would have been counted, whether or not they completed follow-up, assuming no change in outcome status for dropouts. Data would have been excluded from studies where the attrition rate was higher than the accepted level, apart from the outcome of 'leaving the study early'. In the assessment of other outcomes, people leaving early were considered to have had the negative outcome, except for the event of death. The impact of including studies with high attrition rates (25-50/60%) would have been analysed in a sensitivity analysis. If inclusion of data from this latter group had resulted in a substantive change in the estimate of effect their data would not have been added to trials with less attrition, but presented separately.</P>
<P>4.3 Data types<BR/>Outcomes are assessed using continuous (e.g. average changes on a behaviour scale), categorical (e.g. categories on a behaviour scale, such as 'little', 'moderate' or 'much' change), or dichotomous measures (e.g. 'no important' versus 'important' changes in an individual's behaviour). Currently RevMan does not support categorical data and so these would have been presented only in the text of the review.</P>
<P>4.3.1 Dichotomous/binary data<BR/>4.3.1.1 Cut-offs: where possible attempts would have been made to dichotomise outcome data, by identifying meaningful cut-offs on rating scales (e.g. 'clinically improved' versus 'not clinically improved'). Cut-offs for clinical effectiveness that were pre-designated by authors of primary studies would have been used where available.</P>
<P>4.3.1.2 Measure of effect: Relative Risks (RR) and their 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) would have been used as the key summary statistic of effect size for binary outcomes (in preference to Odds Ratios - ORs). The RR has been shown to be more intuitive than the OR (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>), with the OR frequently interpreted by clinicians as an RR, resulting in overestimation of perceived effect sizes (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). Where possible, the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH) would have been calculated using an online calculator (http://www.nntonline.net).</P>
<P>4.3.2 Continuous data<BR/>4.3.2.1 Rating scales: a wide range of rating scales is used for measuring mental health outcomes, although the quality of a proportion of these is questionable. Therefore as a minimum standard, outcomes on these scales would have been included in the analyses only if both reliability (i.e. is the instrument consistent within and between observers?) and validity (i.e. does the instrument measure what it purports to measure?) had been indicated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The other minimum standards set would have been: the rating scale was either i. a self report; or ii. completed by an independent rater or relative (but not the therapist). If the rater was also the therapist, the study would have been tagged as being 'prone to bias' and subjected to sensitivity analyses. Where possible, direct comparisons would have been made between trials that used the same scale to assess specific outcomes. If continuous data had been presented for different scales rating the same effect, both sets of data would have been presented and the general direction of effect inspected.<BR/>
<BR/>4.3.2.2 Distributions: continuous outcome data for trials in the mental health field are commonly non-normally distributed. To avoid inappropriate application of parametric methods to non-parametric data, the following standards would have been applied prior to analysis:<BR/>i. standard deviations (SDs) and means were reported (or were derivable) from the published data, or were obtainable from the authors; ii. double the SD (2SD) was smaller than the mean (if 2SD is larger than the mean, it is unlikely to be a good measure of the centre of the distribution - <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). If a scale started from a positive value, e.g. PANSS, which has possible values from 30 to 210, the calculation outlined in ii. would have been adjusted for scale starting point - i.e. a skewed distribution would have been indicated if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. Trial data not meeting standards i. and ii. would have been not entered into RevMan for analysis, but would have been reported in the text of the results section. </P>
<P>4.3.2.3 Intention-to-treat analysis: for continuous outcomes this optimal analytical approach is not generally possible, and therefore analyses would have been restricted only to those people who completed the study (i.e. completer-only analyses).</P>
<P>4.3.2.4 Endpoint versus change data: where possible endpoint data would have been presented and if both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcomes then only the former would have been reported in this review.</P>
<P>4.3.2.5 Summary statistic: for all continuous outcomes, a weighted mean difference (WMD) between treatment groups would have been calculated as the key summary statistic.</P>
<P>4.4 Statistical modelling technique<BR/>Random effects models, which take account of differences between studies, would have been used regardless of the result of the chi-square test for heterogeneity (although analyses using fixed effects models would also have been undertaken for comparative purposes). </P>
<P>4.5 Studies deploying cluster randomisation<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. First, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). If data had been presented corrected by a design effect (see below) this would have been pooled with non-cluster studies.</P>
<P>If data had been reported as if from a non-cluster randomised study and the analyses were based on the numbers of individuals with no account taken of the clustering effect, the reviewers would have followed the statistical advice given by the MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK. Dr Julian Higgins has advised that binary data as presented in the report should be divided by a 'design effect' and that this should be calculated using the mean number of families in the groups (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC]. If authors of the study did not or were unable to supply ICC we would have assumed this to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If clustering had not been accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented continuous data in a table, with an (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. If such situations arise in subsequent versions of this review, we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.6 Sensitivity analyses<BR/>These would have been used to address the following issues: attrition rates (i.e. intention-to-treat versus completer-only analysis for dichotomous outcomes), cases where the rater and therapist were the same person, probable unit-of-analysis errors, and questions of overall study quality. For example, if a trial had been described as 'double-blind' but it was implied that the study was randomised, these trials would have been subject to sensitivity analysis. If there was no substantive difference within primary outcomes when these 'implied randomisation' studies were added, then they would have been included in the final analysis. If there was a substantive difference, only clearly randomised trials would have been utilised and the results of the sensitivity analysis described in the text.</P>
<P>4.7 Heterogeneity<BR/>This would have been assessed informally by visual inspection of tables and graphical presentations and by formal statistical testing using chi-square tests for heterogeneity (using p&lt;0.1 as a cut-off for a positive result). Once this assessment had been carried out, the individual trials that accounted for the heterogeneity would have been identified. Possible reasons for the heterogeneity would have been explored in detail in the 'Discussion' section.</P>
<P>4.8 Investigating possible publication bias<BR/>Data from all identified and selected trials would have been entered into a funnel graph (i.e. trial effect size versus trial sample size) in an attempt to assess the likelihood of overt publication bias. A formal test of funnel plot asymmetry (indicating potential publication bias) would have been undertaken (using p&lt;0.1 as a cut-off for a positive result). Formal statistical testing would not have been undertaken if only a small number of studies had been selected, or if there was little variation in sample size.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>1. Excluded studies<BR/>The search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register identified a total of twenty published references to nineteen different studies. Five references were rejected as not being relevant on the basis of information provided in the title and abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1972</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Modai-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Modai 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Schrut-1955" TYPE="STUDY">Schrut 1955</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Spencer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Spencer 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trandafir-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Trandafir 1998</LINK>). Full text copies of the original papers were obtained for the remaining fifteen references. One of these was written in Japanese (<LINK REF="STD-Hayano-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hayano 1993</LINK>), one in French (<LINK REF="STD-Albert-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Albert 1970</LINK>), and one in Spanish (<LINK REF="STD-San-Miguel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">San Miguel 1995</LINK>). Colleagues who are fluent in these languages read the Methods and Results sections of these papers in order to screen for relevance.</P>
<P>Using a hierarchical approach to inclusion/exclusion (i.e. appropriate study design, followed by participants, intervention, outcome, in that order), the studies were excluded for the following reasons:</P>
<P>1.1 Study was not a randomised controlled trial<BR/>Five studies were excluded on this basis (<LINK REF="STD-Azima-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Azima 1958</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1972</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hardwick-1957" TYPE="STUDY">Hardwick 1957</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hayano-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hayano 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Schrut-1955" TYPE="STUDY">Schrut 1955</LINK>). One was a case series (<LINK REF="STD-Hardwick-1957" TYPE="STUDY">Hardwick 1957</LINK>) and in one the patients were assigned to intervention groups according to their diagnosis (<LINK REF="STD-Azima-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Azima 1958</LINK>). Another was a retrospective observational study (<LINK REF="STD-Hayano-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hayano 1993</LINK>) and two were prospective clinical controlled trials (CCTs) (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1972</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Schrut-1955" TYPE="STUDY">Schrut 1955</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Cohler-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Cohler 1982</LINK>) was classified as 'probably randomised' as the study design and allocation procedure were not well described. This study was not excluded at this stage, but was later excluded for a different reason (i.e. participants were not relevant to this review).</P>
<P>1.2 Study was randomised but the participants were not relevant to the review<BR/>The remaining fourteen studies were excluded on this basis (<LINK REF="STD-Albert-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Albert 1970</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Breier-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Breier 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cohler-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Cohler 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fann-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Fann 1976</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lieberman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lieberman 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Modai-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Modai 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Paykel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Paykel 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-San-Miguel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">San Miguel 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Spencer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Spencer 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Swenson-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Swenson 1956</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trandafir-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Trandafir 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wadzisz-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Wadzisz 1969</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Washburn-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Washburn 1976</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials involved only children (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Spencer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Spencer 1994</LINK>). In six studies none of the women involved in the trials were pregnant or going through the postpartum period (<LINK REF="STD-Albert-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Albert 1970</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Breier-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Breier 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lieberman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lieberman 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Modai-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Modai 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Swenson-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Swenson 1956</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Washburn-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Washburn 1976</LINK>). </P>
<P>In three studies, very small numbers of relevant participants were studied. <LINK REF="STD-Fann-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Fann 1976</LINK> only included one participant with postpartum psychosis. In <LINK REF="STD-San-Miguel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">San Miguel 1995</LINK> there were two and <LINK REF="STD-Wadzisz-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Wadzisz 1969</LINK> contained two women with puerperal psychosis. In the protocol for this review we stated that 75% of all participants had to have a relevant disorder, unless results were provided separately for the post-partum women. Results were not reported separately so these studies had to be excluded. </P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Trandafir-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Trandafir 1998</LINK> women during pregnancy or the postpartum period were specifically excluded, and in <LINK REF="STD-Cohler-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Cohler 1982</LINK> psychotic mothers were investigated, but not during pregnancy or postpartum. </P>
<P>Finally <LINK REF="STD-Paykel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Paykel 2000</LINK> is not yet fully published, but participants did not have a psychotic disorder on recruitment. This interesting study addresses another question related to this review - can further episodes of postpartum psychosis be prevented for women made vulnerable by a past history of psychosis during or directly after pregnancy? It might be possible to include this study of prevention of postpartum relapse in different related reviews. </P>
<P>2. Included studies<BR/>No studies met the inclusion criteria for this review.</P>
<P>3. Studies ongoing or awaiting assessment<BR/>No studies are ongoing or awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>4. Ongoing<BR/>The reviewers know of no relevant ongoing studies.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>No studies fulfilled the criteria for inclusion, and so none were excluded on the grounds of poor methodology.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>1. The search<BR/>The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register is the most comprehensive trials register of its kind, yet no trials met the inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>2. The excluded studies<BR/>Closer scrutiny of the nineteen excluded studies suggests that our entry criteria were not too restrictive. In five cases the study design was not a randomised controlled trial and in the other fourteen the participants investigated were not relevant to the review. Such a high degree of irrelevance can be explained by the fact that a very broad set of search terms was used. These terms were chosen in order to maximise sensitivity but as a result specificity was low.</P>
<P>3. COMPARISON: ANY ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUG versus ANY OTHER TREATMENT OPTION (INCLUDING ANY OTHER ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUG)<BR/>There are no data to present.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>1. The search<BR/>It may be that our search failed to identify relevant studies. Overall, the probability that any large informative trials were missed would appear to be low as such studies would have been widely referenced in international literature. The reviewers would like to hear of any studies that have not been identified by the search. Trials with equivocal results or where a treatment effect was not clearly demonstrated, and those written up in languages other than English, are known to be less likely to be published (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1998</LINK>). It is therefore possible that we could have missed these trials. Also our search used English phrases and this could have resulted in a reduced sensitivity to detect trials written up in other languages. However, the trials register is indexed in English. </P>
<P>It is also likely that many studies might have inadvertently recruited psychotic women who were pregnant or postpartum even where the design of the study precluded it. The reviewers would be very interested to receive any data about these women and the studies they were involved in. </P>
<P>2. COMPARISON: ANY ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUG versus ANY OTHER TREATMENT OPTION (INCLUDING ANY OTHER ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUG)<BR/>The lack of relevant studies identified by the review is a reflection of the ethical and methodological obstacles that we alluded to in the Background section. Firstly, random allocation of vulnerable unwell women during or shortly after pregnancy to one treatment or another may not be acceptable to the client group, their families, ethics committees or even trialists. For various reasons this may be more problematic for psychiatry than for perinatologists. Informed consent is difficult, although no different than for other trials of psychotic people. These women are also rare. Puerperal psychosis is not common and it would take considerable co-ordination to ensure that adequate numbers of women could be recruited to a specific study. Also giving women a class of drug that has potential to cause harm to the unborn foetus, neonate or infant has clearly been a strong impediment to the conduct of experimental research in this area. In addition, the lack of large pharmaceutical company-led clinical trials probably reflects the fear in the industry concerning how adverse outcomes might damage a particular product's image, and the recognition that this is not a large market for their products: certainly not one for which such a risk is worthwhile. </P>
<P>One of the studies identified by the search (<LINK REF="STD-Paykel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Paykel 2000</LINK>) is a trial in which an antipsychotic drug (haloperidol) was randomly assigned to women 72 hours after delivery. Although the study was excluded from this review as participants were free of psychosis on recruitment, it does indicate a need for a further review of preventive treatments against acute postpartum psychotic episodes.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. For women with postpartum psychosis and their families<BR/>Women who become psychotic during or directly after pregnancy are currently made yet more vulnerable by the complete absence of objective trial-based evidence concerning which drug is safest to stop the distressing or even dangerous symptoms of the psychosis. It could be argued that current practice is not ethical outside of a well-designed randomised study. </P>
<P>2. For clinicians<BR/>It is likely that clinicians will continue with their current practice of using clinical judgement and prescribing patterns to guide their choice of treatment. This raises important clinical and ethical concerns for the current use of antipsychotic drugs for women during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Such treatment cannot be considered to be evidence-based. Difficult though it is for researchers to undertake trials in this population it does seem remarkable that the drug treatment of such vulnerable women and their children is left to opinion-based policy that has so often proved erroneous. Women with pregnancy related psychosis are often treated through specialist teams. These clinical teams have an opportunity to design and undertake a pioneering randomised study. </P>
<P>3. For policy-makers, funders and ethical committees<BR/>At present policy-makers have no sound evidence base on which to generate guidelines for the use of antipsychotic drugs in treating women with non-affective psychoses during pregnancy or the postpartum period. As a result, they are likely to have to continue basing their recommendations on habit, opinion, and historical clinical practice. In order to change this situation, funding bodies must consider making these women a priority for future research and ethical committees need to carefully re-evaluate the ethical issues concerning the random allocation of these drugs in pregnant and postpartum women. Until the risks and benefits for the different treatment options are accurately quantified and weighed against each other, the continued use of antipsychotic drugs in these women without a sound evidence-base raises major clinical and ethical concerns.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. General<BR/>If the authors of the excluded studies had made all data widely available, we would at least have some hypothesis generating data on the effects of antipsychotics for partum-related psychoses (<LINK REF="STD-Fann-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Fann 1976</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-San-Miguel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">San Miguel 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wadzisz-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Wadzisz 1969</LINK>). Future studies should comply with CONSORT recommendations. (Begg 1996, Moher 2001)</P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>There is a great need for clinically meaningful randomised controlled trials to help guide pregnant women, policy-makers and clinicians in the use of antipsychotics during pregnancy or the postpartum period. These trials should preferably be of a pragmatic nature and reflect the treatment dilemmas faced in routine clinical practice. Comparisons between treatment strategies are required, including head-to-head comparisons of different antipsychotic drugs, and antipsychotic drugs versus non-pharmacological interventions. As we outlined in the Methods section, a wide range of outcomes requires investigation, including the mental health of the mother, the physical health of the foetus and neonate, developmental outcomes in infants and young children, and healthcare utilisation rates for both mothers and their offspring.</P>
