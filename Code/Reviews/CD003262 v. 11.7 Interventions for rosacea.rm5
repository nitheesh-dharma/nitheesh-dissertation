A new paragraph was added &amp;quot;There are no standard validated tools for assessing the severity of rosacea or its signs and symptoms. Clinicians and patients assess severity of rosacea differently, with patients focusing on papules and pustules and clinicians on erythema. There seems to be a low inter-rater reliability when detailed scoring scales are used (Bamford 2004; Gessert 2003).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;at Background under epidemiology and causes, new references have been added. 2nd paragraph the following sentences have been added:&amp;quot;Although the latter is now under debate (Powell 2004; Aroni 2004).&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;as causative factors, the following are now newly included: pilosebaceous abnormalities (Crawford 2004)&lt;br&gt;free oxygen radicals (&amp;#214;ztas 2003; Baz 2004)&lt;br&gt;bacterial protein production at different temperatures (Dahl 2004)&lt;br&gt;hormonal influences (Aroni 2004;&lt;br&gt;follicular involvement (Aroni 2004; Powell 2004)&lt;br&gt;and under causative factors for ocular rosacea the following have been included: type IV hypersensitivity reaction (Michel 2003)&lt;br&gt;tear breaking-up time (Quarterman 1997)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under symptoms and disability, low self-esteem is added, as well as references Bikowski 2004, Kligman 2004)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under treatment in general more references are added, furthermore under the first paragraph &amp;quot;As rosacea has a great impact on quality of life, rosacea management should involve strategies for improving the quality of life for these patients (Bikowski 2004).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under second paragraph is added &amp;quot; Other topical treatments like tacrolimus and topical application of NADH (the reduced form of &amp;#223;-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) have been proposed (Bamford 2004b; Wozniacka 2003).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the 3rd paragraph the following sentence is added &amp;quot; To reduce not only the incidence of side effects from tetracyclines but also the risk of bacterial resistance, subantimicrobial doses of 20 mg doxycycline twice daily have been proposed in open-label studies with good results (Bikowski 2003; Bikowski 2004). However, results from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) have not been published yet.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often oral treatment is initially combined with topical treatment. As the rosacea improves, the oral treatment can be discontinued and improvement is maintained by continuation of the topical treatment. (the wording has changed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added &amp;quot;The vascular symptoms of rosacea can be effectively treated with light-based therapies like pulsed dye laser or intense pulsed light (Bikowski 2004; Landow 2002; Crawford 2004)&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;The following part has changed slightly &amp;quot;Drugs used to prevent flushing have also been used. These include centrally-active alpha blocking hypotensive drugs such as clonidine and rilmenidine (Rebora 1987; Grosshans 1997; Jansen 1997; Pelle 2004). Other suggested treatments for rosacea include facial massage (for facial oedema), spironolacton, beta-blockers, dapsone, oral contraceptives, benzoyl peroxide creams, bifonazol cream and treatment of Helicobacter pylori (Rebora 1987; Pelle 2004)&amp;quot; .&lt;br&gt;Added &amp;quot;Prevention and reducing the risk of exacerbations involves sun avoidance and use of sunscreens, avoiding triggers, such as heat, alcohol consumption, certain foods (e.g. hot and spicy), certain medications (e.g. corticosteroids, niacin), and irritating cosmetics (waterproof cosmetics, astringents, peeling agents, soap) etc (Draelos 2004; Landow 2002; Pelle 2004). Furthermore, mild cleansers and camouflage creams are often suggested.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;at DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDIES: As more studies are included and excluded, this is described, the numbers, categories of trials have been adapted (I added one category of benzoylperoxide + antibiotics)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY, the new studies are added, numbers of high/intermediate changed, as well as the number of studies lacking SD's.&lt;br&gt;under randomsation and selection bias, the numbers have been changed, and studies included. Changed wording The authors clearly demonstrated that concealment of allocation was adequate in only 15 of the trials (Sneddon 1966; Marks 1971; Bartholomew 1982; Nielsen 1983a; Nielsen 1983b; Bleicher 1987; Bjerke 1989b; Bitar 1990; Carmichael 1993; Bamford 1999; Breneman 2004; Elewski 2003; Leyden 2004; Thiboutot 2003a; Thiboutot 2003b).&lt;br&gt;idem under blinding and detection bias&lt;br&gt;idem under handling of losses and attrition bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT RESULTS:&lt;br&gt;Under comparison 2 , text has changed, 2 studies added (Thiboutot a and b).&lt;br&gt;Under comparison 10, Elewski 2003 is added, so text changed&lt;br&gt;New comparison 14 Metronidazole + sunscreen SPF 15 versus placebo is added.&lt;br&gt;New comparison 15 Benzoyl peroxide 5%/clindamycin1% gel versus placebo is added&lt;br&gt;New comparison 16 Topical permethrin versus topical metronidazole is added&lt;br&gt;new comparison Benzoyl peroxide 5%/erythromycin 3% gel versus metronidazol gel is added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At DISCUSSION:&lt;br&gt;In the first paragraph Elewski is added in the part of the physicians being more satisfied than the patients.&lt;br&gt;Paragraph Some studies etc; benzoyl peroxide and sulfacetamide are removed.&lt;br&gt;Added: A very interesting treatment seems low dose doxycycline 20mg BID (Sanchez 2004, Bikowski 2003, Bikowski 2004, NCT00041977). This is a sub antimicrobal dose, but reduces the inflammation, the risk for resistance of P.acnes to tetracyclines will be reduced and so will the incidence of adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 3rd paragraph the following is added: Four studies were included using benzoyl peroxide alone or in combination with topical antibiotics (Breneman 2004; Leyden 2004; Montes 1983; &amp;#214;zt&amp;#252;rkcan 2004). Unfortunately, when taking a closer look at the studies, the quality of the studies was suboptimal. The same holds true for the study with permethrin (Ko&amp;#231;ak 2002). Both benzoyl peroxide and permethrin are well known drugs and further investigation in the treatment of rosacea is interesting and needed.&lt;br&gt;In the last paragraph Two studies combined treatment with a sun protection factor (Tan 2002; Ko&amp;#231;ak 2002) is added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;At REFERENCES, at included studies, a typing error was removed (Bartholomew), new reference have been added (see at included studies). At excluded studies also 1 typing error has been removed (Irvine)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;at included studies;added Tan 2002, Breneman 2004, Leyden 2004, Elewski 2003, Ko&amp;#231;ak 2002 (not all the namens could be spelled correctly within Revman), Thiboutot 2003, and &amp;#214;zturkcan 2004. And also the characteristics and comparisons and data have been added:&lt;br&gt;At Comparisons and data; as oucome numbers 05,06 and 07 were empty and deleted in the former versions, I have renumbered the outcome numbers and changed it in the grapnumbers of the result section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At characteristics of included studies, 2 typing errors have been removed (Montes, Sneddon)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;at exluded studies added: Fernandez-Obregon 2004, Guillet 1999, Hofer 2004, Dreno 1998, Koch 1999, Loo 2004, Nasir 1985, Sanchez 2004, del Rosso 2004B. And so the characteristics also have been added. However I cannot delete Dreno without a year from the characteristics????????&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At ongoing studies: study started at june 2002 (is added) and data will be published second quarter of 2005 (added).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;at other references added: Powell 2004, Crawford 2004, Wilkin 2004, Aroni 2004, Kligman 2004, Draelos 2004, Pi&amp;#233;rard-Franchimont , Wozniacka 2003, Millikan 2004, Shalita 2004, Wolf 2004, Del Rosso 2004, Landow 2002, Pelle 2004, Kendall 2004, Dahl 2004, Bamford 2004, Gessert 2003, &amp;#214;ztas 2003, Baz 2004, Bikowski 2004, Bikowski 2003, Michel 2003, Ghanem 2003, Quaterman 1997, Bamford 2004b, Taub 2003, Lonne-Rahm 2004, Kaushik 2003, Tan 2004 , Stone 2004&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartholomew was removed under &amp;quot;it was unclear how many participants were recruited, how they were randomised and/or how many participants dropped out in each group. &amp;quot;as this was not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 25, after comments of Sally and Mark I have made changes in the statistics and result section (comments Sally)&lt;br&gt;The wording of the synopsis has slightly changed.&lt;br&gt;AT abstract: Data collection &amp;amp; analysis added: Disagreements were resolved by discussion and concensus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT Background- treatment the word &amp;quot;theory&amp;quot; is changed in &amp;quot;well controlled trials&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under methods of the study: instead of the quite long sentence we now have However, many studies were seriously flawed and were classified as low quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 27 A lot of typing errors have been corrected, and sentences have been reworded, but these are mentioned above as these all were new sentences, and my wording of these added sentences was inadequate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At details of corviewers, some addresses has been changed and Melissa Gover is added&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;05-04-05 After discussion with Sally, it was decided to add Leyden 2004 only as a reference and not as a study as it was the same study as Breneman 2004 but looked at different outcome measures. The text has changed therefore, where needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PM added comments in the text in red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11 May 05 (KJ) - Made minor edits and changed the acknowledgements section. Sent to Dedee and Esther at the same time with the peer review comments. This is the version that is to be revised and submitted to the CLIB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11-05-2005 accepted all PM's comments and KJ's changes&lt;br&gt;12-05-2005 comments of Alison Layton included (in red)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;19 May 05 (KJ) Made minor edits and changes asked for by Esther. Most copy-editing is done, sent to Esther for final approval and changes must be back with editorial base by Monday morning (23rd May). (Spell checking is complete down to the end of the list of included studies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 May 2005, accepted all the changes, shortened the abstract, Espagne is also becoming a study awaiting assessment, the text decription of the studies, first Par has changed (in red)&lt;br&gt;Added at excluded studies Ertl: 16 weeks (first 16 weeks no control!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added at last sentence of discussion &amp;quot;No studies were found to support the treatment claims of immunomodulatory agents and NADH.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;23 May 05 (KJ) Final copy editing done.&lt;br&gt;23/24 may - TL checked, added picture (again) and did minor edits, also updated the 'What's New' section)&lt;br&gt;25 May 05 (KJ) Moved Monk 1991 from 'Excluded studies' to 'Studies awaiting assessment' and modified the 'What's new' section accordingly. A few more minor edits and sent to TL for final approval - back to KJ for totals- KJ removed the totals from the comparisons that have less than two studies in. Sent to TL for the module submission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ready for CLIB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;******************************&lt;br&gt;21july05 - 2 corrections from Esther: changed number of studies awaiting assessment from 2 to 3 , and number excluded from 38 to 39&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7/9/08 Converetd to RM5 CB&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-05-17 13:52:07 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" REVIEW_NO="#25" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.3.5 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="11.7">

<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Which treatments are effective for rosacea?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Rosacea is a common skin condition causing flushing, redness, red pimples and pustules on the face, and should not be confused with acne. Dilated blood vessels may appear near the surface of the skin (telangiectasia). It can also cause inflammation of the eyes or eyelids, or both (ocular rosacea). Some people can develop a thickening of the skin, especially of the nose (rhinophyma). Although the cause of rosacea remains unclear, a wide variety of treatments are available for this persistent (chronic) and recurring and often distressing disease. These include medications applied directly to the skin (topical), oral medications and light-based therapies. We wanted to discover how people assessed their treatments: if the treatments changed their quality of life, if they saw changes in their condition and if there were side effects. From the doctors, we wanted to discover whether treatments changed the severity of rosacea, as well as how long it took before symptoms reduced and reappeared.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed 106 studies (up to July 2014) which included 13,631 people with moderate to severe rosacea. Most were between 40 and 50 years old, with more than twice as many women as men. Most studies lasted between eight to 12 weeks, with the longest lasting 40 weeks. The majority of people in these studies suffered from two rosacea subtypes, the subtype with pimples and pustules, or the subtype that causes flushing and persistent redness.</P>
<P>Of the 106 studies, 66 reported that they received funding, mainly by pharmaceutical companies. We were confident funding did not affect the results in 56 of these studies but had concerns about the remaining 10.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Most of the treatments appeared to be effective in treating rosacea. Almost half of the studies reported how people assessed their treatments. Only 11 assessed changes to quality of life. Almost all studies reported side effects, although this information was often limited. Studies mostly evaluated changes in the number of pimples and pustules, and redness. Only five studies included ocular rosacea. None included the rare variant called 'granulomatous rosacea'.</P>
<P>
<I>Topical treatments</I>
</P>
<P>Two separate treatments, metronidazole and azelaic acid, were effective and safe in reducing rosacea symptoms. Improvements tended to appear after three to six weeks. With metronidazole, very few people experienced mild itching, skin irritation and dry skin. For some, azelaic acid caused mild burning, stinging or irritation. More research is needed to conclude which of these two treatments is best.</P>
<P>Ivermectin, a new treatment, was more effective than placebo and slightly more effective than metronidazole. Another newly registered treatment called brimonidine, especially for reducing redness, was shown to work up to 12 hours after being applied.</P>
<P>
<I>Oral treatments</I>
</P>
<P>Antibiotics such as tetracycline, a low dose of doxycycline or a low dose of minocycline reduced the number of pimples and pustules. Low dose doxycycline (40 mg) was likely as effective as 100 mg, but with much fewer side effects of diarrhoea and nausea. Azithromycin may be as effective as 100 mg doxycycline, but only one study addressed this treatment and better quality studies are needed to confirm this.</P>
<P>A low dose of isotretinoin (0.3 mg/kg), a vitamin A-related drug, appeared to be slightly more effective than 50-100 mg doxycycline for treating pimples and pustules. However, extra precautions need to be taken regarding contraception in women of childbearing age as this drug is known to cause malformations in the foetus.</P>
<P>
<I>Light-based therapies</I>
</P>
<P>Laser therapy and intense pulsed light therapy were both effective for the treatment of telangiectasia, but the studies examining these treatments only reported limited data.</P>
<P>
<I>Rosacea of the eyes or eyelids, or both (ocular rosacea)</I>
</P>
<P>Better quality studies are required on ocular rosacea, though ciclosporin 0.05% ophthalmic emulsion appeared to be more effective than artificial tears.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We rated the quality of the evidence for several outcomes as very low to high. There was high quality evidence for azelaic acid, topical ivermectin, brimonidine, doxycycline and isotretinoin. The lower quality evidence for other treatments was mostly because there were few people in the studies, making the results less precise, and the lack of blinding (people knew which treatments they were receiving).</P>

<P>Rosacea is a common chronic skin condition affecting the face, characterised by flushing, redness, pimples, pustules and dilated blood vessels. The eyes are often involved and thickening of the skin with enlargement (phymas), especially of the nose, can occur in some people. A range of treatment options are available but it is unclear which are most effective.<BR/>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-25 16:43:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Esther van Zuuren">
<P>We included 106 studies, comprising 13,631 participants. Sample sizes of 30-100 and study duration of two to three months were most common. More women than men were included, mean age of 48.6 years, and the majority had papulopustular rosacea, followed by erythematotelangiectatic rosacea.</P>
<P>A wide range of comparisons (67) were evaluated. Topical interventions: metronidazole, azelaic acid, ivermectin, brimonidine or other topical treatments. Systemic interventions: oral antibiotics, combinations with topical treatments or other systemic treatments, i.e. isotretinoin. Several studies evaluated laser or light-based treatment.</P>
<P>The majority of studies (57/106) were assessed as 'unclear risk of bias', 37 'high risk ' and 12 'low risk'. Twenty-two studies provided no usable or retrievable data i.e. none of our outcomes were addressed, no separate data reported for rosacea or limited data in abstracts.</P>
<P>Eleven studies assessed our primary outcome 'change in quality of life', 52 studies participant-assessed changes in rosacea severity and almost all studies addressed adverse events, although often only limited data were provided. In most comparisons there were no statistically significant differences in number of adverse events, most were mild and transient. Physician assessments including investigators' global assessments, lesion counts and erythema were evaluated in three-quarters of the studies, but time needed for improvement and duration of remission were incompletely or not reported.</P>
<P>The quality of the body of evidence was rated moderate to high for most outcomes, but for some outcomes low to very low.</P>
<P>Data for several outcomes could only be pooled for topical metronidazole and azelaic acid. Both were shown to be more effective than placebo in papulopustular rosacea (moderate quality evidence for metronidazole and high for azelaic acid). Pooled data from physician assessments in three trials demonstrated that metronidazole was more effective compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 3.02). Four trials provided data on participants' assessments, illustrating that azelaic acid was more effective than placebo (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.63). The results from three studies were contradictory on which of these two treatments was most effective.</P>
<P>Two studies showed a statistically significant and clinically important improvement in favour of topical ivermectin when compared to placebo (high quality evidence). Participants' assessments in these studies showed a RR of 1.78 (95% CI 1.50 to 2.11) and RR of 1.92 (95% CI 1.59 to 2.32),which were supported by physicians' assessments. Topical ivermectin appeared to be slightly more effective than topical metronidazole for papulopustular rosacea, based on one study, for improving quality of life and participant and physician assessed outcomes (high quality evidence for these outcomes).</P>
<P>Topical brimonidine in two studies was more effective than vehicle in reducing erythema in rosacea at all time points over 12 hours (high quality evidence). At three hours the participants' assessments had a RR of 2.21 (95% CI 1.52 to 3.22) and RR of 2.00 (95% CI 1.33 to 3.01) in favour of brimonidine. Physicians' assessments confirmed these data. There was no rebound or worsening of erythema after treatment cessation.</P>
<P>Topical clindamycin phosphate combined with tretinoin was not considered to be effective compared to placebo (moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>Topical ciclosporin ophthalmic emulsion demonstrated effectiveness and improved quality of life for people with ocular rosacea (low quality evidence).</P>
<P>Of the comparisons assessing oral treatments for papulopustular rosacea there was moderate quality evidence that tetracycline was effective but this was based on two old studies of short duration. Physician-based assessments in two trials indicated that doxycycline appeared to be significantly more effective than placebo (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.47 and RR 2.37, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.99) (high quality evidence). There was no statistically significant difference in effectiveness between 100 mg and 40 mg doxycycline, but there was evidence of fewer adverse effects with the lower dose (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.54) (low quality evidence). There was very low quality evidence from one study (assessed at high risk of bias) that doxycycline 100 mg was as effective as azithromycin. Low dose minocycline (45 mg) was effective for papulopustular rosacea (low quality evidence).</P>
<P>Oral tetracycline was compared with topical metronidazole in four studies and showed no statistically significant difference between the two treatments for any outcome (low to moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>Low dose isotretinoin was considered by both the participants (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.43) and physicians (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.36) to be slightly more effective than doxycycline 50-100 mg (high quality evidence).</P>
<P>Pulsed dye laser was more effective than yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser based on one study, and it appeared to be as effective as intense pulsed light therapy (both low quality evidence).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-04-12 07:15:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Esther van Zuuren">
<P>There was high quality evidence to support the effectiveness of topical azelaic acid, topical ivermectin, brimonidine, doxycycline and isotretinoin for rosacea. Moderate quality evidence was available for topical metronidazole and oral tetracycline. There was low quality evidence for low dose minocycline, laser and intense pulsed light therapy and ciclosporin ophthalmic emulsion for ocular rosacea. Time needed to response and response duration should be addressed more completely, with more rigorous reporting of adverse events. Further studies on treatment of ocular rosacea are warranted.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Definition and clinical features</HEADING>
<P>Rosacea is a chronic skin disease that can affect the cheeks, nose, eyes, chin and forehead. It is characterised by recurrent episodes of flushing, erythema (redness), papules (pimples), pustules and telangiectasia (permanent distended blood capillary vessels with a spidery appearance) (<LINK REF="REF-Elewski-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elewski 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Korting-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korting 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marks-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marks 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2005</LINK>). Although there is no standard clinical definition of the condition, rosacea is generally classified into four subtypes and one variant (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilkin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkin 2004</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Subtype 1: erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, where the clinical features include flushing and persistent central facial erythema (redness) with or without telangiectasia.</LI>
<LI>Subtype 2: papulopustular rosacea, characterised by persistent central facial erythema with transient, central face papules or pustules, or both.</LI>
<LI>Subtype 3: phymatous rosacea, where thickening of the skin is seen with irregular surface nodularities, and enlargement. This may occur on the nose (rhinophyma), chin, forehead, cheeks or ears.</LI>
<LI>Subtype 4: ocular rosacea, characterised by ocular involvement, including inflammation of different parts of the eye and eyelid. It may be found in up to 58% of cases but it is frequently undiagnosed.</LI>
<LI>Variant: granulomatous rosacea, which is non-inflammatory and characterised by hard, brown, yellow or red cutaneous papules, or nodules of uniform size.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Progression from one subtype to another is possible, patients may express signs and symptoms of more than one subtype, and each individual characteristic may change from absent to severe (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilkin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkin 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Rosacea primarily affects the face and is accompanied by the physical discomfort of flushes, persistent erythema and the effects of eye lesions and inflammatory lesions, and it can also lead to psychological problems over and above these physical symptoms.</P>
<P>The disease can cause embarrassment, anxiety, low self-esteem and lack of confidence, and may even lead to depression, social anxiety disorder or body dysmorphic disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Abram-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abram 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elewski-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elewski 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Landow-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landow 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2005</LINK>). If there is eye involvement, it may result in varying and sometimes severe manifestations which may produce significant additional discomfort (<LINK REF="REF-Lazaridou-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazaridou 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oltz-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oltz 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vieira-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vieira 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are no standard validated tools for assessing the severity of rosacea or its signs and symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Gessert-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gessert 2003</LINK>). Thus clinicians tend to assess the severity of rosacea by focusing on the papules and pustules, whereas people with rosacea place greater emphasis on the erythema. There would appear to be poor consistency in assessments between individuals when detailed scoring scales are used (<LINK REF="REF-Bamford-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bamford 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gessert-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gessert 2003</LINK>). Moreover, several studies have demonstrated that objective clinical parameters of skin disease are often poorly correlated with quality of life, and that physicians tend to underestimate the impact of skin disease on an individual (<LINK REF="REF-Chren-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chren 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicholson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholson 2007</LINK>). Rosacea has a significant negative impact on quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Aksoy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aksoy 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cresce-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cresce 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moustafa-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moustafa 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Linden-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Linden 2014</LINK>). A validated disease-specific quality of life instrument (RosaQoL) has been developed, and RosaQoL scores have been used in several studies as one of the outcome parameters (<LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bamford-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bamford 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleischer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fleischer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kini-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kini 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicholson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholson 2007</LINK>). Much work remains to be done to improve the quality of reporting of patient reported outcomes (PRO) in studies on rosacea (<LINK REF="REF-van-Zuuren-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Zuuren 2013</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology and causes</HEADING>
<P>Rosacea usually presents in the second or third decade of life, with up to 10% of the population affected (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1989</LINK>). It is reportedly more common in fair-skinned people of Celtic and northern European heritage (<LINK REF="REF-Culp-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Culp 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Korting-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korting 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2005</LINK>) and women appear to be more often affected than men (<LINK REF="REF-Culp-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Culp 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2005</LINK>). However, a proportionately larger number of men develop phymatous changes (thickening skin, irregular surface nodularities, and enlargement), sometimes as a result of progression from subtype 1 or subtype 2 to subtype 3 (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilkin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkin 2004</LINK>). The prevalence of rosacea varies from less than 1% to more than 20%, indicating a range which is most likely attributable to differences in the populations studied and the methodological approach used (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2013b</LINK>). Prevalence studies of rosacea in darker skin phototypes are sparse.</P>
<P>The pathophysiology of rosacea is very complex and the exact cause remains unclear. A number of hypotheses have been proposed. Both genetic and mostly environmental stimuli and triggers, for example heat, sunlight, stress, certain foodstuffs and Demodex mites stimulate an augmented innate immune response and neurovascular dysregulation (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Rosso-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Rosso 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elewski-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elewski 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinhoff-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinhoff 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinhoff-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinhoff 2013</LINK>). In rosacea affected skin, elevated abnormal cathelicidin (an antimicrobial peptide) and elevated serine protease (kallikrein-5) induce increased LL-37, which results in inflammation, neurovascular effects and vascular changes (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Rosso-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Rosso 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yamasaki-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamasaki 2007</LINK>
<U>; </U>
<LINK REF="REF-Yamasaki-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamasaki 2011</LINK>). More recently mechanisms and components of rosacea pathophysiology have been categorised into (a) increase of Toll-like receptors on keratinocytes, (b) augmented innate immunity, (c) neurovascular dysregulation (d) vascular changes, (e) reactive oxygen species (ROS), (f) stratum corneum permeability barrier dysfunction, (g) ultraviolet (UV) radiation and (h) microbes, e.g. Demodex,<I> Bacillus oleronius </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Del-Rosso-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Rosso 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Del-Rosso-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Rosso 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinhoff-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinhoff 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tisma-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tisma 2009</LINK>). The current hypothesis is that rosacea is an inflammatory disorder that may develop in individuals with rosacea-prone skin, initiated by several triggers (<LINK REF="REF-Steinhoff-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinhoff 2011</LINK>). Possible triggers that have been investigated are gastrointestinal (digestive) tract diseases, infestation with <I>Demodex folliculorum</I>, <I>Bacillus oleronius</I>, epidermal barrier defect, and childhood stye (<LINK REF="REF-Bamford-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bamford 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elewski-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elewski 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forton 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forton-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forton 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lacey-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacey 2007</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-04-11 11:13:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Esther van Zuuren">
<P>As with most chronic skin diseases, rosacea requires long-term treatment, therapies are numerous, and their use is frequently based on anecdotal evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Elewski-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elewski 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Layton-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Layton 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2005</LINK>). Management strategies for people with rosacea can often be tailored to the specific subtype of rosacea (<LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jansen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jansen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2005</LINK>) but, because rosacea can have a significant impact on quality of life, these strategies should also be directed towards achieving improvements in general well-being (<LINK REF="REF-Bikowski-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bikowski 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elewski-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elewski 2011</LINK>). In certain individuals successful management of rosacea is possible through avoidance of some of the triggers, in particular those which cause flushing, that is certain foods and beverages, sunlight and some types of cosmetics (<LINK REF="REF-Elewski-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elewski 2011</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Topical interventions</HEADING>
<P>If a small number of papules and pustules are present, topical rather than systemic therapy is considered to be the first-line of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Rosso-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Rosso 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elewski-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elewski 2011</LINK>). This includes a range of formulations of metronidazole, azelaic acid, clindamycin lotion, permethrin 5% cream, tretinoin cream, 10% sulphacetamide with sulphur (5%) and benzoyl peroxide alone or in combination with erythromycin or clindamycin (<LINK REF="REF-Culp-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Culp 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Del-Rosso-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Rosso 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elewski-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elewski 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Korting-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korting 2009</LINK>). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved topical ivermectin 1% for papulopustular rosacea and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval is expected in the near future (<LINK REF="REF-Layton-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Layton 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2014a</LINK>). Brimonidine tartrate gel 5%, a topical selective &#945;-adrenergic receptor agonist with vasoconstrictive activity, was recently approved for the treatment of persistent erythema in rosacea (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Rosso-2013c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Rosso 2013c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fowler-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Fowler 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fowler-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Fowler 2013a</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Systemic interventions</HEADING>
<P>If the skin lesions are more extensive, oral antibiotics such as tetracyclines or azithromycin are usually recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Alikhan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alikhan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bakar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakar 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Culp-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Culp 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elewski-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elewski 2011</LINK>). Second-generation tetracyclines, for example doxycycline and minocycline, have been used more recently with reportedly fewer side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Bikowski-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bikowski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Korting-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korting 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sloan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sloan 2008</LINK>). To reduce not only the side effects but also the risk of bacterial resistance, a novel approach has been advocated that involves the use of a subantimicrobial dosage of doxycycline, which separates the anti-inflammatory effect of doxycycline from its antimicrobial properties by limiting the plasma concentration to a range below the minimum inhibitory concentrations for susceptible bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Del-Rosso-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Del Rosso 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sapadin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sapadin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2006</LINK>). Not infrequently, oral treatment may be combined initially with topical treatment so that as the rosacea improves the systemic treatment can be discontinued and improvement can be maintained by continuation with the topical treatment alone (<LINK REF="REF-Elewski-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elewski 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Other interventions</HEADING>
<P>The vascular manifestations of rosacea appear to respond fairly effectively to light-based therapies such as pulsed dye laser or intense pulsed light (<LINK REF="REF-Culp-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Culp 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kawana-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawana 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Korting-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korting 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tanghetti-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanghetti 2014</LINK>). In the more severe or persistent cases of papulopustular and phymatous rosacea, oral 13-cis-retinoic acid (isotretinoin) therapy may be required. Isotretinoin has a well-recognised safety profile but should only be given to women under close supervision and should include an appropriate contraception strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Korting-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korting 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nickle-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nickle 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Traditional therapies for ocular rosacea include oral tetracyclines, eyelid hygiene and warm compresses (<LINK REF="REF-Stone-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oltz-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oltz 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vieira-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vieira 2013</LINK>). Topical metronidazole gel and fusidic acid gel are also reportedly successful (<LINK REF="STD-Barnhorst-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Barnhorst 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seal-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Seal 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vieira-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vieira 2013</LINK>). Rhinophyma may require surgical intervention, but low dose isotretinoin and laser therapy have also been used (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taghizadeh-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taghizadeh 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tanghetti-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanghetti 2014</LINK>).</P>

<P>Although a lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of rosacea continues to hamper therapeutic efforts (<LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elewski-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elewski 2011</LINK>), metronidazole and azelaic acid are generally considered as the first-line in topical medicaments. It is also now widely recognised that the therapeutic efficacy of both can be attributed to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects (<LINK REF="REF-Bhatia-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhatia 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elewski-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elewski 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feldman-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naranayan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naranayan 2007</LINK>). Ivermectin has demonstrated activity against Demodex in addition to possible inflammatory properties (<LINK REF="REF-Layton-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Layton 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2014a</LINK>). Brimonidine targets the &#945;-adrenergic receptors in the smooth muscle sheath located around the vessel wall of the superficial blood vessels of the skin and coupled with its potent vasoconstrictive activity it can provide a reduction of facial erythema after application (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Rosso-2013c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Rosso 2013c</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Tetracyclines down-regulate the production of inflammatory cytokines, inhibit matrix-metalloproteinases (MMP), and down-regulate the inflammatory response in papulopustular rosacea (<LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Del-Rosso-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Del Rosso 2007a</LINK>). Doxycycline has been shown to inhibit neutrophil activity and several pro-inflammatory reactions including those associated with phospholipase A2, endogenous nitric oxide and interleukin-6 (<LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bikowski-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bikowski 2003</LINK>). Subantimicrobial doses of doxycycline can be important in minimising the development of microbial resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Bikowski-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bikowski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Korting-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korting 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sloan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sloan 2008</LINK>). Isotretinoin has anti-inflammatory properties, it diminishes sebaceous gland size and number and can help retard or halt development of rhinophyma (<LINK REF="REF-Baldwin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldwin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erdogan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Erdogan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gollnick-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gollnick 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uslu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uslu 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Laser therapy is capable of reducing both erythema and telangiectasia (<LINK REF="REF-Shim-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shim 2013</LINK>). The pulsed dye laser (PDL) with the 595 nm wavelength targets haemoglobin and delivers all of the administered energy in a wavelength that is actively taken up by the haemoglobin in blood vessels causing vessel destruction (<LINK REF="REF-Bernstein-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernstein 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Butterwick-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butterwick 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shim-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shim 2013</LINK>). The 532 nm frequency-doubled, potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) and the neodymium-doped, yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser can also deliver wavelengths which are readily absorbed by haemoglobin (<LINK REF="REF-Bernstein-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernstein 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Butterwick-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butterwick 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karsai-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Karsai 2008</LINK>). Intense pulsed light with a wavelength between 550 nm and 670 nm is readily absorbed by both melanin and oxyhaemoglobin, and has also been used in the treatment of telangiectasia (<LINK REF="REF-Butterwick-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butterwick 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kawana-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawana 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nymann-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nymann 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>The following domains were rated for each of the included studies as 'low risk of bias', 'high risk of bias', and 'unclear risk of bias' if the risk of bias was uncertain or unknown:</P>
<P>(a) the allocation sequence was adequately generated ('sequence generation');<BR/>(b) the allocation was adequately concealed ('allocation concealment');<BR/>(c) knowledge of the allocated interventions was adequately prevented during the study ('blinding');<BR/>(d) incomplete outcome data were adequately addressed;<BR/>(e) reports of the study were free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting; and<BR/>(f) the study was apparently free of other sources of bias that could put it at high risk of bias. This would include adequate study duration, i.e. a minimum of four weeks, and that previous oral and topical rosacea therapy was discontinued for a minimum of four weeks prior to the initial assessment. If the investigators declared any support or funding of the study by the pharmaceutical industry this was noted and assessed to determine if it represented a potential risk of bias in the conduct or reporting of the study (<LINK REF="REF-Bero-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bero 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>These assessments were reported in the 'Risk of bias' table for each individual study. See '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'.</P>

<LI>low risk of bias (plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the results) if all criteria were met;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias (plausible bias that raises some doubt about the results) if one or more criteria were assessed as unclear; or</LI>

<P>Clinical heterogeneity was assessed by examining the characteristics of the studies, the similarity between the types of participants, the interventions, the comparisons and the outcomes as were specified in the criteria for included studies.

<P>The clinical diversity between many of the studies in this review as well as the limited number of studies that could be combined for each intervention only allowed us to make assessments of heterogeneity between the studies in just two of the comparisons. We assessed heterogeneity based on thresholds for the interpretation of I where &lt; 40% might not be important, 30% to 60% represents moderate and 50% to 90% substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

We used a random-effects model to combine the results of individual studies in this review. For comparisons where data synthesis was not feasible, the data has been reported separately in tables as 'Incomplete data on which further analysis is not possible' and presented in the review as a narrative summary, where appropriate.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Characteristics of the participants</HEADING>
<P>Most of the participants in the included studies had papulopustular rosacea, however in 16 of the studies most or all of the participants had erythematotelangiectatic rosacea. The participants were between 40 and 50 years of age, with a mean of 48.6 years; there were more women (8332) than men (3718) and the gender was unreported for 1581 participants. Thirty-five of the studies were carried out before the year 2000, the remainder (71) were conducted after 2000. The number of participants in the individual studies varied widely from 6 to 1299 and sample sizes of between 30 and 100 participants were the most common.</P>
<P>It was agreed between the review authors that two studies, <LINK REF="STD-NCT01426269" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01426269</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Thiboutot-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Thiboutot 2008</LINK>, should be included but that these were considered as maintenance studies. In <LINK REF="STD-NCT01426269" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01426269</LINK>, 130 participants took part in the second phase of the study and were randomised to doxycycline 40 mg or placebo after having obtained an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) of clear or near clear during the open-label first phase of treatment with doxycycline 40 mg combined with metronidazole gel, both once daily. In <LINK REF="STD-Thiboutot-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Thiboutot 2008</LINK>, the investigators enrolled 172 participants in the pilot phase of the study out of which only 136 continued into the second phase (maintenance phase), but these constituted the participants who had already achieved an improvement of &gt; 75% reduction in inflammatory lesions.</P>

However, this number has risen by nine compared to the former update, which would appear to illustrate the steadily increasing recognition of quality of life as a key outcome by investigators in rosacea studies. Nearly half (52) of the remaining studies evaluated participant-assessed changes in rosacea severity. The patient-reported outcomes (PROs) which were reported in the 52 studies included not only assessments of changes in severity but also, in most instances, patient satisfaction associated with these changes.</P>
<P>We evaluated these PROs against the checklist for describing and assessing patient-reported outcomes in clinical trials (see <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>), which is described in Chapter 17.6 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We found that hardly any of them matched the recommended criteria. In the vast majority of studies the self-assessments were made by way of questionnaires and instruments which evaluated the resolution of symptoms either jointly or separately with patient satisfaction related to the treatment. While most of these instruments were based on Likert-type scales, a very small number of the studies utilised visual analogue scales (VAS) in their assessments (<LINK REF="STD-Neuhaus-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Neuhaus 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nymann-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nymann 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weissenbacher-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Weissenbacher 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was wide diversity in the format of the questionnaires; many appeared to be unvalidated, used a range of scaling which offered a choice of from three to seven points on a Likert scale covering similar outcomes across the different questionnaires, and in several of them the physician and participant assessments were combined and expressed as composite scores. In the majority of the questionnaires it was not clear how the ratings correlated with the scaling of the items nor how reliable the interval-level measurements were between the individual items (see also <LINK REF="REF-van-Zuuren-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Zuuren 2013</LINK>). Additionally, in a number of the patient satisfaction questionnaires the judgements appeared to have been framed in such a way that only positive responses were possible, which would most likely lead to biased assessments being made (<LINK REF="STD-Bjerke-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bjerke 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breneman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Breneman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lebwohl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lebwohl 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maddin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Maddin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sauder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sauder 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The quality of life assessment tools which were utilised in nine of the studies had been validated and were internationally recognised. Three studies used more than one instrument (<LINK REF="STD-Stein-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2014b" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2014b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taieb-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Taieb 2015</LINK>). The disease-specific RosaQoL was used in eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bamford-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bamford 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Draelos-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Draelos 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luger-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Luger 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01426269" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01426269</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2014b" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2014b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taieb-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Taieb 2015</LINK>). Another disease-specific instrument, the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), was used in <LINK REF="STD-Schechter-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schechter 2009</LINK> and the dermatology-specific instrument Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) in the other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bribeche-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bribeche 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2014b" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2014b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taieb-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Taieb 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weissenbacher-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Weissenbacher 2007</LINK>). In all of these studies the investigators provided citations to reports indicating that the tools had been previously validated, as was specified in the PRO checklist (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adverse events were addressed in the majority of the included studies, although often limited data were provided.</P>
<P>Most of the studies (81) assessed erythema or telangiectasia, or both, although the presence of erythema or telangiectasia was an inclusion criterion in just 63 of the 106 studies (16 of these were conducted in participants with subtype 1 rosacea). In this update there were clearly more studies focusing on erythema, which was assessed utilising mostly four to five-point Likert scales.

Almost half of the studies (57) were categorised as 'unclear risk of bias' (plausible bias that raised some doubt about the results) because one or more criteria were assessed as unclear, and the remaining 37 studies were assessed as 'high risk of bias' (plausible bias that seriously weakened confidence in the results) because one or more of the criteria were not met. Further details of these assessments are available in the 'Risk of bias' table corresponding to each study in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>', and are also presented in the 'Risk of Bias' graph in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and the 'Risk of Bias' summary in <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>Some of these assessments were to a certain extent based on the inadequate reporting of the criteria that are a prerequisite in the evaluation of methodological rigour in terms of trial design and conduct. Concealment of the allocation sequence and blinding are key domains in the assessment of risk of bias and most of the studies in this review provided insufficient detail to enable accurate judgements to be made. Protocol deviations, losses to follow-up with incomplete data, and subsequent per-protocol analyses, were other important sources of potential bias in a number of the included studies (see 'Risk of bias' table in '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>').</P>

<P>The methods used to generate the allocation sequence and how the sequence was concealed, such that participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee the upcoming assignment, are the most important and sensitive indicators that bias has been minimised in a clinical trial (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>In 59 out of the 106 trials in this review the method of sequence generation was not described at all, or was at best unclear. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Espagne-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Espagne 1993</LINK>) allocation to the intervention was based on up to four participants in each of 18 clinics, but not all clinics enrolled four participants. The report did not provide any reassurance that the allocation sequence was adequately generated and there was lack of evidence that any form of central randomisation had been employed for the 18 clinics involved in this study, and therefore we judged this domain as high risk of bias. In the remaining studies (46) the method used to generate the allocation sequence was described in sufficient detail; therefore this domain was judged as low risk of bias for these studies.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Concealment of the allocation sequence was reported adequately in only 33 of the trials and involved either a form of central allocation, was pharmacy-controlled or was through the use of serially numbered opaque envelopes (see 'Risk of bias' tables in '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'). The majority of studies received a judgement of unclear risk of bias for this domain and the investigators in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Akhyani-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Akhyani 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bribeche-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bribeche 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2011</LINK>) informed us that the providers of care had access to the computer-generated list, which we judged as high risk of bias.</P>

<P>In slightly more than half of the studies (64/106) incomplete outcome data appeared to have been adequately addressed and any missing outcome data were reasonably well-balanced across intervention groups with similar reasons for missing data across the groups. However, in 42 of the 106 studies the reporting of missing outcome data was largely inadequate. Attrition was one of the main causes of incomplete outcome data. The reasons for attrition varied and these were often dependent on the assignment of the participant to one or other particular group; thus, for example, more dropouts tended to occur in groups receiving the active intervention secondary to any side effects, as opposed to dropouts due to lack of efficacy in the corresponding placebo group. In 30 studies we judged this domain as at unclear risk of bias. When there were more than 20% of dropouts and no ITT analysis was applied, or when dropouts in one arm exceeded 20%, we judged this domain as at high risk of bias (12 studies).</P>

<P>The reporting quality in most of the older studies was consistent with the editorial style and standards existing at the time of publication. Although the protocols for most of the included studies were not available, based on the information in the methods section of the reports 73 out of the 106 studies appeared to have reported all pre-specified outcomes and were therefore judged to be free of selective reporting. In the remaining studies, rarely was more than one outcome inadequately addressed, but in some instances these outcomes were reported only as a graph plot without any clearly discernible data. For 21 studies this domain was therefore judged as at unclear risk of bias. In those instances where one or more pre-specified primary or secondary outcomes were not addressed, or if the data analysis appeared to be flawed after it was re-analysed, we judged this domain as at a high risk of bias (12 studies).<BR/>

<P>Fifty-eight of the studies appeared to be free of other forms of bias, whereas in 41 studies this domain was judged to be unclear. This judgement was based in part on an assessment of the extent to which funding by the sponsors may have had an impact on the results of a study. When there was no evidence of selection bias, nor performance or detection bias as double-blinding was ensured, we did not consider sponsoring or financial compensation a threat for other bias. However, if we were uncertain about selection bias and if the method of blinding was not described in sufficient detail, we concluded that there was insufficient information to permit a clear judgement. Further reasons for possible other bias were: if groups were treated unequally or, in some of the older studies, if there was an inadequate wash-out period before the start of the study. Seven of the included studies were largely not free of other forms of bias. In most of these studies there was baseline imbalance between the groups, but in one study participants switched to the other treatment arm if they failed to respond to the allocated treatment, and one study was designed as a superiority trial but reported as a non-inferiority trial.</P>

Based on the DLQI at the end of the <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2014a</LINK> study, 231/451 participants in the ivermectin group compared to 77/232 in the vehicle group considered that the disease had "no effect on their overall quality of life" (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.89; P &lt; 0.0001; NNTB = 6, 95% CI 4 to 10). In <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2014b" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2014b</LINK> these were 236/459 in the ivermectin group versus 76/229 in the vehicle group (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.90; P &lt; 0.0001; NNTB = 6, 95% CI 4 to 10).</P>
<P>Scores in the DLQI range from 0 to 30: a DLQI score of 0 to 1 is considered to have almost no impact on HRQOL, whereas 2 to 5 is considered to have a small effect, 6 to 10 a moderate effect, 11 to 20 a very large effect and 21 to 30 an extremely large effect on HRQOL. Therefore a reduction in score can be seen as an improvement in HRQOL. The mean change from baseline in DLQI for the ivermectin group (n = 436, per-protocol population as provided for this outcome) in <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2014a</LINK> was -3.50 (SD 2.77) compared to -2.30 (SD 2.71) in the vehicle group (n = 221) with a MD of -1.20 (95% CI -1.64 to -0.76; P &lt; 0.00001). In <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2014b" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2014b</LINK> the reductions in DLQI were similar: -3.20 (SD 2.54) in the ivermectin group (n = 445, per-protocol population as provided for this outcome) versus -2.10 (SD 2.48) in the vehicle group (n = 218) with a MD of -1.10 (95% CI -1.51 to -0.69; P &lt; 0.00001). Although the minimal important difference (MID) for the DLQI is yet to be established for the different skin diseases there is general acceptance that this ranges between 2.5 and 5, and therefore the impact of both treatments provided a small improvement in HRQOL but the difference, although statistically significant, was not clinically important (<LINK REF="REF-Basra-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basra 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In re-analysing the data for this outcome we used the identical N per protocol populations for the groups as for the DLQI outcome.

A cumulative grade 1 improvement was experienced over 12 hours by 25/28 (89.3%) participants in the 0.07% group, 27/31 (87.1%) in the 0.18% group, 28/31 (90.3%) in the 0.5% group, and in 18/32 (56.3%) in the vehicle group. The highest concentration (0.5%) of brimonidine was more effective than vehicle in reducing erythema based on participants' assessments (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.23; P = 0.004; NNTB = 3, 95% CI 3 to 8).</P>

<P>Physicians used the Clinician's Erythema Assessment (CEA) scale (0 to 4, clear to severe) to assess this outcome. The cumulative grade 1 improvement over 12 hours was reached in 24/28 participants in the group treated with 0.07%, in 28/31 in the group treated with 0.18%, in 30/31 treated with 0.5%, and in 21/32 of the participants treated with vehicle. The physician-assessed changes in the comparison of the highest concentration (0.5%) with vehicle showed that brimonidine 0.5% was more effective (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.91; P = 0.003; NNTB = 4, 95% CI 3 to 8).</P>
<P>A cumulative grade 2 improvement was seen in 14/28 of the participants in the 0.07% gel group, in 24/31 in the 0.18% gel group, in 24/31 in the 0.5% gel group, and in 9/32 in the vehicle gel group. Brimonidine 0.5% demonstrated greater efficacy than vehicle, represented by an effect which was statistically significant (RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.94; P = 0.0007; NNTB = 3, 95% CI 2 to 4). These physician-assessed changes were in concordance with the assessments made by the participants.</P>
<P>Erythema was also assessed with a Chroma Meter, and the investigators reported that the values for brimonidine 0.5% were lower (investigators report P &lt; 0.001) and that the onset of effect was within 30 minutes, reaching a maximum effect with a duration of between four to six hours, followed by a reappearance of the redness after eight hours.</P>

PSA was also addressed, but no exact data were provided and it was reported that the mean scores were statistically significantly lower in the brimonidine group.</P>
<P>The results of the facial redness questionnaire at baseline showed that a small number of participants, 2/48 in the brimonidine group and 0/44 in the vehicle group, were satisfied to very satisfied with their appearance.

Feeling self conscious was also evaluated by the participants, and at baseline 40/48 (83.3%) in the brimonidine group felt self conscious and 41/44 (93.1%) in the vehicle group. At day 8 35/48 (73.4%) in the brimonidine group and 39/44 (88%) in the vehicle group felt self conscious (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.01; P = 0.06).</P>

Although the minimal important difference (MID) for the DLQI is yet to be established for the different skin diseases there is general acceptance that this ranges between 2.5 and 5, and therefore the impact of both these treatments was a small improvement in HRQOL but the difference between the groups in terms of reduction of the DLQI scores was not clinically important (<LINK REF="REF-Basra-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basra 2008</LINK>).

<P>The data from these assessments provided evidence for the effectiveness of topical ciclosporin in the treatment of ocular rosacea. The Schirmer's test determines whether the eye produces enough tears to keep it moist. Paper strips are inserted into the eye for several minutes to measure the production of tears, and then the paper is removed and the amount of moisture measured. At baseline the mean Schirmer scores were 9.7 mm (SD 5.1) in the ciclosporin group compared with 10.2 mm (SD 5.8) in the artificial tears group. The difference in change scores between the groups at the end of the study was 4.1 (95% CI 1.66 to 6.54; P = 0.001), which points to a significant improvement in the ciclosporin group. Furthermore, the change score of 3.6 in the tear break-up time (95% CI 2.59 to 4.61; P &lt; 0.00001) provided an indication of the role played by topical ciclosporin in increasing tear production.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-26 11:44:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Esther van Zuuren">
<P>One hundred and six studies were included in the updated version of this review. In this update there was a small increase in the number of studies which reported assessments of our first primary outcome 'change in quality of life', but there was little change in the number of studies (approximately half) which addressed participants' assessments of improvement in rosacea severity, which was one of the other primary outcomes in this review. Adverse events were reported in most of the studies, although the data were often very limited and frequently incomplete.</P>
<P>The majority of studies focused on papule and pustule counts which, although they may provide a quantifiable, objective and more readily intelligible outcome, are generally considered to be clinician-centred rather than patient-preferred. Rosacea is a chronic skin disease and the importance of self-assessments by the participants of the effectiveness of the interventions should not be underestimated. Slightly more than half of the studies evaluated erythema, using a variety of scales, principally Likert scales, but there was a lack of uniformity in their ratings making interpretations in any of the relevant comparisons more difficult.</P>
<P>In day-to-day clinical practice, clinicians and patients need to know how rapidly lesions will respond to treatment and, once an optimal response has been achieved, how long this will last. Although these would appear to be key issues in clinical decision making, the time to response, which was one of our secondary outcomes, was not a pre-specified outcome in any study. In a few instances it could be roughly estimated from some of the interim data that were reported. Duration of remission was only assessed and reported in four of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Akhyani-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Akhyani 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dahl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01426269" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01426269</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thiboutot-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Thiboutot 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pooling of data was not feasible for most of the treatment options, and was only possible for several outcomes in the trials which evaluated topical metronidazole and azelaic acid (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). Both these treatments were shown to be more effective than placebo, with the quality of evidence rated as moderate to high for several outcomes for metronidazole, and high for azelaic acid. Which of these two treatments is most effective still needs to be established because the results from three of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Elewski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Elewski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maddin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Maddin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 2006</LINK>) were contradictory (quality of the evidence moderate to low, see <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although most comparisons were evaluated in single studies, we have provided 'Summary of findings' tables for the most current and more frequently prescribed therapies as we considered these would prove to be the most useful for clinical decision making. We did not provide 'Summary of findings' tables for treatments that are no longer favoured or had been evaluated in studies at high risk of bias, factors which we consider would make their data less usable.</P>
<P>Topical ivermectin 1% is registered for papulopustular rosacea by the FDA and registration in Europe is expected in the near future. Two studies showed a statistically significant and clinically important improvement in favour of topical ivermectin when compared to placebo, with the quality of evidence rated as high (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). Furthermore, based on one recently published study (<LINK REF="STD-Taieb-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Taieb 2015</LINK>) topical ivermectin appeared to be slightly more effective than topical metronidazole for subtype 2 rosacea (<LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>). Another new compound, brimonidine, which was recently approved by both the FDA and EMA for treatment of erythema in rosacea, was shown to be more effective than vehicle in reducing erythema at all time points over 12 hours, with the quality of evidence rated as high (see <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>). Topical clindamycin phosphate combined with tretinoin was not considered to be effective compared to placebo (moderate quality of the evidence) (see <LINK REF="SOF-08" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 8</LINK>). For ocular rosacea topical ciclosporin ophthalmic emulsion demonstrated effectiveness with the quality of the evidence rated as low (see <LINK REF="SOF-07" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 7</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the comparisons assessing oral treatments, there was moderate quality evidence that tetracycline is effective but this was based on two rather old studies which were of short duration (<LINK REF="SOF-09" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 9</LINK>). The newer tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline were evaluated in several comparisons but mainly at the lower dose. The anti-inflammatory dose of 40 mg doxycycline was shown to be effective for papulopustular rosacea (moderate to high quality evidence for the outcomes listed) (see <LINK REF="SOF-10" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 10</LINK>) and as effective as 100 mg doxycycline but with one quarter of the side effects (low quality evidence) (see <LINK REF="SOF-12" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 12</LINK>). There was no statistically significant difference in effectiveness or safety when low dose doxycycline was combined with either topical metronidazole or azelaic acid (<LINK REF="SOF-13" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 13</LINK>). There was very low quality evidence from one study assessed as at high risk of bias that doxycycline 100 mg was as effective as azithromycin (<LINK REF="SOF-11" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 11</LINK>). Unfortunately we were unable to include further studies evaluating the effectiveness of azithromycin, even though this is a frequently prescribed drug for rosacea. Low dose minocycline 45 mg either combined with topical azelaic acid gel or as stand-alone therapy was effective for papulopustular rosacea (low quality evidence) (see <LINK REF="SOF-14" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 14</LINK>).</P>
<P>Oral (oxy)tetracycline was compared with topical metronidazole in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Monk-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Monk 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1983b" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1983b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schachter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Schachter 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veien-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Veien 1986</LINK>) and showed no statistically significant difference between the two treatment modalities for any outcome, with the quality of evidence rated as low to moderate for the outcomes listed (see <LINK REF="SOF-15" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 15</LINK>).</P>
<P>Isotretinoin is frequently prescribed 'off-label' for rosacea, albeit in the absence of any evidence underpinned by RCTs, therefore it was reassuring to be able to include one study comparing the effectiveness of isotretinoin 0.3 mg/kg with doxycycline 100 mg. Low dose isotretinoin was considered by both the participants and the physicians to be slightly more effective than doxycycline 50 to 100 mg (high quality of the evidence) (see <LINK REF="SOF-16" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 16</LINK>). Although there was no statistically significant difference in the number of adverse events between the two treatment groups, isotretinoin has a well known safety profile and can only be prescribed in women of child bearing age following the Risk Management Programme of the FDA and American Medical Association (AMA).</P>
<P>Pulsed dye laser (PDL) was more effective than Nd:YAG laser based on one study (quality of evidence rated low) (see <LINK REF="SOF-17" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 17</LINK>), and it appeared to be as effective as intense pulsed light therapy (quality of the evidence rated low to moderate) (see <LINK REF="SOF-18" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 18</LINK>).</P>
<P>No studies could be included that addressed the variant granulomatous rosacea.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-04-26 11:52:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Esther van Zuuren">
<P>Study duration was less than eight weeks in 32/106 studies, which is an inadequate period of time to demonstrate an optimal treatment effect for some of the interventions. Because rosacea is a chronic disease there is a pressing need for more studies that evaluate strategies focused on therapies that are capable of maintaining remission. Consequently, the evidence was noticeably incomplete for some of these interventions such as, for example, patient education and avoidance measures for trigger factors, that is certain foods and exposure to heat and sunlight, or the use of non-irritating cosmetics. The review also failed to identify any eligible studies addressing dietary manipulation or sun protective measures for the treatment of rosacea. However, the majority of included studies provided enough evidence to draw conclusions on effectiveness of the various treatment options for the different subtypes, notwithstanding the fact that most people with rosacea suffer from more than one subtype and often a combination of treatments will be needed to reach a satisfactory result. Moreover, in clinical practice it is not always possible to definitively differentiate between subtype 1 and subtype 2 rosacea. Indeed, people may have more signs and symptoms of subtype 1 at a point in time and at another point in time more features of subtype 2.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatments for subtype 1, erythematotelangiectatic rosacea</HEADING>
<P>Erythema or telangiectasia, or both, were inclusion criteria in 63 studies, however only 16 studies addressed subtype 1, erythematotelangiectatic rosacea. In 47 studies erythema and telangiectasia were part of the diagnosis of subtype 2, papulopustular rosacea. Whilst erythema or telangiectasia were not pre-specified inclusion criteria for 18 studies, these were assessed as an outcome at baseline and follow-up in a study only in participants with papulopustular rosacea.</P>
<P>Around 40% (43) of the total number of included studies demonstrated a reduction in erythema but in general not of telangiectasia. In view of the potential impact of these reductions on the quality of life for people with rosacea, future updates of this review should place increased emphasis on the effects of interventions on both erythema and telangiectasia. The use of different scoring systems to assess improvements of erythema and telangiectasia, and the paucity and variability of evidence on the effects of interventions on this subtype of rosacea, did not in most cases permit firm conclusions to be made. The Clinician's Erythema Assessment (CEA) tool which rates erythema on a 5-point Likert scale (from 0 = clear to 4 = severe erythema, fiery redness) was used in 16 of the 106 studies included in this review. The CEA has been validated and is reported to have a high inter-rater and good intra-rater reliability when used by experienced and trained raters (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2014</LINK>). Applying the same scale in future studies will enable more accurate and directly quantifiable comparisons of erythema between the different interventions.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Topical treatments</HEADING>
<P>Robust evidence based on data gathered using the CEA scale came from several studies evaluating brimonidine (<LINK REF="STD-Fowler-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Fowler 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fowler-2012b" TYPE="STUDY">Fowler 2012b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fowler-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Fowler 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fowler-2013b" TYPE="STUDY">Fowler 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kendall-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kendall 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01885000" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01885000</LINK>). There was high quality evidence that brimonidine was effective for erythema over a 12 hour period, with a peak effect occurring between three and six hours. As erythema also occurs in other subtypes of rosacea, its use is not restricted to subtype 1.<BR/>None of the data showed that BFH772 1% (betamethasone and calcipotriol) was any better than vehicle ointment (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01449591" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01449591</LINK>), and the same holds true for TDT 068 gel (ultra-deformable Sequessome<SUP>TM</SUP> vesicles) (<LINK REF="STD-Luger-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Luger 2015</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Laser and light therapies</HEADING>
<P>Lasers and light therapies would appear to have a major clinical role to play in the treatment of erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, but these treatment modalities are still largely under researched in RCTs. There was some evidence that PDL, Nd:YAG laser and intense pulsed light therapy are capable of reducing erythema and telangiectasia on the face (<LINK REF="STD-Alam-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Alam 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karsai-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Karsai 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neuhaus-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Neuhaus 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nymann-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nymann 2010</LINK>). Because clearance of the redness and telangiectasia occurring on the face is highly desirable, and can be a source of personal embarrassment and lead to low self esteem, further studies of laser and light-based therapies should be considered a priority (<LINK REF="REF-Menezes-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menezes 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>Pooled data for topical metronidazole (<LINK REF="STD-Bjerke-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bjerke 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breneman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Breneman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1983a</LINK>) and azelaic acid (<LINK REF="STD-Bjerke-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bjerke 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Draelos-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Draelos 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thiboutot-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Thiboutot 2003a;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Thiboutot-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Thiboutot 2003b</LINK>) indicate that both are effective treatments for rosacea. However, based on the assessments in <LINK REF="STD-Elewski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Elewski 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Maddin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Maddin 1999</LINK>, azelaic acid would appear to be more effective than metronidazole albeit with more side effects. The more recent study of <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 2006</LINK> failed to demonstrate improved effectiveness of one of these two treatments over the other and, therefore, further supporting evidence is still required.</P>
<P>No statistically significant difference in effect was reported between the two concentrations of topical metronidazole or when different vehicles were compared in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beutner-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Beutner 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dahl-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dreno-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dreno 1998</LINK>). Topical metronidazole was also shown to be effective in maintaining remission (<LINK REF="STD-Dahl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>A single daily dose of azelaic acid appears to be as effective as the twice daily dose, and is also likely to result in improved compliance (<LINK REF="STD-Thiboutot-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Thiboutot 2008</LINK>). This comparison warrants further investigation.</P>
<P>The results in <LINK REF="STD-Thiboutot-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Thiboutot 2009</LINK> illustrate that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that azelaic acid is either effective or ineffective for maintenance treatment. Rosacea is a chronic disease and therefore RCTs investigating the effectiveness of azelaic acid and metronidazole used in maintenance therapy are still required.</P>
<P>Topical ivermectin was shown to be more effective than placebo (high quality evidence) (<LINK REF="STD-Stein-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2014b" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2014b</LINK>) and slightly more effective than metronidazole (moderate to high quality evidence) (<LINK REF="STD-Taieb-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Taieb 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effectiveness or otherwise of benzoyl peroxide in the treatment of papulopustular rosacea remains unclear. The conflicting results in <LINK REF="STD-Leyden-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Leyden 2011</LINK> and the inadequate study design coupled with a short study duration of four weeks did not enable any definitive conclusions to be drawn from <LINK REF="STD-Montes-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Montes 1983</LINK>. Benzoyl peroxide combined with clindamycin was investigated in <LINK REF="STD-Breneman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Breneman 2004</LINK> but the data were incomplete; no standard deviations were reported and the data were skewed, which did not permit firm conclusions to be made about the efficacy of this combined intervention.</P>
<P>Sodium sulphacetamide 10% in combination with sulphur 5% would appear to be more effective than metronidazole but further research is warranted, especially because two of the studies for this intervention were assessed as being at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Lebwohl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lebwohl 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torok-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Torok 2005</LINK>) and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sauder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sauder 1997</LINK>) at unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>The evidence for the effectiveness of permethrin for rosacea was inconclusive, and therefore further trials with a rigorous study design are still required (<LINK REF="STD-Ko_x00e7_ak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Koak 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mostafa-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mostafa 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no evidence to support the effectiveness of pimecrolimus, however this was based on very limited and largely unusable data presented in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Koca-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Koca 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weissenbacher-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Weissenbacher 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several studies which examined topical calcineurin antagonists could not be included as they were not RCTs or did not match the pre-specified inclusion criteria for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Chu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crawford-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crawford 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garg-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Garg 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2008</LINK>). Further well-designed, double-blind RCTs which examine the potential benefits of calcineurin antagonists as a treatment option for rosacea are required.</P>
<P>No eligible studies were identified for dapsone or topical tretinoin, although these treatments are still in fairly common use in the treatment of rosacea (<LINK REF="REF-Jansen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jansen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thiboutot-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thiboutot 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilkin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkin 1994</LINK>).

</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Oral treatments for papules and pustules</HEADING>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Marks-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sneddon-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Sneddon 1966</LINK>) evaluated the effects of tetracycline. In both of these studies the physicians' assessments indicated an improvement in severity, but only <LINK REF="STD-Marks-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1971</LINK> provided data on the participants' assessments of treatment. In contrast, although the six week study duration may appear to have been too short, the assessments of the participants nevertheless failed to provide any evidence of a difference in effectiveness between tetracycline and placebo. The data from these two studies are further supported by <LINK REF="STD-Monk-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Monk 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1983b" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1983b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schachter-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Schachter 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Veien-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Veien 1986</LINK>, which compared (oxy)tetracycline with topical metronidazole. Tetracyclines are used extensively for the treatment of rosacea and, although their efficacy may be widely accepted by clinicians, this is currently not substantiated by high level evidence from robust and methodologically sound clinical trials.</P>
<P>Whilst a number of studies included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Del-Rosso-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Del Rosso 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Del-Rosso-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Del Rosso 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Del-Rosso-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Del Rosso 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fowler-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fowler 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanchez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez 2005</LINK>) demonstrated the efficacy of an anti-inflammatory dose of doxycycline as a reduction in physician-assessed lesion counts, quite significantly the participants' views and satisfaction with the effects of this intervention were not assessed. Furthermore, while there was a measurable decrease in lesion counts as a result of the intervention, it was unclear if these counts were continuing to decrease or had stabilised by the time the studies were completed.</P>
<P>Although a number of studies have shown that anti-inflammatory doses of doxycycline do not have an antimicrobial effect on skin flora, nor do they lead to an increase in the number or severity of resistant organisms, studies with a longer duration and which are capable of providing conclusive evidence of the efficacy of an anti-inflammatory dose of doxycycline are still required (<LINK REF="REF-Bikowski-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bikowski 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fowler-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fowler 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Korting-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korting 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sloan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sloan 2008</LINK>). There is evidence from these trials that the 40 mg dose is at least as effective as the 100 mg dose and has a correspondingly lower risk of adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Del-Rosso-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Del Rosso 2008</LINK>); although these events may be mild to moderate, more were reported with the 100 mg of doxycycline than the 40 mg dose. Therefore, because anti-inflammatory doses of antibiotics represent a novel approach in the management of rosacea, further trials evaluating the effects of such dosing regimens of other antibiotics should be encouraged (<LINK REF="REF-Bikowski-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bikowski 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fowler-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fowler 2007</LINK>). Low dose minocycline is yet another tetracycline with demonstrable effectiveness in papulopustular rosacea. The data for the various outcomes of all investigated tetracyclines were assessed as low to high quality evidence.</P>
<P>Although a number of studies which examined the effects of azithromycin were retrieved in our searches, they were excluded from this review because they were not RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Bakar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bakar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bakar 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bakar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakar 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dereli-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dereli 2005</LINK>). Only one study which compared azithromycin with doxycycline (<LINK REF="STD-Akhyani-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Akhyani 2008</LINK>), assessed as at high risk of bias, was included but the data were skewed and consequently more research is required on the effects of this intervention.</P>
<P>Low dose isotretinoin 0.3 kg/kg was slightly more effective for papulopustular rosacea than doxycycline 50 to 100 mg (high quality evidence) (<LINK REF="STD-Gollnick-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gollnick 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several studies examined other interventions such as rilmenidine and ampicillin (<LINK REF="STD-Grosshans-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Grosshans 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marks-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 1971</LINK>) and, although the latter showed some evidence of effectiveness, neither are now considered as treatment options by clinicians. There were contradictory results for oral zinc (<LINK REF="STD-Bamford-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bamford 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharquie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sharquie 2006</LINK>) and limited data on oral ivermectin (<LINK REF="STD-Salem-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Salem 2013</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Topical treatments for erythema and telangiectasia in papulopustular rosacea</HEADING>
<P>More than half of the included studies assessed the effects of interventions on erythema or telangiectasia, or both, in participants with papulopustular rosacea. These are important participant-preferred outcomes and are also integral to the physician-assessed changes in rosacea severity. These outcomes have been reported in the <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK> section of this review. As stated above under 'Topical treatments for erythema is subtype 1', brimonidine can also be used for treatment of erythema in other subtypes.</P>
<P>Based on the data reported in <LINK REF="STD-Bjerke-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bjerke 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bleicher-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bleicher 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breneman-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Breneman 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dahl-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Elewski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Elewski 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ko_x00e7_ak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Koak 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Monk-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Monk 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1983a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tirnaksiz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tirnaksiz 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 2006</LINK>, topical metronidazole appears to be effective in reducing erythema.

Two studies provided some evidence for the effectiveness of permethrin on erythema (<LINK REF="STD-Ko_x00e7_ak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Koak 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mostafa-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mostafa 2009</LINK>), however further research is required. The scales used in the assessments of these treatments varied widely, the reporting was mostly incomplete, and it remained unclear if these treatments merely had an effect on perilesional redness or additionally improved background or persistent redness. More evidence is needed on the effectiveness or otherwise of five other topical interventions, P-3075 cream (<LINK REF="STD-Berardesca-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Berardesca 2012</LINK>); 4-ethoxybenzaldehyde (<LINK REF="STD-Draelos-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Draelos 2005b</LINK>); praziquantel (<LINK REF="STD-Bribeche-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bribeche 2015</LINK>); a skin care product containing ambophenol, neurosensine and La Roche-Posay thermal spring water (<LINK REF="STD-Seit_x00e9_-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Seit 2013</LINK>); and SEI003 cream (serine protease inhibitor) (<LINK REF="STD-Two-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Two 2014</LINK>). These interventions were addressed in small sample size studies. A rosacea treatment system consisting of gentle cleanser, metronidazole 0.75% gel, hydrating complexion corrector and skin balancing sunscreen SPF 30 was not more effective than metronidazole + the standard care regimen of the rosacea treatment system without metronidazole; data reporting was however incomplete and SDs were missing (<LINK REF="STD-Leyden-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Leyden 2011</LINK>). Cream containing a 1% extract of a flavonoid-rich plant <I>Chrysanthellum indicum</I> was also not more effective than placebo in reducing erythema (<LINK REF="STD-Rigopoulos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rigopoulos 2005</LINK>).</P>

Only the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Barnhorst-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Barnhorst 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schechter-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schechter 2009</LINK> provided usable data.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Topical treatments</HEADING>
<P>Although there was insufficient evidence to support the efficacy of topical metronidazole for ocular rosacea (<LINK REF="STD-Barnhorst-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Barnhorst 1996</LINK>), there was some evidence of a consistent improvement in all outcomes and that ciclosporin a 0.05% ophthalmic emulsion was more effective than artificial tears in the treatment of ocular rosacea (<LINK REF="STD-Schechter-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schechter 2009</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatments for the variant granulomatous rosacea</HEADING>
<P>No studies were identified that assessed the variant granulomatous rosacea.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>The adverse events reported were mostly mild and transient and were comprised of skin irritation, pruritus, tinging or burning or dry skin. In most of the studies the number and types of adverse events did not differ significantly between active treatment and the placebo group, however these were not always reported adequately or completely.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Limitations in study design and implementation</HEADING>
<P>Although the overall clinical design of the included studies appeared to be adequate, our assessments of risk of bias revealed some of the limitations in the quality of the studies covering many of the interventions.</P>
<OL>
<LI>There was considerable variation in how well the studies were reported and in particular the methods used to generate the randomisation sequence, to conceal the allocation, and the measures taken to blind investigators and participants. These factors, compounded with unsuccessful attempts to contact many of the investigators for additional information, created difficulties in making accurate assessments of the risk of bias in some of the included studies.</LI>
<LI>A significant proportion of the outcome data was not normally distributed (skewed). SDs were frequently missing from study reports, which meant that in many instances continuous outcome data could not be entered in a meta-analysis. For most treatment comparators it was not possible to pool data relating to the various studies, and it was only possible to pool the data for a limited number of outcomes in the trials evaluating topical metronidazole and azelaic acid.</LI>
</OL>
<P>However, whilst recognising these limitations the authors consider that the body of evidence summarised in this review is sufficient to allow certain conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness of several of the interventions used in the treatment of rosacea.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Indirectness of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>The participants included in the studies were to a large extent representative of the population as pre-specified in '<LINK TAG="CRIT_PARTICIPANTS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of participants</LINK>'. Almost half of the studies (49) included in this review were placebo-controlled trials, which may only provide limited evidence on the advantages or disadvantages of new relative to existing interventions. However, 46 active-controlled studies were also included and these gave access to data not only on the risks and benefits of individual interventions but also the comparative efficacy of these interventions; thus these head-to-head trials are more likely to have provided evidence that is both relevant and direct. Eleven studies included a placebo in addition to an active treatment arm.</P>
<P>Patient-relevant primary outcomes are a pre-requisite for informing evidence-based clinical decision making but the importance of patient-reported outcomes (PRO), and specifically those used in evaluating the impact of interventions on quality of life, appears to have been underestimated by the investigators in most of the included studies. Improvement in symptoms may not necessarily equate with or translate into measurably significant changes in quality of life for the individual; and therefore whilst a moderate change in some of the physical symptoms, that is erythema, may be interpreted by clinicians as evidence of effective treatment it does little to address the wider psychological distress or physical disfigurement that may occur in those with chronic rosacea. Thus, although the majority of reports appeared to recognise the importance of patient-assessment of symptoms, in reality greater emphasis was placed on the reporting of lesion counts as primary outcomes whereas self-assessments were almost always considered as secondary outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Inconsistency of results</HEADING>
<P>Although a diverse range of interventions were considered in this systematic review, the majority of participants in the included studies had subtype 1 and 2 rosacea. The results for specific outcomes were fairly consistent across the very limited number of studies and interventions where pooling of data was feasible.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Imprecision of results</HEADING>
<P>The rather limited number of studies that were included in this review examining similar interventions did not permit any substantive assessment of the degree of precision of effect. Small sample sizes were responsible for most of the imprecision.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>A large number of abstracts to conference proceedings were identified. Some were published in full but a number were not otherwise available. There is a possibility that a number of reports, in particular those which conclude negative outcomes, involve serious adverse effects or a lack of effect, may have been sponsored by parties with potentially vested interests, remain unpublished.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-04-11 14:22:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Esther van Zuuren">
<P>Serious attempts were made to limit bias in the review process by ensuring a comprehensive search for potentially eligible studies. The authors' independent assessments of eligibility of studies for inclusion in this review and the extraction of data minimised the potential for additional bias beyond that detailed in the 'Risk of bias' tables. The incomplete reporting of trial details, results, or both in some of the included studies, and our inability to obtain satisfactory clarification from trial investigators, may have contributed to some biased assessment in the review process. Where these conditions applied this was explicitly stated in the text of our review.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-04-11 14:29:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Esther van Zuuren">
<P>A number of studies, reviews and guidelines have been published since we last updated this review, a fuller listing of these can be found in DynaMed (<A HREF="https://dynamed.ebscohost.com/">https://dynamed.ebscohost.com/</A>). Although we are in broad agreement that the conclusions reached in these other studies reflect the present findings, we express a level of disagreement with the methods used to reach these conclusions, more specifically in the assessments of the quality of the evidence and how these might correlate with the individual recommendations. All of the studies that were identified appear to have comprehensively and succinctly covered this clinical topic and, based on the references cited, providing a degree of reassurance that a competent literature search had been undertaken. These studies included an update of guidelines produced by the American Acne and Rosacea Society (AARS) (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Rosso-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Rosso 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Del-Rosso-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Rosso 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Del-Rosso-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Rosso 2014b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Del-Rosso-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Rosso 2014b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tanghetti-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanghetti 2014</LINK>), the S1 Guideline developed by the German Society of Dermatology (<LINK REF="REF-Reinholz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reinholz 2013</LINK>), a consensus document proposing an evidence-based treatment approach by the Rosacea International Expert Group (ROSIE) (<LINK REF="REF-Elewski-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elewski 2011</LINK>) and two literature reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Korting-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korting 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moustafa-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moustafa 2014b</LINK>).</P>
<P>No details were reported on how studies were selected for inclusion, however the S1 Guideline developers stated that the consensus recommendations of the AARS were based on a "thorough literature review and observations from clinical experience", and also indicated that the process involved an "informal expert panel for consensus". The literature cited in both of these guidelines was complete but there was no indication of how the primary research had been critically appraised by the expert panels, and it appeared that the recommendations, although consensus based, were underpinned by study level assessments of evidence from relevant clinical trials. Similarly, neither of the two other reviews or the consensus document referred to any aspects of the methodological quality of the studies supporting the specific interventions, which was distinct from the more detailed exploration of the quality of the evidence undertaken in this review. We have emphasized, where appropriate in this review, the limitations in study design of the included studies and the potential impact of these limitations on the quality of the evidence. Although we have identified these limitations in our review, they may be of less relevance to well-established therapies, but may provide cautionary information for those interventions where benefits may marginally exceed potential harms or, indeed, may be critical for the further assessment of newer therapies.</P>
<P>Effect measures can enable clinically meaningful comparisons of efficacy to be made between trials. These were reported, mostly in general terms, in only one of the guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Reinholz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reinholz 2013</LINK>), and only for the emerging therapies in <LINK REF="REF-Moustafa-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moustafa 2014b</LINK>; whereas we have reported these magnitudes of effect in more detail, as either RR or MD, for many of the outcomes in single studies as well as in the meta-analyses across several studies.</P>
<P>Many of the studies evaluating the effects of interventions on rosacea emphasize the significant impact of this condition on the psychosocial well-being and quality of life of the individual, thus it was somewhat surprising to see that neither of the guidelines involved patients or patient advocacy groups but appeared to be more reliant on the contribution of expert panels. In contrast, and in terms of recognising the significant impact of this condition on patients, we have tried to ensure that we received timely, patient-relevant input at all stages of conducting and reporting in this review and have also included a consumer as a co-author.</P>
<P>Guidelines provide balanced information on the benefits and limitations of the therapeutic interventions being evaluated. Their process of development should be transparent, robust and reproducible, and should clearly demonstrate that the supporting evidence was systematically reviewed. The strength of clinical recommendations in the two guidelines did not correspond to the widely-recognised GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to developing and presenting recommendations for the appropriate health care for specific clinical conditions or circumstances (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>). In contrast, we used the GRADE method in this review to examine and categorise the quality level of a body of evidence and to explain our confidence in the effect estimates for several of the interventions, which we have presented in the 'Summary of findings' tables.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-04-12 07:24:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Esther van Zuuren">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-04-12 07:24:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Esther van Zuuren">
<P>Based on only those studies which are most likely to have provided reliable results, that is those that are reproducible, repeatable and therefore valid, and selecting the most rigorously described and conducted studies, we have made several conclusions. Evidence of treatment effect could be demonstrated for several of the interventions studied. In daily practice often a combination of treatments should be chosen based on the activity of signs and symptoms of the specific subtype, or combination of subtypes.</P>
<UL>
<LI>There is high quality evidence to support the effectiveness and safety of brimonidine topical gel for reducing erythema over 12 hours after application in the management of persistent erythema in rosacea. There was low to moderate quality evidence of the effectiveness of pulsed dye laser and intense pulsed light therapy for erythematotelangiectatic rosacea.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>For subtype 2, papulopustular rosacea, topical metronidazole, azelaic acid, topical ivermectin, anti-inflammatory dose doxycycline (40 mg), tetracycline and isotretinoin 0.3 mg/kg appear to be effective and safe for short-term use (moderate to high quality of evidence). It still needs to be established whether azelaic acid is more effective than topical metronidazole, but topical ivermectin appeared to be slightly more effective than topical metronidazole. There is evidence that 40 mg doxycycline is at least as effective as 100 mg, with evidence of fewer adverse effects (low quality of evidence). There is low quality evidence for the effectiveness and safety of low dose minocycline 45 mg and very low quality evidence of azithromycin for this subtype. There is no clear evidence that any one of these treatments, or any combination of treatments, has a particular advantage in terms of higher remission rates or fewer adverse effects.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>No studies could be included that addressed treatment of phymatous rosacea (subtype 3).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>For ocular rosacea (subtype 4), ciclosporin 0.05% ophthalmic emulsion was shown to be more beneficial than artificial tears (low quality evidence).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Clinical decision making on the choice of intervention for rosacea should be based on high-level evidence if it is available, but in the absence of such evidence for any specific intervention these decisions should continue to be guided by clinical experience and patients' individual characteristics and preferences until further evidence becomes available.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-04-07 05:58:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The impact of available treatment on ocular rosacea warrants further examination, and this might include the removal of Meibomian cysts. Less direct interventions, such as dietary adjustments, avoidance measures for trigger factors, the use of sunscreens and patient education, in addition to trials investigating which is the most effective treatment for phymatous rosacea and granulomatous rosacea, are further areas of much needed research. Conceivably some of the studies listed in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>' section of this review will be able to provide answers to these remaining questions.</P>
<P>There was wide variability in not only the conduct but also the quality of reporting of many of the trials. A major area for improvement would be in the standardisation of outcome reporting in any future research, as suggested by the COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials) Initiative (http://www.comet-initiative.org/). The use of proprietary severity scales and non-standardised erythema scales significantly hampered our ability to combine study results for meta-analysis. Outcomes collected in future trials should be primarily based on a standardised scale of the participant's assessment of the treatment efficacy, and also have a greater emphasis on changes in quality of life as a result of the interventions. Standardised and uniform scales should be developed and used for physicians' assessments, and these should reliably reflect global evaluation, lesion counts, and assessment of erythema and telangiectasia.</P>
<P>Time needed for a response and response duration should be addressed more completely, and adverse events reported more rigorously. Furthermore, to ensure improved clinical decision making, future research should place a greater emphasis on the management and treatment of rosacea based on the staging pattern of the disease.</P>
<P>Future randomised controlled trials must be well-designed, well-conducted, and adequately delivered with subsequent reporting, including high-quality descriptions of all aspects of methodology. Rigorous reporting needs to conform to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</A>) statement, and this will enable appraisal and interpretation of results and accurate judgements to be made about the risk of bias and the quality of the evidence of the selected outcomes. Although it is uncertain whether the reported quality mirrors actual study conduct, it is noteworthy that studies with unclear methodology have been shown to produce biased estimates of treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Adherence to guidelines, such as the CONSORT statement, would help ensure complete reporting.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2015-04-07 06:12:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update we have revised all of the search strategies and added a search of the LILACS database. LILACS is now a standard resource used in Cochrane Skin Group reviews. The Cochrane randomised control trial filters for MEDLINE and EMBASE have been refined since the previous version of this review, and the latest versions have been used for this update. We also removed many terms that were symptoms of rosacea rather than being synonyms for the disease itself. We checked the new strategies against the previous ones to ensure they were robust enough to capture relevant RCTs.</P>
<P>For this update we added an additional physician-assessed outcome 'assessment of erythema or telangiectasia, or both, at end of study'. In previous versions these data were in part reflected in 'Other data' tables, but we thought it would be more appropriate to have this outcome as a separate listed outcome, as erythema is very bothersome to people with rosacea. We have removed 'dropout rates' as an outcome as this is already listed in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' tables, as well as under attrition bias in the risk of bias tables. Adverse events moved to primary outcomes as these should include events that are of potential harm (MECIR C14).</P>
<P>We also revised the 'Methods' section to meet the latest requirements of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> as well as the MECIR reporting standards. As it is unlikely we will encounter cluster trials we removed this item under 'units of analysis issues'.</P>
<P>For this update the additional comparisons of interventions of within-participant studies have been included after extracting the RR or MD and SE for those that appropriately accounted for the variability. These studies were then included in meta-analyses (where appropriate) with the other studies using a generic inverse-method of analysis in Revman.</P>
<P>After consulting Toby Lasserson, Alain Mayhew and the Editorial board of the Cochrane Skin Group we agreed that funding would be added in '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' tables. However, in cases where we considered that the financial support, or the employment of the investigators by the pharmaceutical company, might have posed a risk of bias we would report this, just like in former versions, in the domain 'Other bias' of the risk of bias tables.</P>
<P>We have added 'Summary of findings' tables according to the latest requirements of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> and MECIR.</P>
<P>All fixed-effect model calculations for data synthesis have been recalculated to the random-effects model in line with the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>.</P>
<P>In the former 2011 update, at the request of the Skin Group odds ratios have been changed into risk ratios. Because risk and odds are different when events are common, the risk ratio and the odds ratio also differ when events are common. The Skin Group recommends that because many of the outcomes of trials of skin conditions are common events risk ratios should be used.</P>
<P>In the protocol (published in 2001) we had planned, under the section <LINK TAG="CRIT_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of studies</LINK>, to include randomised controlled trials in people with moderate to severe rosacea. By the time the review was first published 2004 'Types of studies' had been amended to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met the methodological criteria. This remained the same for the substantial update that was published in 2005. We had previously excluded trials that were RCTs and otherwise matched our inclusion criteria if they were assessed to be of low methodological quality. Following the advice of the Skin Group's editors, we re-assessed all of the excluded RCTs and those which matched the inclusion criteria were included in the former update of this review (2011) and the participant data were analysed (if appropriate).</P>
<P>For the former update we rewrote the Methods section, especially the 'Data collection and analysis' section after comments from our referees. We added a part on 'Assessment of heterogeneity of studies' and only pooled outcomes if we had at least three studies to provide an acceptable body of evidence to examine the intervention. In earlier versions we pooled the data of two studies. </P>
<P>Having abandoned the use of quality judgments to exclude some trials, we assessed all included studies using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing bias.</P>

<P>We only included second phase as first phase (up to 12 weeks). All participants received doxycycline 100 mg BID + azelaic acid 15% gel BID in first phase. However, participants who did not respond in first phase were not included in second phase, this means these data cannot be generalised for all participants with papulopustular rosacea. Two of our primary outcomes were addressed (participant-assessed changes in rosacea severity and adverse events)</P>

<P>nathalie.wagner@galderma.com, 1-8-2014 (sequence generation and allocation concealment)<BR/>1) Regarding the allocation sequence generated for the 4 subsequent groups consisting of different doses or regimen for topical applications, the randomisation list was created before the study started, with a 1:1:1:1 ratio and block size of 4. This randomisation list was generated by a designated biostatistician and was distributed to the clinical supply team in a sealed envelope (see the attached pdf file for the randomisation memo)</P>
<P>2) As explained above, only the 4 arms treated with topical products were to be randomised. The block size of 4 was not known by the sites, so foreseeing the next allocation was possible but unlikely. Since the study had 2 treatment groups for QD regimen and 2 treatment groups for BID regimen, subjects and the personnel who distributed the medication necessarily knew this information</P>
<P>Of note, the primary objective of this study was PK assessment (and not efficacy), an objective measure, and the primary comparison was topical versus eye drop which was in no way planned to be randomised or blinded</P>
<P>3) This study was not posted on CT.gov since it was classified as a phase 1 study</P>

<P>1. This was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study</P>
<P>Patients, having signed their informed consent and who satisfied all inclusion and exclusion criteria at inclusion visit were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (P-3075 cream, placebo), according to a computer-generated randomisation list</P>
<P>Patients were sequentially assigned to the next available randomisation number, starting from the lowest number provided to each investigational site</P>
<P>Furthermore, for ethical reason, in order to minimise the exposure to placebo, randomisation was unbalanced between the P-3075 and placebo groups with a 2:1 ratio using blocks of 3 treatments</P>
<P/>
<P>2/3. The double blind study design was guaranteed by the use of placebo cream units, which were identical to the active product in terms of size, shape, volume, colour. The tubes (P-3075 and placebo) were identically labelled for clinical use as it is in a double-blind procedure</P>
<P/>
<P>4. Thank you for this observation (you are the first). We confirm that the correct value is -167.00 and not 167.00, as reported in our database. It was a typing error that was not detected when the manuscript was transformed in draft paper by the editor</P>
<P/>
<P>5. As described in the paper, a 4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) was used by the investigators at each visit for the clinical evaluation of erythema</P>
<P>The results at Day 28 (end of treatment) showed that, in the P-3075 group, erythema was absent in 27 patients (96.4%) and mild in 1 (3.6%), while in the placebo group, erythema was absent in 9 patients (64.3%) and mild in 5 (35.7%). There were no cases of moderate or severe intensity at Day 28 in both groups. The statistically significance values were reported in the paper as you underlined. For completeness the baseline clinical assessment for erythema was as follows: for P-3075 absent in 7 patients, mild in 14, moderate in 6 and severe in 1 and for placebo absent in 3 patients, mild in 6 and moderate in 5</P>

<P>'ridha.bribech@gmail.com' 30-8-2014<BR/>Dear professor Bribeche (allocation concealment and blinding)<BR/>reply 7-9-2014: 1- During enrolment we used an allocation randomiser programme: http://www.randomizer.org/<BR/>2- Only the participants were blinded to treatment, praziquantel ointment and the placebo had the same colour (white), and ointment were given to participants in identical boxes for both groups (white box with a blue cover)<BR/>
<U>Next mail 7-9-2014:</U> The reply to our first question is more on sequence generation, and not concealment of the allocation. Who was responsible for using that programme and who had access to the generated list?</P>
<P>
<U>Reply 10-9-2014</U>: Me and professor Fedotov VP, were responsible for using this programme, both of us had access to the generated list and a doctor from our department (Dr Makurina); who was fully unaware of the aims of the study and overseen the enrolment<BR/>

<U>15-8-2014 </U>Randomisation was done centrally by the generation of a randomisation list using the randomisation program RANCODE (version 3.6). Randomisation used blocks. Whole randomisation blocks were allocated to each site. In each study site, each newly enrolled patient was allocated to study medication with the lowest randomisation number available in that particular site at the subjects baseline visit. The patient randomisation number was entered into the CRF immediately after allocation. Each patient retained the randomisation number originally allocated at Baseline for the duration of the study<BR/>
<BR/>Six drug tubes (tubes with a blinded label to cover the trademarks) and 3 bottles were packaged by a CMO in individual numbered kit boxes. Each patient was issued an individual numbered kit box containing 6 tubes and 3 bottles of study materials. The study drug was not to be dispensed by the investigator, but was dispensed by and returned to qualified study personnel (e.g., practice or clinic nurses) not involved with the selection and the assessment of the patients. At the control visits after Weeks 4, 8 and 12, patients returned empty, partially used, and unused containers to qualified study personnel before being examined by the investigator. Study drug compliance was assessed by the qualified study personnel. The patient was advised not to discuss the treatment schedule with the investigator<BR/>

<BR/>I will answer your questions below:<BR/>1. the method used to generate the allocation sequence as &#8220;were divided equally into two groups&#8221; does not seem at random. Subjects were randomised in two balanced populations based on a computer generated randomisation sequence<BR/>2. How was stratification done during the sequence generation? That is, can you describe the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow us an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups stratified for demographics and presence and severity of acne, eczema, rosacea and atopic dermatitis?<BR/>The data for each person was entered into a database and then the computer randomisation balanced the two groups for all of the characteristics you have mentioned<BR/>3. the method used to conceal the allocation sequence to ensure that intervention allocations could not have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment i.e. participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee the upcoming assignment (this is not the same as blinding!!).<BR/>I realize that randomisation and blinding are not the same. The products were identically packaged<BR/>4. How were the investigators and participants blinded to the treatment the participants received?<BR/>Yes, both the investigator and the participant did not know the product identity which was concealed through identically appearing products packaged identically<BR/>5. Are there separate data for women on rosacea? No, the data was not analysed in this fashion.</P>

<U>Follow-up mail 11-8-2014</U>
<BR/>reply 12-8-2014 1) Random selection by study coordinator<BR/>2) Medication and placebo allocation was the responsibility of the study coordinator who randomly selected which product to provide each subject (2:1 ratio). The investigators were unaware of the selection process and the study coordinator was not privy, prior to selection of product, of the type or severity of disease of any subject</P>
<P>3) Investigators were not privy to the medication/placebo selection process. No medication tubes were shown to the investigators. No questions were asked about the topical product (i.e. Odor, color or feel). There was no communication between the study coordinator and the investigators regarding the medication/placebo selection</P>
<P>
<U>follow-up mail 12-8-2014</U>
<BR/>Regarding 1) this answer still does not inform us the method, so what method did the study coordinator used?<BR/>Regarding 2) You describe that the investigators were unaware of selection process, but if the study coordinator was aware who received what, then the allocation was NOT concealed, even if he was not privy<BR/>Regarding 3) if the patients knew what they received they could tell the investigators, as slip of the tongue. So it might be that study coordinator did not say anything, the patients could say something to the investigator. So was there any possibility that patients knew what they received? And if not why not? Why did they not know what they received (as stated as double-blinded)<BR/>Response: 12-8-2014: Randomisation: every third patient was given placebo to create a 2:1 ratio<BR/>Follow-up mail: then it is not truly randomised but quasi-randomised as you know every third patient gets placebo it is no longer at random and we have to exclude the study<BR/>

<BR/>The generation of the random code list was performed in a validated environment by an independent CRO not involved in study conduct and monitoring using the software RANCODE Version 3.6. Central randomisation was performed by this CRO. For eligible subjects, investigators called the randomisation centre and provided the patient&#8217;s identification number and gender. Patients were subsequently randomised and the study centre was notified of the treatment number of the patient via telefax by the randomisation centre. Treatment allocation provided by the central randomisation service was documented in the CRF and monitored.<BR/>ad 2) The investigational product and its matching vehicle had a similar appearance and all subject kits were packaged in the same way. The randomisation list was kept strictly confidential. It was accessible only to authorized persons who were not involved in the conduct, monitoring and analysis of the study, until time of unblinding. Based on the randomisation list, sets of sealed individual code envelopes were prepared for emergency procedures. No emergency unblinding occurred during the study<BR/>

<P>1. The allocation sequence was generated by a statistician using a specific software</P>
<P>2. As soon as they have been recruited (because they answered to the inclusion criteria) by the investigating dermatologist (only one = Dr Zelenkova) a number given chronologically, as indicated in the allocation sequence purchase to the investigator, was attributed to the patient (the first was the N1, the 2<SUP>nd</SUP> the N 2&#8230;)</P>
<P>3. After enrolment and at the end of the 1<SUP>st</SUP> visit, a nurse (in the absence of the investigating dermatologist) give the products allocated to the patient&#8217;s number. Both products was in the same packaging (blind white packaging) without any indication about formula reference (only reference of study and number of patient) and some information about use (topical use only&#8230;)</P>
<P>4. None dropped out between the stop of metronidazole treatment (Week 8) and the end of the study (week 16). 67 patients were included before metronidazole treatment, 1 dropped out due to irritative dermatitis at day 53 (before the end of the 8-week Metronidazole treatment); So 66 patients remained after 8 weeks, 32 received the test formula and 34 the vehicle</P>
<P>5. More detail about the 66 patients included in this study are available (see below (printscreens))<BR/>

</P>
<P>The study was a parallel group study of 960 subjects; however 1800 kit numbers are randomised in blocks of 6. The RANUNI routine of the SAS system was used to randomly assign, in balanced blocks, kit to a treatment (Ivermectin 1% cream, Metronidazole 0.75% cream). Prior to the start of the study, a randomisation list was generated by the statistician and was secured with restricted access. Treatment assignment was balanced into consecutive blocks in a 1:1 ratio and kit numbers were assigned sequentially in chronological order. The study design was investigator-blinded. The integrity of the blinding was ensured by packaging the products in identical tubes, not allowing the investigator and subject to discuss study treatments, and requiring a third party other than the investigator to dispense the medication.</P>

<P>1. The allocation sequence was generated by an unblinded member of the study team who worked off-site in a separate laboratory to group in a 2-to-1 fashion, so that 8 of those numbers were assigned to the treatment group, and 4 to the control group. As subjects were enrolled in the study, they were sequentially assigned a unique study identification number from 1-12 by the blinded study coordinator, with the first subject to enrol in the study being assigned the study identification number of 1. The list matching study identification numbers to their corresponding treatment group was only accessible by this unblinded member of the study team</P>
<P/>
<P>2. The allocation sequence was created prior to enrolling any subjects in the study, therefore ensuring that intervention allocations could not be foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment</P>
<P/>
<P>3. This study was conducted in a double-blind fashion so that both participants and investigators were blinded as to which intervention group participants were assigned. As stated previously, randomisation was completed by an unblinded member of the study team who worked off-site and had no contact with enrolled subjects. The list of treatment group assignments was stored on a password-protected computer accessible only to this unblinded study team member. This same unblinded member of the study team was also responsible for preparing all study medication. Once prepared, the study medication was placed into a bottle labelled with the participant&#8217;s unique study identification number that was assigned to the participant at the time of enrolment in the trial. The unblinded study team member dispensed the bottles of prepared medication to the study&#8217;s clinical coordinator, who was also blinded, for distribution to subjects. Both the treatment and the control creams were identical in appearance and viscosity so that the two drugs could not be distinguished by look or feel<BR/>R<U>esent</U> regarding exact data IGE and CEA 12-9-2013<BR/>

<P>In addition, please be informed that we are currently conducting another permethrin trial (permethrin 5% vs placebo cream) in PPR-patients. We expect the results of this trial in spring 2015 (we discussed with PI, study does NOT appear in EUCTR (EUDRACT-Nr. 2013-000979-32)</P>

<P>mhaedersdal@dadlnet.dk 16-7-2014<BR/>My colleagues and I are conducting a Cochrane review (Interventions for rosacea) and one of your studies have been identified as potentially eligible for inclusion (NCT00483145 Laser-mediated photodynamic therapy of acne vulgaris and rosacea). It has been completed in 2007.<BR/>Has this study ever been published as I could not find it?</P>
<P>Reply 16-7-2014: We were unsuccessful in recruiting rosacea patients and as thus, published a case report, which is attached. Results from treating acne patients were published as a RCT, we have removed this one from ongoing studies<BR/>
