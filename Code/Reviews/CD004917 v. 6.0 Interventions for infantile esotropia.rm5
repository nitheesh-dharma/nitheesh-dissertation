<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-12 09:45:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sue Elliott">
<P>Infantile esotropia can affect the vision in the eye, the ability to use the two eyes together (binocularity) and also be a cosmetic issue to the child/parents. Treatment includes surgical and non-surgical interventions to reduce the squint and to enhance/aid binocularity in children. This review looks at the various interventions and also the timing of such treatment. The review did not find any randomised trials that compared treatment to another treatment or to no treatment. A large, multi-centre, non-randomised trial found that children operated on earlier had better binocularity at age six compared to the late surgery group. This group had been operated on more frequently however and there was no significant difference in the angle of the squint after surgery in either group. This review does not resolve the controversy regarding the best type of surgery, the value of non-surgical interventions and the optimal timing of either type of intervention. It highlights a need for further research in this area.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-12 09:45:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sue Elliott">
<P>Introduction</P>
<P>Strabismus (squint) is a misalignment of the eyes in which the visual axes deviate from bifoveal fixation (<LINK REF="REF-RCO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCO 2002</LINK>). It can be subdivided into esotropia (inward deviation), exotropia (outward deviation) or, less commonly, hypertropia (upward deviation), hypotropia (downward deviation) and cyclotropia (torsional deviations - inwards, incyclotorsion or out outwards, excyclotorsion). This review will specifically look at infantile esotropia (IE). Other terms that have been used to describe this condition include congenital esotropia and essential infantile esotropia.</P>
<P>Epidemiology</P>
<P>Strabismus is present in approximately 4% of children (<LINK REF="REF-Vaughan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaughan 1998</LINK>). The reported incidence of infantile esotropia within the first six months of life varies between 0.1% (<LINK REF="REF-Nixon-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nixon 1985</LINK>) and 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>Presentation and diagnosis</P>
<P>Infantile esotropia is a large, constant, stable angle esotropia (the angle indicates the degree/size of the squint) with an onset within the first six months of life (<LINK REF="REF-Kommerell-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kommerell 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Features associated with IE include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>alternating esotropia (can swap from one eye to the other);</LI>
<LI>cross-fixation: taking advantage of the crossed position of the eyes so that the right eye is used to look towards the left and the left eye to look towards the right. This can be associated with the appearance of limited abduction (outward movement) of the other eye;</LI>
<LI>manifest-latent nystagmus: oscillation of the eyes, which increases when either eye is covered;</LI>
<LI>asymmetry of optokinetic nystagmus: a following movement followed by a rapid fixation movement in the opposite direction. This can be demonstrated by using a rotating, striped drum;</LI>
<LI>over-acting inferior obliques: one of six muscles which move each eye. This usually occurs bilaterally (in either eye) but can be asymmetrical, leading to the development of a hypertropia in one or more positions of gaze (most prominent in adduction - inward movement of the eye);</LI>
<LI>dissociated vertical deviation (DVD): where either eye elevates resulting in a hypertropia when the amount of light entering it is reduced (<LINK REF="REF-Calcutt-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calcutt 1993</LINK>). This can also occur during a period of inattention or fatigue and can contribute to the hypertropia in adduction, since the nose can act as an occluder to the image being viewed;</LI>
<LI>refractive error (focusing error) within normal limits;</LI>
<LI>suppression: resulting in absence of binocular single vision (BSV) - the simultaneous use of the two eyes to give a single 3-dimensional image.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Significant amblyopia (a reduction in vision) is rare (<LINK REF="REF-Ansons-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansons 2001</LINK>). The main reason for presentation of children with infantile esotropia is usually parental awareness of unacceptable ocular misalignment.</P>
<P>Treatment options</P>
<P>Treatment aims to improve ocular misalignment. However, another important issue to consider is whether such treatment facilitates and enhances the development of binocular vision. Therefore there are two aims of intervention:</P>
<P>1. to align the visual axes;<BR/>2. to optimise the potential for binocularity. Many authorities believe that alignment to within 10 dioptres (^) of orthotropia 'straight eyes' by two years of age offers the best prospect for the development of binocular vision (<LINK REF="REF-Ing-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ing 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>Management of the strabismus may be surgical, non-surgical or a combination of both. As with other forms of strabismus, it is important to treat any amblyopia or significant refractive error when they exist, but as stated these are unusual findings in this condition.</P>
<P>Surgery to correct the esotropia involves adjusting the horizontally acting extraocular muscles, and can be divided into three types:</P>
<P>1. unilateral surgery: weakening, usually recession, of the medial rectus which is responsible for pulling the eye in and resection (strengthening) of the lateral rectus which is responsible for pulling the eye out;<BR/>2. bilateral surgery: the medial rectus is weakened in both eyes;<BR/>3. three or more muscle surgery (horizontal): a combination of recessions and resections.</P>
<P>Surgical adjustment of the vertically acting muscles may also be undertaken to correct any significant hypertropia:<BR/>1. weakening of the inferior oblique muscle responsible for pulling the eye up in adduction;<BR/>2. weakening of the superior rectus, responsible for pulling the eye up in abduction, adduction and in the primary (straight ahead) position.</P>
<P>The age at which surgery is performed can vary and authors have used various terms to describe the timing of surgery. For example, 'ultra early' has been used to describe surgical intervention between four and six months (<LINK REF="REF-Helveston-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helveston 1990</LINK>), 'early' to describe surgery before the age of two, and 'late' to describe surgery after the age of two.</P>
<P>The main form of non-surgical management in IE is botulinum toxin. This drug comes from a bacterium called <I>Clostridium botulinum</I>, which produces toxins that can be used to block muscle contractions. The type of toxin most commonly used for injection into muscles is botulinum toxin A (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1980</LINK>). The toxin is injected into the medial recti to temporarily paralyse the muscles and weaken their action, allowing the antagonist muscles (the lateral recti) to act unopposed. When the paralytic effect wears off after several months, the alignment may be improved.</P>
<P>Rationale for a systematic review</P>
<P>Although previous studies have compared treatment strategies, there are currently no clinical guidelines to determine the most effective treatment or age for treatment in IE. A systematic review was needed to assess the current evidence on these issues and will be useful to ophthalmologists, orthoptists and patients (or parents of).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective of this review was to examine the effectiveness and optimal timing of surgical and non-surgical treatment options for infantile esotropia in improving ocular alignment and achieving/allowing the development of binocular single vision.</P>

<I>Updated searches</I>
<BR/>The updated search of September 2006 identified 144 reports of studies. The hard copy of one citation was obtained (<LINK REF="STD-Simonsz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Simonsz 2005</LINK>) but was then excluded as it was not a randomised trial.</P>
<P>A further update search in September 2008 identified 134 reports of studies. The abstracts were checked but none of the references were relevant to the scope of the review.</P>
<P>Updated searches were run in April 2011. The electronic searches yielded a total of 240 titles and abstracts. After deduplication the Trials Search Co-ordinator scanned 171 records and discarded 133 records as they were not relevant to the scope of the review. We screened the title and abstracts of the remaining 38 reports. We obtained a hard copy of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Polling-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Polling 2009</LINK>) but this was excluded as it only had follow-up data for three months postoperatively and studies require a minimum of six months follow-up data to be eligible for inclusion in this review.</P>
<P>Updated searches run in June 2013 identified 172 references. The Trials Search Co-ordinator removed 27 duplicates, scanned 145 references and removed 117 records which were not relevant to the scope of the review. We screened the remaining 28 references but did not find any trials that met the inclusion criteria for the review.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-07-17 13:55:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sue Elliott">
<P>There is a large body of literature on the subject of infantile esotropia (IE), which, until recently, mainly consisted of retrospective studies, cohort studies or case series. Over recent years, more prospective studies are starting to be conducted and the results published, however, there is still a lack of randomised trials and hence it still remains difficult to resolve some of the controversies highlighted regarding management of IE. A brief summary of findings from a selection of the current literature on each of the outcome measures is given below:</P>
<P>Surgical interventions</P>
<P>Most authors agree that some form of surgical intervention is necessary to treat IE. Authors have found that a constant esotropia of &gt; 40^ in patients aged two to four months did not spontaneously resolve (<LINK REF="STD-Birch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Birch 1998</LINK>) or had a low likelihood of doing so (<LINK REF="REF-PEDIG-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">PEDIG 2002</LINK>). In 1976, Arnoult et al., looked retrospectively at two groups of patients; group 1 had all undergone bimedial recessions, group 2 unilateral surgery (resection of the lateral rectus and recession of the medial rectus) (<LINK REF="STD-Arnoult-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Arnoult 1976</LINK>). The average angle of each group postoperatively was found to be the same, however, no statistical analysis was documented.</P>
<P>More recently <LINK REF="STD-Polling-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Polling 2009</LINK>, conducted a randomised trial comparing bilateral recessions to unilateral surgery for IE. Whilst the results are not suitable for inclusion for analysis in this review, the authors concluded that there no statistically significant difference between the two interventions.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Forrest-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forrest 2003</LINK>, published the long term outcomes of 49 patients who underwent three muscle surgery for IE and concluded from this case series, that graded, three horizontal muscle surgery has a high success rate in attaining good ocular alignment'</P>
<P>A randomised comparison of graded versus standard bimedial recessions (<LINK REF="STD-Kushner-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Kushner 1984</LINK>), concluded that standard 10.5 mm bimedial recessions achieved a better final ocular alignment. A randomised trial of severing the check ligaments and intermuscular membranes on the medial recti during surgery found no significant difference between the two groups (<LINK REF="REF-Friendly-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friendly 1993</LINK>). Whilst bimedial rectus recessions tends to be the current method of choice, there are currently no randomised trials on different surgical approaches for IE, although many authors have stated their varying preferences.</P>
<P>Non-surgical interventions</P>
<P>Whilst surgical intervention for IE still seems to be the initial method of choice for the majority, a non-surgical intervention, (botulinum toxin) to alter ocular muscle alignment was first reported in <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1980</LINK>. After this, <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1990</LINK>, reported the results of botulinum toxin (BT) on a group of IE patients. The study found that 65% of this group achieved alignment to within 10^ of orthotropia, with just over two years follow up with no adverse effects (there was no mention of binocular state). This was in contrast to Biglan's publication a year earlier, which concluded that BT was not as successful as surgery for the treatment of IE (<LINK REF="REF-Biglan-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biglan 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Following this, <LINK REF="STD-Ing-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ing 1992</LINK> looked at a group of 49 patients, three years after alignment with botulinum to try and determine the effectiveness of BT in achieving binocularity. He found positive binocularity (sensory and motor fusion) in approximately half of this group. He then compared his results to another group of patients with IE aligned by surgery and concluded that botulinum was less effective than surgery in establishing binocularity (P &lt; 0.005).<BR/>
<LINK REF="REF-McNeer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeer 1994</LINK> published results of 57 IE patients, all of whom received bimedial medial rectus botulinum injections. The authors concluded that, for the purpose of improving ocular alignment, BT was an effective therapy, reducing the angle of the squint, both in patients under the age of 12 months and in those under the age of 24 months. The follow-up period was a minimum of 12 months.</P>
<P>In 2010, a single-centre, prospective, non-randomised study (<LINK REF="REF-de-Alba-Campomanes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Alba Campomanes 2010</LINK>) concluded that surgery was more successful than BT in the treatment of large angle IE, however in smaller angle squints (&lt; 30^ to 35^) it was found to be comparable to surgery. <LINK REF="REF-Gursoy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gursoy 2012</LINK> found that there was no difference in binocular alignment with BT versus surgery and proposed that BT may be considered a primary treatment for IE.</P>
<P>Botulinum toxin has also been used in addition to surgery i.e. to augment surgery (bimedial recessions) for large angle IE. <LINK REF="REF-Lueder-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lueder 2008</LINK> suggests that augmentation with BT may be more effective than bimedial recessions alone, especially in large angle squints (<LINK REF="REF-Lueder-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lueder 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The role of botulinum toxin prior to surgery was looked at retrospectively (<LINK REF="REF-Ruiz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruiz 2004</LINK>). It was found to be effective in reducing the amount of further horizontal surgery needed however, the authors found that in children under 18 months, injection of five units of botulinum induced unbalanced DVD.</P>
<P>Botulinum toxin has been shown by randomised trial to be a good alternative to surgery for re-treatment of IE, being equally successful as surgery in achieving binocularity (sensory and motor fusion - not stereopsis), if carried out within six months of surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Tejedor-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tejedor 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Age at intervention</P>
<P>The advantages and disadvantages of surgical intervention at an 'early' (&lt; two years of age) or 'late' (&gt; two years of age) stage have been debated in the literature. Some of these are highlighted below:</P>
<P>
<I>Early surgery</I>
<BR/>Advantages: Better potential for binocularity, reduced muscle contraction.</P>
<P>Disadvantages: May increase the risk of amblyopia, difficulty in obtaining reliable and accurate measurements.</P>
<P>
<I>Late surgery</I>
<BR/>Advantages: Amblyopia management easier, more reliable measurements.</P>
<P>Disadvantages: Reduced potential for binocularity, muscle contracture can lead to mechanical component to squint.</P>
<P>Prospective cohort studies have found that surgical alignment is associated with better stereopsis (which is considered the 'gold' standard in binocularity) in patients who received treatment within the first 24 months of life (early) (<LINK REF="STD-Birch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Birch 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Birch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Birch 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1994</LINK> proposed even earlier surgery, between the age of 2.5 and three months, resulting in good binocularity, which is in agreement with Helveston's proposal of 'ultra early surgery' between four and six months.<BR/>In view of these reports of improved binocularity with surgery at less than six months of age, <LINK REF="REF-Ing-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ing 1995</LINK> performed a multi-centre study of the results of IE patients operated on at age six months or earlier. He included 16 patients with IE that had been surgically aligned at an average age of 4.2 months, all with a minimum of four years follow up. He concluded that surgery at less than six months of age did not lead to a better quality of binocularity than in those patients aligned at age six months. Interestingly, he concluded that binocularity remains an elusive target and a rare outcome of treatment for IE.</P>
<P>The early versus late strabismus surgery study (ELISS) (<LINK REF="STD-Simonsz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Simonsz 2005</LINK>) was a large multi-centre, non-randomised trial, which involved 58 clinics, who recruited 231 children with IE in the "early" surgery group (six to 24 months) and 301 in the "late" group (32 to 60 months). This study found that children operated on early had better "gross" stereopsis at age six compared to the late group. This group had been operated on more frequently however and there was no significant difference in the angle of the strabismus between the two groups. In 2010, the ELISS study (<LINK REF="REF-Simonsz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simonsz 2010</LINK>) published further results, concluding that the benefit of early surgery for gross binocular vision, is balanced by a higher re-operation rate and an occasional child being operated on that would have had a spontaneous decrease without surgery. <LINK REF="REF-Birch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birch 2006</LINK> looked at the long-term motor and sensory outcomes of children operated on by the age of six months and concluded that early surgery was associated with a higher prevalence of fusion and stereopsis than surgery after this age. However <LINK REF="STD-Polling-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Polling 2009</LINK> included children who had late surgery (aged three to eight years) and concluded that 38.4% of these had some degree of gross binocular vision postoperatively.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Gerth-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerth 2008</LINK> looked at the effects that the timing on surgery for IE has on cortical visual motion processing (by measuring visually evoked potentials) and concluded that early surgery (which is defined by the authors as at or before 11 months of age) promotes the development of cortical visual motion processing compared to surgery after this age.</P>
<P>Studies have also looked at the effect of surgery on neuromotor development not just on vision. Both <LINK REF="REF-Drover-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drover 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Caputo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caputo 2007</LINK> have conducted studies that look at the influence of congenital squints and surgery on such development. Both studies concluded that squint surgery is beneficial to motor function and development. This is an area for further research.</P>
<P>The above highlights that the current literature in the area of timing of intervention is still conflicting.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-07-12 09:45:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sue Elliott">
<P>As there are no randomised trials that we can include in this review at present, it has not been possible to resolve the controversies regarding type of surgery, non-surgical options and age of intervention in patients with infantile esotropia (IE). The available literature now contradicts previous suggestions that bimedial recessions is the surgical method of choice.There seems to be general agreement that any intervention should be earlier rather than later however gross binocular vision still seems possible in those receiving late intervention.</P>
<P>Studies of non-surgical interventions continue to be undertaken and published, mainly on the use of botulinum toxin. However, the current use of botulinum as a primary intervention for IE remains limited in comparison to surgical intervention, although McNeer and Tucker state in correspondence that BT is their primary treatment for IE (<LINK REF="REF-McNeer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeer 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The actual aims and outcomes of treatment are to improve ocular alignment and achieve some degree of binocularity. Most authors agree about the ocular alignment and aim for alignment within 10^ of orthotropia. However, claims of positive demonstrable binocularity after intervention vary widely. This is most likely due to the methods used to assess/confirm the presence of binocularity and the fact that claims/definition of positive stereopsis and of binocular vision can vary. The ELISS study used the term "gross" stereopsis/binocularity - very few patients in either arms of this trial actually achieved better than this level i.e. good quality binocularity. Polling's study defined positive binocularity by the presence of a bagolini cross i.e. the lowest grade of binocular vision possible. Recent multi-centre trial results still leave many questions regarding interventions for IE answered.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-07-04 13:00:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>There is clearly a need for good quality trials to be conducted in various areas of IE, in order to improve the evidence base for the management of this condition. The trials need to be carefully planned, using standardised outcomes - an agreement is needed as to what constitutes 'positive binocularity' and what is considered a 'success' in terms of surgical alignment. Ideally quality of life measures would be incorporated into these trials.</P>
