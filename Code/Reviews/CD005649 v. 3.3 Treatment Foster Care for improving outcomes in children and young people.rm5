<P>Treatment foster care (TFC) is a foster family-based intervention that aims to provide young people (and, where appropriate, their families) with an individually tailored programme designed to help bring about positive changes in their lives. TFC was designed to help children whose difficulties or circumstances place them at risk of multiple placements and/or more restrictive placements such as hospital or secure residential or youth justice settings. This review set out to assess the impact of Treatment Foster Care on a range of outcomes for children and young people in such circumstances, including psychosocial and behavioural outcomes, delinquency, placement stability, and discharge status. Five studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. All were conducted in the USA. Four focussed on young delinquents or children with a range of behaviour problems. The fifth examined the effectiveness of TFC for young people in a state mental hospital. Findings indicate that TFC care may be a useful intervention to help place these usually hard to place children and young people in family settings. Results indicate some clinically meaningful decreases in: antisocial behaviour, the number of days children and young people running away from placement; the number of criminal referrals and the time spent in locked settings. There is some evidence that young people in Treatment Foster Care spent more time in treatment over the long-term and more time at home. Examination of educational and employment outcomes showed improvements in school attendance, homework completion and finding work.</P>
<P>However, the generalisability of findings is limited. The total number of included studies was small and the profile of participants quite mixed. The evidence may be subject to bias given the involvement of programme developers in the research teams responsible for all included studies. On the basis of this review, nothing can be said about the costs and benefits of what is a relatively costly service. Furthermore, it is not possible to make statements about TFC effectiveness vis-a-vis other composite interventions.</P>
<P>Future research should seek to test the generalisability of findings from these studies by replicating the studies using independent research teams. Studies need to be conducted in different locations, with different groups of young people, of different ages and more diverse ethnicity, and with a range of clearly specified problem profiles (e.g. psychological disorders; delinquency), and with follow-up periods longer than two years.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Treatment foster care (TFC) is a foster family-based intervention that aims to provide young people (and, where appropriate, their families) with a tailored programme designed to effect positive changes in their lives. TFC was designed specifically to cater for the needs of children whose difficulties or circumstances place them at risk of multiple placements and/or more restrictive placements such as hospital or secure residential or youth justice settings. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the impact of TFC on psychosocial and behavioural outcomes, delinquency, placement stability, and discharge status for children and adolescents who require out-of-home placement. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) 2006 (Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2007), CINAHL (1982 to December 2006), PsycINFO (1872 to January 2007), ASSIA (1987 to January 2007), LILACS (1982 to January 2007), ERIC (1966 to January 2007), Sociological Abstracts (1963 to January 2007), and the National Research Register 2006 (Issue 4). </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Included studies were randomised controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of TFC with children and young people up to the age of 18 who, for reasons of severe medical, social, psychological and behavioural problems, were placed in out of home care in restrictive settings (e.g. secure residential care, psychiatric hospital) or at risk of placement in such settings.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Titles and abstracts identified in the search were independently assessed for eligibility by the two authors (GM and WT) who also extracted and entered into REVMAN. Date were synthesised on the few occasions where this was possible. Results are presented in tabular, graphical (forest plots) and textual form.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Five studies including 390 participants were included in this review. Data suggest that treatment foster care may be a useful intervention for children and young people with complex emotional, psychological and behavioural need, who are at risk of placements in non-family settings that restrict their liberty and opportunities for social inclusion.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Although the inclusion criteria for this systematic review set a study design threshold higher than that of previous reviews, the results mirror those of earlier reviews but also highlights the tendency of the perceived effectiveness of popular interventions to outstrip their evidence base. Whilst the results of individual studies generally indicate that TFC is a promising intervention for children and youth experiencing mental health problems, behavioural problems or problems of delinquency, the evidence base is less robust than that usually reported.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<P>Treatment foster care (TFC) is a foster family-based intervention that aims to provide young people (and, where appropriate, their biological or adoptive families) with an individually tailored programme designed to help bring about positive changes in their lives (<LINK REF="REF-Bereika-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bereika 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clark-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1993</LINK>). Because it is individually tailored programme, TFC is sufficiently flexible to accommodate different client populations with a wide range of clinical problems and shifting community needs (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1993</LINK>). TFC was designed specifically to cater for the needs of children whose difficulties or circumstances place them at risk of multiple placements and/or more restrictive placements such as hospital or secure residential or youth justice settings (<LINK REF="REF-Webb-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webb 1988</LINK>). These groups include children who have experienced trauma, neglect or abandonment; children and adolescents with mental health problems, children with problems of antisocial behaviour and offending, and children with serious medical conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foster-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 1982</LINK>). Multiple placements deprive children of the opportunities to establish strong attachments with carers, to establish and maintain friendship networks and to realise their potential in education. The long-term adverse consequences for children are formidable. Mainstream foster care or residential care placements do not typically provide interventions designed specifically to address the complex emotional, psychological and behavioural needs of young people placed; nor do they provide carers with the skills and support services needed to implement them. Externally, the paucity of professional services available to children, compounded by long waiting lists and the serendipitous nature of services that are available, often mean that effective help is not there when it is needed. This is the vacuum which treatment foster care seeks to fill.</P>
<P>'Treatment Foster Care' is not the only term used to describe placements with carers that are specifically designed and delivered to provide tailored support to young people, their carers and, where appropriate, their families. 'Specialised foster care' was a term used early on to describe what later became called treatment foster care (<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1990a</LINK>). Other terms include 'wraparound' foster care (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1998</LINK>) and multidimensional treatment foster care (MTFC) (<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 2007a</LINK>). Some reviewers define the term even more widely, to include supportive arrangements such as Foster Extended Family (<LINK REF="REF-Barsh-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barsh 1983</LINK>, see <LINK REF="REF-Clark-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1993</LINK> for a review). Others attempt to distinguish categories such as specialised foster care and treatment foster care (see <LINK REF="REF-Reddy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reddy 1997</LINK>). The definition of treatment foster care used in this systematic review draws on the nine 'basic ingredients' identified by Snodgrass as characterising treatment foster care programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Snodgrass-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snodgrass 1989</LINK>):</P>
<P>1. The stated goal or objective of the programme is to serve children and youths who would otherwise be in more restrictive nonfamily settings (usually institutions), or at risk of admission to those settings. In this respect we interpret children with serious emotional or behavioral problems as at risk of multiple placements and therefore, ultimately, at risk of finding themselves in ever more restrictive settings.<BR/>2. There is a clearly articulated philosophy with strong community links and individually designed treatment and education plans that include 'a stated, measurable goal, a written set of procedures for achieving the goal, and a process for regularly assessing the result (<LINK REF="REF-Snodgrass-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snodgrass 1989</LINK> p. 77)<BR/>3. Foster carers are selected and trained to provide therapeutic care to children and youths who have special needs that may result from emotional disturbance, developmental disabilities, behavioural difficulties, or special medical needs.<BR/>4. Care is provided within a family setting, in a home owned or under the control of the foster carers who are responsible for the implementation of the young person's treatment plan<BR/>5. The number of children placed in the home is limited to no more than two.<BR/>6. Foster carers receive support, consultation, and supervision from professionals who carry a small caseload with crisis intervention services available around the clock.<BR/>7. Foster carers are regarded as professional members of the service and treated as such.<BR/>8. Foster carers receive payments above those provided for regular foster care and may also receive a special stipend based on each child's treatment needs.<BR/>9. The programme is administered by specialist agencies or, if part of a host agency, by a unit specifically identified as a treatment foster care programme, even if using a different name.</P>
<P>
<B>Early findings</B>
<BR/>Results from initial programme evaluations and experimental studies of treatment foster care programmes in Canada, United Kingdom and the United Sates suggest that:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>TFC programmes can serve as alternatives to residential treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Almeida-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almeida 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Colton-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colton 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hazel-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazel 1981</LINK>), to correctional institutions (<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1990b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1990b</LINK>), and to psychiatric hospitalisation (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1991</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Children and adolescents served in TFC experience positive in-programme changes in self-esteem, sense of identity, and personal growth (<LINK REF="REF-Bogart-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bogart 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clark-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Colton-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colton 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Colton-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hazel-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazel 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fanshel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanshel 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Larson-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larson 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rubenstein-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Rubenstein 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yelloly-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yelloly 1979</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Most TFC placements were completed as outlined in the child's or adolescent's case plan (<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fanshel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanshel 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fenyo-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenyo 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hazel-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazel 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hazel-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazel 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yelloly-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yelloly 1979</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Compared to youth discharged from institutional care, those discharged from TFC are more likely to go to less restrictive settings and are less likely to be institutionalised subsequently (<LINK REF="REF-Almeida-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almeida 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Colton-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fanshel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanshel 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Larson-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larson 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stroul-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stroul 1989</LINK>), though some of these findings might be attributable to selection bias.</LI>
<LI>Finally, TFC programmes appear to be less costly than the institutional and group-home alternatives to which they were compared (<LINK REF="REF-Almeida-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almeida 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rubenstein-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Rubenstein 1978</LINK>).</LI>

<P>
<BR/>These papers have been included in one or more of three literature reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Galaway-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galaway 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hudson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hudson 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Meadowcroft-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meadowcroft 1994</LINK>). Although tentatively supportive of TFC, these reviews are limited in two respects. First of all, all reviewers use different, and generally very broad definitions of treatment foster care. Secondly, the methodological rigour of included studies varies. Only two involved random assignment (<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1991</LINK>) and four involved no control or comparison group (<LINK REF="STD-Larson-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hazel-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazel 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fanshel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanshel 1989</LINK>). Studies with control groups compared TFC with other treatment settings, including regular foster care (<LINK REF="REF-Bogart-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bogart 1988</LINK>), treatment in the community (<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1990a</LINK>), residential children's homes (<LINK REF="REF-Colton-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colton 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Colton-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colton 1990</LINK>), and other residential treatment centres (<LINK REF="STD-Rubenstein-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Rubenstein 1978</LINK>). One study comprised an 'experimental, retrospective longitudinal design' (<LINK REF="REF-Fanshel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanshel 1989</LINK>), six studies involved a post-test measure only (<LINK REF="REF-Almeida-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Almeida 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hazel-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazel 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yelloly-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yelloly 1979</LINK>) and seven were described as quasi-experimental with repeated measures (<LINK REF="REF-Bogart-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bogart 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larson-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Larson 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Colton-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colton 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomlison-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomlison 1992</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Meadowcroft-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meadowcroft 1994</LINK> concluded that 'the positive results demonstrated for the few treatment foster care programs that have been studied cannot be extended to all programmes. Treatment foster care programs in general vary greatly regarding children served; treatment parent selection, training, and supervision; staff expertise; involvement of children's families; and frequency and types of interventions used to help children adjust. Nor it is clear what aspects of these successful treatment foster care programs contribute to the positive results. The research to date has not isolated the critical components of successful treatment foster care programs' (p. 575).</P>
<P>In a meta-analytic research synthesis of 40 outcome studies conducted between 1974 and 1996, Reddy and Pfeiffer (<LINK REF="REF-Reddy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reddy 1997</LINK>) reported overall positive social-psychological changes in children and adolescents placed in TFC. The largest effects were in the domains of children's social skills and placement permanency with medium effects observed in behaviour problem reduction, level of restrictiveness at post-discharge, and psychological adjustment. The researchers caution against drawing definitive conclusions about the overall effectiveness of TFC due to the limited number of rigorous outcome studies and the pooling of data relating to children of different age groups and clinical populations, and different lengths of follow-up periods.</P>
<P>In a review of five studies specifically designed to assess the impact of TFC on violence prevention, Hahn and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 2004</LINK>) concluded there was i) insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of TFC programmes in which clusters of foster-parent families cooperated in the care of children aged 5-13 with severe emotional disturbance, but that ii) data from three studies in which programme personnel 'collaborated closely and daily with foster families caring for adolescents (aged 12-18 year) with a history of chronic delinquency' suggested that this form of TFC might be effective.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-04-23 11:37:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Julie G Millener">
<P>Treatment foster care is designed to address those aspects of foster care that research suggests can impede placement stability or reunification. This includes tackling the issues that bring children and young people into foster care or other, more restricted settings. Thus, treatment foster care seeks to i) provide foster carers with the skills they need to manage challenging behaviour, whether that is conduct disorder, delinquency, or emotional and psychological disorders; complex medical conditions, and the range of challenges that are associated with caring for children who may have suffered maltreatment. As well as specialist training, foster carers are typically offered routine and accessible support from staff with expertise in managing the situations they are dealing with. This combination of training and support are thought to make manageable an otherwise very demanding job that - in other contexts - do not usually fall to one or two carers. In addition, direct work with the children and young people is undertaken or available, including immediate access to child and adolescent mental health services. Finally, where relevant, steps are taken to minimise the influence of peers and maximise that of the foster carers e.g. with delinquent youth. Treatment foster care draws on the longitudinal studies on family interaction conducted by researchers at the Oregon Social Learning Center which informs a number of the key strategies designed to reduce disruptive and antisocial behaviour (see <LINK REF="REF-Patterson-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patterson 1982</LINK>). There is evidence from analyses of data by <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK> that the following variables play an important part in mediating the effects of TFC on delinquency: the management of young people by foster carers, who provide consistent and predictable forms of discipline, close supervision; and by the separation of the young person from his/her delinquent peers. In <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK> this was thought to account for some 32% of the programme's effect on reducing violence.<BR/>

<P>As per the protocol, a range of outcome measures were identified and analysed where appropriate. These included:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">A. Looked-after child outcomes: </HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Behavioural outcomes, covering: i. behavioural problems within the treatment foster home using measures of externalising behaviour, including carers' report (i.e., physical and verbal aggression, self-harming, rule-breaking behaviour, defiance, truancy); ii. anti-social behaviour as measured by rates of delinquency, rates of arrest, rates of conviction, and rates of incarceration, iii. drug and substance abuse (based on self reports and biological measures); iv. prescribed medication for behavioural symptom reduction/management (as indicated by agency records and carers reports);</LI>
<LI>Psychological functioning, including: i psychiatric diagnosis and symptoms) as measured by (preferably) standardised scales (e.g., Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL] <LINK REF="REF-Achenbach-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achenbach 1983</LINK>) and reports provided by therapeutic foster carers and other mental health professionals; ii. confidence, resilience and adaptability, as measured by self-reports and/or agency assessments) and/or standardised scales (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1965</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>Educational outcomes (i.e. level of school attendance and educational achievement) as indicated by grades obtained and teacher reports; where data will be available (and applicable to the population examined) training and employment outcomes (as indicated, for example, by employers' reports and agency records) will be considered alongside educational outcomes;</LI>
<LI>Interpersonal functioning, including: i.<B> </B>community participation and involvement as measured, for example, by foster carer reports on extent of community services and resources accessed, and ii.<B> </B>peer relationships as indicated by either self-reports and/or treatment foster carers and/or teacher reports;</LI>
<LI>Mental health status, including: i. measures of well-being and self-esteem; ii. psychiatric status (e.g. DSM IV diagnosis), or iii. prescription and adherence to antipsychotic meditation;</LI>
<LI>Physical health status.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>Note</B>: Interpreting the use of medication, particularly in the field of mental ill health, is complex. First, where associated with maintenance or improvement of health then starting or maintaining a pharmacotherapeutic regimen could be a good outcome (e.g. in cases with schizophrenia). In some cases, however, medication might mean that participants are not receiving the psychological therapy that would be more beneficia/have less harmful side effects. Secondly, TFC foster carers may be more likely to advocate for psychiatric assessment and treatment, on the basis of children's needs, or because it is seen as an answer to difficult child management problems. Finally, it could be indicative of harm if the need for medication precipitates stress and associated mental health problems. Given the challenges of disinterring these processes we have said we will report these outcomes in the review and only synthesise and/or interpret them if the meaning of the data are unambiguous i.e. clearly beneficial, clearly indicative of appropriate advocacy, clearly an unintended harm. No relevant data were reported in the included studies in this review.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-04-23 11:42:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Julie G Millener">
<P>To assess concealment of allocation to intervention groups, the authors independently assigned each selected study to the following categories described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>):</P>
<P>(A) indicates adequate concealment of the allocation (for example, by telephone randomisation, or use of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes);<BR/>(B) indicates uncertainty about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (for example, where the method of concealment is not known);<BR/>(C) indicates that the allocation was definitely not adequately concealed (for example, open random number lists or quasi-randomisation such as alternate days, odd/even date of birth, or hospital number).</P>
<P>The following items were also assessed as potential sources of bias: blinding of outcome assessors (where relevant); extent of drop-out or attrition. We also identified those studies that used Intention to Treat analysis.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-04-23 11:43:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Julie G Millener">
<P>
<B>Binary data</B>. Of the studies included in this review, only <LINK REF="REF-Clark-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1998</LINK> provided binary data but it was not suitable for meta-analysis (see below for reporting of odds ratios in the published paper). Should binary data be reported in studies identified in future updates of this review, these will be analysed as described in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, 'Additional methods for future updates.'</P>
<P>
<B>Continuous data. </B>Continuous data were analysed where (i) means and standard deviations were available or calculable and ii) there was no clear evidence of skew in the distribution (mean less than 1 standard deviation from an upper or lower bound). Where means or standard deviations were not given directly effect sizes were calculated using test statistics wherever possible. Where scales were measuring the same clinical outcomes in different ways, mean differences were standardised in order to combine results across scales (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where an outcome was assessed using a measure with sub-scales it was our intention to use the total score where appropriate, providing the full scale addressed the outcome of interest. Otherwise we would used the most relevant subscore. In this present version of the review this issue did not arise in relation to the rare occasions when it was possible to combine the results of studies. In the reporting of results from individual studies we have used the sub-scales of the CBCL where reported, alongside the total score for this measure when used.</P>
<P>
<B>Multiple measures </B>
<BR/>When a study (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK> ) used multiple measures of the same outcome, we reported all measures.

<P>All included studies were randomised controlled trials. <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1992</LINK> randomised foster carers rather than children, but the children for whom data are reported were those living with the foster carer at the time of randomisation. All other studies randomised individual children. <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1994</LINK> randomised more participants to the control group in order to compensate for an anticipated higher rate of attrition amongst the control group, for example from extended runaways and voluntary dropouts. All but one study allocated participants to one of two groups, the experimental (TFC) arm and a control group that was usual foster care practice. One study allocated participants to one of three groups, two of which were experimental and comprised i) an augmented monthly allowance, and ii) an augmented monthly allowance plus training and support (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1992</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Three studies focused on children and young people with emotional and behavioural problems (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1994</LINK>). Of these, one study focused on children &amp; youths aged 9-18 who were in psychiatric hospital with severe emotional disorders who required out-of-home placements (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1991</LINK>). The other two were focused on children who were in out-of-home placement for reasons of abuse or neglect, and who either had emotional or behavioural problems or were deemed at risk of developing these. The remaining studies focused on delinquent children, one on boys aged 12-17 with histories of chronic delinquency (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK>) and the other on chronically delinquent girls aged 13-17 (<LINK REF="STD-Leve-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leve 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study provided no information on the ethnicity of child participants (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1991</LINK>). In the remaining studies the vast majority of participants were Caucasian, with percentages ranging from 62% in <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1994</LINK> and 74% in <LINK REF="STD-Leve-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leve 2005</LINK> to 85% and 86% in <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1992</LINK> respectively. See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for a profile of the ethnicity of participants in each study, where given.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Three studies reported a multi-dimensional intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leve-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leve 2005</LINK>). In each case the TFC intervention included i) pre-service training of specially selected foster carers; ii) the implementation of a behaviour management programme for the child in both the home and the community; iii) an individualised treatment plan for the children and young people; iv) supervision and support of foster carers via daily telephone calls and weekly groups, and v) services were coordinated by case managers were on call 24 hours per day, seven days per week and available to biological parents as well as foster carers, where appropriate.</P>
<P>Of these three studies, two dealt with delinquents (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leve-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leve 2005</LINK>). In these studies, the basic framework outlined above was further developed to include: vi) additional meetings with foster carers as and young people to deal with routine problems of difficulties in implementing the programme; vii) weekly family therapy for the biological family or other aftercare resource, focussed on parent management training, including an emphasis on supervision, encouragement, discipline and problem solving; ; viii) enrollment of young people in schools underpinned by carefully planned and implemented behaviour management arrangements with backup from the programme; ix) weekly individual therapy with young people which focused on skills building in problem-solving, social perspective taking and nonaggressive methods of self-expression; x) psychiatric consultation, evaluation and medication as needed; xi) close supervision of the young peoples whereabouts and activities; xii) prohibition of contact with peers with known histories of delinquency and other peer associations closely monitored; xiii) individually tailored consequences of rule infringements that were consistently delivered. Young people were encouraged to accept consequences and start 'each day with a clean slate'; xiv) all parole violations were reported and xv) where the plan was to return the child home, frequent visits were arranged beginning with one to two hours and increasing to overnight stays as the young people progressed through the programme. In the study with delinquent girls (<LINK REF="STD-Leve-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leve 2005</LINK>) the investigators describe the intervention as incorporating 'gender specific processes' with foster carers providing additional reinforcement and response cost for girls' avoidance of / commitment of social-relational aggression. Girls were taught skills to avoid this particular form of aggression.</P>
<P>interventions in the remaining two studies were less intensive in nature, with fewer components and focused on abused/neglected children and youth. <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1992</LINK> provided foster carers with weekly support via a two-hour meeting with other foster carers, led by a facilitator who had been a foster carer and who was trained in child behaviour management methods and group process. Foster carers were also telephoned three times a week by the group leader to review their report of the child's progress and recent problems, and to offer suggestions and support. <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1994</LINK> provided an interventions called the Fostering Individualised Assistance Programme (FIAP) in which standard fostering services were enhanced by i) a strengths-based approach to assessment covering 10 life domains; (ii) life domain planning designed to address the priority needs of children and the family; iii) clinical case management through which Family Specialists provided intensive, individualised services and support in the context of the child's home and community settings, to the extent possible and; iv) follow-up services designed to secure the maintenance of change and further progress.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">1. Child Behaviour</HEADING>
<P>Three measures of child behaviour were used in the included studies.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1991</LINK> the <B>Parent Daily Report Checklist (PDR) </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 1987</LINK>) was used to measure the occurrence of problem symptoms during the prior 24-hour period. It was administered by phone on 10 separate days to ward staff (at baseline) and then to foster parents, ward staff, or other primary caretaker 3 and 7 months later. In <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1992</LINK> it was used to assess the extent of problem behaviours within the foster home on five consecutive weekdays at baseline and again 3 months later to determine any changes over time in the foster parents' reports of child problems. <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK> used a modified version of the PDR to collect information on foster care supervision and young people's association with deviant peers.</P>
<P>The <B>Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) </B>and the <B>Youth Self Report (YSR) </B>are measures for describing the behaviour of children from the perspective of caregivers and youth respectively <LINK REF="REF-Achenbach-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achenbach 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Achenbach-1991b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achenbach 1991b</LINK>). The instruments provide a total problem score, eight narrow-band factors (i.e., withdrawn, somatic complaints, anxious/depressed, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent behaviour, aggressive behaviour) and two-broad-band factors (i.e., internalising &amp; externalising). The internalising score is based on the narrow-band factors of withdrawn, somatic complaints, and anxious/depressed, and the externalising score is based on the narrow-band factors of delinquent and aggressive behaviours.

In <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK> participants were asked how many times they had engaged in any of the criminal behaviours during a specific time frame. The General Delinquency subscale was chosen as an additional measure of overall criminal activity and the other two (Index Offenses and Felony assaults) to measure the rates of more serious and person crimes.</P>

<P>The <B>Diagnostic Interview Scale for Children (DISC) </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1991</LINK>) is a structured interview that contains items reflecting the presence of current and past symptoms, emotions and behaviours that correspond to DSM III-R criteria. One section of the DISC is the conduct disorder interview protocol, which yields a conduct disorder diagnosis. The conduct disorder instrument was added to the interview protocol used by <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1994</LINK> for Waves 6, 7, and 8 of the study. The subscale scores from these waves were averaged to provide a single conduct disorder score for each young person.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1994</LINK> also calculated a <B>Total Delinquency score.</B> This composite score was derived from the dependent measures of the delinquency items on the CBCL and YSR, the conduct disorder score, and the official delinquency score. A total score was computed for each of the 131 participants. This score was calculated by converting each of the scale scores available for each particular individual into Z scores and averaging them to establish a total delinquency score.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Close calls</HEADING>
<P>This intervention has been developing over a number of years, during which time it has changed in title and potential content. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1992</LINK>) was described by the authors as a '"light" version of MTFC that could be used universally with all foster parents providing regular foster care' (Chamberlain, personal communication). The profile of children included in the study suggested they had histories of abuse and neglect and presented with a range of behavioural problems. The intervention was not described as treatment foster care and the study was primarily designed to examine the effects of the intervention on foster carer retention. However, given the profile of the children and the categorisation of the intervention by the authors we have included it. <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2005</LINK> was primarily concerned with developing an evidence base to address the merits of early intervention in the lives of pre-school foster children who, research indicates, are at increased risk of developmental delay. The intervention is described as 'oriented toward creating optimal environmental conditions to facilitate developmental progress' (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2005</LINK> p. 62). It also examines whether - as an early intervention - MTFC mitigated risks associated with placement history. The study uses permanent placements and placement failure as outcome measures in view of their likely impact on psychosocial outcomes. We were undecided as to whether to include this study. We decided against including it as the children did not directly meet the inclusion criterion of children placed in out of home care 'for reasons of severe medical, social, psychological and behavioural problems' or at risk of developing these problems. Rather, the authors describe their approach as addressing 'the challenges of foster preschoolers are viewed from the perspective of delayed maturation, rather than as strictly behavioral and emotional problems. Consequently, it is oriented toward creating optimal environmental conditions to facilitate developmental progress' (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 2005</LINK> page 63).</P>

<P>Many of the data on placement outcomes and, where relevant, offending, were gathered via agency records, although some were gathered through the programme staff. <LINK REF="STD-Leve-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leve 2005</LINK> states clearly that the staff members responsible for data collection and data entry were blind to participants' group assignment and were not involved in delivering the intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 2007a</LINK>, p. 188-189). In two studies the investigators report some limited blinding of outcome assessors to treatment condition as a reliability check: <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1991</LINK> report that an 'independent observer who was blind to group assignment and phase' independently rated videotapes of the social interaction tasks, and their score compared with that of the interviewer who administered the task.

In <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK> the investigators reported that 'In 10% of the cases, criminal referrals were recoded after having removed all identifying information', resulting in a 90% level of reliability, entry by entry (page 626).

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1991</LINK> used the Parent Daily Report Checklist (PDR) to measure the occurrence of problem symptoms during the prior 24-hour period. The measure was administered by phone on 10 separate days to ward staff (at baseline) and then to foster carers, ward staff, or other primary caretakers at 3 and 7 months later. Complete data were available for seven (out of ten) children in each group. Children for whom data were missing had either run away, the placement had no telephone, or residential staff were uncooperative. The study does not provide sufficient data to calculate an effect size. In the published paper the authors acknowledge the limited power of the statistical analysis based on the small amount of data available and suggest that the results are 'moderately encouraging.... (and that) they indicate that the behaviour of these institutionalised and very seriously disturbed youngsters was not perceived by the caregivers to deteriorate or to be unmanageable when they were moved into the less restrictive specialized foster care environments (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1991</LINK>, p. 273), although it should be noted that some of the reasons given for missing data (in particular, that children had run away) render the observed effects more difficult to interpret. The investigator communicated that no other data were now available (Chamberlain, personal communication).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1992</LINK> reports a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the change in frequency of problem behaviours from baseline to three-months PDR scores, indicating a 'significant' decrease in problem behaviours for the Enhanced Support and Training (ES &amp; T) condition relative to the other two conditions (Increased Payment Only [IPO] and Foster Care as Usual [FCU]). However, no details are provided in the paper, other than a graph, and the fact that the groups differed significantly at baseline raises questions about the validity of their result. The investigators took care to point out that whilst the foster carers in their sample did not appear to differ at baseline, the number of 'child problem behaviours' between groups differed considerably, with the children in the ES &amp; T group reported as exhibiting on average 7.5 problem behaviours per day as compared to 5.71 in the IPO group and 3.71 in the FCU group. The number of problems reported post-test the ES &amp; T group fell to 3.85 per day; and those in the IPO group dropped to 3.94; whilst the control group of FCU actually worsened (with an increase of problem behaviours to 4.56 per day). The investigators note that the 'norm' for non-referred children would be an average of 5 'daily problems' (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1994</LINK> used a repeated measures ANOVA to examine changes in emotional and behavioural adjustment over the course of the study, for those children for whom complete data were available i.e. interview data secured on each of eight 'waves' of data collection (YSR n= 43; CBCL n=41). Intervention group, age and gender acted as independent factors. Analyses of the scores on both measures revealed no within-subject effects for internalising or any internalising narrow-band factors for condition, condition by age, or condition by gender. Both groups showed some improvements over time, and there were several gender x time and age x time interactions. The absence of an interaction effect for condition (FIAP versus SP) suggests that group assignment had no significant effect on internalising factors.</P>
<P>Repeated measures analysis for YSR scores on Waves 1-8 revealed a condition by gender interaction for externalising (F(7, 245)=2.53, P&lt;.01, delinquency, F(7, 245)=2.90, P&lt;.001, and a marginal effect for aggression F(7,245)=1.84, P&lt;.08. The investigators report that Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) post hoc tests were performed to assess mean differences on YSR externalising and YSR delinquency scores for Waves 1 through 8 for FIAT (Treatment) versus SP (control) males and females, separately. On the externalising broad-band factor, a significant interaction showed that FIAP males had significantly lower scores than SP males during Waves 4, 7 and 8, and FIAP females had significantly higher scores compared to SP females during Waves 1, 2 and 3. On the delinquency narrow-band factor, the same significance pattern emerged across the waves. No other externalising effects over time with condition, condition by age, or condition by gender were found. There is no evidence of of significant long-term effects of the intervention. Similar analyses of data from the CBCL over time indicated only a condition by gender interaction effect for both externalising and delinquency. In both cases (internalising and externalising) the lack of condition x time interaction effects is problematic in this context as we can not assess the long-term effectiveness of the intervention.</P>

<P>Both <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Leve-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leve 2005</LINK> used the 21-item General Delinquency Subscale of the Elliot Self-Report of Delinquency Scale ( <LINK REF="REF-Elliot-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliot 1983</LINK>) to assess the effectiveness of MTFC in perceptions of engagement in activities or behaviours that could result in arrest 12 months post baseline. The two studies provided data from a total of 151 participants (76 treatment group and 75 Group Care group). The combined data suggest a small effect that might be clinically meaningful but is not statistically significant (SMD -0.20; 95% CI -0.95 to 0.56) and it is also possible that the 'real' effect could be null or even negative (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is evidence from their analyses of data from <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK> that the following variables play an important part in mediating the effects of TFC on delinquency: the management of young people by foster carers, who provide consistent and predictable forms of discipline, close supervision; and by the separation of the young person from his/her delinquent peers. In <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK> this was thought to account for some 32% of the programme's effect on reducing violence.</P>

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Leve-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leve 2005</LINK>) considered 'school attendance' as an educational engagement outcome.

Caregiver-girl correlations were .12 at baseline and .74 at 12 months postbaseline. The results suggested a clinically meaningful effect of moderate size on levels of school attendance for MTFC girls (SMD 0.54; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.99). <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1994</LINK> reported that no statistically significant differences were found for i) the number of days children were absent; ii) days suspended; iii) days since dropping out, or iv) rates of school-to-school movements.</P>

<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1992</LINK> study, 12 out of the 72 participating foster families discontinued providing care. The dropout rates for the three groups were 9.6% for the ES &amp; T, 14.3% for the IPO, and 25.9% for the control group. The authors note that even the control group had a substantially lower dropout rate than foster families across the state dropout rate (i.e. 40% in Oregon, USA). Data relating to the stability of the child in foster care indicated that out of the 72 study children 18 were returned home during the study (the reasons for the move were improvements in the family of origin's situation rather than factors associated with the child's adjustment in care). Analyses of the data pertaining to the number of successful days in care were concentrated on the remaining 54 children who were classified as either successful (remained in the foster home) or unsuccessful (ran away, were moved to another home, or were placed in residential care). Examining the number of successful days in care for children in each of the three study groups, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that children in the ES&amp; T group had significantly more successful days in care than children in the other two conditions (F = 3.45, P &lt; 0.04 - degrees of freedom not reported in the published paper). Caution must be applied to this finding due to the baseline differences in the three groups described above.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1994</LINK> examined the differences in the number of children in permanent placements in the experimental group (FIAP) and controls (SP). At entry to the study, all children were in regular foster care or emergency shelter care. At follow up the data suggested that a child in the experimental group was twice as likely to be in with parents, relatives, adoptive homes or independent living) as a child in the control group, OR=2.00, p&lt;.05. This difference wasn't found to be statistically significant for the younger subset but attributable to the greater success of FIAP in achieving permanence for older children, OR=4.5, p&lt;.05.</P>
<P>The triallists went on to examine changes in the proportion of time spent in permanency placements over the study period. The post-period was divided into seven equal 6-months intervals, yielding eight 'waves' in all. The percentage of time spent in permanency in each post period was analysed using a repeated measures ANOVA, the results of which suggest an effect related to age. For the 'Younger subset' (ages 7-11.5 years, n=64) there were no significant main effects or interactions for the younger children except for time alone, F(6, 57)=8.98, p&lt;.001, suggesting that younger participants spent significantly more time in permanency, irrespective of group assignment. Analyses of permanency in the 'Older subset' (ages 11.5-16 years, n=67) suggested a similar effect for time, F(6,60)=5.54, p&lt;.001 and also a statistically significant effect for condition F(1,65)=4.04, p&lt;.05 and for condition by time F(6,390)=5.49, p&lt;.001. On the assumption that the two groups were equal, and based on the main effect for condition data, we computed an effect size and confidence intervals (<LINK REF="REF-Kelley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelley 2006</LINK>). Results suggest a moderate, statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect (SMD 0.49; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.97) favouring the FIAP (treatment) group. The triallists point to an increasing difference in the average amount of time spent in permanency, favouring FIAP children, with differences becoming more marked from the third time period onwards. There were no other significant results relating to rates of placement change in the <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1994</LINK> study.</P>

In order to assess the feasibility of caring for chronic juvenile offenders in the community <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK> used individual records maintained by the GC (Group Care) and MTFC (Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care) programmes to calculate the number of days each month that youngsters were 'on the run'. At one year the mean number of days on the run was 18.17 for MTFC children and 35.82 for GC children, a result that approached statistical significance in the reduction of 'days on the run' favouring MTFC children (SMD -0.38; 95% CI -0.83 to 0.06). At two years the mean number of days again favoured the MTFC group, whose mean number of days on the run was 30 compared with 63 for GC children. This results represents a statistically significant decrease in the numbers of days on the run for children in the MFTC groups (SMD -0.52; 95% CI -1.01 to -0.02).

<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1994</LINK> reported a statistically significant difference between young people in the TFC group and those in the control.

<P>The five studies included in this review originate, without exception, from the United States of America. Four of them were conducted in Oregon. Almost all the participants in all studies were white. Whilst the challenges of placing children and young people with complex needs in family placements are common to many geopgraphical and cultural contexts, the location of the studies and the profile of the included samples may limit the applicability of the evidence. Studies are currently being conducted in England, the USA and Sweden (<A HREF="Biehal &amp; Green 2004">Biehal &amp; Green 2004</A>; <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farmer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Farmer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hansson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hansson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hansson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hansson 2008</LINK>) and these may shed light onto the effectiveness of TFC when implemented in other cultural contexts. They are testing the effects of Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care, the model developed by the team in Oregon (see Table of Ongoing Studies).<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>Treatment foster care is specifically tailored to address the needs of those children who, for a variety of reasons, are at risk of finding themselves in placements that restrict their liberty and other opportunities for participation, outside of the mainstream of society. For delinquents, placement in group homes or secure settings further exposes them to further adverse influence that come from living alongside other delinquent peers. It also deprives them of exposure to prosocial role models and to the opportunities to develop prosocial skills and attitudes and to be reinforced for doing so. For those with chronic physical illness or disability it magnifies the social exclusion that so often arises as a result of illness or impairment. Four studies focused on either young delinquents or children with a range of behaviour problems. Somewhat unusually this included a focus on juvenile delinquent girls. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1991</LINK>) examined the effects of TFC for children and youth in a state mental hospital. No study of TFC for disabled children and youth met the inclusion criteria for this review. In the course of preparing this review, the authors reflected that the set of outcomes identified in the protocol did not fully take into account the importance of social inclusion for children and youth who are marginalised through delinquency, chronic illness or mental or physical impairment.</P>
<P>For the most part, data on particular outcomes were only available from one or sometimes two studies. This limits the cumulative picture of the effectiveness of treatment foster care and, as a consequence, its generalisability.<BR/>

The four Oregon studies used coinflipping as the method of randomisation and ensured that this was done in a private office location that independent of the centers were treatment was delivered, thereby ensuring that both sequence generation and allocaton concealment were adequate. Full details of our assessments are available in a quality assessment table (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Aspects of study quality were generally poorly reported however and much of the detail in our assessment of methodological quality was dependent on unpublished information kindly provided by the study investigators</P>
<P>Outcome blinding is a challenge in the evaluation of interventions such as TFC. Investigators made appropriate use of statistical information, where this was available, and in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK>) steps were taken to check the reliability of data gathered. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Leve-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leve 2005</LINK>) specifically stated that the staff members responsible for data collection and data entry were blind to participants' group assignment and were not involved in delivering the intervention. As indicated in the body of the review, attrition rates were generally low or non-existent, depending on the study or outcome measure. <LINK REF="STD-Leve-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leve 2005</LINK> provides an exemplary flow-chart tracking attrition throughout the study, in line with the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>), a rare feature of reports in the field of child and adolescent mental health.

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-04-30 11:32:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Julie G Millener">
<P>We endeavoured to extract pre-specified outcomes, but there remains a high risk that the scales reported are a biased representation of those collected by the study authors (selective reporting). It is also possible that the practice in some studies of reporting the results for only those children who completed all post-treatment assessments, represents a further source of bias, though in what direction it is not possible to say. Most studies appear to have reported on all the measures they set out to use (as far as one can tell from published reports), at all time points, but these are not always available in a form that supports secondary analysis or meta-analysis. For early studies the authors are unable to supply raw data, though for later studies this has been possible in some cases e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Leve-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leve 2005</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Leve-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leve 2005</LINK> the investigators appear to have dropped the carers' reported Child Behavior Checklist (<LINK REF="REF-Achenbach-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achenbach 1991a</LINK>) at the two year follow-up.</P>
<P>All five of the included studies were conducted by research teams that included the programme developers. This has to be considered as a potentially significant source of bias.

<P>Whilst attrition was generally limited, only two studies reported undertaking Intention to Treat analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1998</LINK>) or analyses designed to handle missing data (<LINK REF="STD-Leve-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leve 2005</LINK>).</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Although the inclusion criteria for this systematic review set a threshold for study design that was higher than that of previous reviews, the results mirror those by <LINK REF="REF-Hahn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 2004</LINK> (particularly in relation to delinquency) and <LINK REF="REF-Reddy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reddy 1997</LINK> (particularly with regard to placement permanency). Although the numbers of studies are relatively few, diverse and small scale, the evidence suggests that TFC is a promising social intervention for children and young people at risk of placement in settings that restrict their liberty and who are at risk of a range of adverse outcomes. This holds for a range of children and youth with behavioural and emotional disorders, but particularly those with conduct disorders and delinquency. </P>
<P>Chamberlain and colleagues have noted the likely importance of ensuring that, for girls at least, Treatment Foster Care needs to address emotional and psychiatric conditions that often appear alongside delinquency (and which may contribute to it, or to the impediments to treatment). Given the histories of maltreatment, including sexual abuse, in this population, this is a reasonable consideration (<LINK REF="REF-Chamberlain-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chamberlain 2007a</LINK>). It underlines a more general view that, for many children and young people, successful foster care requires access to appropriate, evidence-based child and adolescent mental health services. </P>
<P>The indirect evidence from improved placement stability and other outcomes for children suggest that targeted selection, training and support combine to improve the experience of foster carers, and their continued preparedness to foster these challenging children. Support is not only to the foster carers themselves, but comes in the form of access to services that focused care management provides.</P>
<P>On the basis of this review, nothing can be said about the costs and benefits of this service. Further, although Treatment Foster Care is advocated for a range of children whose difficulties mean they are at greater risk of placements in settings outside of the mainstream, we were unable to find any studies of the effectiveness of TFC for children with chronic illness or disability that met the methodological inclusion criteria for this review (see below).</P>
<P>In the absence of a larger body of evidence on the effects of TFC it is not possible to make statements about its effectiveness vis a vis other composite interventions.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given the dearth of high quality evidence in respect of social interventions, it is usual for authors to recommend that more research is needed in relation to programmes such as TFC. Whilst this is undoubtedly true, we suggest that the findings of this systematic review point to more specific recommendations. </P>
<P>The MTFC programme developed by Chamberlain and her colleagues at the Oregon Social Learning Center has a coherent underpinning logic model that has been tested in a number of empirical studies of reasonable quality., albeit by researchers who have also played a role in developing the programme. These studies provide promising evidence of MTFC's potential effectiveness as an intervention for delinquent girls and boys in Oregon. There is also some evidence of its potential as an effective service for youth with serious mental health problems. Rather than a general recommendation for more research into the generic category of 'TFC' we recommend that further research should seek to test the generalisability of findings from these studies of MTFC. These should be conducted by independent research teams, in different locations, with different groups of young people, of different ages and more diverse ethnicity, and with a range of clearly specified problem profiles (e.g. psychological disorders; delinquency). Researchers should seek to report data on core outcomes of primary significance, reporting the data in the same way over time, and using follow-up periods of at least two years, but preferably longer. This might be particularly important in relation to delinquency given the association between early onset chronic delinquency and adult offending careers. In expanding the evidence base in this way it may be possible meaningfully to investigate any differential impacts of the intervention and the factors that might moderate its effectiveness. Ongoing studies in the UK and Sweden will contribute to this evidence base if they contribute data to a core set of primary and secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>As and when a more substantial evidence-base is established for TFC (or not) then it would be desirable to compare its effectiveness with other composite or multifaceted interventions. At present, available resources should, however, be given to testing its effectiveness in a variety of populations with a variety of problems.</P>
<P>Researchers need to give serious consideration to the effectiveness of TFC with children whose medical conditions, learning or physical impairments, place them at risk of social exclusion. Whilst some of the aims of TFC for delinquents differ in important respects from those of TFC for children with chronic medical conditions, others do not e.g. placement stability, an opportunity to develop strong attachments with a significant other, social inclusion. Some might think it inappropriate or ethically questionable to randomize such children to TFC and other experimental conditions. The reality is that most disabled children in out-of-home care have access only to less intensive, less holistic fostering packages that can mean they move from one placement to another. Little is known about the 'value-added' of what are undoubtedly expensive fostering packages, or what might be essential to effective adoption - in some jurisdiction deemed the more desirable outcome. Future studies (or even papers on past studies) should - minimally - provide information on the costs of programmes. Wherever possible, cost-benefit analyses should be undertaken or the data necessary for this to be done should be incorporated. </P>

</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Experimental group: multi-component model comprising: (i) individualised treatment plan for children and young people, in which the consequences of rule infringements were individually tailored, (ii) close supervision and monitoring of boys' activities, including contact with peers (contact with delinquent peers was prohibited), (iii) weekly supervision of foster carers via daily telephone calls and weekly groups, (iv) additional meetings with foster carers and boys to deal with routine problems or difficulties in implementing the programme, (v) weekly individual therapy for boys, (vi) weekly family therapy for the boys' biological family or other after care resource, (vii) psychiatric consultation, evaluation and medication as needed, (viii) where reunification was the goal, a structured approah to home visiting was incorporated that involved frequent, visits, building in duration over time and overseen by a family therapist experienced in parent training methods, (ix) contracted and supervised educational arrangements at school or at home (where boys were suspended from school), (x) co-ordination of treatment and supervision services by a case manager who was also available to biological parents or other after care parents, 24 /7. (xi) reports of all parole violations to parole or probation officers who followed through with appropriate sanctions. <BR/>Control group: one of eleven community-based group care programmes located throughout the state of Oregan with 6-15 youths in residence, using shift staff and with varying theoretical orientations, though most used variations of a positive peer culture approach (66%). Most boys participated in individual and/or group therapy, most on a weekly basis and most attended in-house schools. Family contact was encouraged and family therapy was provided when families could commute to the program sites (55% of cases).</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Placement outcomes: days in actual care; days on the run; days in detention and in state training schools (juvenile court records), days living at home. <BR/>Child Behaviour: (I) official criminal referrals (recorded by the Oregon youth Authority), (ii) rates or self-reproted delinquency</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Several steps were taken to ensure the integrity of the MTFC condition. This was continually assessed via the telephoning of MTFC carers every weekday, the weekly collection of home and school points by case managers, and the review of individual and family therapy session videotapes at weekly 2-hr therapist meetings. No such supervision took place as part of the standard practice of GC. </P>
<P>Chamberlain and Moore's (1998) paper note that the judge was given the opportunity to veto randomization categories up to 3 times over the five year period of the study. Used the exception twice to place boys initially assigned to GC to the TFC condition.</P>

<P>Experimental group (n randomised = 37): multi-component model comprising: (i) individualised treatment plan for children and young people, in which the consequences of rule infringements were individually tailored. In addition to the programme implemented with boys (Chamberlain 1998) 'gender-specific processes' were addresed by training foster carers to provide reinforcement (extra points) for girls' avoidance of social-relational aggression and sanctions (loss of points) for girls' commission of social-relational aggression. Girls were taught strategies for avoiding social-relational aggression (e.g. practicing ways to talk directly to friends about distressing or uncomfortable situations) and for regulating their emotions (e.g. recognizing their feelings of distress, practicing coping strategies, and generating various solutions for dealing with problems).(ii) close supervision and monitoring of girls' activities, including contact with peers (contact with delinquent peers was prohibited), (iii) weekly supervision of foster carers via daily telephone calls and weekly groups, (iv) additional meetings with foster carers and girls to deal with routine problems or difficulties in implementing the programme, (v) weekly individual therapy for girls, (vi) weekly family therapy for the girls' biological family or other after care resource, (vii) psychiatric consultation, evaluation and medication as needed, (viii) where reunification was the goal, a structured approah to home visiting was incorporated that involved frequent, visits, building in duration over time and overseen by a family therapist experienced in parent training methods, (ix) contracted and supervised educational arrangements at school or at home (where girls were suspended from school), (x) co-ordination of treatment and supervision services by a case manager who was also available to biological parents or other after care parents, 24 /7. (xi) reports of all parole violations to parole or probation officers who followed through with appropriate sanctions.<BR/>Control group (n = 44 randomised): one of nineteen community-based group care programmes located throughout the state of Oregan with 2-51 youths in residence, with 1-50 staff members and on-site schooling. The majority of programs (86% reported endorsing a specific treatment model, wiht the primary philosophy being behavioral (70%), eclectic (26%), or family style (4%). 70% of the programs reported delivering therapeutic services at least weekly.</P>

<TD>
<P>Binary data</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Binary outcomes will be analyzed by calculating odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Although the odds ratio provides an effect for use in meta-analysis (Lipsey 2001), attempts will be made to preserve information about base rates (actual proportions) and differences in proportions, since this information is of interest to policy makers. RevMan 4.2 uses Mantel-Haenszel methods for combining binary outcome data across studies.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Multiple measures in meta-analysis</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>If measures of an outcome are combined for meta-analysis, we will conduct multiple meta-analyses if multiple studies report multiple measures that can be combined in this way. If a study includes multiple measures where only one effect estimate can be used for meta-analysis, we will calculate the average effect for this purpose (e.g. the average SMD or RR weighted by variance).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Multiple arms <BR/>
</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>All eligible outcome measures for all trial arms will be reported in the review. If two or more eligible intervention groups are compared to an eligible control, thus requiring that the reviewers choose a single intervention group for comparison or inclusion in a meta-analysis, that which most closely matches the definition of TFC will be included in the meta-analysis, and the decision process by which authors selected arm will be clearly documented. <BR/>
</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Sub-group analyses and investigation of heterogeneity</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>If substantial heterogeneity is identified within a meta-analysis, two possible sources will be investigated separately: i) studies serving different populations; ii) studies which work with young people and biological parents and those that do not; iii) characteristics of the children and young people (age, gender) and iv) characteristics of the foster carers. Depending on the number of primary studies in the analysis, attempts will be made to study variations in effect sizes between studies using weighted multiple regression or categorical comparisons.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Assessment of bias (including sensitivity analyses)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Sensitivity analysis will be used to examine the robustness of conclusions. Separate analyses will examine studies that support intent-to-treat analysis and those in which the outcome assessment was blind to treatment allocation. <BR/>
<BR/>To investigate the possibility of bias, including publication bias, funnel plots will be drawn (Deeks 2005, Egger 1997, Sterne 2001). In the event of asymmetry, the reviewers will seek input from methodologists, including the Cochrane and Campbell Collaboration Methods Groups, on appropriate analyses.</P>

<P>A repeated measures ANOVA on the frequency of problem behaviours indicates a 'significant' decrease in problem behaviours for the Enhanced Support and Training (ES &amp; T) condition relative to the other two conditions (Increased Payment Only [IPO] and Foster Care as Usual [FCU]). However, the fact that the groups differed significantly at baseline raises questions about the validity of their result. The investigators took care to point out that whilst the foster carers in their sample did not appear to differ at baseline, the number of 'child problem behaviours' between groups differed considerably, with the children in the ES &amp; T group reported as exhibiting on average 7.5 problem behaviours per day as compared to 5.71 in the IPO group and 3.71 in the FCU group. The investigators note that the 'norm' for non-referred children would be an average of 5 'daily problems'</P>

</TD>
<TD>
<P>Repeated measures ANOVAs on both YSR and CBCL broad- and narrow-band factors for waves 1 through 8 examined changes in emotional and behavioural adjustment over the course of the study, for those children for whom complete data were available (YSR n= 43; CBCL n=41). Intervention group (FIAP versus SP), age and gender acted as independent factors. Internalising and internalising-narrow-band factors (YSR &amp; CBCL). No within-subject effects - both groups showed some improvements over time, and there were several gender x time and age x time interactions. Externalising factors (YSR). Significant interactions only for condition by gender (F(7, 245)=2.53, P&lt;.01, and delinquency, F(7, 245)=2.90, P&lt;.001. Externalising or delinquency factors (CBCL). Only a significant condition by gender interaction. The lack of condition x time interaction effects is problematic in this context as we can not assess the long-term effectiveness of the intervention.</P>

<P>Data in the study were drawn from computerised records of arrests and incarceration, interviews with youths and contacts with foster care caseworkers. In the study it is reported that 22% (n=29) of the children spent time in locked settings (detention, jail, correctional centers, adult prisons) during the pre or post periods or both. For this subset (13 FIAP; 16 SP) a repeated measures ANOVA indicated a statistically significant difference favouring the FIAP youth, who spent fewer days incarcerated during this post periods than their SP peers, F(1,27)=4.68, p&lt;.05.</P>
