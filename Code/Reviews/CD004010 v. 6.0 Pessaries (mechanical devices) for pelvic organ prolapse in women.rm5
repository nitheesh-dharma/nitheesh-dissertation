<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-01-22 10:27:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pelvic organs, such as the uterus, bladder or bowel, may protrude into the vagina because of weakness in the tissues that normally support them. The symptoms that they cause vary depending on the type of prolapse. Pessaries (mechanical devices such as latex or silicone pessaries) can be used to try to restore the prolapsed organs to their normal position and hence to relieve symptoms. They are commonly used when conservative treatment, like physiotherapy, and surgery have either failed or are not suitable. The review found one randomised trial which compared two types of pessary, the ring pessary and the Gellhorn pessary. Both pessaries worked for the 60% of women who completed the study and there were no differences between the two types of pessary.</P>

<P>Pelvic organ prolapse is common, with some degree of prolapse seen in up to 50% of parous women in a clinic setting, although many are asymptomatic. The use of pessaries (a passive mechanical device designed to support the vagina) to treat prolapse is very common, and up to 77% of clinicians use pessaries for the first line management of prolapse. A number of symptoms may be associated with prolapse and treatments include surgery, pessaries and conservative therapies. A variety of pessaries are described which aim to alleviate the symptoms of prolapse and avert or delay the need for surgery.</P>

<P>The review authors identified one randomised controlled trial comparing ring and Gellhorn pessaries. The results of the trial showed that both pessaries were effective for the approximately 60% of women who completed the study with no significant differences identified between the two types of pessary. However, methodological flaws were noted in the trial, as elaborated under risk of bias assessment. There is no consensus on the use of different types of device, the indications nor the pattern of replacement and follow-up care. There is an urgent need for randomised studies to address the use of pessaries in comparison with no treatment, surgery and conservative measures.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-01-22 10:27:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pelvic organ prolapse is common and is seen in up to 50% of parous women in a clinic setting (<LINK REF="REF-Swift-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swift 2000</LINK>). In the general population, an estimated 30% of women will have signs of prolapse although the majority are asymptomatic (<LINK REF="REF-Samuelsson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuelsson 1999</LINK>). MacLennan found in telephone interviews that only 8.8% of women in the general population are symptomatic (<LINK REF="REF-MacLennan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLennan 2000</LINK>). Pelvic organ prolapse includes anterior vaginal wall prolapse (cystocoele, urethrocoele), posterior vaginal wall prolapse (enterocoele, rectocoele, perineal deficiency) and uterine or vaginal vault prolapse. A woman can present with prolapse of one or more of these sites. The International Continence Society has standardised the nomenclature using the POP-Q evaluation (<LINK REF="REF-Bump-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bump 1996</LINK>), but in this document we have also used the descriptive terms above as these are compatible with searches of the literature.</P>
<P>The aetiology of pelvic organ prolapse is complex and multi-factorial. Risk factors include pregnancy, childbirth, congenital or acquired connective tissue abnormalities, denervation or weakness of the pelvic floor, ageing, menopause and factors associated with chronically raised intra-abdominal pressure such as obesity, cough and heavy lifting (<LINK REF="REF-Bump-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bump 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacLennan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLennan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dietz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dietz 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Women with prolapse may have a variety of pelvic floor symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Hagen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lone-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lone 2011</LINK>). Only some of the symptoms are directly related to the prolapse, including pelvic heaviness, a dragging sensation in the vagina, a bulge, lump or protrusion coming down from the vagina and backache. Symptoms of bladder, bowel or sexual dysfunction are frequently present. These symptoms may be directly related to the prolapsed organ, for example a poor urinary stream when a cystocoele is present or obstructed defecation when a rectocoele is present. They may also be independent of the prolapse, for example symptoms of detrusor overactivity when a cystocoele is present. Symptoms may negatively affect body image, quality of life and a woman's ability to perform day to day activities (<LINK REF="REF-Lowder-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowder 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-01-22 10:27:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prolapse treatment may be dependent on a number of factors including the severity of prolapse, the bothersomeness of the associated symptoms, the woman's general health and the woman's treatment preference (<LINK REF="REF-Kapoor-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kapoor 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Basu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basu 2011</LINK>). Options available for treatment are conservative (for example pelvic floor muscle training), mechanical support (such as vaginal pessaries), oestrogens and surgery. Previously, conservative or pessary treatment was only considered for women with a mild degree of prolapse, for those who wished to have more children, and the frail or those unwilling to undergo surgery. However, 87% to 98% of clinicians report using pessaries in their clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Cundiff-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cundiff 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pott_x002d_Grinstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pott-Grinstein 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gorti-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorti 2009</LINK>) and 77% of gynaecologists report using pessaries as first line treatment for prolapse (<LINK REF="REF-Cundiff-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cundiff 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>This is a review of treatment with pessaries (mechanical devices) for prolapse. We will use the term 'pessary' throughout the review, with a pessary been defined as a passive mechanical device designed to support the vagina. Other Cochrane reviews assess the effectiveness of surgical, conservative and oestrogen based treatments for prolapse (<LINK REF="REF-Ismail-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ismail 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hagen-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagen 2011b</LINK>) and mechanical devices for urinary incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Lipp-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipp 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>An extensive range of pessaries have been described for the treatment of prolapse (<LINK REF="REF-Poma-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poma 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oliver-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 2011</LINK>). These consist mainly of latex or silicone pessaries which are shaped devices that are inserted into and left in the vagina to support the prolapsed pelvic organs. Two main groups of pessaries are used, support pessaries and space filling pessaries (<LINK REF="REF-Oliver-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 2011</LINK>). Study findings suggest that ring pessaries are the type most commonly used in practice (<LINK REF="REF-Cundiff-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cundiff 2000</LINK>) but these may not be effective for all types of prolapse.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-01-22 10:27:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pessaries are used in pelvic organ prolapse in order to physically support the vaginal walls and the pelvic organs behind them. The pessary is inserted into the vagina with a view to holding the prolapsed organs inside the vagina, supporting the pelvic structures, and relieving pressure on the bladder and bowel (<LINK REF="REF-Hay_x002d_Smith-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay-Smith 2009</LINK>). The aims of using a pessary in the management of pelvic organ prolapse include to:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>prevent the prolapse becoming worse;</LI>
<LI>help decrease the frequency or severity of symptoms of prolapse;</LI>
<LI>avert or delay the need for surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Oliver-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 2011</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Variable patterns of follow-up care are reported (<LINK REF="REF-Gorti-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorti 2009</LINK>), however pessaries do need to be removed regularly and the vaginal mucosa checked for erosions. Some patients will be able to remove and replace the pessary themselves, which may lengthen the intervals between gynaecological examinations, while others will return to the clinic for removal and replacement. Descriptive data suggest that local oestrogens may be beneficial in successful pessary fitting or in maintenance of treatment with pessaries (<LINK REF="REF-Hanson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanson 2006</LINK>) but more evidence is needed about ongoing pessary management. Pessaries are cheap and complications are reported to be rare (<LINK REF="REF-Hanson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanson 2006</LINK>). The majority of evidence for the use of pessaries comes from level II and III studies (<LINK REF="REF-Clemons-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clemons 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clemons-2-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clemons 2 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clemons-3-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clemons 3 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kapoor-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kapoor 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lone-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lone 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manchana-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manchana 2012</LINK>) thus the efficacy of pessary use in the management of prolapse still requires to be clearly established.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-01-22 10:27:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The wide variety of treatments available for prolapse indicates the lack of consensus as to the optimal treatment. Provided that sufficient numbers of trials of adequate quality have been conducted, the most reliable evidence is likely to come from the consideration of randomised controlled trials, and this is the basis for the present review. The aim is to help identify optimal practice and highlight where there is a need for further research.</P>

The GRADE working group strongly recommends including up to seven critical outcomes in a systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2013b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this systematic review, GRADE methodology was adopted for assessing the quality of evidence for the following outcomes:</P>
<P>&#8226; woman's perceived improvement in prolapse symptoms assessed using validated symptom questionnaire at one year;</P>
<P>&#8226; acceptability of or satisfaction with treatment at one year;</P>
<P>&#8226; grade of prolapse with device in situ at one year.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Cundiff-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cundiff 2007</LINK> reported a randomised crossover trial comparing symptom relief and the change in life impact for women using ring with support versus Gellhorn pessaries. The study was multicentre and performed in the USA. The trial included 134 women presenting with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse, stage II or greater on the POP-Q classification (<LINK REF="REF-Bump-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bump 1996</LINK>). Women were randomised to each pessary using computer generated random numbers allocated in sealed opaque envelopes. Neither women nor researchers were blinded to the allocated pessary, but data were coded to permit blinding during analysis. Those women who were successfully fitted were asked to wear the pessary for three months, but if they discontinued prior to three months the data collection was accelerated. Outcome measures included changes in the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) and the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ) (<LINK REF="REF-Barber-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barber 2001</LINK>). The study reported both statistically significant and clinically significant changes in the PFDI and PFIQ.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-01-22 10:27:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review considers whether pessaries (mechanical devices) are effective in the management of pelvic organ prolapse. The scope of the review has not been changed. Reviews relating to alternative forms of treatment for pelvic organ prolapse are covered in other Cochrane reviews, surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Maher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2010</LINK>), conservative methods such as pelvic floor muscle training and lifestyle changes (<LINK REF="REF-Hagen-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagen 2011b</LINK>) and oestrogen (<LINK REF="REF-Ismail-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ismail 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the last review only one randomised controlled trial has been identified (<LINK REF="STD-Cundiff-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cundiff 2007</LINK>). This trial had a high attrition rate leading to high risk of bias. However, the trial was not underpowered due to the crossover design. In this study it was reported that approximately 60% of women offered a pessary would continue with the treatment in the long term regardless of which device they used. This low continuation and high attrition factor should be considered in future study designs.</P>
<P>The use of pessaries has become commonplace over many years without full evaluation of their efficacy in comparison to other modes of treatment such as surgery, oestrogens or pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT). There is a need for trials of the effectiveness of pessaries in comparison to other treatments. There is a need for trials to assess whether early use of pessaries prevents progression of prolapse. There is also a need for trials which address the indication for pessary use and the care of pessaries; at present there is no consensus on the intervals between pessary changes, the treatment of complications, the role of local oestrogens or other concomitant treatments such as PFMT, nor which pessaries are indicated in specific types of pelvic organ prolapse. Despite their common usage, there are wide gaps in our knowledge of the outcomes of treatment using pessaries, which should be remedied with well-designed RCTs.</P>

<P>No good quality evidence from randomised controlled trials was identified on which to base the management by pessaries of women with pelvic organ prolapse. The only randomised controlled trial that was reported highlighted a high attrition rate of up to 40%, which needs to be taken into account in the design of randomised controlled trials of pessaries for pelvic organ prolapse in the future.</P>

<P>There is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials in this area. Specifically the following comparisons should be made:<BR/>1. a pessary versus control, waiting list or no active treatment;<BR/>2. a pessary versus surgery;<BR/>3. a pessary versus physical interventions such as pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) or lifestyle changes.</P>
<P>These trials should also evaluate whether there is any additional risk or benefit from the use of local oestrogen therapy or PFMT in conjunction with a pessary. In addition, trials are needed to inform the best ways to manage long term pessary use.</P>

<P>PEDro (the Physiotherapy Evidence Database) (url: www.pedro.fhs.usyd.edu.au) produced by the Centre for Evidence-Based Physiotherapy (CEBP), University of Sydney, Australia was searched on 13 October 2003 using the search term "prolapse".</P>
<P>The UK National Research Register (Issue 3, 2003), Controlled Clinical Trials (April 2003) and ZETOC database of conference abstracts (April 2003) were searched using the search terms cystocele, urethrocele, rectocele, vault prolapse, uterine prolapse, vaginal prolapse, pelvic organ prolapse, pelvic floor.</P>
<P>The reference lists of relevant articles were searched for other possibly relevant trials, including the Cochrane review (Hay-Smith 2001) of pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence.</P>
<P>We did not impose any language or other restrictions on any of the searches.</P>
