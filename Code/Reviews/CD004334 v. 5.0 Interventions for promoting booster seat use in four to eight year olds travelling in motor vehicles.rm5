<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-29 11:24:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Booster seats are designed for use by children aged four to eight years, while travelling in motor vehicles. They aim to raise the child off the vehicle seat so that the adult seat belt fits correctly and the child can travel in greater comfort and safety. Public health and traffic safety agencies recommend the use of booster seats in children until the vehicle seatbelt fits properly; typically when the child is at least 58 inches tall, has a sitting height of 29 inches and weighs about 80 pounds.</P>
<P>In children aged four to seven years, booster seats are estimated to reduce the odds of sustaining clinically significant injuries during a crash by 59%, when compared to using ordinary vehicle seatbelts. Despite the evidence of effectiveness, many children are not restrained in age-appropriate booster seats.</P>
<P>In light of the strong evidence for the safety benefits of booster seats, interventions specifically aimed at promoting their use have been implemented. To evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions, the authors of this systematic review examined all high quality trials investigating their effect on acquisition and use of booster seats.</P>
<P>The authors found five studies involving a total of 3,070 participants. All interventions investigated by the studies were found to increase the use of booster seats, compared to the group receiving no intervention. The distribution of free booster seats combined with education on their use, had a marked beneficial effect, as did incentives (for example, booster seat discount coupons or gift certificates) combined with education. Education-only interventions also produced beneficial outcomes. One of the studies evaluated the effectiveness of the enforcement of a booster seat law, but did not detect an effect on usage.</P>
<P>The authors concluded that the current evidence suggests that several types of interventions aimed at increasing the use of booster seats among children aged four to eight years, are effective. However, there is still a need for further high quality trials, especially those conducted outside of the USA and Australia, where current research dominates.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Public health and traffic safety agencies recommend use of booster seats in motor vehicles for children aged four to eight years, and various interventions have been implemented to increase their use by individuals who transport children in motor vehicles. There is little evidence regarding the effectiveness of these interventions, hence the need to examine what works and what does not.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of interventions intended to increase acquisition and use of booster seats in motor vehicles among four to eight year olds.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2005), EMBASE (1980 to April 2005), LILACS, Transport Research Databases (1988 to April 2005), Australian Transport Index (1976 to April 2005), additional databases and reference lists of relevant articles. We also contacted experts in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomized and controlled before-and-after trials that investigated the effects of interventions to promote booster seat use.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Five studies involving 3,070 individuals met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. All interventions for promoting use of booster seats among 4 to 8 year olds demonstrated a positive effect (relative risk (RR) 1.43; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.05 to 1.96). Incentives combined with education demonstrated a beneficial effect (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.55; n = 1,898). Distribution of free booster seats combined with education also had a beneficial effect (RR 2.34; 95% CI 1.50 to 3.63; n = 380) as did education-only interventions (RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.49; n = 563). One study which evaluated enforcement of booster seat law met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis, but demonstrated no marked beneficial effect.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Available evidence suggests that interventions to increase use of booster seats among children age four to eight years are effective. Combining incentives (booster seat discount coupons or gift certificates) or distribution of free booster seats with education demonstrated marked beneficial outcomes for acquisition and use of booster seats for four to eight year olds. There is some evidence of beneficial effect of legislation on acquisition and use of booster seats but this was mainly from uncontrolled before-and-after studies, which did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-27 15:27:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Road traffic injuries are a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally. They are the 10th leading cause of death and the ninth leading cause of the global burden of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1996</LINK>). The World Health Organization estimates that over 1.18 million people are killed and as many as 50 million injured or disabled in road traffic crashes annually (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). It is projected that without renewed emphasis on implementation of effective preventive interventions, road traffic injuries will become the third leading cause of the global burden of disease by 2020 (<LINK REF="REF-Krug-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krug 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). Children and young people are at particular risk. The UNICEF Innocenti Report on child deaths by injury in rich nations (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF 2001</LINK>) showed that traffic crashes are a leading cause of death among children in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) region, accounting for 41% of all child deaths by injury type. Available evidence shows that the fatality rates for developing countries (measured in terms of deaths per 100,000 population) are about six times as high as the figures for developed nations (<LINK REF="REF-Nantulya-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nantulya 2003</LINK>). Globally, motor vehicle injuries and deaths have been described as "an issue of immense human proportions, an issue of economic proportions, an issue of social proportions, and an issue of equity - a problem that very much affects the poor" (<LINK REF="REF-Nantulya-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nantulya 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ross-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 1999</LINK>). The estimated direct annual costs of road traffic crashes are enormous, ranging from 0.3% of the Gross National Product (GNP) in Vietnam to almost 5% in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Motor vehicles injuries affect many young people, resulting in a large number of years lost because of premature death or a large number of years lived with disability (<LINK REF="REF-Krug-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krug 2000</LINK>). Children aged four to eight years are especially important since they die more as occupants in motor vehicle crashes than from other forms of unintentional injuries (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2004</LINK>). As they outgrow safety seats designed for younger children, many four to eight year olds travel unrestrained in motor vehicles, or are placed prematurely in adult seat belts instead of booster seats recommended by public health and transport safety agencies (<LINK REF="REF-Am-Acad-Ped-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Am Acad Ped 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ATSB-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATSB 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DfT-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DfT 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHTSA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHTSA 2004</LINK>). This increases their risk for serious crash-related injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Winston-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winston 2001</LINK>). In addition to mortality and disability, such injuries have been shown to produce enduring negative psychological effects in children (<LINK REF="REF-Aitken-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aitken 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stallard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stallard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stallard-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stallard 2004</LINK>). Even relatively minor childhood injuries disrupt parent's ability to work, place significant economic burden on affected families, and on the health system (<LINK REF="REF-Osberg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osberg 1996</LINK>). Reducing crash-related deaths and injuries among 4-8 year olds calls for the implementation of effective strategies to get booster seats in cars and make sure they are correctly used (<LINK REF="REF-Corden-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corden 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mickalide-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mickalide 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winston-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winston 2001</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Booster seats</HEADING>
<P>Children outgrow toddler car safety seats generally around 40 lbs (18 kgs) or four years of age and should then transition to booster seats. Booster seats in motor vehicles are designed to raise four to eight year olds off the vehicle seat, allowing them to use adult seat belts more safely and comfortably. Although the benefits of booster seats in protecting children from serious crash-related injuries are well documented, usage rates remain low (<LINK REF="REF-Cody-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cody 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebel 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHTSA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHTSA 2002</LINK>). Booster seats help to protect children from motor vehicle injuries and deaths by reducing the risk of <I>'lap belt syndrome' </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Durbin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durbin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mickalide-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mickalide 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2001</LINK>) that is a situation in which adult seatbelts can cause injuries to children in car crashes instead of protecting them (<LINK REF="REF-Halman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hingston-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hingston 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osberg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osberg 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pickler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickler 2001</LINK>). Research has demonstrated that children aged four to eight years have a significantly reduced risk of injury if they are restrained in booster seats rather than adult seatbelts (<LINK REF="REF-Durbin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durbin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Durbin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durbin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winston-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winston 2001</LINK>). Thus, it is recommended that children should use booster seat until they are 80 lbs in weight, eight years of age, or reach a height of 58 inches (<LINK REF="REF-NHTSA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHTSA 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are essentially three types of booster seats:</P>
<OL>
<LI>booster seats without shields, also called belt-positioning boosters, designed to be used in vehicles with lap-shoulder belts. Some have a high back that gives head support for children who are transported in vehicles without head rests; there are also backless booster seats for vehicles with head rests;</LI>
<LI>booster seats with removable shields, used without the shield to make lap and shoulder belts fit better;</LI>
<LI>high-back-booster seats- designed for children who have outgrown their child safety seats, but who still weigh less than 40 lbs (18 kgs). Most high back booster seats have a clip or strap to hold the shoulder belt in place; others have a removable harness. This type can be used with the harness for a child weighing less than 40 lbs. Once the child reaches 40 lbs, the harness can be removed and the seat is then used with the adult lap-shoulder belt as a belt-positioning booster seat.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Low- and high-back belt-positioning booster seats have existed in Europe for nearly 20 years but have only been on the market in the United States for about 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Weber-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 2000</LINK>). Booster seat cushions were developed in Sweden and Australia in the mid-1970s to allow children to take advantage of the vehicle's built-in upper and lower torso restraint, and they have been used there and elsewhere successfully ever since (<LINK REF="REF-NHTSA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHTSA 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weber-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 2000</LINK>). Booster seats are also widely used in Canada. The country has three primary classifications of children's restraint systems regulated by law, namely: rearward facing infant restraints; child restraints; and booster cushions (<LINK REF="REF-Dance-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dance 2001</LINK>). Booster cushions are for children who have outgrown their child restraint system and for those who are at least 40 lbs. Booster seats are virtually non-existent in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-UN-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">UN 2003</LINK>). Where found, they are almost exclusively sold in stores catering to expatriates or wealthy families. At very exorbitant prices, it could require weeks of earnings for an average family to purchase one (<LINK REF="REF-Hendrie-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hendrie 2005</LINK>). Even in a middle-income country such as Brazil, the cost of a booster seat is far beyond the reach of most average income families. In developing countries, these devices are imported and are thus, subject to tariffs and import taxes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Need for evidence to inform policy and practice</HEADING>
<P>Although various interventions have been implemented to increase acquisition and use of booster seats use by individuals who transport children in motor vehicles, there is little evidence regarding the effectiveness of these interventions and hence the need to which programs are effective and which are not. Previous reviews of interventions for promoting use of child restraints have targeted children under the age of four years old and there is a clear gap in scientifically based evidence on how to increase booster seat use for older children. Synthesizing evidence of effects of the various approaches will help to inform future research, guide policy and practice, justify use of resources, train health professionals, and facilitate design of community-based prevention programs that are effective. This review will assess the impact of various legislative, educational, and promotional interventions to promote the use of booster seats among children aged four to eight years and will include studies in which participants are individuals who transport children aged four to eight years in motor vehicles.</P>

<P>Legislative, educational, and promotional measures to increase acquisition and use of booster seats among four to eight year olds travelling in motor vehicles, including:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>primary enforcement of booster seat laws: a driver can be stopped, cited and fined for failure to comply with a booster seat law (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2002</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>community-wide information and enhanced enforcement campaigns: targeted information about booster seats delivered to a community, usually geographic in nature. These campaigns use mass media, information and publicity, booster seat displays in public places, public demonstration of correct use, special enforcement strategies such as checkpoints, dedicated law enforcement officials, or alternative penalties (for example verbal/written informational warnings instead of citations;</LI>
<LI>booster seat distribution and education programs: these provide booster seats to parents through loan, low-cost rental, or giveaway. The rationale is that parents who cannot afford booster seats, or with limited understanding of their benefits might be more likely to use them if financial assistance and adequate information are provided;</LI>
<LI>incentive and education programs: designed to reward parents for obtaining and using booster seats or to provide direct reward to children for using them. Incentives can also involve the distribution of discount coupons to help offset part of the cost of a booster seat.

<I> (Newcastle, Australia)<BR/>
</I>The purpose of this study was to implement and compare the effectiveness of two interventions to increase the safety restraint use of preschool children aged three to five. <LINK REF="STD-Bowman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bowman 1987</LINK> did not specifically mention booster seats in their report, but recommendations in Australia at the time of the study (as now) was for children in the three to five age group to move into booster seats as an intermediary step to seat belts alone. Confirmation that the study evaluated booster seats was obtained from the author, Dr Jenny Bowman, Associate Professor in the School of Behavioral Sciences, University of Newcastle, Australia. In this study, one intervention was an enforcement strategy aimed at parents; the other was an educational intervention for preschool children. The educational intervention was designed to address two issues: children's resistance to the use of restraints and passive acceptance by children of being unrestrained. Children were taught by their teachers to insist on wearing a restraint when travelling in the car. If not restrained by parents, children were taught to persist until the parents took action to ensure that they were suitably restrained.<BR/>
<BR/>Study participants were children attending 45 preschools randomly selected from the telephone directory. Trained observers recorded restraint status of the children before the interventions and immediately after. Restraint information was recorded on one morning at each preschool by a single observer. For each preschool, percentage restraint use was calculated. Preschools were then assigned randomly to a control or intervention group, after matching for restraint use. Fifteen preschools were assigned to each of the control, educational intervention, and legislative intervention groups.</P>
<P>Research assistants visited the preschools in the two intervention groups to deliver and explain the use of the intervention materials. The legislative intervention used threats of random police checks and fines to attempt to increase children's restraint use. Letters from the Chief Inspector of Police in the Newcastle District were handed individually to parents by the preschool director. The letter outlined legislation concerning the wearing of safety restraints by children. It warned parents that police would be conducting random checks in the area and that parents whose children were not adequately restrained would be fined. Police were not conducting checks but had agreed to include the warning in the letter to increase parents' perceptions of threat. The letter also included information regarding the types of child restraints available and their approximate cost. An accompanying pamphlet supplied general information regarding the use of child restraints. Posters and reminder cards, with the same warning of police checks and possible fines, were also used. Each preschool was supplied with three posters, which were displayed prominently. Reminder cards were pinned to the children's clothing or placed in their lunch boxes on the intervention days in both weeks.<BR/>
<BR/>The educational intervention was presented to preschool directors in kit form, and included the intervention material and a detailed explanation of its use. The material supplied to the preschools included: copies of six different drawings featuring cartoon characters; two brief songs, written to well-known tunes; a rubber stamp, which read "seat belt safety"; and two modified lap seat belts, which were fitted to preschool chairs. Suggestions were made for ways in which the supplied materials might be used, but it was left to the individual preschool teachers to create their own programs.<BR/>

<I> (Seattle Washington, USA)<BR/>
</I>This study assessed the effectiveness of a multifaceted community booster seat campaign in increasing observed booster seat use among child passengers in motor vehicles, using a prospective, non-randomized, controlled community intervention design. The campaign was initiated in four communities in the greater Seattle, Washington area between January 2000 and March 2001. Eight communities in Portland, Oregon, and Spokane, Washington, served as control sites. The study utilized community-based multiple intervention strategies that included:<BR/>

<LI>the formation of community coalition of agencies and organizations to promote the use of booster seats;</LI>
<LI>citizen advisory group of parents and caregivers to provide feedback on campaign messages and materials and to develop strategies to ensure community involvement;</LI>
<LI>broad-based community education program to increase knowledge and awareness of the importance of booster seat use (through newspaper articles, organization and group newsletter articles, booster seat web site, tip sheet, brochures, and flyers in multiple languages, telephone information line where parents can call for materials and with questions about booster seats and car seats, resource kits for preschools and health care providers, radio public service announcements, television public service announcements, local news reports);</LI>
<LI>educational programs to address barriers to booster seat use, including defining types of booster seats, identifying where devices are available, and providing alternatives for automobiles with lap-only belts;</LI>
<LI>discount booster seat coupons;</LI>
<LI>car seat training programs and in-services for health care providers, child care providers and educators, law enforcement, emergency medical service personnel, and child passenger safety advocates.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The outcome measure was observed booster seat use rates at 83 child care centers and after school programs, 15 months after the start of the campaign. Booster seat use rates were adjusted for child's age, driver's seat belt use, and driver's gender.</P>

<I> (Washington State, USA)<BR/>
</I>This trial assessed the effects of an injury prevention program delivered by school-based home visitors to low-income families whose children were attending preschool enrichment programs in Washington State, USA. Study participants were the families of children in a defined geographic area aged four to five years and enrolled in Head Start or ECEAP between January and June 1998. Of the 258 families enrolled in the intervention sites, 213 (82.5%) completed both baseline and post-intervention assessments. Of the 160 families in the comparison sites, 149 (93.1%) completed both baseline and post-intervention assessments. Analysis was restricted to those families that completed both assessments. Case workers administered a baseline home safety assessment to participating families and recorded availability of booster seats in motor vehicles owned by the family. Intervention families were offered educational materials and free child safety equipment including age appropriate car safety restraints to<B> </B>195 families,<B> </B>based on results of the home inspection. Families in the comparison group received only written information encouraging them to purchase needed safety equipment including booster seats. Outcome data were obtained by the same case worker who had enrolled families and was back to repeat the home safety assessment at three months post enrolment. Outcome measure was self-reported use of booster seats. Availability of booster seat was confirmed at the home visit by the case worker.</P>

<I> (Indianapolis, Indiana, USA)<BR/>
</I>This was a blinded, randomized, controlled trial conducted in daycare and preschools to evaluate methods to increase booster seat use for four to six year old children. The study selected nine facilities and assigned the facilities to one of the following three arms; distribution + education, incentive + education, or a control group. The education component was the same in both intervention groups and was based on the Health Belief Model of behavioral change (<LINK REF="REF-Glanz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glanz 2002</LINK>). Parents in the distribution + education group were taught how to correctly install and use a booster seat in their vehicle. At the end of the session the parents were offered a free booster seat. Their children received a separate educational presentation on why children need to be buckled-up in a booster seat and sit in the rear-seating position of the vehicle. Educational information and materials were based on the Boost America© program using Blues Clues© format with songs, coloring activities and a brief question and answer period.<BR/>
<BR/>The incentive + education group was similarly taught about the importance (and use) of booster seats, but was not offered free booster seats. They were informed that if they were observed using a booster seat at the one and six-month observation they would be entered into a drawing to win a gift certificate. The control group received educational materials through an informed consent that related information typically transmitted during a primary care health maintenance visit. On the day of the baseline observation and survey, certified child passenger safety technicians and their assistants were stationed at the entrance and in a specially marked off area of the parking lot of each participating facility. As a vehicle approached the facility for the morning drop off, they were stopped and identified as a potential study participant, and asked if they would be interested in participating in the study. If interested, informed consent was obtained and the driver filled out a survey collecting personal demographic data and knowledge, attitudes and beliefs in the use of booster seats, seat belts and seating position in the vehicle. While the driver completed the survey, the observer noted the type and use of child safety seats, booster seats, seat belts and seating position in the vehicle.<BR/>
<BR/>The child passenger's height and weight were measured and recorded. One and six months after the intervention program was completed, observations were conducted and surveys repeated in a similar manner at intervention and control sites. None of the sites knew in advance when observers would be present. Observers remained blinded to which sites was intervention or control. Main outcome measure was observed use of booster seat at one or six months post-intervention follow-up. Our analysis was restricted to six month post-intervention data. Two hundred and seven (207) children aged four to six years were enrolled and observed at baseline. Only 136 of these were observed post intervention, thus a loss to follow-up of 34.3%.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2000</LINK>
<I> (Virginia, USA)<BR/>
</I>Stevens conducted a field study with a volunteer sample of 128 participants made up of customers walking into a retail toy store in a Southwest Virginia community. All participants had a child who was aged 3.5 to 8 years of age and weighed between 35 to 80 lbs (16 to 36 kgs). The hypotheses tested were that: (i) booster information pamphlets and<I> "dollars off" </I>coupon would reduce booster seat use compliance cost and thus, encourage purchase of booster seats; and (ii) that the pamphlets would increase risk perception. None of the participating children were using booster seats in the primary vehicle at baseline. The participants were randomized into four groups as follows: pamphlets and booster discount coupons, pamphlet only, booster seat discount coupon only, and no intervention. The pamphlet contained a warning label, a true story of a child who was killed because he was restrained in an adult seat belt instead of a booster seat, statistics and consequences of non-use. The coupon's value of $30.00 represented 30 to 60% discount off the cost a high back booster seat. Outcome measures were participants' change in risk perception and whether or not they purchased a booster seat.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Bowman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bowman 1987</LINK> observation was recorded on one morning by at each preschool by a single observer. She discussed reliability of observations but did not report whether the observers were blinded. <LINK REF="STD-Ebel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebel 2003</LINK> had two observers per vehicle, so inter-observer variation was not an issue. The observers were unaware of the allocation status. <LINK REF="STD-Johnston-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 2000</LINK> did not report whether case workers were blinded, but it was noted that one case worker was assigned to one family for both pre- and post-intervention assessments. <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Neil-2005" TYPE="STUDY">O'Neil 2005</LINK> indicated that observers were blinded to the intervention type received by the centers they were examining. <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2000</LINK> was both the investigator and the observer; thus, blinding was not feasible.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interviewee bias</HEADING>
<P>Social desirability bias can be introduced in a study when self-report is relied upon for the outcome measure (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005</LINK>). Respondents, eager to please their interviewer, may give answers they believe the interviewer would like to hear in order to prove that the activity was effective. Thus, <LINK REF="STD-Johnston-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 2000</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2000</LINK> should be interpreted in this context since they relied on self-reports. It should however, be noted that Stevens corroborated booster seat purchase by confirming redeemed coupon numbers with the purchase report of the participant. In <LINK REF="STD-Johnston-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 2000</LINK> also, the case worker confirmed availability of booster at the home visit. <LINK REF="STD-Bowman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bowman 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ebel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebel 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Neil-2005" TYPE="STUDY">O'Neil 2005</LINK> used observation and so interviewee bias was not an issue.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Loss to follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Loss to follow-up for the post-intervention assessment was variable among the studies. In <LINK REF="STD-Johnston-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 2000</LINK>, a high proportion of intervention-eligible families enrolled and completed the study; the authors however did not conduct a comparative analysis of those who dropped out of the study or those who chose not to participate versus those who completed the study. Participants could have self-selected to remain in the program due to any number of confounding factors. <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Neil-2005" TYPE="STUDY">O'Neil 2005</LINK> had a significant loss to follow-up of 34.3%; 20% of the children moved from the facilities, and a number of participants lost interest. <LINK REF="STD-Ebel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebel 2003</LINK> involved two entirely different sets of children that were observed at baseline and follow up; thus, loss to follow-up was not an issue. The same was the case for <LINK REF="STD-Bowman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bowman 1987</LINK> who observed 740 preschool children and baseline and 751 post-intervention. Post-intervention observations were made on the same day of the week as the pre-intervention observations. For this reason, <LINK REF="STD-Bowman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bowman 1987</LINK> asserted that "the sample of children observed was basically homogenous pre- and post-intervention". However, no evidence was provided to support this claim. <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2000</LINK> had no loss-to-follow-up.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2000</LINK> distinguished between two factors together (pamphlet plus coupon), pamphlet only, coupon only, and one group lacking any intervention at all. <LINK REF="STD-Johnston-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 2000</LINK> compared information and distribution of seats to participants who received only information. <LINK REF="STD-Bowman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bowman 1987</LINK> used two intervention arms; education for preschool children, enforcement of law for parents, and non-placebo control group. They provided the educational intervention kits to preschools and made suggestions on ways in which the supplied materials might be used. It was left to the individual preschool teachers to create their own programs. Although it was noted that preschools were visited twice during the two week intervention to ensure that interventions were being implemented correctly, implementation strategies across the 45 preschools may have varied. <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Neil-2005" TYPE="STUDY">O'Neil 2005</LINK> utilized two intervention arms that compared: (i) distribution + education with (ii) incentives + education with (iii) a non-placebo intervention control. <LINK REF="STD-Ebel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebel 2003</LINK> was a community-based intervention that utilized multiple intervention strategies, including community mobilization and involvement. The purpose was to evaluate what the overall impact of a community-based campaign was on booster seat use rate. Thus, the study did not isolate the effects of one factor from others due to the design of the study. The distribution of seats might have been more effective than the brochures and flyers for instance, but the analyses could not reveal such distinctions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measurement issues</HEADING>
<P>Over-estimation of effectiveness of the specific interventions studied may have occurred in both the Indianapolis study (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Neil-2005" TYPE="STUDY">O'Neil 2005</LINK>) and the Washington community study (<LINK REF="STD-Ebel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebel 2003</LINK>). Study participants likely received non-intervention-related messages regarding the passage of new booster seat laws, which could conceivably increase awareness and lead to purchase and use of booster seats in experimental group and/or control group.</P>
<P>A complicating factor in the measurement of booster seat use is that the only objective way to ensure 'age-appropriate child restraint' is to physically measure the weight and height of the child. Few campaigns perform this activity, as it is seldom feasible under field study conditions and can lead to attrition of participants due to time constraints. Only <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Neil-2005" TYPE="STUDY">O'Neil 2005</LINK> measured height and weight for participating children. The others relied on parents' or caregivers' report of the child's age, height, and weight as a proxy for appropriate size for a booster seat. It is questionable whether such reports represent actual age, height, and weight of the children.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Theoretical framework</HEADING>
<P>Two of the studies clearly relied on strong behavior change theories to influence the design of their studies. <LINK REF="STD-Ebel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebel 2003</LINK> utilized the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, which attempts behavioral change by identifying predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Neil-2005" TYPE="STUDY">O'Neil 2005</LINK> was designed based on the Health Belief Model, which establishes leverage points that can be influenced, such as perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits of taking action, perceived barriers to action, cues to action, and self-efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Glanz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glanz 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2000</LINK> relied on a vague combination of theories derived from the hazard and warnings literature as well as the concept that increased risk perception (in this case, perceived risk of injury severity), will motivate behavior change. <LINK REF="STD-Johnston-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bowman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bowman 1987</LINK> did not indicate integration of theory into their design or implementation.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-27 15:46:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The benefits of using booster seats by children who are too big for safety seats designed for toddlers, but too small to use adult seat belts have been widely discussed in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Corden-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corden 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mickalide-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mickalide 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winston-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winston 2001</LINK>). Also, constraints which families have in acquiring and using booster seats have been examined and documented (<LINK REF="REF-AED-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AED 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsey-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsey 2000</LINK>). Finding effective ways to translate available knowledge into increased age-appropriate booster seat use remains a challenge for traffic safety and public health agencies. Opportunities to increase booster seat acquisition and use fall into four categories: legislation requiring booster seat use, enforcement of booster seat laws, distribution of booster seats (or incentives), and education. Our initial search revealed a total of 1,350 reports that were related to child restraint promotion. These were later narrowed to 12 studies. Of these, only five good to excellent quality studies met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Results obtained from our analyses show that interventions which combine education with either incentives (discount coupons for purchase of booster seats) or distribution of free booster seats have a beneficial effect on acquisition and use of booster seats. <LINK REF="STD-Ebel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebel 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2000</LINK> provided booster discount coupons, which displayed an effect on purchase and use of boosters. Distribution of free booster seats was influential for both <LINK REF="STD-Johnston-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Neil-2005" TYPE="STUDY">O'Neil 2005</LINK>. Only <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Neil-2005" TYPE="STUDY">O'Neil 2005</LINK> compared distribution of free booster seats with incentives, noting that distribution was more effective than incentives. Results of the analyses can have significant implications on the establishment of future interventions, as program planners want to be as effective as possible but have limited budgets within which to work. Education demonstrated an effect for <LINK REF="STD-Bowman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bowman 1987</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Uncontrolled before-and-after studies</HEADING>
<P>Although many reports have been published on interventions to increase child restraint use, very few programs involved rigorous evaluation of impact. We identified several studies that used the uncontrolled before-and-after design (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Of the studies that dealt with booster seat laws, only one qualified for inclusion in the meta-analysis. However, all but one of the five uncontrolled before-and-after studies that assessed the impact of legislation demonstrated a positive effect. In the absence of a comparison group, drawing conclusions becomes difficult since any observed differences between pre- and post-intervention measures could have resulted from chance or simply the passage of time. Although these studies did not strictly meet the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis, a reference is made to these quasi experimental studies in order to capture the totality of evidence regarding booster seat laws albeit lower level of evidence.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>It is important that readers interpret the results of this review in the context of a number of limitations that are discussed hereunder. This review involved extensive search of relevant databases and contacts with public health and transport safety agencies and experts from around the world. The literature search was not restricted by language or status of publication. Nevertheless, eligible studies identified were from developed countries, notably the US and Australia. We found no indication of eligible studies from other countries. This has implication for international generalizability of our findings. On another hand, it is doubtful that the populations involved in the included studies can be regarded as representative of the general populations of the US and Australia. For example, the middle class Seattle area communities in <LINK REF="STD-Ebel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebel 2003</LINK> study seem quite different from the Head Start population studied by <LINK REF="STD-Johnston-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 2000</LINK>. Even within <LINK REF="STD-Ebel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebel 2003</LINK>, the per capita income of the study population ranged from $15,260 (20% living in poverty) to $54,000 (3% living in poverty). It is important to note that given the resources needed to conduct interventions such as those implemented by <LINK REF="STD-Johnston-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Neil-2005" TYPE="STUDY">O'Neil 2005</LINK>, replication may not be possible in many countries. Equally, the level of community involvement in <LINK REF="STD-Ebel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebel 2003</LINK> may be difficult to achieve in some poor countries that have fewer resources or more social problems. It was noteworthy that most of the Head Start families in <LINK REF="STD-Johnston-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnston 2000</LINK> did not have cars with rear seat lap-shoulder belts suitable for booster seats. This may be the case in many parts of the world.<BR/>
<BR/>While the five studies included in the meta-analysis had sufficiently rigorous deign, two were based on observations and three on self-reports. We recognize the challenges involved in collecting observational data, and although corroboration of booster seat availability was obtained, self-reports generally constitute weak evidence of effectiveness.<BR/>
<BR/>Some of the included studies suffered from significant attrition rates, and follow-up duration varied significantly. This may imply different implications for the different studies analyzed. For example, there is a marked difference between the experimental day care intervention of two week duration by <LINK REF="STD-Bowman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bowman 1987</LINK> when compared to <LINK REF="STD-Ebel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebel 2003</LINK>, a large multi-intervention, community-based trial of 15 month duration.<BR/>
<BR/>Notwithstanding these limitations, this review has considerable implications for research and practice related to efforts to increase use of booster seat for four to eight year olds.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The science of booster seats and the strategies to increase its acquisition and use by families with young children is still an evolving field in many settings. The limited results shown suggest that multiple intervention approaches can be used to ensure increases in booster seat acquisition and use. Incentives + education, distribution + education, and education-only interventions produced varying degrees of beneficial effects. For studies that demonstrate the effect of incentives and distribution of free booster seats, the question arises with regard to funding and sustainability. It is possible that some socially minded governments or local health departments might decide to fund booster seat distribution or coupons. However, with limited resources, very few governments or local councils in many resource-poor countries are likely to be able to provide incentives or free booster seats to all deserving families. In such situations, local health departments and traffic safety programs can identify and foster participation and contribution of material resources by the private sector, including but not limited to the auto industry, child advocacy organizations, foundations, and private voluntary organizations (PVOs) with interest in child health. Private-public partnership strategies are successfully being advocated and applied in other areas of population health promotion (<LINK REF="REF-Goodman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muraskin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muraskin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wertheimer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wertheimer 2004</LINK>) and may be relevant to the promotion of booster use. Result obtained with regard to the effect of laws on booster seat use should to be interpreted with caution.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>We found only five good to excellent quality studies. Given the dearth of evaluation studies currently available globally, future endeavors to increase booster seat use must include rigorous assessment of impact, using well designed approaches that minimize bias and ensure the validity and reliability of results. There is a need for randomized controlled trials but there is also a need for prospective controlled trials, especially community-based interventions that are readily replicable, and which may provide some indication of sustainability under normal field conditions. A useful focus for future research would be a demonstration of the individual effects of the different available interventions (education, incentives, distribution, legislation). None of the studies included in our review compared for example, distribution of booster seats versus no distribution (that is, without education included in the intervention), or legislation versus no legislation. It will be important to know whether a multiple intervention strategy such as the one used by <LINK REF="STD-Ebel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ebel 2003</LINK>, which involved significant community mobilization and participation is more effective than incentives only. We do not know how incentives-only programs compare with either distribution-only or education-only interventions, neither do we know what effect community mobilization and participation has on program effectiveness. Evidence in these areas will be needed to determine generalizability of the results. The need to investigate what works best in different populations settings (for example, affluent and poor neighborhoods) is also important since it is possible that differences would be found between the behaviors of low-income parents as compared to the more affluent, or between urban and rural parents. Ascertainment of such differences is important to ensure proper targeting of future campaigns. Other important areas for future research include evaluation of the effect of legislation, cost-effectiveness analyses, studies of interventions in high risk populations, and the issue of outcome measurement. We acknowledge the practical challenges of collecting observational data, including time constraint and cost. However, such measures are critical to ensure reliability of data. Larger population studies of longer-term duration should be implemented to facilitate adequate assessment long term impact and effect size.</P>
