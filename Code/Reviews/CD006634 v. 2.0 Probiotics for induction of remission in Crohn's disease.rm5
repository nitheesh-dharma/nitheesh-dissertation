</DEL>Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestines which has periods of inactivity and periods when it flares up. Crohn's disease can affect any part of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus. The most common symptoms of Crohn's disease are abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. Probiotics are living microorganisms that are thought to benefit health by altering the growth of bacteria in the intestines thereby reducing inflammation. Only one study was identified and this did not show that probiotics had any effect in treating active Crohn's disease. However this study was only small (11 patients) and no definite conclusion can be made regarding the effectiveness of probiotics. Probiotics were generally well tolerated and no side effects were reported. There is insufficient evidence to make any conclusions about the effectiveness of probiotics for treatment of active Crohn's disease.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-05-12 10:41:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Crohn's disease has a high morbidity and there is no known cure. Current treatments have multiple side effects and an effective treatment with minimal side effects is desired. Probiotics have been proposed as such a treatment but their efficacy is undetermined. There is some evidence that probiotics are effective in other conditions affecting the gastrointestinal tract and they are popular with patients. They are thought to work through competitive action with commensal and pathogenic flora, influencing the immune response. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine if there is any evidence for the efficacy of probiotics for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to 2007), Excerpta Medica/EMBASE (1974 to 2007), CINAHL (1982-2007) and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialised Trial Register were searched. Manufacturers of probiotics were also contacted to identify any unpublished trials. References of trials were also searched for any additional trials. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared probiotics against placebo or any other intervention for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease were eligible for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality of included studies were independently performed by two authors. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of clinical remission. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-12 10:41:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>One small study (n = 11) met the inclusion criteria and was included in the review. There were some methodological concerns with this study. Four of 5 patients in the probiotic group achieved remission compared to 5 of 6 in the placebo group (OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.04 to 17.20). </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-05-12 10:41:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>There is insufficient evidence to make any conclusions about the efficacy of probiotics for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. There is a lack of well designed RCTs in this area and further research is needed. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-12 10:41:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing condition with a high morbidity. There is no known cure for CD and treatment is aimed at inducing and maintaining remission, correcting malnutrition, addressing complications, and thereby improving the quality of life of patients. In children, a major additional goal is to facilitate normal growth and pubertal development which are frequently impeded.</P>
<P>Although effective, current treatments may have serious adverse events. New treatments with minimal adverse effects would be welcomed by both patients and physicians. Any new therapy, ideally, would have the same or better efficacy as current modalities but without causing the adverse events associated with steroids and immunosuppressive agents. Probiotics have been proposed as a possible treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Malin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malin 1996</LINK>), as they seem to have few adverse effects but their efficacy for induction of remission in Crohn's disease is yet to be ascertained. </P>
<P>Probiotics consist of a group of live microorganisms that are thought to be beneficial to health. Micro-organisms that have been used as probiotics include <I>Lactobacillus spp</I>, <I>Bifidobacterium spp</I>, <I>Streptococcus salivarius spp</I>, VSL#3 (a combination of 8 probiotic bacterial species), yeasts (e.g. <I>Saccharomyces boulardii</I>) and <I>E. Coli Nissle</I> 1917 (<LINK REF="REF-Sartor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sartor 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Probiotics are thought to work through competitive action with commensal and pathogenic flora and by influencing the immune response (<LINK REF="REF-Shanahan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shanahan 2000</LINK>). Efficacy has been examined in diseases related to gut barrier dysfunction and probiotics seem to have some effect in childhood diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Hove-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hove 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Pedone-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pedone 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Pochapin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pochapin 2000</LINK>), atopic eczema (<LINK REF="REF-Isolauri-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isolauri 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Majamaa-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majamaa 1997</LINK>) and milk hypersensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-Pelto-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pelto 1998</LINK>). There is limited evidence of efficacy of probiotics in ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Kruis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruis 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Rembacken-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rembacken 1994</LINK>), pouchitis (<LINK REF="REF-Gionchetti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gionchetti 2000</LINK>) and Crohn's disease, (<LINK REF="REF-Malchow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malchow 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Guslandi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guslandi 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Campieri-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campieri 2000</LINK> ). If probiotics were shown to be an effective treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, it is feasible that complications from the use of immunosuppressives and steroids could be reduced.</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to summarise the available evidence for the use of probiotics for induction of remission in CD.</P>

<P>Step 1: Using the above search strategy, papers that appeared to be potentially relevant were identified by two authors.</P>
<P>Step 2: The authors, after reading the full texts, independently assessed the eligibility of all trials identified using an ad hoc eligibility, based on the inclusion criteria above. Disagreement among authors was discussed and agreement was reached by consensus.</P>
<P>Step 3. The methodological quality of selected trials was assessed independently by two authors using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>) and the Jadad scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). The former is based on the evidence of a strong relationship between allocation concealment and direction of effect. The categories are defined below:</P>
<P>A. adequate allocation concealment;<BR/>B. allocation concealment unclear; and<BR/>C. inadequate allocation concealment.</P>
<P>The Jadad scale is a validated five point scale which measures some important factors that impact on the quality of a trial. This is summarised below:</P>
<P>a. was the study described as randomised?<BR/>b. was the method of randomisation well described and appropriate?<BR/>c. was the study described as double blind?<BR/>d. was the double blinding well described and appropriate?<BR/>e. were withdrawals and dropouts described?</P>
<P>Each item was given a score of 1 if the answer was 'yes' and 0 if the answer was 'no'. One point was deducted if the described method of randomisation or blinding was inappropriate.</P>
<P>DATA COLLECTION<BR/>A data extraction form was developed and used to extract information on relevant features and results of included studies. Two authors independently extracted and recorded the data on the predefined checklist. Extracted data included the following items:</P>
<P>a. characteristics of patients: age, sex, disease distribution, disease duration, disease activity index;<BR/>b. total number of patients originally assigned to each intervention group;<BR/>c. intervention: type and amount of probiotic<BR/>d. control: no intervention, placebo or other interventions;<BR/>e. concurrent medications; and<BR/>f. outcomes: time of assessment, length of follow up, type of Crohn's disease activity index used, definitions of remission and relapse, relapse rates, time to relapse, quality of life assessment, adverse events.</P>
<P>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS<BR/>The Cochrane Collaboration review manager (RevMan) software (version 4.2.9) was used for data analysis. Data were analysed according to the intention to treat principle. Patients with final missing outcomes were assumed to be treatment failures. Analyses were planned to be grouped by length of follow up but, as there were limited data, this was not possible.</P>
<P>Dichotomous variables<BR/>Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated based on the fixed effects model.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity<BR/>Heterogeneity among trial results were planned to be assessed by inspection of graphical presentations and by calculating the chi square test of heterogeneity but this was not possible because of insufficient data.</P>
<P>Publication Bias<BR/>Publication bias was to be investigated with funnel plots (trial effects versus trial size). This was not done due to a lack of studies.</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis<BR/>A subgroup analysis was planned but was not done due to insufficient data.</P>

<P>Twelve potentially relevant studies on the use of probiotics for inducing remission in Crohn's disease were identified. Eleven studies were excluded for various reasons: four studies related to maintenance of remission only (<LINK REF="STD-Barclay--1992" TYPE="STUDY">Barclay 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bousvaros-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bousvaros 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marteau-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marteau 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Prantera-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 2002</LINK>); four were review articles (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ewaschuk-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ewaschuk 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gionchetti-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gionchetti 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mach-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mach 2006</LINK>); two were open label uncontrolled studies (<LINK REF="STD-Guandalini-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guandalini 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2000</LINK>); one was excluded because all patients were given probiotics during the induction phase (<LINK REF="STD-Plein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Plein 1993</LINK>) and one was a study on collagenous colitis (<LINK REF="STD-Wildt-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wildt 2006</LINK>). Only one study was identified that satisfied the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 2004</LINK>
<BR/>In this study, 11 adults were recruited from one centre in Germany. Participants were patients with active Crohn's disease, (defined as a Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) of 150 to 300)). The trial encompassed both induction and maintenance of remission with patients receiving one week of antibiotics (ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily and metronidazole 250 mg three times daily) and corticosteroids (60 mg initially and then tapering down). After one week, patients were randomised to receive either Lactobacillus GG (2 billion colony forming units per day) or a corn starch placebo. After one further week the antibiotics were stopped leaving the patients on corticosteroids plus the probiotic or placebo for the remainder of the trial. Remission was defined as a CDAI of less than 150 at twelve weeks and was the primary outcome for the induction stage. The maintenance stage of the trial continued for a total of six months and any relapses were recorded. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-05-12 10:41:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 2004</LINK> was a very small involving 11 patients and no power calculation was reported. Allocation to the groups was random, blinding was double-blind and the trial was placebo-controlled. However, further details on methods were not provided. The authors were contacted for further information. Randomisation was performed using a computer generated randomisation table. Blinding was performed by a trial nurse who had no contact with the patients and the placebo consisted of corn starch placed in a capsule similar to that used for the probiotics. There were no patients lost to follow up. The Jadad score was four. Allocation concealment was unclear. </P>
<P>It was not clear in the paper when or how induction of remission was assessed. On contacting the authors, they stated that remission was assessed at 12 weeks. During the induction phase two patients in the treatment group and two in the control group were reported as relapsing. This appears to contradict the author's statement that remission was assessed at 12 weeks. Another concern with the trial design was the fact that corticosteroids were used concurrently in the two groups. Corticosteroids are potent inducers of remission and could have been a confounding factor in this trial. </P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-05-12 10:41:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Efficacy <BR/>There was no statistically significant difference between probiotics and placebo for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. However, due to the small sample size, there was a high risk of a type 2 error. Meta analysis was not possible as only one study was included in the review. In the probiotics group 4 of 5 patients (80%) achieved remission compared to 5 of 6 (83%) in the placebo group (OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.04 to 17.20). The wide confidence interval reflected the small sample size. </P>
<P>Safety<BR/>No adverse events were reported in the 11 patients who took part during the induction phase and also during the follow up period while the maintenance study was taking place. </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-12 10:41:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>In some patients, Crohn's disease can be refractory to conventional therapy such as corticosteroids, and immune-modulators (including azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate). Some patients may become dependent on corticosteroids thereby increasing the risk of developing steroid-related adverse events. In these situations, it is important that other treatment options are considered. Probiotics have a favorable adverse effects profile and have been proposed as an alternative treatment option for patients with mild Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Malin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malin 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>There is a paucity of RCTs assessing probiotics treatment for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Only one small study (n = 11) was identified that met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 2004</LINK>) and this study had methodological flaws. This study did not show any statistically significant benefit for probiotics. However, given the weaknesses of this study, it cannot be conclusively stated that probiotics are ineffective. Appropriately powered, well-designed RCTs are needed to address this question. </P>
<P>Probiotics have also been investigated as maintenance therapy for CD. A recent Cochrane review concluded there is no evidence to suggest that probiotics are beneficial for the maintenance of remission in CD (<LINK REF="REF-Rolfe-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolfe 2006</LINK>). All of the studies included in this review enrolled small numbers of patients and may have lacked statistical power to show differences should they exist. Larger trials are required to determine if probiotics are of benefit for maintenance treatment in Crohn's disease. </P>
<P>In conclusion, there is insufficient evidence to make any conclusions regarding the efficacy of probiotics treatment for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is currently no evidence to support the use of probiotics for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. The use of probiotics as induction therapy for Crohn's disease cannot be recommended at this time.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review highlights the need for good quality, adequately powered RCT's to investigate the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. </P>
