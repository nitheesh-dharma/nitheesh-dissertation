<TITLE>Additional oxygen in the treatment of cystic fibrosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-06 09:11:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>People with cystic fibrosis (CF) suffer from breathing problems. Giving additional oxygen has long been a standard of care for people with chronic lung diseases. It is common for doctors to prescribe this treatment for people with CF when there is not enough oxygen in their blood. We looked for evidence that this treatment improves the length and quality of life for people with CF. We found eleven studies with 172 participants to include in the review. All studies compared low-flow oxygen to room air. Ten of the studies were short-term. Four of the studies looked at giving additional oxygen at night. At night, oxygen levels rose during both rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep in those people breathing low-flow oxygen. Participants breathing oxygen at night also spent less time in REM sleep and took less time to fall asleep. Six of the studies looked at the effect of extra oxygen on exercise. The levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood of participants increased during or after exercise when they breathed in low-flow oxygen. People were able to exercise for longer if they breathed in low-flow oxygen. There was more regular attendance at school or work in those receiving long-term oxygen. There is little evidence to support or oppose the long-term use of oxygen therapy in people with advanced CF lung disease. In the short term, treatment has shown some improvement in blood oxygen levels in people with CF during sleep and exercise. This increase in oxygen also came with an increase in carbon dioxide levels, which is probably not clinically important. However, caution needs to be exercised in those with advanced lung disease where this may require further monitoring. There should be research into the effects of long-term oxygen treatment on sleep quality and exercise in people with CF. Unfortunately, we do not expect that any such research will be undertaken any time soon, so we do not plan to update this review again until we find any new trials.</P>

<P>The most serious complications of cystic fibrosis (CF) relate to respiratory insufficiency. Oxygen supplementation therapy has long been a standard of care for individuals with chronic lung diseases associated with hypoxemia.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-01-17 12:48:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>This review includes 11 published studies (172 participants); only one examined long-term oxygen therapy (28 participants). There was no statistically significant improvement in survival, lung, or cardiac health. There was an improvement in regular attendance at school or work in those receiving oxygen therapy at 6 and 12 months. Four studies examined the effect of oxygen supplementation during sleep by polysomnography. Although oxygenation improved, mild hypercapnia was noted. Participants fell asleep quicker and spent a reduced percentage of total sleep time in rapid eye movement sleep, but there were no demonstrable improvements in qualitative sleep parameters. Six studies evaluated oxygen supplementation during exercise. Again, oxygenation improved, but mild hypercapnia resulted. Participants receiving oxygen therapy were able to exercise for a significantly longer duration during exercise. Other exercise parameters were not altered by the use of oxygen.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-08-06 09:11:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>There are no published data to guide the prescription of chronic oxygen supplementation to people with advanced lung disease due to CF. Short-term oxygen therapy during sleep and exercise improves oxygenation but is associated with modest and probably clinically inconsequential hypercapnia. There are improvements in exercise duration, time to fall asleep and regular attendance at school or work. There is a need for larger, well-designed clinical trials to assess the benefits of long-term oxygen therapy in people with CF administered continuously or during exercise or sleep or both. However, we do not expect any new research to be undertaken in this area any time soon and do not plan to update this review again until any new evidence does become available.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-29 11:58:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-05-29 11:51:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common life-threatening genetic illness in Caucasians, is a chronic disease affecting many secretory organs primarily the lungs and organs involved in gastro-intestinal tract function. With advances in therapy, there has been marked improvement in survival (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzsimmons-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzsimmons 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frederiksen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frederiksen 1996</LINK>). However, chronic and recurrent airway-based infection leads to progressive lung damage, bronchiectasis, and fibrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsey 1996</LINK>). These changes ultimately result in chronic hypoxemia (that is, the condition in which the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood of a person breathing room air is less than 60 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) (equivalent to 8.0 kilopascal (kPa)) or the oxygen saturation of arterial hemoglobin is less than 90%) and eventually can lead to pulmonary hypertension (an abnormal persistent elevation of the blood pressure within the pulmonary blood vessels) and cor pulmonale (right sided heart failure). Progressive destruction of lung parenchyma, pulmonary vasculature and pulmonary vasoconstriction secondary to chronic hypoxemia may all play a role in the development of pulmonary hypertension in CF (<LINK REF="REF-Fraser-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is important to acknowledge that there is no universally accepted method of detecting or quantitating hypoxemia in CF or other chronic lung diseases. First, transcutaneous pulse oximetry (reported as the percentage of saturation of arterial hemoglobin by oxygen (SaO<SUB>2</SUB>)) has become the most common method in clinical practice and research for measuring oxygenation even though partial pressure of oxygen tension measured on an arterial blood gas is a more accurate measure of oxygenation. Within the literature regarding CF, there have been varied measures of oxygenation including the following: minimum SaO2 (<LINK REF="REF-Tepper-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tepper 1983</LINK>); a lowered mean SaO<SUB>2</SUB> (<LINK REF="REF-Coffey-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coffey 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Milross-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milross 2001a</LINK>); percentage of time spent with SaO<SUB>2</SUB> below 90% (<LINK REF="REF-Frangiolis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frangiolis 2001</LINK>); or a fall in baseline SaO<SUB>2</SUB> of &#8805; 4% (<LINK REF="REF-Narang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Narang 2003</LINK>). This lack of uniformity in definition makes comparison among studies even more difficult. Lastly, gas exchange is a dynamic phenomenon over time when substantial parenchymal lung disease is involved, indicating that the more chronic the study, the more difficult to quantify the adequacy or stability of gas exchange. Nonetheless, oxygen therapy for individuals with hypoxemic lung disease is commonly prescribed and its effects worthy of precise measurement and analysis.</P>
</CONDITION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-05-29 11:54:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The efficacy of chronic oxygen supplementation in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe hypoxemia has been well demonstrated. The 'British Medical Research Council Trial' randomized people with COPD and severe hypoxemia to receive either 15 hours of oxygen therapy daily or no oxygen (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 1981</LINK>). Similarly, the 'Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial' in the USA randomized participants with severe COPD and chronic hypoxemia to receive either 12 hours or 24 hours continuous oxygen therapy (<LINK REF="REF-NOTTG-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">NOTTG 1980</LINK>). In both studies, mortality in the treatment group was significantly lower than that seen in the control or lesser-treated group. Thus, it appears that improvement in survival in individuals with chronic hypoxemia and COPD is related to the use of daily oxygen therapy in people with partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PaO<SUB>2</SUB>) &lt; 55 mm Hg (7.3 kPa). More recent studies have failed to show a survival benefit in people with COPD with milder degrees of hypoxemia (PaO<SUB>2</SUB> 56 to 65 mm Hg) (7.4 to 8.7 kPa) (<LINK REF="REF-Gorecka-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorecka 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Oxygen therapy is used in people with CF, particularly in those with chronic hypoxemia, to relieve symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue and to retard the development of cor pulmonale (right heart failure) (<LINK REF="REF-Schidlow-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schidlow 1993</LINK>). However, chronic oxygen therapy has its own costs. The estimated cost of chronic oxygen therapy in the USA in 1995 was $1.8 billion (<LINK REF="REF-Tarpy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarpy 1995</LINK>). Oxygen supplementation may be associated with complications or adverse effects, including suppression of respiratory drive in people with hypercarbia (elevated blood carbon dioxide level), psychological sequelae, and decreased mobility due to the tethering of an individual to a device or tank. It remains unclear whether oxygen therapy alleviates symptoms, alters the natural disease progression or reliably accomplishes any benefit in people with CF. In addition, it is unknown whether oxygen supplementation may be beneficial alone or when used in conjunction with non-invasive ventilation.</P>
<P>An important specific aspect of prescribed oxygen therapy is the context of air travel. Commercial airplanes pressurize cabins to a pressure commensurate with approximately 2500 meters or 8000 feet, which results in modest and clinically insignificant drops in oxygenation in normal individuals. Although there are publications with recommendations regarding the requirement of oxygen therapy in individuals with hypoxemia due to underlying lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 1992</LINK>), consideration of oxygen therapy during air travel for the individual with CF has not been the subject of study.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-09-23 16:08:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale are believed to be pre-terminal events in the majority of people with CF who die of their respiratory disease. Respiratory failure (the inability of the respiratory system to meet the metabolic demands of the body for oxygen intake and carbon dioxide excretion, leading to hypoxemia and/or elevated partial pressures of carbon dioxide in the blood, usually greater than 50 mm Hg (6.7 kPa)) is the usual mechanism of death. Sleep and exercise are the conditions during which individuals with lung disease are particularly at risk for compromised gas exchange. In chronic severe lung disease of all sorts, including CF, hypoventilation (reduced depth of or frequency of breathing, or both, leading to accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood) and worsened ventilation perfusion mismatching (an imbalance between air flowing into the air sacs of the lung and the blood flow through the lung which leads to abnormal gas exchange) during sleep often leads to worsened gas exchange and resulting in varying degrees of nocturnal hypoxemia and hypercapnia (<LINK REF="STD-Milross-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Milross 2001b</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is therefore important to determine whether oxygen therapy alleviates symptoms or reliably accomplishes any benefit in people with CF.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>

<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether the use of oxygen therapy in people with CF is associated with changes in mortality, morbidity, quality of life (including sleep quality) or with any adverse effects.</P>
<P>Furthermore, we shall search for evidence as to whether the amount of oxygen supplementation, duration (hours per day), and mode of oxygen delivery determine efficacy of clinical effect.</P>

<P>The authors sought data on the number of participants by allocated treated group, irrespective of compliance and whether or not the participant was later thought to be ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up in order to allow an intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>For binary outcome measures, we calculated a pooled estimate of the treatment effect for each outcome across studies and reported the odds ratio (OR) (the odds of an outcome among treatment allocated participants to the corresponding odds among controls) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as generated from the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we recorded either mean change from baseline for each group or mean post-treatment or post-intervention values and standard deviation for each group. Then, where appropriate, we calculated a pooled estimate of treatment effect by calculating the mean difference (MD) and reported this with the 95% CIs as generated by the meta-analyses. Three studies originally presented data as mean with standard error of the mean (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1992</LINK>: <LINK REF="STD-McKone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKone 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parsons-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Parsons 1996</LINK>). We have calculated the standard deviation (SD) from the standard error of the mean (SEM) in order to combine data from these studies in the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>Where studies measured data longitudinally, we based the analysis on the mean change from baseline at either 6 or 12 months or both if available. As only one long-term study was identified, the final time point results were used for the majority of studies which were short term. By treating the time points as independent, the correlation between the time points was assumed to be zero.</P>

<P>Ideally when conducting a meta-analysis combining results from cross-over studies, we would have liked to use the methods that are recommended by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>) and Curtin (<LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002</LINK>). Due to restrictions on the data that were available from the papers, the only method that we were able to use was to treat the cross-over studies as if they were parallel studies. Elbourne says that this approach will produce conservative results as it does not take into account within-patient correlation (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Also each participant will appear in both the treatment and control group, so the two groups will not be independent.</P>

<P>The diagnosis of CF in all participants in all 11 studies was based on a positive sweat test, typical respiratory or digestive symptoms or a positive family history, or both.</P>
<P>All 11 studies included participants with moderate to severe obstructive lung disease. Of these, four studies included participants with severe obstructive lung disease with baseline measurements of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> reported as follows: two studies reported the mean (SEM) 31 (3) % predicted (<LINK REF="STD-Parsons-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Parsons 1996</LINK>) and 62 (5) % predicted (<LINK REF="STD-Shah-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1997</LINK>); one study reported the mean (SD) 29.4 (3.4) % predicted (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1997</LINK>); and the remaining study reported just the mean 41% predicted (<LINK REF="STD-McKone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKone 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In six studies, specific criteria for lung function or gas exchange were included in the methodology (<LINK REF="STD-Falk-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milross-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Milross 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nixon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nixon 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spier-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Spier 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zinman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Zinman 1989</LINK>). Two papers based participant selection on blood gas parameters (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spier-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Spier 1984</LINK>). In one study participants were included if an arterial blood gas on room air showed a SaO<SUB>2</SUB> less than 92% (<LINK REF="STD-Spier-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Spier 1984</LINK>). In the Marcus study, participants were included if they had a resting PaO<SUB>2</SUB> less than 70 mm Hg (equivalent to 9.33 kPa), when the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<SUB>2</SUB>) was greater than 45 mm Hg (6 kPa) on room air, or if they had required multiple hospital admissions (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1992</LINK>).

<P>Four studies reported the effects of nocturnal oxygen supplementation on sleep quality and gas exchange during sleep in the short term (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milross-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Milross 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parsons-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Parsons 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spier-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Spier 1984</LINK>). There were differences in the amount of supplemental oxygen given and in the method of delivery of the oxygen. Two studies compared placebo (room air), low-flow oxygen and oxygen administered via non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milross-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Milross 2001b</LINK>). One of these compared the effects of room air, low-flow nocturnal oxygen and an average of 2.2 L/min oxygen delivered via the NIPPV circuit (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1997</LINK>). The second study compared the effects of room air, low-flow oxygen supplementation titrated to keep SaO<SUB>2</SUB> greater than 90% administered via face mask with low pressure continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 4 to 5 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O and bilevel ventilatory support with or without oxygen to maintain SaO<SUB>2</SUB> greater than 90% (<LINK REF="STD-Milross-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Milross 2001b</LINK>). From these two studies, we excluded the data which examined the effects of NIPPV from our analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milross-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Milross 2001b</LINK>). The remaining two studies compared nocturnal low-flow oxygen and room air (<LINK REF="STD-Parsons-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Parsons 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spier-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Spier 1984</LINK>). The amount of supplemental oxygen was not stated for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Parsons-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Parsons 1996</LINK>). In the other study, humidified oxygen or compressed air were administered via nasal prongs at 2 L/min (<LINK REF="STD-Spier-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Spier 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study looked at the effects of long-term oxygen therapy in hypoxemic CF participants during sleep (<LINK REF="STD-Zinman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Zinman 1989</LINK>). Twenty-eight children and adults were enrolled in three Canadian centers. Participants were randomized to receive either oxygen supplementation to achieve a PaO<SUB>2</SUB> of 70 mm Hg or room air administered from a concentrator type device in the home. Treatment was administered during sleep via facemask or nasal cannula. A limitation of the study was the failure to assess the adequacy of oxygenation during sleep with the prescribed therapy. Participants had the option of changing the route of administration, in which case the flow of oxygen necessary to maintain a PaO<SUB>2</SUB>³ 70 mm Hg was recalculated. During hospitalizations, the participant's physician determined oxygen requirements. Adherence to therapy was determined by correlating participant logs with timers on the concentrators (<LINK REF="STD-Zinman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Zinman 1989</LINK>). The aim of the study was to determine the impact of chronic oxygen therapy in advanced CF lung disease on morbidity and mortality. Outcomes measured included death, measures of pulmonary function, anthropometric measurements, exercise tests and radionuclide angiography to assess right heart function. Structured questionnaires were used to assess cognitive function, memory capacity and the participants' sense of self-esteem. The study design called for outcome variables to be measured at intervals up to 36 months post-enrolment (<LINK REF="STD-Zinman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Zinman 1989</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">During exercise</HEADING>
<P>Six studies looked at the effects of oxygen therapy on exercise; five studies evaluated the effects of short-term oxygen supplementation on exercise tolerance (<LINK REF="STD-Barker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falk-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKone 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nixon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nixon 1990</LINK>) and one study examined the ability of oxygen to enhance recovery from exercise and to improve performance of a subsequent bout of exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Shah-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1997</LINK>). None of these studies used control groups but instead looked at participants with CF with and without oxygen supplementation.</P>
<P>The six studies used different oxygen concentrations: five used fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<SUB>2</SUB>) 1.00 (<LINK REF="STD-Shah-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1997</LINK>); FiO<SUB>2</SUB> 0.30 (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nixon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nixon 1990</LINK>); FiO<SUB>2</SUB> 0.39 (<LINK REF="STD-McKone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKone 2002</LINK>) and FiO2 0.4 (<LINK REF="STD-Barker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barker 1998</LINK>). The sixth study considered participants at sea level and at Dead Sea level (396 m below sea level) (<LINK REF="STD-Falk-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 2006</LINK>). The elevated barometric pressure at low altitude was used as a method of increasing the quantity of inspired oxygen and therefore the exact amount of oxygen supplementation can not be quantified (<LINK REF="STD-Falk-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Different exercise protocols were used in these six studies. In one study, the participants performed initially to maximal exercise capacity and then underwent two supramaximal (130% of the workload calculated during maximal exercise) exercises 10 minutes apart; after one of which they breathed room air and after the other FiO<SUB>2</SUB> of 1.0 (<LINK REF="STD-Shah-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1997</LINK>). Two studies used a protocol of two progressive exercise tests in which the participants exercised to exhaustion (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nixon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nixon 1990</LINK>). In a further study, individuals exercised at 80% of maximal workload to exhaustion (<LINK REF="STD-McKone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKone 2002</LINK>). In another study, a graded submaximal test at each of three velocities, followed by a maximal exercise test, followed by a six-minute walk test were performed (<LINK REF="STD-Falk-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 2006</LINK>). The final study used submaximal cycle ergometry using pseudo-random binary sequences of workload (PRBS) (<LINK REF="STD-Barker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barker 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The participants in each of the six exercise studies were randomized to receive room air during one exercise and oxygen supplementation during the second session. One of these studies split participants into two groups based on whether or not they desaturated during exercise while breathing normal air (<LINK REF="STD-Nixon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nixon 1990</LINK>). If their peak SaO<SUB>2</SUB> remained above 90% during exercise, participants were allocated to the "High Sat" group, but if their peak SaO<SUB>2</SUB> was measured at 90% or below, they were allocated to the "Low Sat" group (<LINK REF="STD-Nixon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nixon 1990</LINK>). It is unclear whether this was an a priori division or was made on retrospective analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Nixon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nixon 1990</LINK>). We did not anticipate such a division and this is a post hoc change for this review.</P>
<P>Measured parameters in the five studies looking at short-term oxygen supplementation on exercise tolerance included heart rate, maximal oxygen uptake, maximal carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) production, peak minute ventilation and arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (<LINK REF="STD-Barker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falk-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKone 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nixon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nixon 1990</LINK>). The Barker study measured respiratory exchange ratio and spectral analysis of the PRBS data (<LINK REF="STD-Barker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barker 1998</LINK>). In addition, the Falk study measured peak oxygen consumption (VO<SUB>2</SUB>pk), ventilatory equivalent (Ve/VO<SUB>2</SUB>), ventilatory reserve utilisation (VE/MVV), blood lactate (La) and a rating of overall perceived exertion (<LINK REF="STD-Falk-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 2006</LINK>). Maximum partial pressure of carbon dioxide exhaled during a tidal breath (PETCO<SUB>2</SUB>) was measured in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKone 2002</LINK>) and transcutaneous PCO<SUB>2</SUB> (tPCO<SUB>2</SUB>) was also measured in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nixon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nixon 1990</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>Seven of the studies were judged to have a low risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data reporting. In three studies, data appear to have been analyzed based on all enrolled participants; these studies state that all participants completed all the exercises and therefore were judged to have a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Barker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKone 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shah-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1997</LINK>). In another study, data were analyzed on all enrolled participants; however, two participants were also analyzed as a separate group due to obstructive sleep apnoea symptoms; this study was also considered to be low risk (<LINK REF="STD-Spier-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Spier 1984</LINK>). In a fifth study, data from three participants were not analysed as they were unable to complete the exercise tests (<LINK REF="STD-Falk-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 2006</LINK>). Since a reason was given for non-inclusion, this also was judged as having a low risk of bias. In one further study, six out of eight participants completed the study; two participants were enrolled, but later excluded from the study as they did not tolerate NIPPV (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1997</LINK>). As these participants were withdrawn due to the NIPPV treatment rather than the oxygen treatment, this was judged as having a low risk of bias for the purposes of this review. In the final study, the data were analyzed both on an intention-to-treat basis and on the 18 participants who completed the study (10 participants dropped out - four from the oxygen group and six from the room air group) (<LINK REF="STD-Zinman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Zinman 1989</LINK>). Although a rise in PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> greater than 5 mm Hg was determined <I>a priori</I> to be grounds to exclude a participant from the study, there were no exclusions for this reason because this eventuality did not occur. The follow-up of all participants with respect to survival data was complete (<LINK REF="STD-Zinman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Zinman 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>The remaining studies were judged to have an uncertain risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data reporting.

In one of those studies, all but one participant completed the exercise tests; it is not stated whether the results were analyzed to include this participant (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1992</LINK>). In the second of those studies, data from two participants were not analyzed, as they were too young to co-operate sufficiently; it was unclear as to whether these two participants were from the same group and therefore unclear as to whether their withdrawal led to a risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Nixon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nixon 1990</LINK>). In one study 11 participants underwent full nocturnal polysomnography, but it is not clear if the results reported are from all participants or just the seven who had arterial blood gas measurements taken prior to the first part of the study and after each subsequent part (<LINK REF="STD-Parsons-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Parsons 1996</LINK>).

<P>The major adverse effect of oxygen therapy that investigators measured was an excessive increase in carbon dioxide levels. Comparisons between groups were made more difficult by the use of variations in protocol, duration of therapy and different methods of measurement. The degree of elevation in carbon dioxide during sleep or exercise was generally within 10 mm Hg or 1.0 kPa. One study did report an average of 16 mm Hg rise during exercise in the "Low Sat" group (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1992</LINK>). It is unclear whether these rises are of clinical significance over time. Notably, the only paper to study long-term oxygen therapy did not discover an increase in PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> after one year and reported not adverse clinical effects with the use of oxygen therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Zinman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Zinman 1989</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-07-03 09:04:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The frequency of the use of oxygen therapy in CF is unknown. We wished to examine the evidence for its potential benefit in CF.</P>
<P>Eleven studies were included in the review and ten of these were short-term. Nine of these studies were included in the original review and two were added at a later revision in 2008 (<LINK REF="STD-Barker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falk-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 2006</LINK>). Six of the eleven studies reported the effects of oxygen supplementation on exercise performance in CF (<LINK REF="STD-Barker-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falk-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKone 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nixon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nixon 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shah-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1997</LINK>). Four other studies reported the effects of nocturnal oxygen supplementation on gas exchange and sleep quality (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milross-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Milross 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parsons-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Parsons 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spier-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Spier 1984</LINK>). A considerable number of outcomes were tested and to put the results in context, it should be noted that the results for the first two primary outcomes listed in this review were non-significant. The third primary outcome and some of the secondary outcomes did, however, show some significant differences between treatment and placebo groups which are worthy of discussion.<BR/>
<BR/>The results of the review of short-term studies showed that there was a statistically significant improvement in oxygen saturations during or immediately after exercise in participants with CF inspiring low-flow oxygen compared with room air. There was, however, a greater increase in both the transcutaneous and end-tidal CO<SUB>2</SUB> level while breathing low-flow oxygen during exercise compared to air. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. During sleep, there was a significant improvement in oxygen saturation levels during both REM and non-REM sleep in those breathing low-flow oxygen. Data looking at changes in CO<SUB>2</SUB> levels during sleep could not be combined in a meta-analysis, but greater increases in CO<SUB>2</SUB> levels while breathing oxygen were reported in some studies. There was a significant reduction in percent of total sleep time spent in REM sleep and a reduced sleep onset latency during sleep with oxygen compared to air, but no significant changes in the mechanics of ventilation during sleep were found. Participants were able to exercise for a significantly longer duration while breathing oxygen compared to air, but no other significant effect on exercise tolerance was found.<BR/>
<BR/>One study looked at the long-term effects of oxygen in CF, and specifically described outcome measures including mortality, changes in lung function, gas exchange after 12 months, nutritional indices and progression of pulmonary hypertension (<LINK REF="STD-Zinman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Zinman 1989</LINK>). The participants received oxygen only during sleep. In participants followed for a mean duration of 26 months, nocturnal oxygen therapy did not affect any of the outcome variables. There was a trend towards improved right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) and cardiac output in the participants receiving oxygen but there was no clear relationship with better clinical outcome. Reasons for a lack of efficacy of oxygen could be explained by a number of the aspects of study design. The study population was relatively small, and may not have been of sufficient size to demonstrate statistical significance. Another reason may relate to the duration of oxygen therapy being too short to deliver a significant clinical benefit - seven hours on average per day compared to the 12 to 24 hours of oxygen demonstrated in the original studies in COPD (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NOTTG-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">NOTTG 1980</LINK>). The criterion for study entry included participants who were less severely hypoxemic than those in the COPD studies, which could easily have mixed those who would benefit with those with milder hypoxemia (<LINK REF="REF-Gorecka-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorecka 1997</LINK>). It is also conceivable that considering the different pulmonary pathophysiology in CF compared to COPD, there might be less therapeutic responsiveness to oxygen therapy.</P>
<P>Despite the presumed widespread use of oxygen therapy in CF, we believe that it is most frequently prescribed for people with documented arterial oxygen desaturation. Based on the successful use of long-term oxygen therapy in other conditions such as COPD, we hoped to find evidence to support the use of chronic oxygen therapy. We identified only one clinical study of chronic oxygen therapy which had a number of limitations and on this basis, there is an absence of evidence for benefit from long-term oxygen supplementation in people with advanced lung disease due to CF (<LINK REF="STD-Zinman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Zinman 1989</LINK>). It is possible that oxygen administered for longer daily durations in more uniformly severely ill individuals would prove to be beneficial.</P>
<P>With respect to oxygen supplementation during sleep in people with CF, it appears that hypoxemia can predictably be eliminated with variable degrees of hypercapnia resulting (<LINK REF="STD-Gozal-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gozal 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parsons-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Parsons 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spier-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Spier 1984</LINK>). Based on the levels of hypercapnia noted in studies, there is no strong reason to suspect clinically important untoward side effects in the short term. We cannot be entirely sanguine about the potential effects of oxygen supplementation in all individuals with CF and advanced lung disease. Attention to blood gas analysis would be warranted in such individuals. In people with advanced hypercapnia in CF, nasal ventilation during sleep has become a common therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moran-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moran 2007</LINK>). There is no evidence of a consistently demonstrable improvement in sleep quality in people with CF given oxygen supplementation. However, the lack of benefit in the three single night studies in hospital sleep laboratories may derive in part from the artificial nature of the sleep environment. Further study may be warranted to assess sleep quality with oxygen therapy in these participants.</P>
<P>People with CF with advanced lung disease typically have reduced exercise tolerance, a fact corroborated in the four studies reviewed (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKone 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nixon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nixon 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shah-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1997</LINK>). Reduced exercise tolerance could be related to the underlying condition or ventilatory limits. However, it could also be related to hypoxemia, which can be treated with oxygen therapy. There is evidence of modest enhancement of exercise capacity and duration with oxygen supplementation, especially in participants with more advanced lung disease (<LINK REF="STD-Marcus-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Marcus 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McKone 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nixon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Nixon 1990</LINK>). There is also a tendency for more hypercapnia during exercise when oxygen supplementation is administered, but once again, as with sleep, the degree of hypercapnia is unlikely to be of untoward clinical significance. In the one study that looked at recovery and subsequent exercise, people with CF do tend to recover more quickly when given oxygen supplementation after vigorous exercise and perform at a higher capacity with the next exercise challenge (<LINK REF="STD-Shah-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 1997</LINK>). If the findings in these studies all of which examine short-term oxygen use were corroborated in longer-term use of oxygen in individuals with CF, improved fitness, muscle mass and well-being might well result. Certainly, this hypothesis would be a worthy one for future study.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-08-06 09:12:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-05-29 10:52:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>To date, there is little evidence to support or oppose the long-term use of oxygen therapy to either reduce mortality or alleviate symptoms. The authors believe that no adequate study has examined this hypothesis with a rigorous enough study design to guide current prescribing practice. On the other hand, during sleep and exercise, there is evidence of modest improvements in oxygenation in hypoxemic people with CF with mild hypercapnia which probably has little clinical significance in the short term. Exercise capacity or duration or both are modestly improved in most participants. There is clearly a need for study of the potential benefit of long-term oxygen supplementation on the sleep quality and exercise parameters of individuals with CF.</P>
<P>Based on available data, oxygen therapy should be reserved for those individuals with objective evidence of hypoxemia, either at rest while awake or during either exercise or sleep. This review has found an absence of data on which to dictate the prescription of long-term oxygen therapy in people with CF with hypoxemia. In the subset of people with CF and documented nocturnal hypoxemia, oxygen therapy should be considered. In people with hypercapnia, assessment of the impact of oxygen supplementation on ventilation via capnometry may be indicated. In some of these individuals, nasal ventilation with oxygen supplementation during sleep may be a more optimal therapeutic choice. In people with CF with advanced lung disease and hypoxemia during exercise, the prescription of oxygen supplementation appears to prevent hypoxemia and has clear benefits regarding exercise capacity and duration. Although it is tempting to speculate that oxygen supplementation over time during exercise in people with CF with advanced lung disease might have cumulative benefits, there are no studies upon which to base this recommendation. Since there is some evidence that individuals with CF who have hypoxemia during exercise frequently have hypoxemia during sleep (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coffey-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coffey 1991</LINK>), overnight polysomnography should be considered in these individuals.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-08-06 09:12:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We recommend further multi-centre studies to determine a more precise role for both short-term and long-term limited (with exercise or during sleep) or continuous oxygen therapy in people with CF with hypoxemia. The studies included in this review were small and future studies should be adequately powered. For individuals with chronic hypoxemia, it would be of practical benefit to study the potential benefits of the long-term use of oxygen supplementation for the greater preponderance of each day (minimum of 16 hours per day). Regarding individuals with hypoxemia restricted to sleep, it would be beneficial to know if sleep quality improves in the home environment and whether oxygen supplementation improves survival, cardiopulmonary health, quality of life and nutrition without complications from hypercapnia. In individuals with hypoxemia during exercise, similarly it would be of interest to study the potential benefits of a rehabilitation program with oxygen supplementation compared to one without oxygen supplementation. Longitudinal studies would be expensive but would add weight to outcome measurement and allow for the many different confounders in this complex and multi-system disease.</P>
<P>The most recent trial included in the review was published in 2006, and we have not identified any relevant trials up to 2013. We therefore do not plan to update this review until the regular two-yearly searches of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register identifies any new evidence. </P>
