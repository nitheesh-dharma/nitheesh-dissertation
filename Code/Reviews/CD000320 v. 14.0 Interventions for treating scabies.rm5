<P>2007, Issue 3: A substantive update with new authors. We included nine new trials and excluded two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dunne-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dunne 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Macotela_x002d_Ruiz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Macotela-Ruiz 1996</LINK>) included in <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2000</LINK> after re-evaluation, as noted in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>'. The review has been rewritten and reformatted throughout, and the conclusions of the review have been updated to reflect the new trial evidence. We used more precise definitions in the 'Types of interventions' and separated the 'Types of outcome measures' into primary, secondary, and adverse events. Treatment failure in those clinically diagnosed and treatment failure in those microscopically confirmed are considered as separate outcome measures, while parasitological cure is no longer an outcome measure. We reformatted the search strategy section, but did not attempt to systematically search literature for adverse events. For data analysis, we used relative risks rather than odds ratios, and used a random-effects model for meta-analysis if significant heterogeneity was present. We used available-case analyses rather than intention-to-treat analyses using imputed data.</P>

<P>Scabies is a parasitic infection of the skin. It occurs throughout the world, but is particularly problematic in areas of poor sanitation, overcrowding, and social disruption, and is endemic in many resource-poor countries. The global prevalence of scabies is estimated at 300 million cases, but the level of infection varies between countries and communities. The female mite burrows into the skin to lay eggs which then hatch out and multiply. The infection can spread from person to person via direct skin contact, including sexual contact. It causes intense itching with eruptions on the skin. Various drugs have been developed to treat scabies, and herbal and traditional medicines are also used. The review of trials attempted to cover all these. The authors identified 22 small trials involving 2676 people, with 19 of the trials taking place in resource-poor countries. Permethrin appeared to be the most effective topical treatment for scabies, and ivermectin appeared to be an effective oral treatment. However, ivermectin is unlicensed for this indication in many countries. Adverse events such as rash, vomiting, and abdominal pain were reported, but the trials were too small to properly assess serious but rare potential adverse effects. No trials of herbal or traditional medicines were identified for inclusion.</P>

<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Results were presented as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals and data combined where appropriate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-09-06 17:07:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-two small trials involving 2676 people were included. One trial was placebo controlled, 18 compared two or more drug treatments, three compared treatment regimens, and one compared different drug vehicles.</P>
<P>Fewer treatment failures occurred by day seven with oral ivermectin compared with placebo in one small trial (55 participants). Topical permethrin appeared more effective than oral ivermectin (140 participants, 2 trials), topical crotamiton (194 participants, 2 trials), and topical lindane (753 participants, 5 trials). Permethrin also appeared more effective in reducing itch persistence than either crotamiton (94 participants, 1 trial) or lindane (490 participants, 2 trials). No difference was detected between permethrin (a synthetic pyrethroid) and a natural pyrethrin-based topical treatment (40 participants, 1 trial), and between permethrin and benzyl benzoate (53 participants, 1 trial), however both these trials were small.</P>
<P>No significant difference was detected in the number of treatment failures between crotamiton and lindane (100 participants, 1 trial), lindane and sulfur (68 participants, 1 trial), benzyl benzoate and sulfur (158 participants, 1 trial), and benzyl benzoate and natural synergized pyrethrins (240 participants, 1 trial); all were topical treatments. No trials of malathion were identified.</P>
<P>No serious adverse events were reported. A number of trials reported skin reactions in participants randomized to topical treatments. There were occasional reports of headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, and hypotension.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Topical permethrin appears to be the most effective treatment for scabies. Ivermectin appears to be an effective oral treatment. More research is needed on the effectiveness of malathion, particularly when compared to permethrin, and on the management of scabies in an institutional setting and at a community level.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">What is scabies?</HEADING>
<P>Scabies is an intensely itchy parasitic infection of the skin that is caused by the <I>Sarcoptes scabiei </I>mite. It occurs throughout the world, but is particularly problematic in areas of poor sanitation, overcrowding, and social disruption. The global prevalence of scabies is estimated at 300 million cases (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1984</LINK>), with large variations between countries. In the UK, no up-to-date robust prevalence data exist, but general practitioners recorded approximately 1200 new cases per year in the 1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Downs-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1999</LINK>). In resource-rich communities, scabies tends to occur in cyclical epidemics, particularly within institutional-living situations such as nursing homes (<LINK REF="REF-Scheinfeld-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheinfeld 2004</LINK>) or the army (<LINK REF="REF-Mimouni-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mimouni 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mimouni-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mimouni 2003</LINK>). There is some seasonal variation with incidence being greater in the winter than the summer, perhaps related to the tendency for more indoor overcrowding in colder weather (<LINK REF="REF-Downs-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1999</LINK>). In resource-poor communities, the occurrence pattern is quite different with the disease being endemic in many areas (<LINK REF="REF-Chosidow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chosidow 2000</LINK>). For example, the prevalence of scabies among the remote Aboriginal communities of Northern Australia is around 50% in children and 25% in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2002</LINK>). The prevalence of infection in a community is potentially influenced by changes in social attitudes, population movements, wars, misdiagnosis, inadequate treatment, and changes in the immune status of the population. Scabies infestation represents a considerable burden of ill health in many communities, and although the disease is rarely life threatening, it causes widespread debilitation and misery (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>The life cycle of <I>S</I>.<I> scabiei</I> begins with the pregnant female laying two to three eggs a day in burrows several millimetres to several centimetres in length in the stratum corneum (outermost layer) of the skin. After about 50 to 72 hours, larvae emerge and make new burrows. They mature, mate, and repeat this 10- to 17-day cycle. Mites usually live for 30 to 60 days (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Humans are the main reservoir for <I>S</I>.<I> scabiei</I> var. <I>hominis</I> (variety of the mite named to reflect the main host species). Scabies is usually spread person to person via direct skin contact, including sexual contact, though transfer via inanimate objects such as clothing or furnishings is also possible (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 2004</LINK>). The mite can burrow beneath the skin within 2.5 minutes, though around 20 minutes is more usual (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1984</LINK>). The level of infectiousness of an individual depends in part on the number of mites harboured, which can vary from just a single mite to millions (<LINK REF="REF-Chosidow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chosidow 2000</LINK>). Humans can also be transiently infected by the genetically distinct animal varieties of <I>S. scabiei </I>(eg var. <I>canis</I>), though cross infectivity is low (<LINK REF="REF-Fain-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fain 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walton 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinical infection with the scabies mite causes discomfort and often intense itching of the skin, particularly at night, with irritating papular or vesicular eruptions. While infestation with the scabies mite is not life threatening, the severe, persistent itch debilitates and depresses people (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1989</LINK>). The classical sites of infestation are between the fingers, the wrists, axillary areas, female breasts (particularly the skin of the nipples), peri-umbilical area, penis, scrotum, and buttocks. Infants are usually affected on the face, scalp, palms, and soles. Much of the itching associated with scabies is as a result of the host immune reaction, and symptoms can take several weeks to appear after initial infection in a person exposed to scabies for the first time. Symptoms appear after a much shorter interval (one to two days) after reinfestation (<LINK REF="REF-Arlian-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arlian 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>A more severe or 'crusted' presentation of infestation is associated with extreme incapacity and with disorders of the immune system, such as HIV infection. Clinically this atypical form of scabies presents with a hyperkeratotic dermatosis resembling psoriasis. Lymphadenopathy and eosinophilia can be present, but itching may be unexpectedly mild. Patients with crusted scabies may harbour millions of mites and are highly infectious (<LINK REF="REF-Meinking-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meinking 1995a</LINK>). The dermatological distribution of mites in such patients is often atypical (eg including the head), and treatment in hospital is often advised (<LINK REF="REF-Chosidow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chosidow 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Complications are few although secondary bacterial infection of the skin lesions by group A <I>Streptococcus pyogenes</I> or <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>, or both, can occur following repeated scratching, particularly in warmer climates (<LINK REF="REF-Meinking-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meinking 1995a</LINK>). Secondary infection with group A <I>Streptococcus</I> can lead to acute glomerulonephritis, outbreaks of which have been associated with scabies (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1989</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention</HEADING>
<P>Diagnosis on clinical grounds is usually made on a history of itching (particularly if contacts are also affected) and the finding of lesions in the classical sites. The diagnosis can in most cases be confirmed by microscopically identifying a mite, egg, or mite faeces in a skin scraping, or by extracting a mite from a burrow (<LINK REF="REF-Chosidow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chosidow 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Various treatments are available for scabies. These include sulfur compounds, which have been used for centuries; benzyl benzoate (first used in 1931); crotamiton (used since the late 1970s); hexachlorocyclohexane, which is also known as gamma benzene hexachloride or the commercial purified form lindane ('lindane' is used in this review) (available since 1948); malathion (used since the mid 1970s); permethrin (first licensed in 1985 by the US Food and Drug Administration); and oral ivermectin (first used in humans in the 1980s). A number of herbal remedies have also been proposed (<LINK REF="STD-Oladimeji-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Oladimeji 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alebiosu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Alebiosu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oladimeji-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oladimeji 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Serious adverse effects have been associated with the use of some antiscabietic treatments. Convulsions and aplastic anaemia have been reported with the use of lindane (<LINK REF="REF-Rauch-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rauch 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elgart-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elgart 1996</LINK>), and an increased risk of death amongst elderly patients has been reported with the use of ivermectin (<LINK REF="REF-Barkwell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barkwell 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence of cure ideally requires follow up for about one month. This allows time for lesions to heal and for any eggs and mites to reach maturity if treatment fails (ie beyond the longest incubation interval). Patients should be warned that itching may persist for one to two weeks after treatment, even if the mite is successfully eradicated (<LINK REF="REF-Buffet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buffet 2003</LINK>). Because of this delay in symptom relief it may sometimes be difficult to distinguish reinfestation from primary treatment failure.</P>
<P>Contacts of cases are usually advised to treat themselves at the same time as the case in order to reduce the risk of reinfestation (<LINK REF="REF-Orkin-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orkin 1976</LINK>). Prevention is based on principles common to most infectious diseases, that is, limitation of contact with the mite.</P>
<P>Using data from randomized controlled trials, this review examines the existing evidence of effectiveness of treatments for scabies.</P>

<P>All identified trials were entered into a trials register. MS and PJ independently applied the inclusion criteria to the potentially relevant trials. If a trial's eligibility was unclear, we attempted to contact the trial authors for further information. MS reassessed all included and excluded trials cited in the previous review version (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2000</LINK>). Where the review authors disagreed, the Co-ordinating Editor of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group was consulted, and a consensus reached among the three parties; this process was also used for assessing the risk of bias in trials, and extracting data. The trial reports were scrutinized to ensure that multiple publications from the same trial were included only once.

<P>Results were presented as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around these estimates. RRs less than one were taken to demonstrate a favourable outcome of the intervention of interest, and these are presented to the left of the line of no effect.</P>
<P>For those comparisons in which there were data from more than one trial we assessed heterogeneity by visually inspecting forest plots, calculating an I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, and carrying out a chi square test for heterogeneity.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-09-06 17:17:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of current treatments for scabies in order to inform practice and guide future research. The previous version of this review noted that clinicians faced considerable uncertainty when choosing the best treatment for scabies (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2000</LINK>). Ten years later the picture is a little clearer, but there are still considerable gaps in our knowledge.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Trial quality</HEADING>
<P>All 22 included trials were designed to test the effectiveness of one or more treatments for scabies. Methodological quality varied between trials. Only two trials described both adequate randomization sequence generation and adequate allocation concealment, and the majority of the reports described neither adequately. The blinding was absent, or the degree of blinding was unclear in ten of the 22 identified trials, and losses to follow up were greater than 20% of the enrolled participants in four of the trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effectiveness</HEADING>
<P>The results of this review suggest that, of the topical treatments for scabies, permethrin is most effective. Permethrin has been tested against topical crotamiton, topical lindane, and oral ivermectin in randomized controlled trials, and it appears to be superior to all three in terms of minimizing treatment failure in participants with a clinical diagnosis of scabies. In the one trial that tested permethrin against topical benzyl benzoate no difference in cure rate was detected, however this trial was small (53 participants) and the data used in the review related only to one week follow up.</P>
<P>In the subgroup of participants with microscopically confirmed scabies, permethrin was again superior to crotamiton, but there is uncertainty as to whether permethrin is superior to lindane. Permethrin also appears to be better at relieving itch than either crotamiton or lindane (itch was not reported as a separate outcome in the ivermectin versus permethrin trial). Unfortunately no trials comparing permethrin with either topical sulfur or topical malathion were identified; permethrin's relative effectiveness against these treatments therefore remains unknown.</P>
<P>In some countries natural pyrethrin-based topical treatments are available as an alternative to permethrin cream (<LINK REF="STD-Biele-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Biele 2006</LINK>). Pyrethrins are naturally occurring insecticidal compounds found in the <I>Compositae</I> family of plants (<LINK REF="REF-Wagner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 2000</LINK>), whereas permethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid analogue. Results from the two Italian trials included in this review suggest that pyrethrin is equivalent in effectiveness to both permethrin and benzyl benzoate.</P>
<P>Trials comparing crotamiton with lindane, lindane with sulfur, and sulfur with benzyl benzoate have all produced equivocal results, suggesting that there is no single most effective treatment out of these four topical options. In most countries the choice is in any case restricted, either due to lack of availability, or the lack of a licence for scabies.</P>
<P>Ivermectin is currently the only oral treatment for scabies that is in routine use. It appears to be more effective than both placebo and lindane, but less effective than permethrin. There was significant heterogeneity in the results of the five trials that compared ivermectin and benzyl benzoate, which may be explained by differences in drug regimen and length of follow up between the trials. After stratifying by drug regimen and length of follow up the relative effectiveness of ivermectin appeared to increase with increasing length of follow up. This may mean that ivermectin is slower in achieving cure than topical benzyl benzoate, however, this conclusion is rather speculative given these data.</P>
<P>An advantage of an oral antiscabietic treatment over a topical one is ease of use, particularly in hot humid climates, when engaging in mass treatment, or when treating children. However, ivermectin is not presently licensed for the treatment of scabies in most countries. Ivermectin's effectiveness, cost effectiveness, and safety in mass treatment in areas of high endemicity (preferably as a sustainable public health intervention) need to be further evaluated in larger trials of sufficient power.</P>
<P>Topical ivermectin has also been suggested to be effective after success in uncontrolled studies (<LINK REF="REF-Yeruham-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeruham 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Victoria-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Victoria 2001</LINK>). At present there is no commercially available topical ivermectin preparation available for the treatment of scabies, and randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate this potential new treatment option.</P>
<P>There are still no published reports of randomized controlled trials that test the effectiveness of malathion against either placebo or another drug, despite over 30 years passing by since a non-controlled study first suggested that the drug was effective (<LINK REF="STD-Hanna-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Hanna 1978</LINK>). The 2010 British National Formulary recommends malathion as the treatment of choice if permethrin is inappropriate (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2010</LINK>), despite the lack of evidence from randomized controlled trials. Such a trial comparing malathion with permethrin is needed to test their relative effectiveness.</P>
<P>We found trials of the herbal remedies toto soap (<LINK REF="STD-Alebiosu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Alebiosu 2003</LINK>) and lippia oil (<LINK REF="STD-Oladimeji-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Oladimeji 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oladimeji-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Oladimeji 2005</LINK>), but these trials did not meet the review's inclusion criteria. Both treatments look promising, but randomized controlled trials making direct comparisons with the existing best treatments are needed to assess their true relative effectiveness.</P>
<P>Treatment regimen was assessed in two trials. <LINK REF="STD-Maggi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Maggi 1986</LINK> found that a one-hour application of lindane reduced itch compared with a much longer four-day application; the authors suggested that the itch may, at least in part, have been due to a dermatitis caused by the lindane treatment itself. <LINK REF="STD-Schenone-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Schenone 1986</LINK> compared two different regimens using decamethrin, a pyrethroid insecticide in the same class as permethrin. All participants were cured in both groups. Decamethrin is not commercially available for the treatment of scabies and we found no trials that tested its effectiveness against other treatments. Decamethrin (as deltamethrin) is usually used as an agricultural insecticide and its safety as an antiscabietic medication has not been established (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The formulation of a topically applied product may influence its efficacy. For example, a 1% permethrin formulation marketed for the treatment of head lice appears to be less effective than the conventional antiscabietic 5% preparation, according to case reports (<LINK REF="REF-Cox-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 2000</LINK>). None of the trials included in this review directly compared different strength formulations of the same treatment.</P>
<P>One trial compared different vehicles for the same drug (<LINK REF="STD-Avila_x002d_Romay-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Avila-Romay 1991</LINK>). Cold cream as a treatment vehicle for sulfur may be more effective than pork fat, with fewer adverse events. For resource-poor countries this could be a cheap and safe option, which in some circumstances might also be more culturally acceptable.</P>
<P>This review did not seek to assess the relative cost effectiveness of the various treatments for scabies; however, large cost differences are apparent. In the UK, costs are: permethrin £5.51 per 30 g of cream, benzyl benzoate £0.50 per 100 mL, crotamiton £2.99 per 100 mL, and malathion £2.96 per 100 mL (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2010</LINK>). When lindane was marketed in the UK it was a fifth the cost of permethrin per treatment (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>We did not specifically attempt to assess the effectiveness of treatments for crusted scabies, and none of the included trials selected participants with this diagnosis. Caution should therefore be exercised in generalizing the results of this review to the treatment of patients with atypical severe scabies infection. This is an important area where more research is needed.</P>
<P>Caution should also be exercised in generalizing these results, which were obtained from trials that recruited individual participants (mostly in the outpatient setting), to the management of outbreaks in institutions. Given the burden of disease caused by scabies within institutions, such as long-term healthcare facilities, the inclusion of such patients in randomized controlled trials of effectiveness would be beneficial.</P>
<P>Mass treatment of a community in order to eradicate scabies has been tested in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dunne-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dunne 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bockarie-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bockarie 2000</LINK>), both of which used oral ivermectin. Unfortunately neither of these studies met the review's inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Bockarie-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bockarie 2000</LINK> was an uncontrolled trial, and <LINK REF="STD-Dunne-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dunne 1991</LINK> recruited participants on the basis of a diagnosis of onchocerciasis). Further research is needed to test the effectiveness, safety, and practicality of this approach to the management of scabies, particularly in areas of high prevalence.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Safety</HEADING>
<P>Serious adverse events leading to death or permanent disability were not reported in any of the included or excluded trials. This review did not seek to systematically review the literature on the safety of antiscabietic treatments, but a number of notable reports of serious adverse events that have been published elsewhere are discussed below.</P>
<P>Convulsions and aplastic anaemia have both been reported with the use of lindane (<LINK REF="REF-Rauch-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rauch 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elgart-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elgart 1996</LINK>); in some cases this being thought to be due to the application of the drug to non-intact skin. Lindane was withdrawn by the manufacturer from the UK market in 1996, but this was for commercial and not toxicological reasons. In 1995, the US Food and Drug Administration designated lindane as a second-line treatment due to its potential toxicity; only to be used in those who have failed to respond to, or who are intolerant of, other antiscabietic treatments (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ivermectin has been very widely used in the treatment of onchocerciasis (predominantly in adults) and even with repeated doses serious adverse effects have been rare (<LINK REF="REF-DeSole-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeSole 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pacque-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pacque 1990</LINK>). However, an increased risk of death among a group of elderly patients with scabies in a long-term care facility has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Barkwell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barkwell 1997</LINK>). Whether this was due to ivermectin or to interactions with other scabicides, including lindane and permethrin, or other treatments such as psychoactive drugs was not clear and there was considerable discussion of the validity of this report (<LINK REF="REF-Bredal-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bredal 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coyne-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coyne 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Diazgranados-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diazgranados 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reintjes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reintjes 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Rare adverse reactions have been reported with the use of both permethrin (dystonia, <LINK REF="REF-Coleman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 2005</LINK>) and natural pyrethrin (fatal asthma, <LINK REF="REF-Wagner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The relative purity of the active ingredients of certain topical treatments and their isomeric ratios may also affect drug toxicity. In particular, very little is known about the effects of exposure to different isomeric grades of permethrin. Clinical grade material is 25:75 cis isomer:trans isomer and agricultural grade is 40:60. The cis isomer has 10 times the acute toxicity and there could be dangers in people in resource-poor countries using agricultural-grade permethrin for treating human infestations (personal communication from Ian Burgess, Medical Entomology Centre, Cambridge). Similar problems have been reported with the inappropriate use of agricultural grade malathion for treating human infestations (<LINK REF="REF-Petros-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petros 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>A search of the WHO Adverse Drug Reaction Database in 1998 for a previous version of this review found reports of serious adverse drug reactions for convulsions (benzyl benzoate 4, crotamiton 1, lindane 38, malathion 2, permethrin 6) and death (benzyl benzoate 0, crotamiton 1, lindane 1, malathion 0, permethrin 5) (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2000</LINK>). A search for this update of the review of the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency database of suspected drug reactions found reports for convulsions (benzyl benzoate 1, crotamiton 0, lindane 3, malathion 0, permethrin 0, sulfur 0, ivermectin 1) and death (benzyl benzoate 0, crotamiton 0, lindane 1, malathion 0, permethrin 1 (intra uterine death), sulfur 0, ivermectin 3) (<LINK REF="REF-MHRA-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">MHRA 2006</LINK>). Extreme caution must be shown in interpreting these reports, as they are clearly influenced by the extent to which the products are used and by the quality of the reporting. Neither can a causal link be assumed for any of the reported events.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>On the basis of the available evidence from randomized controlled trials, topical permethrin appears to be the most effective treatment for scabies. Ivermectin appears to be an effective oral treatment, but in many countries it is not licensed for this indication.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Trials are needed to evaluate the relative effectiveness of malathion against permethrin, and the relative effectiveness of herbal treatments against existing treatments. The effectiveness of topical ivermectin also needs to be explored. The most appropriate treatment for the severe crusted form of scabies has not yet been established in randomized controlled trials. </P>
<P>Researchers should ensure that toxicity and safety outcomes are systematically collected in future trials as well as being notified through routine monitoring of adverse events in clinical practice. </P>
<P>Approaches to the control of outbreaks in institutions and public health programmes to control scabies in populations with high prevalence require evaluation.</P>
