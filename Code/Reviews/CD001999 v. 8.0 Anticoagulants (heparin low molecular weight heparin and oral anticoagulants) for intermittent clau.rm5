<P>Atherosclerosis is a disease of the arteries in which fatty deposits block the flow of blood. This can cause intermittent claudication, when cramping pain in the legs is brought on by exercise and relieved by rest. These fatty deposits can also cause serious blockages that lead to heart attacks and the need for amputation (surgical removal of the limb). Anticoagulants, such as heparin or warfarin, are drugs that prevent clotting and may help people with intermittent claudication. No new studies were included for this update. Seven studies with 802 participants were included in this review. The review of trials found that the benefit of heparin, LMWHs and oral anticoagulants for treatment of intermittent claudication has not been established while an increased risk of major bleeding events has been observed, especially with oral anticoagulants. There is no clear evidence to support the use of anticoagulants for intermittent claudication at this stage. More research is needed.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-05-06 10:07:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  A Broderick">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-14 13:40:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intermittent claudication (IC) is a symptom of lower limb atherosclerosis. The clinical manifestations of lower limb atherosclerosis depend on the extent and severity of the obstructive lesions and on the extent of the collateral circulation.</P>
<P>Four clinical stages are described according to Fontaine (<LINK REF="REF-Fontaine-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontaine 1954</LINK>), namely:<BR/>(1) asymptomatic arterial insufficiency;<BR/>(2) intermittent claudication, which is a symptom complex characterised by leg pain and weakness brought on by walking, with the disappearance of the symptoms following a brief rest;<BR/>(3) pain at rest;<BR/>(4) ulceration and gangrene.</P>
<P>Stages III and IV are also described as critical limb ischaemia in which the process endangers part, or all, of the extremity, and can lead to limb loss (amputation) (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1997</LINK>). The presence of lower limb atherosclerosis is an index of a diffuse atherosclerotic process and thus patients have an increased risk of cardiac and cerebrovascular complications (stroke and acute myocardial infarction) (<LINK REF="REF-Balkau-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balkau 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aims of treating lower limb atherosclerosis are to:</P>
<OL>
<LI>improve functional capacity (increase walking distance);</LI>
<LI>inhibit the local progression of atherosclerotic lesions;</LI>
<LI>reduce cardiac and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Conservative treatment may ameliorate the symptoms of IC and is based upon modification of risk factors for atherosclerosis, regular exercise and pharmacologic intervention. Pharmacologic interventions such as antithrombotic agents, i.e. antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants, may prevent the progression of atherosclerotic lesions by interfering with thrombotic complications. Thrombus formation seems to be an important factor in progression of atherosclerotic disease and in the conversion of events from chronic to acute (<LINK REF="REF-Fuster-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuster 1992</LINK>). The inhibition of thrombin formation provides a rationale for the use of anticoagulant drugs such as oral anticoagulants, heparin and low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs). The antithrombotic effect of these drugs could be beneficial in maintaining or improving functional capacity. A randomised trial has indicated a benefit of long term oral anticoagulants in improving survival rates after arterial reconstruction for lower limb atherosclerosis (<LINK REF="REF-Kretschmer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kretschmer 1992</LINK>). Thus, treatment with anticoagulants might reduce the incidence of major cardiovascular complications of atherosclerosis-related thrombosis in patients with IC.</P>
<P>The purpose of this review is to assess the evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulant drugs for the treatment of IC. This is an update of the review first published in 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-Cosmi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cosmi 2001</LINK>). </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of anticoagulant drugs (heparin, low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), oral anticoagulants) in patients with intermittent claudication (Fontaine stage II) (<LINK REF="REF-Fontaine-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontaine 1954</LINK>) in terms of improving walking capacity (i.e. pain-free walking distance or absolute walking capacity), mortality, cardiovascular events (acute myocardial infarction, sudden death and stroke), ankle/brachial pressure index, progression to surgery, amputation-free survival and side effects of these drugs.</P>
<P>We wished to test the following a priori hypotheses:<BR/>(1) Anticoagulants (either heparin or LMWHs or oral anticoagulants) are more efficacious than placebo in increasing pain-free or maximum walking distance.<BR/>(2) Anticoagulants (either heparin or LMWHs or oral anticoagulants) are more efficacious than alternative treatments in increasing pain-free or maximum walking distance.</P>

<P>Two types of studies were included:<BR/>(1) Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), i.e. those trials with a randomised generation of allocation sequences such as the use of random number tables, computer random number generator, coin tossing.<BR/>(2) Quasi-randomised controlled trials (QRCTs), i.e. those trials with quasi-randomised generation of allocation according to date of birth or case record number (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Priority was given to double-blind trials in which patients, care providers and outcome assessors were unaware of treatment allocation. Thus bias due to patient suggestion in claudication trials should be minimised (<LINK REF="REF-Waller-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waller 1989</LINK>). For the principal analysis, a trial was regarded as double blinded if the term "double blind" was used to describe it or if it was stated that outcome assessors, care providers and patients were blinded to treatment allocation (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). If treatments were not allocated in a double-blind fashion, the trials were considered eligible only in case of blinding of outcome assessors.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of articles</HEADING>
<P>Two authors (BC and EC) selected potentially eligible articles for inclusion in the review from data print-outs. A study was considered potentially eligible if it was a prospective trial with at least two concurrent comparison groups in which patients suffering from IC were allocated to a regimen with anticoagulant drugs (as defined above). In order to assure clinical relevance of article selection, eligibility for inclusion was checked by a third author (SC). Additional information was sought when possible from the investigators of all trials that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological quality of trials</HEADING>
<P>The methodological quality of each trial was assessed using a validated scale developed by Jadad, which includes appropriateness of randomisation and double blinding, a description of drop-outs and withdrawals. This scale consists of three items which contribute to a maximum score of five points (two points each for randomisation and double blinding, and one point for withdrawals and drop-outs), however, it assesses neither concealment of allocation, nor proportion and handling of drop-outs and withdrawals. Three or more points are required for a trial to be judged as being of high quality (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). Quality score was also assessed according to the criteria suggested in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Each trial was given an allocation score of A (clearly concealed), B (unclear if concealed) or C (clearly not concealed) and a summary score of A (low risk of bias), B (moderate risk of bias) or C (high risk of bias), according to the criteria indicated by the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>). Trials scoring A were included and those scoring C were excluded. For trials scoring B, an attempt was be made to obtain more information by contacting the authors. Assessment was done by two independent authors (BC, EC) with the third author (SC) resolving any disagreement.</P>
<P>For each trial, the number of patients originally allocated to each treatment was extracted from the data and an intention-to-treat analysis was performed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection</HEADING>
<P>Data were abstracted independently by two authors (BC and EC). Any discrepancies were resolved by the third author (SC). Primary authors were contacted to request additional information.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analyses</HEADING>
<P>All of the analyses were based on the intention-to-treat data from the individual clinical trials.</P>
<P>Treatment effects were defined as the differences of the mean changes of pain-free (PFWD) or maximum walking distances (MWD), from baseline to end of trial across treatment groups in metres. If time to onset of claudication symptoms or walking cessation only was provided, it was converted to walking distances in metres by multiplying the speed of the treadmill (metres per second) by the walking time (seconds). As a summary estimate of the treatment effect, the mean difference in metres (MDmetres) was calculated employing the inverse variance method, a fixed effect model described by Hald (<LINK REF="REF-Hald-1952" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hald 1952</LINK>), which summarises treatment effects in the same units as used in individual trials, i.e. metres. The major advantage of this is its comprehensibility, although the drawback is the underlying assumption that the outcome measures are standardised across trials, i.e. strictly speaking, individual trials must not only have the same units of measurement (metres), but also the same conditions of assessment such as intensity of walking tests, speeds and inclinations of the treadmills used. The MDmetres depends on the variance of changes of walking distances from baseline to end of trial in the individual treatment groups. If these measures were not provided, the approach by Follmann et al (<LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>) was adopted and we relied mainly on the respective test-statistics or the variances of individual baseline and end of trial walking distances. When the test statistic was not available, we computed it from the corresponding P value by using tables for the normal distribution.</P>

<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Antonicelli-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Antonicelli 1999</LINK>, after 18 months of treatment, the PFWD increased from 196 metres to 283 metres in the group on standard heparin, and from 196 metres to 247 metres in the placebo group.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-04-14 13:43:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anticoagulant drugs such as heparin, LMWHs and oral anticoagulants may have a role in the treatment of patients with intermittent claudication (IC). Their antithrombotic action might influence the progression of disease and the acute complications of thrombosis superimposed on chronic atherosclerotic lesions.</P>
<P>Our review was limited by our inability to obtain further information about methodological issues and data for several studies, due to the length of time since publication of the original trial reports. Thus, the primary analysis was based on only three high quality studies. Two of these studies evaluated oral anticoagulants and one study evaluated standard heparin. All the high quality studies were placebo-controlled randomised trials. One study evaluating fixed-dose subcutaneous heparin was double blinded. One study evaluating oral anticoagulants was single blinded due to the necessity of adjusting oral anticoagulant dosage on the basis of international normalised ratio (INR) results (<LINK REF="STD-Dettori-_x005b_APIC_x005d_-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dettori [APIC] 1989</LINK>), while the other study (<LINK REF="STD-de-Smit-1987" TYPE="STUDY">de Smit 1987</LINK>) was declared to be double blinded but no indication of dose adjustment was found in the placebo treated group on the basis of a sham INR.</P>
<P>In all studies IC was clinically diagnosed and patients were similar with regard to baseline characteristics such as age, sex and co-morbidity. However there was variation between patients' walking capacity, and thus of severity of disease, at baseline. One study evaluating oral anticoagulants also included Fontaine stage III and IV patients. The intensity of the walking test varied between studies and the baseline and follow up walking distances varied.</P>
<P>All studies lacked defined criteria for assessment of severity of bleeding events and for the diagnosis of cardiovascular events such as stroke, unstable angina and myocardial infarction.</P>
<P>The effect of anticoagulants on pain-free and maximum walking distance was properly evaluated in only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Antonicelli-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Antonicelli 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dettori-_x005b_APIC_x005d_-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dettori [APIC] 1989</LINK>), but we could not extract or obtain data from the study evaluating oral anticoagulants (<LINK REF="STD-Dettori-_x005b_APIC_x005d_-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dettori [APIC] 1989</LINK>). No significant difference was observed between heparin treatment and control groups for either pain-free walking distance or maximum walking distance at the end of treatment.</P>
<P>No study reported on revascularisation or amputation-free survival rates. No study reported a significant effect on either overall mortality or cardiovascular events. The pooled odds ratios were not significant for either outcome.</P>
<P>We analysed data on bleeding events separately for oral anticoagulants and heparin and LMWHs. Major and minor bleeding events were significantly more frequent in the groups treated with oral anticoagulants when compared with the control groups, with a non-significant increase in fatal bleeding events. This could be attributed to the high therapeutic range used in one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-de-Smit-1987" TYPE="STUDY">de Smit 1987</LINK>) (INR 2.8 to 4.8).<BR/>
<BR/>Neither major nor minor bleeding events were reported in the studies evaluating LMWHs (<LINK REF="STD-Calabr_x00f2_-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Calabrò 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mannarino-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mannarino 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palmieri-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Palmieri 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tesi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Tesi 1989</LINK>). No major bleeding events were reported in the study evaluating heparin, but a non-significant increase in minor bleeding events was reported.</P>
<P>The WAVE study (<A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1403191135246152735158893723057&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Wave-2007">Wave 2007</A>), which we could not include in the review, randomised patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) to combination therapy with an antiplatelet agent and an oral anticoagulant agent (INR 2.0 to 3.0) or to antiplatelet therapy alone. This study showed that the composite primary outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 132 of 1080 patients receiving combination therapy (12.2%) and in 144 of 1081 patients receiving antiplatelet therapy alone (13.3%) (relative risk (RR), 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.16; P = 0.48), while the secondary outcome myocardial infarction, stroke, severe ischaemia, or death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 172 patients receiving combination therapy (15.9%) as compared with 188 patients receiving antiplatelet therapy alone (17.4%) (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.12; P = 0.37). Life-threatening bleeding occurred in 43 patients receiving combination therapy (4.0%) as compared with 13 patients receiving antiplatelet therapy alone (1.2%) (RR 3.41; 95% CI 1.84 to 6.35; P &lt; 0.001).</P>
<P>A meta-analysis on the role of anti-thrombotic drugs in the medical management of intermittent claudication has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Girolami-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Girolami 1999</LINK>). The authors' conclusions were similar to ours. A clear benefit of anticoagulants for IC could not be established due to the low methodological quality of the available studies. The authors of the <A HREF="http://www.archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1403191135246152735158893723057&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Wave-2007">Wave 2007</A> study also conducted a meta-analysis of nine trials involving 4889 patients with PAD in several stages also including IC evaluating oral anticoagulants (<LINK REF="REF-WAVE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WAVE 2006</LINK>). Oral anticoagulants may reduce mortality and graft occlusion but increase major bleeding compared with no treatment. Compared with aspirin, oral anticoagulants do not appear to reduce mortality (odds ratio (OR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.29), although the CI are wide, or graft occlusion (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.06), and major bleeding is increased (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.69). Compared with aspirin, oral anticoagulants used together with aspirin appears to increase mortality (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.12); may reduce graft occlusion (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.12), and major bleeding is increased (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.57).</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-04-14 13:40:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The benefit of heparin, low molecular weight heparins and oral anticoagulants for treatment of intermittent claudication has not been established, while an increased risk of major bleeding events has been observed, especially with oral anticoagulants. There is no clear evidence to support the use of anticoagulants for intermittent claudication at this stage.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-04-14 13:40:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further trials of anticoagulants for intermittent claudication are required to determine their effectiveness. These trials should be methodologically adequate in terms of sample sizes, drug dosages, duration of follow up, and clinically relevant outcomes such as rate of cardiovascular events, amputation-free survival, revascularisation procedures and mortality. The evaluation of functional improvements should be based on mean changes in pain-free and maximum walking distances. Bleeding events should also be assessed on the basis of standardised criteria.</P>
