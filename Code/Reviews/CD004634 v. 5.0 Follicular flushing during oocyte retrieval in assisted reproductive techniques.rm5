These interventions are known as assisted reproductive technology (ART). One of these interventions is in vitro fertilisation (IVF), or a variant of IVF, called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). During IVF, controlled ovarian stimulation uses hormones to stimulate multiple eggs to develop in the ovaries. After ovarian stimulation, a needle guided by ultrasound is used to collect these eggs that are inside follicles. Instead of using only suction to obtain the contents of follicles (aspiration), it has been proposed that flushing the follicles after aspiration may lead to collection of more eggs and higher chances of becoming pregnant and having a baby. This technique is called follicular flushing.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>This review included ten research studies that randomly assigned a total of 928 women to follicular aspiration alone or follicular flushing after aspiration. To see if there was a difference between the two techniques, we wanted to look at the main results of live birth rate (number of babies born per 1000 women) and miscarriage rate (number of miscarriages per 1000 women). We carried out a comprehensive search to identify all relevant research in this field available in July 2017.</P><P><B>Key results</B></P><P>Three studies reported on the main result of live birth rate and noted that follicular flushing probably has little or no effect on live birth rate compared with aspiration alone (moderate-quality evidence). This suggests that if a live birth rate of approximately 41% is seen with aspiration alone, the equivalent live birth rate with follicular flushing is likely to lie between 29% and 52%. None of the included studies reported on the miscarriage rate.</P><P>Studies also found that follicular flushing probably makes little or no difference in the number of eggs retrieved, the number of embryos, or the clinical pregnancy rate compared with aspiration alone. Although the quality of evidence was very low, it appears that follicular flushing takes much longer to perform than aspiration alone. Evidence was insufficient to permit any firm conclusions with respect to adverse events or safety.</P><P>More research is needed to find out whether any specific patient groups would benefit from follicular flushing.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>The quality of evidence for the main outcome of live birth rate was moderate. The quality of evidence for the other outcomes ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations of included studies were lack of blinding (the process whereby women participating in the trial as well research staff are not aware of the intervention used), inconsistency (differences between different studies), and imprecision (insufficient data).</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-03-20 22:28:35 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-03-20 22:28:20 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Follicular aspiration under transvaginal ultrasound guidance is routinely performed as part of assisted reproductive technology (ART) to retrieve oocytes for in vitro fertilisation (IVF).

We also searched the trial registries ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to identify ongoing and registered trials up to 4 July 2017. We reviewed the reference lists of reviews and retrieved studies to identify further potentially relevant studies.</P></ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY><ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-03-20 22:28:34 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared follicular aspiration and flushing with aspiration alone in women undergoing ART using their own gametes.

A third review author was consulted if required. We contacted study authors as required. We analysed dichotomous outcomes using Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and a fixed-effect model, and we analysed continuous outcomes using mean differences (MDs) between groups presented with 95% CIs. We examined the heterogeneity of studies via the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. We assessed the quality of evidence by using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-03-17 21:47:09 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included ten studies, with a total of 928 women. All included studies reported outcomes per woman randomised. We assessed no studies as being at low risk of bias across all domains and found that the main limitation was lack of blinding. Using the GRADE method, we determined that the quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low, and we identified issues arising from risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency.</P><P>Comparing follicular flushing to aspiration alone revealed probably little or no difference in the live birth rate (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.56; three RCTs; n = 303; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 30%; moderate-quality evidence). This suggests that with a live birth rate of approximately 41% with aspiration alone, the equivalent live birth rate with follicular flushing is likely to lie between 29% and 52%. None of the included studies reported on the primary outcome of miscarriage rate.</P><P>Data show probably little or no difference in oocyte yield (MD -0.28 oocytes, 95% CI -0.64 to 0.09; six RCTs; n = 708; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). Very low-quality evidence suggests that the duration of oocyte retrieval was longer in the follicular flushing group than in the aspiration only group (MD 166.01 seconds, 95% CI 141.96 to 190.06; six RCTs; n = 714; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 88%). We found no evidence of a difference in the total number of embryos per woman randomised (MD -0.10 embryos, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.15; two RCTs; n = 160; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 58%; low-quality evidence) and no evidence of a difference in the number of embryos cryopreserved (meta-analysis not possible). Data show probably little or no difference in the clinical pregnancy rate (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.46; five RCTs; n = 704; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 49%; moderate-quality evidence). Only two studies reported on adverse outcomes: One reported no differences in patient-reported adverse outcomes (depression, anxiety, and stress), and the other reported no differences in needle blockage, vomiting, and hypotension. No studies reported on safety.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-03-17 21:48:21 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review suggests that follicular flushing probably has little or no effect on live birth rates compared with aspiration alone.

The technique involves ovarian stimulation, monitoring of follicular growth, oocyte recovery, sperm preparation and insemination, embryo culture, embryo transfer, and luteal support. Other variables, particularly female age, can significantly affect the number of oocytes retrieved and the success rate of ART.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-03-17 22:03:39 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Once maturity of the follicles is achieved, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or recombinant luteinising hormone (rLH) is used to trigger oocyte maturation. Oocyte pickup is performed approximately 36 hours later. Technical details of oocyte recovery vary between fertility centres, especially with regard to type of anaesthesia (local, sedation, or general), type of aspiration needle (wide or narrow bore, single or double channel), route of retrieval (transvaginal or abdominal), aspiration alone or aspiration with follicular flushing, type of flushing medium, and the collecting system.</P><P>The number of embryos obtained is dependent on the number of oocytes retrieved (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2000</LINK>). To maximise the number of oocytes recovered, investigators have suggested follicular aspiration followed by a single 2-mL flush (<LINK REF="STD-el-Hussein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">el Hussein 1992</LINK>). Waterstone and Parson reported that use of double-lumen needles and flushing yielded 20% more oocytes (<LINK REF="STD-Waterstone-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Waterstone 1992</LINK>). On the contrary, other studies found no difference in number of oocytes collected, fertilisation rate, embryo quality, or pregnancy rate (<LINK REF="STD-Haydardedeoglu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haydardedeoglu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haydardedeoglu-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Haydardedeoglu 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kara-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kara 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kingsland-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kingsland 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knight-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Knight 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Levens-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Levens 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mok_x002d_Lin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mok-Lin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-von-Horn-2017" TYPE="STUDY">von Horn 2017</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Tan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1992</LINK> suggested that aspiration without flushing reduced operative time and decreased the amount of anaesthetic required.</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-03-17 22:05:30 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The place of follicular flushing during oocyte recovery in ART remains uncertain. Benefits of flushing include the possibility of obtaining more oocytes and subsequently more embryos. Whether this translates into higher pregnancy and live birth rates remains controversial. However, flushing may be associated with longer operative time and larger amounts of required anaesthetics and analgesics. From the patient's perspective, it could also mean higher costs. Moreover, anaesthetics such as propofol could have detrimental effects on embryos, at least in the mouse model (<LINK REF="REF-Janssenwillen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janssenwillen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tatone-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tatone 1998</LINK>). Flushing could remove some of the follicular cells that might have an important endocrine luteal support function.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-03-17 22:07:00 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The prevalence of subfertility and the significant costs of assisted conception make assessment of ART techniques imperative to establish which are more effective in terms of attaining a live birth, and which are cost-beneficial, with a view toward improving treatment outcomes.

Evidence was insufficient to allow firm conclusions with respect to adverse events or safety.</P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-03-18 10:04:34 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Only three of the included studies reported on live birth rate, which is likely to be the most important outcome for women embarking on fertility treatment. Furthermore, none of the studies reported a miscarriage rate. No studies reported on this review's subgroup of maternal age. Additionally, only one study focussed on women with poor ovarian reserve (<LINK REF="STD-Haydardedeoglu-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Haydardedeoglu 2017</LINK>). However all participants in this study also had a poor response to ovarian stimulation; we decided to include these patients in this subgroup as it represents the more clinically relevant subgroup. Two studies looked at poor response to ovarian stimulation and noted no difference in the live birth rate (<LINK REF="STD-Haydardedeoglu-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Haydardedeoglu 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mok_x002d_Lin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mok-Lin 2013</LINK>); we deemed this to be high-quality evidence.</P><P>Most of the included papers focussed on oocyte yield and four studies incorporated data that could not be used for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Haines-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Haines 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kingsland-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kingsland 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mok_x002d_Lin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mok-Lin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1992</LINK>). Nevertheless, these studies reported no change in oocyte yield with follicular flushing. In addition, two studies incorporated data on duration of oocyte retrieval that could not be incorporated into the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Kingsland-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kingsland 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1992</LINK>). These data mirrored data presented in the meta-analysis, suggesting increased procedure length with follicular flushing. It appears that follicular flushing is associated with a significantly longer procedure compared with aspiration alone. Nevertheless, these data should be interpreted with caution, as we found a high degree of heterogeneity, mainly attributable to one study (<LINK REF="STD-Haydardedeoglu-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Haydardedeoglu 2017</LINK>).</P><P>Although the included studies provided few data on adverse events, <LINK REF="STD-von-Horn-2017" TYPE="STUDY">von Horn 2017</LINK> reported no differences in depression, anxiety, or stress in either group, and <LINK REF="STD-Tan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 1992</LINK> reported no differences in needle blockage, vomiting, or hypotension. Data on adverse events should be interpreted with caution, as individual studies are relatively small and event rates low.</P><P>A study carried out in the early 2000s reported that more than 50% of fertility units routinely perform follicular flushing (<LINK REF="STD-Knight-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Knight 2001</LINK>). Although changes in clinical practice are usually slow to be implemented, this Cochrane review provides evidence suggesting no benefit for follicular flushing and hence would encourage a shift away from it.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-03-18 10:06:19 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>For this review, we identified and included only published data originating from ten RCTs and incorporating 928 women. We have summarised in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> risk of bias for individual studies.</P><P>We rated the quality of evidence on the basis of GRADE criteria. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate, with issues arising as the result of lack of blinding, imprecision, and inconsistency. Although lack of blinding was a feature of several included studies, and blinding of the operator was not possible, we suggest that this was not essential, as study outcomes were objective. See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-03-18 10:07:21 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Review authors aimed to reduce the risk of publication bias by conducting systematic searches of multiple databases and trial registries to identify ongoing studies. We contacted trial authors to request further information when applicable, and unfortunately we did not receive a response in all cases. Subgroup analysis was not possible for subgroups of age and poor ovarian reserve owing to lack of data. As prespecified, we performed sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome of live birth. We were unable to construct a funnel plot owing to the small number of included studies.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-03-18 10:12:35 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Older studies, which were not randomised controlled trials (RCTs), have suggested that oocyte yield increases with follicular flushing. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Bagtharia-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bagtharia 2005</LINK> found 40% of oocytes in primary aspiration without flushing of the follicle and retrieved up to 82% of oocytes with two flushes and up to 97% with four flushes. <LINK REF="STD-Mendez-Lozano-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mendez Lozano 2008</LINK> observed a 46.8% oocyte recovery rate with aspiration only compared with 84.6% with additional follicular flushing in 165 infertile women with low ovarian reserve who were undergoing 271 consecutive minimal stimulation IVF cycles.</P><P>However, data from this systematic review contradict these findings and show no increase in oocyte yield nor in the more clinically relevant outcome of live birth. In addition, the two most recent systematic reviews on this topic, which date to 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roque-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roque 2012</LINK>), reported findings that are similar to those presented in this systematic review. Both of these systematic reviews incorporated studies that we have included here.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-04-19 08:44:53 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-04-19 08:44:53 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review suggests that follicular flushing probably has little or no effect on live birth rates compared with aspiration alone. None of the included trials reported on effects of follicular aspiration and flushing on the miscarriage rate. Data suggest little or no difference between follicular flushing and aspiration alone with respect to oocyte yield, total embryo number, or number of cryopreserved embryos. In addition, follicular flushing probably makes little or no difference in the clinical pregnancy rate. Evidence was insufficient to allow any firm conclusions with respect to adverse events or safety.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-03-18 10:16:40 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Although the body of evidence against use of follicular flushing is growing, further research predominantly centred on population selection and outcomes is required. Study design could be improved by blinding participants, the embryologist, and those assessing outcomes.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Population</HEADING><P>Most research so far has not focussed on specific populations that may benefit from follicular flushing. Future directions could involve focussing on populations such as older women, women with poor ovarian reserve, and women with a poor response to ovarian stimulation.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING><P>Although more recent studies have focused on the outcome of live birth rate, this remains an underreported outcome. Further research should make this the primary outcome.
