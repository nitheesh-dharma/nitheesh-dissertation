<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-06 09:54:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endodontic treatment of root canals or root canal treatment is a procedure that is very frequently performed in dentistry with the aim of retaining teeth. As a treatment option it offers an alternative to dental extraction and is carried out on teeth in which irreversible pulpitis has led to necrosis (death) of the dental pulp (nerve) (<LINK REF="REF-Keenan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keenan 2005</LINK>). Orthograde root canal treatment entails drilling into the pulp chamber (inside) of the tooth which contains the dental pulp. The pulp, which may be inflamed or necrotic, is removed and the root canal is then cleaned and prepared. The objectives of root canal treatment are the elimination of infection from the root canal and the prevention of its reinfection by the filling and sealing of the root canal space (<LINK REF="REF-Gagliani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gagliani 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-_x00d8_rstavik-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ørstavik 1998</LINK>). It is generally recognised that a cleaner root canal system should lead to improved outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Gutarts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutarts 2005</LINK>) and that successful root canal treatment may prolong the retention of the tooth as a functional unit in the mouth.</P>
<P>Some of the problems encountered in the cleaning and shaping of root canals have led to a wide search for innovative materials, instruments and techniques which might permit a faster and more effective way of achieving a disinfected and debris-free canal which is ready for obturation. Apart from the traditional methods of using hand and rotary instruments, more recent techniques have employed lasers, non-instrumentation techniques (NIT) and methods using ultrasonic or sonic equipment. A number of studies have shown that endodontic files which have been activated by ultrasonic energy may be effective in both the cleaning and shaping of root canal systems (<LINK REF="REF-Tinaz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tinaz 2006</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment options</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hand instruments</HEADING>
<P>Hand instrumentation is the traditional method of preparation of root canals and involves the use of files to clean and shape the root canals with the aim of removing pulpal tissue, infected debris and some of the inner, infected pulpal dentine. Copious irrigation to flush the canal accompanies this instrumentation. The second aim is to shape the canal in such a way that it can be filled completely to prevent the canal becoming further infected by microorganisms. These aims should be attained without changing the central location of the canal and its relationship to the surrounding root structures. In addition debris should not be forced through the root apex into the surrounding tissues.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Ultrasonic devices</HEADING>
<P>Ultrasound is sound energy with a frequency over 20,000 oscillations per second. The first commercial machine designed for cleaning and disinfecting the root canal was introduced 30 years ago (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 1976</LINK>).<BR/>This process involves the activation of a file with ultrasound which can then be used to both clean and shape the dentine of the root canal. Ultrasound instrumentation can be used either as a primary cleaning and shaping technique or after hand instrumentation. These two techniques require the active movement by the operator of the ultrasonic instrument against the canal walls. Alternatively ultrasonic energy can be applied passively, without any contact with the canal walls and without any movement of the instrument after activation is started (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1999</LINK>). It was previously believed that it was necessary to move the file in the canal, however more recently microscopic observation suggests that we only need to bring ultrasonic energy into the canal and that even a straight, blunt passive wire will transmit enough energy to clean the canal further.<BR/>A well recognised difficulty that can arise during ultrasonic preparation is accurate control of the cutting effect of the file (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Sluis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Sluis 2005</LINK>). Ultrasonic instrumentation may also result in lengthier treatment time and the operational and maintenance requirements of the ultrasonic equipment may add substantially to the treatment cost.<BR/>Whilst it is perceived that the improved cleaning that occurs with ultrasonic instruments may lead to improved outcomes for endodontically treated teeth complications may arise.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Hand instrumentation plus ultrasonic instrumentation</HEADING>
<P>Hand instrumentation of the root canal requires irrigation to remove the debris produced. This irrigation may be carried out with fine syringes introduced into the canal orifice. Alternatively ultrasonic irrigation of the root canal can be performed with or without simultaneous ultrasonic instrumentation (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Sluis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Sluis 2007</LINK>). Using ultrasonic devices in addition to hand instrumentation presupposes that benefits may accrue and outcomes may be improved when compared to hand instruments alone.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Complications</HEADING>
<P>Successful root canal treatment is characterised by the absence of symptoms and clinical signs and any radiographical signs of periodontal involvement (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2002</LINK>). The success of orthograde root canal treatment depends on a series of variables some related to the pre-operative conditions of the tooth as well as the endodontic procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Gagliani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gagliani 2005</LINK>), with curved canals posing possibly some of the most significant challenges. Complications can be broadly divided into four categories:<BR/>(1) Blockage, ledging, and loss of working length in the canal<BR/>(2) Deviations from the normal canal or root anatomy<BR/>(3) Excessive or inadequate canal preparation<BR/>(4) Breakage of instruments in the canal.</P>
<P>Root canal treatment has a good degree of success (approximately 80%) (<LINK REF="REF-Kojima-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kojima 2004</LINK>). However, root canal treatment can fail, usually for technical reasons. Even when technical excellence is attained, failure may still ensue from remaining infection, because of the nature of the root canal and the inability of current methods to completely clean and fill all its niches (<LINK REF="REF-Nair-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nair 2004</LINK>). If ultrasonic instrumentation is able to more effectively clean the root canal then it may be expected to result in improved treatment outcomes. Ultrasonic irrigation of the root canal can be performed with or without simultaneous ultrasonic instrumentation. Passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI) can be an important supplement for cleaning the root canal system and, compared with traditional syringe irrigation, is capable of removing more organic tissue, bacteria and dentine debris from the root canal. It has been claimed that PUI is more efficient in cleaning canals than ultrasonic irrigation with simultaneous ultrasonic instrumentation (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Sluis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Sluis 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>Grading of the selected studies was to be done independently by two review authors (JN and Vinicius Pedrazzi (VP)) and every trial reporting a randomised controlled trial was to be assessed according to the criterion grading system described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 4.2.6 (updated September 2006) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). These gradings were to be compared and any inconsistencies in the interpretation of inclusion criteria and their significance to the selected studies were to be resolved by discussion. </P>
<P>The following parameters of methodological quality were to be assessed and used to help in evaluating the risk of bias within any included studies.<BR/>(1) Randomisation: graded as adequate (A) or unclear (B). Adequate (A) included one of the following methods of randomisation: computer generated or table of random numbers.<BR/>(2) Concealment of allocation: graded as adequate (A), unclear (B) or inadequate (C). Adequate (A) methods of allocation concealment included either central randomisation or sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes. This criterion would be considered inadequate (C) if there was an open allocation sequence and the participants and trialists could foresee the upcoming assignment.<BR/>(3) Blinding of outcomes assessment: whether persons assessing the outcome of care were aware of which treatment the participant received. It was to be graded as yes, no or unclear (detection bias).<BR/>(4) Handling of withdrawals and losses: was there a clear description given of losses to follow up. It would be graded as yes (A), unclear (B) or no (C) (attrition bias).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines were to be followed for data synthesis and any data extracted were to be analysed using Review Manager (RevMan) and reported as suggested in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>4.2.6 (updated September 2006) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>).<BR/>No relevant randomised controlled trials were found for this review and therefore no data were available. However, the following methods will be used for data synthesis if further studies are identified in subsequent updates of this review.<BR/>Results of clinically and statistically homogeneous trials will be pooled to provide estimates of the efficacy of the interventions only if the included studies had similar interventions received by similar participants. The fixed-effect or random-effects models will be used as appropriate for the synthesis and meta-analysis of any quantitative data.<BR/>We plan to assess clinical homogeneity by examining the characteristics of the studies, the similarity between the types of participants, the interventions and the outcomes.<BR/>Statistical homogeneity will be assessed using a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test and the I<SUP>2</SUP> test where I<SUP>2 </SUP>values over 50% indicate moderate to high heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).<BR/>An attempt will be made to assess publication bias using a funnel plot, only if a sufficient number of randomised controlled trials are identified (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).<BR/>In the absence of a sufficient number of clinically homogeneous trials or insufficient data for pooling, the review would conclude with a descriptive analysis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>If a sufficient number of relevant studies had been retrieved we had intended conducting sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our review results by repeating the analysis with the following adjustments: exclusion of studies with unclear or inadequate allocation concealment and unclear or inadequate blinding.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Successful endodontic treatment is largely dependant on the complete removal of all necrotic tissue remnants and on the overall reduction in number of bacterial organisms in the root canal. Careful preparation, shaping and subsequent obturation of the root canal are essential steps in the process.<BR/>However, due to the complex nature and irregularity of root canal anatomy the process of cleaning and shaping can be very time consuming and laborious. Although ultrasonic instrumentation for root canal treatment would appear to offer several advantages over the traditional method of hand instrumentation, the use of ultrasonically driven instruments has not been universally accepted. <BR/>The majority of studies that were examined had been conducted on extracted teeth and the only clinical trials retrieved which compared ultrasonic with hand instrumentation had assessed outcomes which were not relevant for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Burleson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Burleson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carver-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Carver 2007</LINK>). This noticeable absence of trials rather highlights the necessity for investigators in future trials to ensure they identify and report not only clinically relevant outcomes but also those that are of importance to patients.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There are no published or ongoing randomised controlled trials relevant to this review question, so in the absence of any high level reliable evidence clinicians should base their decisions on clinical experience, individual circumstances and in conjunction with patients' preferences where appropriate. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-08-06 10:17:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many of the trials that were examined in this review compared the cutting efficiency and other characteristics of hand files with ultrasonically activated files, and the most frequently reported outcomes were expressed as debris indices, sterility and bacterial counts and overall cleanliness of prepared canals. However, the general perception of ultrasonic instrumentation as a major technological advancement in endodontics and its apparent superiority for primary instrumentation of root canals does not appear to have been confirmed in these trials. Many of the limitations, as well as some of the possible applications, of ultrasonic instrumentation used alone for root canal treatment are well recognised, but there would appear to be a need for further research which focuses on ways in which these applications, in particular improved debridement in less accessible canals, can be used as an adjunct to hand instrumentation.<BR/>Future research should include more trials carried out in vivo with outcomes which are patient-centred as listed in the primary outcomes for this review, and trials which are robust, well designed and reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">http://www.consort-statement.org/</A>).<BR/>
