<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>In the past, women have been cared for and supported by other women during labour and birth, and have had someone with them throughout, which we call &#8216;continuous support&#8217;. However, in many countries more women are giving birth in hospital rather than at home. This has meant continuous support during labour has become the exception rather than the norm. The aim of this Cochrane Review was to understand the effect of continuous support on a woman during labour and childbirth, and on her baby. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question (search date: October 2016).</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Research shows that women value and benefit from the presence of a support person during labour and childbirth. This support may include emotional support (continuous presence, reassurance and praise) and information about labour progress. It may also include advice about coping techniques, comfort measures (comforting touch, massage, warm baths/showers, encouraging mobility, promoting adequate fluid intake and output) and speaking up when needed on behalf of the woman. Lack of continuous support during childbirth has led to concerns that the experience of labour and birth may have become dehumanised.</P>
<P>Modern obstetric care frequently means women are required to experience institutional routines. These may have adverse effects on the quality, outcomes and experience of care during labour and childbirth. Supportive care during labour may enhance physiological labour processes, as well as women's feelings of control and confidence in their own strength and ability to give birth. This may reduce the need for obstetric intervention and also improve women's experiences.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We found 26 studies that provided data from 17 countries, involving more than 15,000 women in a wide range of settings and circumstances. The continuous support was provided either by hospital staff (such as nurses or midwives), or women who were not hospital employees and had no personal relationship to the labouring woman (such as doulas or women who were provided with a modest amount of guidance on providing support). In other cases, the support came from companions of the woman's choice from her own network (such as her partner, mother, or friend).</P>
<P>Women who received continuous labour support may be more likely to give birth 'spontaneously', i.e. give birth vaginally with neither ventouse nor forceps nor caesarean. In addition, women may be less likely to use pain medications or to have a caesarean birth, and may be more likely to be satisfied and have shorter labours. Postpartum depression could be lower in women who were supported in labour, but we cannot be sure of this due to the studies being difficult to compare (they were in different settings, with different people giving support). The babies of women who received continuous support may be less likely to have low five-minute Apgar scores (the score used when babies&#8217; health and well-being are assessed at birth and shortly afterwards). We did not find any difference in the numbers of babies admitted to special care, and there was no difference found in whether the babies were breastfed at age eight weeks. No adverse effects of support were identified. Overall, the quality of the evidence was all low due to limitations in study design and differences between studies.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>Continuous support in labour may improve a number of outcomes for both mother and baby, and no adverse outcomes have been identified. Continuous support from a person who is present solely to provide support, is not a member of the woman's own network, is experienced in providing labour support, and has at least a modest amount of training (such as a doula), appears beneficial. In comparison with having no companion during labour, support from a chosen family member or friend appears to increase women's satisfaction with their experience. Future research should explore how continuous support can be best provided in different contexts.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-05-19 10:09:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Historically, women have generally been attended and supported by other women during labour. However, in hospitals worldwide, continuous support during labour has often become the exception rather than the routine.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-06-23 12:32:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary objective was to assess the effects, on women and their babies, of continuous, one-to-one intrapartum support compared with usual care, in any setting. Secondary objectives were to determine whether the effects of continuous support are influenced by:</P>
<P>1. Routine practices and policies in the birth environment that may affect a woman's autonomy, freedom of movement and ability to cope with labour, including: policies about the presence of support people of the woman's own choosing; epidural analgesia; and continuous electronic fetal monitoring.</P>
<P>2. The provider's relationship to the woman and to the facility: staff member of the facility (and thus has additional loyalties or responsibilities); not a staff member and not part of the woman's social network (present solely for the purpose of providing continuous support, e.g. a doula); or a person chosen by the woman from family members and friends;</P>
<P>3. Timing of onset (early or later in labour);</P>
<P>4. Model of support (support provided only around the time of childbirth or extended to include support during the antenatal and postpartum periods);</P>
<P>5. Country income level (high-income compared to low- and middle-income).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-01 13:38:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included a total of 27 trials, and 26 trials involving 15,858 women provided usable outcome data for analysis. These trials were conducted in 17 different countries: 13 trials were conducted in high-income settings; 13 trials in middle-income settings; and no studies in low-income settings. Women allocated to continuous support were more likely to have a spontaneous vaginal birth (average RR 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 1.12; 21 trials, 14,369 women; <I>low-quality evidence</I>) and less likely to report negative ratings of or feelings about their childbirth experience (average RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.79; 11 trials, 11,133 women; <I>low-quality evidence</I>) and to use any intrapartum analgesia (average RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.96; 15 trials, 12,433 women). In addition, their labours were shorter (MD -0.69 hours, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.34; 13 trials, 5429 women; <I>low-quality evidence</I>), they were less likely to have a caesarean birth (average RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.88; 24 trials, 15,347 women; <I>low-quality evidence</I>) or instrumental vaginal birth (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.96; 19 trials, 14,118 women), regional analgesia (average RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99; 9 trials, 11,444 women), or a baby with a low five-minute Apgar score (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.85; 14 trials, 12,615 women). Data from two trials for postpartum depression were not combined due to differences in women, hospitals and care providers included; both trials found fewer women developed depressive symptomatology if they had been supported in birth, although this may have been a chance result in one of the studies (<I>low-quality evidence</I>). There was no apparent impact on other intrapartum interventions, maternal or neonatal complications, such as admission to special care nursery (average RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.25; 7 trials, 8897 women; <I>low-quality evidence</I>), and exclusive or any breastfeeding at any time point (average RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.16; 4 trials, 5584 women; <I>low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses suggested that continuous support was most effective at reducing caesarean birth, when the provider was present in a doula role, and in settings in which epidural analgesia was not routinely available. Continuous labour support in settings where women were not permitted to have companions of their choosing with them in labour, was associated with greater likelihood of spontaneous vaginal birth and lower likelihood of a caesarean birth. Subgroup analysis of trials conducted in high-income compared with trials in middle-income countries suggests that continuous labour support offers similar benefits to women and babies for most outcomes, with the exception of caesarean birth, where studies from middle-income countries showed a larger reduction in caesarean birth. No conclusions could be drawn about low-income settings, electronic fetal monitoring, the timing of onset of continuous support or model of support.</P>
<P>Risk of bias varied in included studies: no study clearly blinded women and personnel; only one study sufficiently blinded outcome assessors. All other domains were of varying degrees of risk of bias. The quality of evidence was downgraded for lack of blinding in studies and other limitations in study designs, inconsistency, or imprecision of effect estimates.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-03 15:40:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Continuous support during labour may improve outcomes for women and infants, including increased spontaneous vaginal birth, shorter duration of labour, and decreased caesarean birth, instrumental vaginal birth, use of any analgesia, use of regional analgesia, low five-minute Apgar score and negative feelings about childbirth experiences. We found no evidence of harms of continuous labour support. Subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution, and considered as exploratory and hypothesis-generating, but evidence suggests continuous support with certain provider characteristics, in settings where epidural analgesia was not routinely available, in settings where women were not permitted to have companions of their choosing in labour, and in middle-income country settings, may have a favourable impact on outcomes such as caesarean birth. Future research on continuous support during labour could focus on longer-term outcomes (breastfeeding, mother-infant interactions, postpartum depression, self-esteem, difficulty mothering) and include more woman-centred outcomes in low-income settings.</P>

<P>Historically and cross-culturally, women have been attended and supported by other women during labour and birth. However, since the middle of the twentieth century, in many countries most women gave birth in hospital rather than at home, and continuous support during labour has become the exception rather than the routine. Concerns about dehumanisation of women's birth experiences (in high-, middle-, and low-income countries) have led to calls for a return to continuous, one-to-one support by women for women during labour (<LINK REF="REF-Klaus-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klaus 2002</LINK>). Research has demonstrated that women benefit from and value the presence of a support person during labour, to provide psychological, physical, emotional, informational and practical support (<LINK REF="REF-Kabakian_x002d_Khasholian-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabakian-Khasholian 2015</LINK>). This support person may act as an advocate for the woman, for example by helping to communicate her preferences to a health worker, and also provides encouragement, reassurance, and physical comfort. A support person may also help to communicate to the woman about her progress through labour, suggest coping techniques, and support her decision-making. Two World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend a companion of the woman's choice during labour and childbirth, to improve labour outcomes and women's satisfaction with services (<LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 2016</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-06-17 05:01:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Common elements of continuous support during childbirth include emotional support (e.g. continuous presence, reassurance and praise), information about labour progress and advice regarding coping techniques, comfort measures (e.g. comforting touch, massage, warm baths/showers, encouraging mobility, promoting adequate fluid intake and output) and advocacy (e.g. helping the woman to articulate her wishes to others). The period of support for this intervention varies greatly across studies and contexts. For example, some doula programs may initiate support during the pregnancy, provide continuous support during labour and childbirth, and provide support through three months postpartum. Other programs focus specifically on facility-based care, and continuous support is provided from around the time of admission through the birth. Definitions for what constitutes "continuous" support vary across trials and contexts. For example, "continuous" is defined as "no interruption" (<LINK REF="STD-Langer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Langer 1998</LINK>), "minimum of 80% of the time" (<LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 2002</LINK>), and "as continuously as possible" (<LINK REF="STD-Hofmeyr-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hofmeyr 1991</LINK>) across three large trials in this review.</P>
<P>For the purposes of this review, we have defined continuous support as some combination of comfort measures, emotional support, provision of information, and advocacy on behalf of the woman, provided from at least early labour (before 6 cm dilation) or within one hour of hospital admission (for admission with greater than or equal to 6 cm dilation), through until at least the birth, and provided by a person whose sole responsibility is to provide support to the woman, as continuously as practical in a given context.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-05-23 13:48:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two complementary theoretical explanations have been offered for the effects of labour support on childbirth outcomes. Both explanations hypothesise that labour support enhances labour physiology and mothers' feelings of control and competence, reducing reliance on medical interventions. The first theoretical explanation considers possible mechanisms when companionship during labour is used in stressful, threatening and disempowering clinical birth environments (<LINK REF="STD-Hofmeyr-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hofmeyr 1991</LINK>). During labour, women may be uniquely vulnerable to environmental influences; modern obstetric care frequently subjects women to institutional routines, high rates of intervention, unfamiliar personnel, lack of privacy and other conditions that may be experienced as harsh. These conditions may have an adverse effect on the progress of labour and on the development of feelings of competence and confidence; this may in turn impair adjustment to parenthood and establishment of breastfeeding, and increase the risk of postpartum depression. The provision of support and companionship during labour may to some extent buffer such stressors.</P>
<P>The second theoretical explanation does not focus on a particular type of birth environment. Rather, it describes two pathways - enhanced passage of the fetus through the pelvis and soft tissues, as well as decreased stress response - by which labour support may reduce the likelihood of operative birth and subsequent complications, and enhance women's feelings of control and satisfaction with their childbirth experiences (<LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 2002a</LINK>). Enhanced fetopelvic relationships may be accomplished by encouraging mobility and effective use of gravity, supporting women to assume their preferred positions and recommending specific positions for specific situations. Studies of the relationships among fear and anxiety, the stress response and pregnancy complications have shown that anxiety during labour is associated with high levels of the stress hormone epinephrine in the blood, which may in turn lead to abnormal fetal heart rate patterns in labour, decreased uterine contractility, a longer active labour phase with regular well-established contractions and low Apgar scores (<LINK REF="REF-Lederman-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lederman 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lederman-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lederman 1981</LINK>). Furthermore, individual interventions (e.g. labour induction, epidural anaesthesia, caesarean birth) and a cascade of interventions throughout labour may disrupt hormonal physiology and introduce risks to the woman or her baby, both in the short and long term (<LINK REF="REF-Buckley-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buckley 2015</LINK>). Emotional support, information and advice, comfort measures and advocacy may reduce anxiety and fear and associated adverse effects during labour.</P>
<P>Continuous support has been viewed by some as a form of pain relief, specifically, as an alternative to epidural analgesia (<LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 2002</LINK>), because of concerns about the deleterious effects of epidural analgesia, including on labour progress (<LINK REF="REF-Anim_x002d_Somuah-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anim-Somuah 2011</LINK>). Many labour and birth interventions routinely involve, or increase the likelihood of, co-interventions to monitor, prevent or treat adverse effects, in a "cascade of interventions". Continuous, one-to-one support has the potential to limit this cascade and therefore, to have a broad range of different effects, in comparison to usual care. For example, if continuous support leads to reduced use of epidural analgesia, it may in turn involve less use of electronic fetal monitoring, intravenous drips, synthetic oxytocin, drugs to combat hypotension, bladder catheterisation, vacuum extraction or forceps, episiotomy and less morbidity associated with these, and may increase mobility during labour and spontaneous birth (<LINK REF="REF-Caton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caton 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anim_x002d_Somuah-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anim-Somuah 2011</LINK>) and impact the experience of giving birth.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-06-17 05:07:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A systematic review examining factors associated with women's satisfaction with the childbirth experience suggests that continuous support can make a substantial contribution to women's satisfaction. When women evaluate their experience, four factors predominate: the amount of support from caregivers, the quality of relationships with caregivers, being involved with decision-making and having high expectations or having experiences that exceed expectations (<LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 2002a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clarification of the effects of continuous support during labour, overall and within specific circumstances, is important in light of public and social policies and programs that encourage this type of care. For example, the Congress in Uruguay passed a law in 2001 decreeing that all women have the right to companionship during labour. In several low- and middle-income countries (including China, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe), the Better Births Initiative promotes labour companionship as a core element of care for improving maternal and infant health (<LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-2016a" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 2016a</LINK>). In many low-income countries, women are not permitted to have anyone with them during labour and birth. Efforts to change policies in these settings have led to questions about the effectiveness of support from spouses/partners or other support people of the woman's own choosing, particularly in settings where the cost of paid companions (e.g. doulas) would be prohibitive.</P>
<P>In North America, and increasingly in many other areas of the world, the services of women with special training in labour support have become available. Most commonly known as doula (a Greek word for 'handmaiden'), this new member of the caregiver team may also be called a labour companion, birth companion, labour support specialist, labour assistant or birth assistant. A number of North American organisations offer doula training, certification and professional support; according to one estimate more than 50,000 people have received this training to date (P Simkin, personal communication). Some North American hospitals have begun to sponsor doula services. In a recent national survey of childbearing women in the United States, 6% of respondents indicated that they had used doula services during their most recent labours (<LINK REF="REF-Declercq-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Declercq 2013</LINK>). Many associations for doulas have been established in high-income countries, including DONA International, Doula UK, NCT Doula, British Doula, Childbirth International, Australian Doulas, Australian Doula College and Europoean Doula Network, among others. Doula services are usually paid for out-of-pocket, and therefore affordable to affluent, higher-educated women only. However, a meta-analysis conducted by <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 1996a</LINK> showed that socially disadvantaged populations, such as low-income women, could benefit more from doula support. Maternal healthcare systems in dozens of high- and low- to middle-income countries throughout the world are developing new traditions for supportive female companionship during labour (<LINK REF="REF-Pascali_x002d_Bonaro-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascali-Bonaro 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Questions have arisen about the ability of employees (such as nurses or midwives) to provide effective labour support, in the context of modern institutional birth environments (<LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 1997</LINK>). For example, nurses and midwives often have simultaneous responsibility for more than one labouring woman, spend a large proportion of time managing technology and keeping records, ensure adherence to institutional practices and protocols, and begin or end work shifts in the middle of women's labours. They may work in short-staffed environments or lack labour support skills.</P>
<P>Companions chosen by a woman from her own network, such as spouses/partners and female relatives, usually have little experience in providing labour support and are often themselves in need of support when with a loved one during labour and birth. As they are frequently available to assume the role, often without extra cost to families or health systems, it is important to understand their effectiveness as providers of continuous labour support.</P>
<P>In addition to questions about the impact of the type of provider of labour support, there are other questions about the effectiveness of support, including its impact under a variety of environmental conditions, and whether its effects are mediated by when continuous support begins (early versus active labour).</P>
<P>There are also questions about the relative impact of different models of labour support; specifically, effects of support provided only during the intrapartum period versus effects of an extended model with support during the antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum periods.</P>
<P>Childbearing women, policy-makers, payers of health services, health professionals and facilities and those who provide labour support all need evidence about the effects of continuous support, overall and under specific conditions.</P>

Our plan was: we would adjust their sample sizes or standard errors using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> (Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6 as appropriate) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we had used ICCs from other sources, we planned to report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. In future updates of this review, if we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.</P>

<P>We noted levels of attrition for included studies. In future updates, if more eligible studies are included, we will explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau, I and Chi statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if I was greater than 30% and either Tau was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (&lt; 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity. If we identified substantial heterogeneity (&gt; 30%), we planned to explore it by pre-specified subgroup analysis.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged to be sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary is treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. When we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% CIs, and the estimates of Tau and I.</P>

<P>Where we identified substantial heterogeneity, we investigated the source using subgroup analyses. We considered whether an overall summary was meaningful, and if it was, we used random-effects analysis to produce the effect. We added two new subgroup analyses on the model of support received (D) and country income level where trials were conducted (E).</P>
<P>We planned the following subgroup analyses.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(A) Three subgroup analyses that concern characteristics of the childbirth environment</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Trials in settings in which women were permitted to be accompanied by one or more support persons of their own choosing compared with trials in which accompaniment was not permitted.</LI>
<LI>Trials conducted in settings in which epidural analgesia was available compared with trials in settings in which it was unavailable.</LI>
<LI>Trials in which there was a policy of routine electronic fetal heart rate monitoring compared with trials in settings in which continuous electronic fetal monitoring was not routine.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(B) One subgroup analysis that concerns characteristics of the providers of labour support</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Trials in which the caregivers were employees of the institution, compared with trials in which the caregivers were not employees and were not members of the woman's social network, compared with trials in which the providers were not employees and were lay people chosen by the participants (e.g. spouse/partner, friend, close relative).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(C) One subgroup analysis that concerns differences in the timing of onset of continuous support</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Trials in which continuous labour support began prior to or during early labour (as defined by trial authors), compared with trials in which continuous support began in active labour.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(D) One subgroup analysis that concerns the model of support received</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Trials in which support was provided solely during the intrapartum period, compared with trials in which extended support was provided during the antenatal and postpartum periods, in addition to continuously during the intrapartum period.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(E) One subgroup analysis that concerns the country income level</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Trials conducted in high-income settings, compared with trials conducted in low- or middle-income settings.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The following outcomes were used in subgroup analyses:</P>
<UL>
<LI>spontaneous vaginal birth;</LI>
<LI>negative ratings of the birth experience;</LI>
<LI>postpartum depression;</LI>
<LI>admission to special care nursery;</LI>
<LI>exclusive or any breastfeeding at any time point, as defined by trial authors;</LI>
<LI>any analgesia/anaesthesia;</LI>
<LI>synthetic oxytocin during labour; and</LI>
<LI>caesarean birth.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The five primary outcomes and three common labour intervention outcomes were used in the subgroup analyses. While normally subgroup analyses are restricted to primary outcomes, we also included the outcome of caesarean birth, because there is widespread concern about escalating caesarean rates worldwide, and subgroup analyses could be helpful to policy makers in decisions about the provision of continuous labour support.</P>
<P>We assessed subgroup differences by interaction tests available in RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We reported the results of subgroup analyses quoting the Chi statistic and P value, and the interaction test I value.</P>
<P>Because few of the trial reports contained all of the information needed for the above subgroup analyses, we contacted the trial authors in an attempt to verify the presence/absence of routine electronic fetal monitoring (EFM), hospital policy regarding the presence of a support person, the presence/absence of epidural analgesia and timing of onset of continuous support. We excluded some studies included in the primary comparisons from the subgroup analyses concerning the use of EFM, presence/absence of epidural analgesia, hospital policy regarding the presence of a support person, because their status was unknown. For tests of differences between these subgroups, we recalculated the overall analysis by including only the studies in which these characteristics were known.</P>
<P>We were unable to carry out subgroup analysis for subgroup (C) timing of onset of continuous support because we could not sufficiently categorise trials according to this subgroup, and in subgroup (D) there were only data for one outcome.</P>

<P>We considered 23 outcomes. Between one and 24 trials contributed to the analysis of each outcome. Sensitivity analyses, conducted by removing the trials (all of which were small) with a high likelihood of selection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Bruggemann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bruggemann 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kashanian-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kashanian 2010</LINK>) did not alter the conclusions. According to our pre-specified criteria, there was statistical heterogeneity in all but three outcomes (instrumental vaginal birth, low five-minute Apgar score, and low postpartum self-esteem). Inspection of the forest plots did not suggest sources of heterogeneity. For the three outcomes postpartum depression, delayed initiation of breastfeeding and difficulty mothering, this statistical heterogeneity confirmed our conclusion that based on clinical heterogeneity a summary statistic would not yield meaningful results (discussed further below). We report the results of fixed-effect analyses for instrumental vaginal birth, low five-minute Apgar score, and low postpartum self-esteem (the latter only contained one trial), and random-effects analyses for all other outcomes in which summary statistics were computed.</P>

<OL>
<LI>Spontaneous vaginal birth: In 13 trials (12,672 women), epidural analgesia was routinely available (average RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.10). In six trials (1546 women) epidural analgesia was not routinely available (average RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.19). Chi for the subgroup comparison = 1.38, P = 0.24, <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>. There was no evidence of a difference between subgroups.</LI>
<LI>Negative ratings of or negative views about the birth experience: In nine trials (10,404 women) epidural analgesia was routinely available (average RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.86). In two trials (774 women) epidural analgesia was not routinely available (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.63). Chi for the subgroup comparison = 7.10, P = 0.008, <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>. Continuous support produced more positive feelings about birth experience regardless of epidural availability; however, the difference was clearly greater in women unable to access epidural anaesthesia. The subgroup difference was still apparent even when we omitted the two trials where we had analysed the data as reciprocals (<LINK REF="STD-Bruggemann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bruggemann 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2006</LINK>), test for subgroup differences: Chi = 15.32, P &lt; 0.0001.</LI>

<LI>Admission to special care nursery: In five trials (8380 women) epidural analgesia was routinely available (average RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.13). In two trials (517 women) epidural analgesia was not routinely available (average RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.88). Chi for the subgroup comparison = 4.51, P = 0.03, <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>. There was a modest subgroup difference for this outcome. Babies of women who did not have access to epidurals and had continuous support were less likely to be admitted to the special care nursery. Similar numbers of babies were admitted to special care in the continuous support and usual care groups when the women had access to epidurals.</LI>

In eight trials (2149 women), epidural analgesia was not routinely available (average RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.72). In two very small trials (34 women and 100 women), we were unable to determine if epidural analgesia was routinely available (average RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.09). Chi for the subgroup comparison = 12.03, P = 0.002, <LINK REF="CMP-003.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.8</LINK>. Continuous support did not make a clear difference on rates of caesarean section compared with usual care in women who had epidurals available to them. However, there was a clear difference between this subgroup and women not able to have an epidural. Continuous support had a greater effect in reducing the rate of caesarean sections when women were not able to have epidurals.</LI>

This subgroup analysis is difficult to interpret but it appears that continuous support probably increases the likelihood of women having a spontaneous vaginal birth regardless of EFM.

<LI>Spontaneous vaginal birth: In nine trials (10,813 women) the support was provided by a member of the hospital staff (average RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.09). In six trials (2035 women) the support was provided by a woman who was not part of the hospital staff nor part of the woman's social network (average RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.26). In six trials (1620 women), the support was provided by a member of the woman's social network (average RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.11).

The largest effect, favouring continuous support, was observed in the group of women supported by people not employed by the hospital or chosen by the women, for example, doulas, although heterogeneity is high within this outcome. A smaller effect size was seen with support given by hospital staff. The difference in spontaneous vaginal birth numbers between usual care and continuous care for women who chose their companion was not clear.</LI>
<LI>Negative ratings of or negative views about the birth experience: in four trials (8145 women) support providers were hospital staff (average RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.03).

There appears to be evidence of a subgroup difference between the groups of women supported by hospital staff, and those supported by non-staff, not chosen by the women herself. For reducing caesarean section rates, the effect was greater for women being supported by a companion who they did not choose and were not hospital staff. Continuous support by hospital staff did not make a clear difference.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-01 14:26:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included a total of 27 trials and summarises data from 26 trials involving 15,858 women, conducted in hospital settings in 17 countries under a wide variety of circumstances. Continuous one-to-one support was given by providers with a variety of experiences, through having given birth themselves or education or both, and practice as nurses, midwives, doulas or childbirth educators, or by the woman's spouse or partner, female relative or close friend. </P>
<P>In the primary comparison, women who were allocated to continuous one-to-one support were more likely to have a spontaneous vaginal birth (<I>low-quality evidence</I>) and less likely to have any intrapartum analgesia or to report negative ratings of or negative feelings about the birth experience (<I>low-quality evidence</I>). In addition, these women had shorter labours (<I>low-quality evidence</I>), were less likely to have a caesarean birth (<I>low-quality evidence</I>) or instrumental vaginal birth, regional analgesia, or a baby with a low five-minute Apgar score. Data from two trials for postpartum depression were not combined due to differences in women, hospitals and care providers included; both trials found fewer women developed depressive symptomatology if they had been supported in birth, although this may have been a chance result in one of the studies (<I>low-quality evidence</I>). There was no apparent impact on other intrapartum interventions, maternal or neonatal complications, or breastfeeding, such as admission to special care nursery (<I>low-quality evidence</I>), and exclusive or any breastfeeding at any time point, as defined by trial authors (<I>low-quality evidence</I>). This review did not identify any adverse effects of continuous labour support. This form of care appears to confer important benefits without attendant risks. The results of earlier versions of this review prompted organisations in Canada, the UK and the USA to issue practice guidelines, advocating continuous support (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AWHONN-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">AWHONN 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MIDIRS-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">MIDIRS 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-Intrapartum-Care--2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE Intrapartum Care 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-_x005b_SOGC_x005d_-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee [SOGC] 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 2016</LINK>). The results of the primary comparison in the current review offer continued justification for such practice guidelines.</P>
<P>The subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution. Individually, each should be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating, particularly when the sample size in one subgroup was much smaller than in another. However, taken in their totality, the consistency of the patterns suggests that the effectiveness of continuous intrapartum support may be enhanced or reduced by policies and practices in the birth setting and by the nature of the relationship between the provider of continuous support and labouring woman.</P>
<P>We chose three aspects of the birth environment - routine use of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM), availability of epidural analgesia and policies about the presence of additional support people of the woman's own choosing - as proxies for environmental conditions that may mediate the effectiveness of labour support. This review cannot answer questions about the mechanisms whereby settings with epidural analgesia limit the effectiveness of labour support. The impact of epidural analgesia may be direct (<LINK REF="REF-Anim_x002d_Somuah-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anim-Somuah 2011</LINK>) or indirect, as part of the 'cascade of interventions' described in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK>. The effects of a policy of routine EFM are less clear, possibly because we were unable to obtain information about EFM policies for several of the trials. Women who were not permitted to have companions with them in labour, benefited more from continuous support than those in settings that permitted their own companions, in the form of fewer caesarean sections and more spontaneous vaginal births. Labour support appears to be effective in reducing the adverse consequences of the fear and distress associated with labouring alone in an unfamiliar environment. A report of a qualitative component of one of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Langer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Langer 1998</LINK>), aptly titled "Alone, I wouldn't have known what to do", provides further justification for this argument.</P>
<P>Effects of continuous labour support may vary by provider characteristics. Divided loyalties, additional duties besides labour support, self-selection and the constraints of institutional policies and routine practices may all have played a role in the apparently limited effectiveness of members of the hospital staff. Childbirth environments influence the healthcare professionals who work in them as well as labouring women and their support people. Furthermore, while women often want and benefit from the presence of selected members of their social network, the support of partners and others with whom they have a longstanding relationship is qualitatively different and more complex than that of a woman who is experienced and often trained to provide labour support and who has no other role other than to provide support. Members of a woman's social network may be less experienced with childbirth and have their own needs relating to the woman, baby and childbirth process, compared to someone in a doula role. An early trial of labour support with partners present found that women received more support from their partners when a doula was present to guide them, and the partners themselves reported more support (<LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 1989)</LINK>. While continuous labour support appears to be more effective in achieving desirable clinical outcomes and fewer negative experiences when it is provided by someone in a doula role (e.g. caregivers who are not employees of an institution and thus have no obligation to anyone other than the labouring woman) and who have an exclusive focus on this task, support from a member of the woman's social network is effective in reducing women's negative birth experiences.</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis of trials conducted in high-income countries compared with trials conducted in middle-income countries suggests that continuous labour support offers similar benefits to women and babies for most outcomes, with the exception of caesarean birth, where studies from middle-income countries showed a larger reduction in caesarean birth. It should be noted that only two included studies were conducted in lower-middle income countries (Guatemala (<LINK REF="STD-Klaus-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Klaus 1986</LINK>), and Nigeria (<LINK REF="STD-Morhason_x002d_Bello-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Morhason-Bello 2009</LINK>)), so conclusions about the effect of continuous support for women and babies in the poorest countries is limited but worthy of further exploration.</P>
<P>There remains relatively little information about the effects of continuous intrapartum support on mothers' and babies' health and well-being in the postpartum period, and none of the included studies contributed to the proposed subgroup analysis to compare extended to intrapartum-only models of continuous support.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-06-19 08:53:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies included in this review are from a diverse range of geographical locations (Oceania, Europe, Africa, South America, North America, Middle East and Asia) and country-income levels, ranging from low- to high-income countries. However, only two trials were conducted in lower-middle income countries. Although we included data from 26 studies, there were diverse interventions among these studies, ranging from providing support only during active labour to providing support across the pregnancy, labour, childbirth and postpartum periods.</P>
<P>Many of the studies in this review included only women with uncomplicated pregnancies, nulliparous women or both. Nulliparous women are an important group to target as they are by definition less experienced with the childbirth process compared to multiparous women, but there is a gap in the evidence related to multiparous women and women with complicated pregnancies.</P>

<P>We assessed included studies at varying levels of risk of bias (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). None of the studies blinded women or staff due to the nature of the intervention and only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Isbir-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Isbir 2015</LINK>) attempted to fully blind the outcome assessors. We used <A HREF="https://gradepro.org/">GRADEpro</A> software to assess the quality of evidence contributing to GRADE outcomes for the main review comparison (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Evidence contributing to all GRADE outcomes (spontaneous vaginal birth, negative rating of/negative feelings about birth experience, postpartum depression, admission to special care nursery, exclusive or any breastfeeding at any time point, as defined by trial authors, labour length, and caesarean birth) were graded <I>low quality.</I> Evidence was downgraded for lack of blinding in studies (it is not possible to blind study participants or personnel to a continuous support intervention) and other limitations in study designs, inconsistency, or imprecision of effect estimates.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-07-01 13:50:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We followed the review process recommended by Cochrane. We obtained and reviewed all potentially relevant studies identified from the search results, resolving any disagreements by discussion. Potential bias in the review process should be minimal: two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted the data. We resolved discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we consulted another review author. Review author GJ Hofmeyr was the author of a study included in this review. He was not involved in extracting data from the trials which he had authored. For some outcomes, such as exclusive breastfeeding and negative rating of or negative feelings about the birth experience, some trials reported the outcome in the opposite way. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Hodnett-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hodnett 2002</LINK> reported "not breastfeeding at all" at six weeks postpartum and <LINK REF="STD-Bruggemann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bruggemann 2007</LINK> reported satisfaction with care received and <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 2006</LINK> overall rating of birth experience. We calculated the reciprocals for these two outcomes so that they could be included in analyses. We acknowledge that this is not ideal and so performed additional sensitivity analyses to omit studies with reciprocal data to ensure that this made no difference to the overall result. Sensitivity analyses excluding reciprocal data for these two outcomes made no difference to the overall results, although some differences were observed in terms of subgroup analyses, as reported in the results section.</P>

<P>There are no other Cochrane Reviews that assess continuous support for women during childbirth.</P>
<P>A non-Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Steel-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steel 2015</LINK>) used critical integrative review methods to explore professional doulas supporting and caring for women. This review provided a descriptive analysis of workforce issues in professional doula care, role and skills of professional doulas, physical outcomes of professional doula care, and social outcomes of professional doula care, while noting several methodological weaknesses across the body of evidence.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-01 14:30:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-07-01 14:30:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Continuous support during labour may improve outcomes for women and infants, including increased spontaneous vaginal birth, shorter duration of labour, and decreased caesarean birth, instrumental vaginal birth, use of any analgesia, use of regional analgesia, low- five-minute Apgar score and negative feelings about childbirth experiences. We found no evidence of harms of continuous labour support. Subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution, and considered as exploratory and hypothesis generating, but evidence suggests continuous labour support with certain provider characteristics (support from someone with a doula role), in settings in which epidural analgesia was not routinely available, in settings where women were not permitted to have companions of their choosing with them in labour (e.g., spouse/partner, mother, friend), and in middle-income country settings, may have a favourable impact on outcomes such as caesarean birth.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-06-19 08:56:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There remains relatively little information about the effects of continuous intrapartum support on mothers' and babies' health and well-being in the postpartum period, and thus trials across all types of settings, which include a focus on longer-term outcomes for the woman and baby, would be helpful. In particular, exploring longer-term outcomes related to exclusive or any breastfeeding, difficulty mothering, low-self esteem, and unsatisfactory mother-infant interactions would help to better understand the impact of continuous support outside the time period of labour, childbirth and the immediate postpartum period. Relatedly, given the rising rates of caesarean birth globally, future research could consider exploring targeted continuous support interventions for nulliparous women, to reduce the risk of first caesarean birth.</P>
<P>This review update included six new outcomes not previously reported. These outcomes were designed to be woman-centric, promote the inclusion of women's experiences of care as important aspects of quality of care, and ensure that women's choices, autonomy and control are respected. Woman-reported measures of the experience and outcomes of maternal and newborn care are essential for a full evaluation of maternity care practices and systems. The inclusion of these outcomes is aligned with the World Health Organization (WHO) vision for quality of care for pregnant women and newborns (<LINK REF="REF-Tun_x00e7_alp-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunalp 2015</LINK>). We hope that the inclusion of these outcomes in this review will encourage researchers, policy-makers, clinicians and other key stakeholders to consider the importance of measuring and promoting woman-centred care. A mixed-methods systematic review concluded that women across the world may experience mistreatment during childbirth, including physical abuse (slapping, hitting, pinching), verbal abuse, stigma and discrimination, lack of supportive care, neglect and denial of autonomy (<LINK REF="REF-Bohren-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohren 2015</LINK>). It is possible that continuous support for women during childbirth could help reduce mistreatment during childbirth and promote respectful maternity care, as a labour companion could act as an advocate for the woman and potentially safeguard against mistreatment. Further research could explore the impact of labour companionship on mistreatment and respectful care.</P>
<P>The trials in resource-constrained countries were relatively small compared to the trials in higher-income countries. Additional, larger trials may be required in resource-constrained settings, where the cost of providing continuous support may compete with other resource priorities. In these settings, implementation research could explore how to effectively implement labour companionship to assuage provider and health system barriers to intervention. Outcomes that have been under-researched in resource-poor settings, but are causes of significant morbidity and poor experiences of care may be worthy of further exploration, including urinary and faecal incontinence, pain during intercourse, prolonged perineal pain, postpartum depression, respect for women's choices and preferences, and promoting dignified and respectful maternity care.</P>
<P>Trials of different models of training providers of labour support would help to inform decision makers about the most effective models in the context of their settings. Trials are also needed to understand whether an extended model of care across the antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum periods adds value to the intrapartum-only continuous support, which has been the primary focus of trials to date. Similarly, future research could compare the effectiveness of models of one-to-one midwifery care with continuous support by an additional person, as it is unclear whether routine midwifery tasks such as charting and managing equipment, impact the provision of supportive care.</P>
<P>Economic analyses of the relative costs and benefits, as well as sufficient details about the training and/or orientation materials provided to the support person (whether they are a doula or a lay person) would be an important contribution to the current evidence base.</P>

<P>In this review update, we re-organised the outcome list and added six new outcomes from the previous version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 2013</LINK>). These include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>delayed skin-to-skin contact, as defined by trial authors;</LI>
<LI>delayed initiation of breastfeeding (more than one hour after birth, or as defined by trial authors);</LI>
<LI>time from birth to initiation of breastfeeding;</LI>
<LI>unlikely to recommend birth in that institution;</LI>
<LI>restricted mobility during labour, as defined by trial authors; and</LI>
<LI>unsatisfactory mother-infant interactions.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We included these outcomes based on the rationale that women's experiences of care are an important component of quality of care, as noted in the World Health Organization (WHO) quality of care vision for pregnant women and newborns (<LINK REF="REF-Tun_x00e7_alp-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunalp 2015</LINK>). We based these outcomes on available evidence, including the WHO Standards for improving quality of maternal and newborn care in health facilities (<LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 2016</LINK>), and other Cochrane Reviews that explored similar topics. In this update, we assessed all new trials for these outcomes, and returned to all previously included trials to identify and include any data contributing to these new outcomes.</P>
<P>We also modified one review outcome to "Exclusive or any breastfeeding at any time point as defined by trial authors" (from &#8220;Breastfeeding at one to two months postpartum&#8221;), to be more inclusive of trials that had postpartum follow-up at a time point outside of the specified range.</P>
<P>We have added two new subgroup analyses on the model of support received (support solely during the intrapartum period, compared with extended support during antenatal and postpartum periods, in addition to continuous support during the intrapartum period), and country income level where trials were conducted (high-income countries compared to low- and middle-income countries).</P>
<P>This review update also includes an assessment of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.</P>
<P>We also performed sensitivity analyses for any outcomes where reciprocal data had to be calculated in order to include data in an analysis (exclusive breastfeeding; negative rating of/negative feelings about the birth experience).</P>
<P>In 2017, we added in an additional search of <A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</A> and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">ICTRP</A>).</P>

Supportive measures classified into psychological and emotional, educational, and physical categories were offered to the mother. Psychological and emotional support included touching, empathy, compassion, encouraging the mother to continue cooperation in the labour process, reassurance, taking mother&#8217;s hands, maintaining eye contact, creating a sense of trust and confidence, continuous talking, and reduction of fear during labour. Educational support included informing the mother about the natural process of childbirth and answering her questions. Finally, physical support included cooling the mother, satisfying her hunger and thirst, and helping her change the positions in various stages of labour.</P>

The nurse provided the usual nursing care plus physical comfort, emotional support, and instruction on relaxation and coping techniques. The nurse took meal breaks and brief rest breaks.</P>

Unknown if companions were typically permitted on the ward, if continuous EFM was used routinely, or if epidural anaesthesia was available. Women in the doula group were encouraged to contact their doula at the start of their labour, but only 101 women (81.5%) in the doula group had the doula in attendance at the birth. The authors report that the most common reasons for doula absence at the birth were: (1) short labours; and (2) failed communication between the woman and the doula.

<P>Strong evidence of selection bias.

Women were enrolled in the study until there were 20 in the control group and 20 in the experimental group."

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Akbarzadeh 2015 and Masoudi 2014 specify the process of selecting blocks, "the subjects were selected through simple random sampling and were divided into supportive care, acupressure, and control groups using stratified block randomisation. In doing so, a number was randomly selected from the table of random numbers and the researcher moved toward the right or left column or row and wrote the 5 digit numbers down. Since the participants were divided into 3 groups in this study, 3-therapy method was used and classification was performed as follows: A: supportive care group, B: acupressure group, and C: control group. Accordingly, ABC: 1, ACB: 2, BAC: 3, BCA: 4, CAB: 5, and CBA: 6. It should be noted that numbers 0, 7, and 9 were ignored".</P>
