<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We conducted a review of the effects of Chinese herbal medicines for people with primary osteoporosis. We found 108 studies with 10,655 people.</P>
<P>
<B>Background: what is primary osteoporosis and what are Chinese herbal medicines?</B>
</P>
<P>Bone is a living, growing part of your body. Throughout your lifetime, new bone cells grow and old bone cells break down to make room for the new, stronger bone. When you have osteoporosis, the old bone breaks down faster than the new bone can replace it. As this happens, the bones lose minerals (such as calcium). This makes bones weaker and more likely to break even after a minor injury, like a little bump or fall.</P>
<P>Chinese herbal medicines are products made from any part of medicinal plants (leaves, stems, buds, flowers or roots). Sometimes non-plant based components (for example insects, deer horn, snake, various shells and powdered fossil) are included. These can be used in the form of raw plant materials, or water or alcohol extracts of raw plant materials. Herbs can also be taken by mouth as capsules, tablets or liquids, or as injections.</P>
<P>Chinese herbal medicines are widely used in China for primary osteoporosis but their benefits and harms have not been appraised in order to inform clinical practice.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>After searching for all relevant studies up to January 2013, we found 108 studies with 10,655 people with osteoporosis. Ninety-nine different Chinese herbal medicines were tested and compared with placebo (three trials), no intervention (five trials) or conventional medicine (61 trials), or Chinese herbal medicines plus conventional medicine were compared with conventional medicine (47 trials). The average length of treatment was 5.7 months (ranging from 3 to 12 months).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results: what happens to people with osteoporosis who take Chinese herbal medicines?</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>New fractures</B>
</P>
<P>We are uncertain whether Chinese herbal medicines reduce the chance of having a new bone fracture. Seven trials evaluated the incidence of fractures. However, these trials were small and had flaws in their methods.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of life</B>
</P>
<P>People who took Bushenhuoxue therapy plus calcium carbonate tablets and alfacalcidol rated their quality of life to be 5.30 points better on a scale of 0 to 100 after three months compared to people who did not take the herbal medicine.</P>
<P>People who took Bushenhuoxue therapy plus calcium carbonate tablets and alfacalcidol rated their quality of life to be 56.05 on a scale of 0 to 100.</P>
<P>People who took calcium carbonate tablets and alfacalcidol rated their quality of life to be 50.75 on a scale of 0 to 100.</P>
<P>
<B>Serious side effects or deaths</B>
</P>
<P>No serious side effects or deaths occurred in the trials.</P>
<P>We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects may include a mild stomach ache or diarrhoea.</P>
<P>
<B>Bone mineral density </B>(the amount and type of minerals in the bone)</P>
<P>We found studies that compared Chinese herbal medicines with placebo (fake treatment), with no treatment and with conventional medicine. We also found studies that compared Chinese herbal medicines plus conventional medication with just conventional medication.</P>
<P>Compared to placebo (fake treatment), three studies showed that bone mineral density increased slightly with Chinese herbal medicines.</P>
<P>Compared to no treatment or conventional medicine, some studies showed an increase in bone mineral density with Chinese herbal medicines while others did not.</P>
<P>When Chinese herbal medicines plus conventional medication was compared with just conventional medicine, some studies showed an increase in bone mineral density while others did not.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>In people with osteoporosis:</P>
<P>- Chinese herbal medicines may improve bone mineral density and quality of life slightly. Further research is likely to change this estimate of how Chinese herbal medicines affect bone mineral density and quality of life.</P>
<P>- We are uncertain whether Chinese herbal medicines reduce the chance of having a new bone fracture.</P>
<P>- No trial reported death or serious side effects.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-04 03:56:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One hundred and eight randomised trials involving 10,655 participants were included. Ninety-nine different Chinese herbal medicines were tested and compared with placebo (three trials), no intervention (five trials) or conventional medicine (61 trials), or Chinese herbal medicines plus western medicine were compared with western medicine (47 trials). The risk of bias across all studies was unclear for most domains primarily due to inadequate reporting of study design. Although we rated the risk of selective reporting for all studies as unclear, only a few studies contributed numerical data to the key outcomes.</P>
<P>Seven trials reported fracture incidence, but they were small in sample size, suffered from various biases and tested different Chinese herbal medicines. These trials compared Kanggusong capsules versus placebo, Kanggusong granule versus Caltrate or ipriflavone plus Caltrate, Yigu capsule plus calcium versus placebo plus calcium, Xianlinggubao capsule plus Caltrate versus placebo plus Caltrate, Bushen Zhuanggu granules plus Caltrate versus placebo granules plus Caltrate, Kanggusong soup plus Caltrate versus Caltrate, Zhuangguqiangjin tablets and Shujinbogu tablets plus calcitonin ampoule versus calcitonin ampoule. The results were inconsistent.</P>
<P>One trial showed that Bushenhuoxue therapy plus calcium carbonate tablets and alfacalcidol had a better effect on quality of life score (scale 0 to 100, higher is better) than calcium carbonate tablets and alfacalcidol (mean difference (MD) 5.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.67 to 6.93).</P>
<P>Compared with placebo in three separate trials, Chinese herbal medicines (Migu decoction, Bushen Yigu soft extract, Kanggusong capsules) showed a statistically significant increase in bone mineral density (BMD) (e.g. Kanggusong capsules, MD 0.06 g/cm<SUP>3</SUP>; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.10). Compared with no intervention in five trials, only two showed that Chinese herbal medicines had a statistically significant effect on increase in BMD (e.g. Shigu yin, MD 0.08 g/cm<SUP>3</SUP>; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.13). Compared with conventional medicine in 61 trials, 23 showed that Chinese herbal medicines had a statistically significant effect on increase in BMD. In 48 trials evaluating Chinese herbal medicines plus western medication against western medication, 26 showed better effects of the combination therapy on increase in BMD.</P>
<P>No trial reported death or serious adverse events of Chinese herbal medicines, while some trials reported minor adverse effects such as nausea, diarrhoea, etc.<BR/>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-02-10 13:51:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Osteoporosis is a worldwide common public health problem with high prevalence (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woolf-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolf 2003</LINK>). It is defined as a progressive, systemic disease characterised by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to bone fragility and an increased susceptibility to fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Diez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diez 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NOF-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NOF 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wylie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wylie 2010</LINK>). While osteoporosis is often thought of as an older person's disease, it can strike at any age (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NOF-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NOF 2014</LINK>). It is estimated that worldwide osteoporosis is currently a problem for 200 million middle-aged and elderly persons, and there are 75 million people with osteoporosis in America, Western Europe and Japan. In terms of its incidence rate osteoporosis has been ranked as seventh among common diseases worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xue-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xue 2000</LINK>). In China, there are already 50 million people with osteoporosis and a large-scale epidemiological study found that the prevalence in people over 50 years is 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Qiu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qiu 2001</LINK>). As life expectancy increases, this number is expected to continue to grow (<LINK REF="REF-Bengner-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bengner 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cumming-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cumming 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kushner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kushner 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Osteoporosis is a highly prevalent disorder associated with sequelae that often have devastating effects on the quality of life of those affected, and may be a high risk factor for death. Morbidity and mortality rates from osteoporosis-related injuries are high (<LINK REF="REF-Diez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diez 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holroyd-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holroyd 2008</LINK>). Osteoporosis-related sequelae therefore have a major impact on healthcare costs, both direct and indirect, especially those related to hip fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Diez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diez 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holroyd-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holroyd 2008</LINK>). Three kinds of major fractures are associated with osteoporosis: hip, vertebrae and the distal forearm (such as wrist) (<LINK REF="REF-Diez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diez 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NOF-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NOF 2014</LINK>). Epidemiologic studies from several countries have reported the incidence and impact of hip fractures, and their absolute number is expected to double in the next 25 years, with a projected total of more than six million occurrences per year throughout the world by the year 2050 (<LINK REF="REF-Genant-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Genant 1999</LINK>). Some studies have found that the mortality rate associated with hip fracture is 15% to 25%, caused by complications such as pneumonia, other infections and cardiac insufficiency. The expense of therapy and hospitalisation is USD 25 billion each year (<LINK REF="REF-Xue-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xue 2000</LINK>). It is difficult to calculate the incidence of spinal fractures because many are asymptomatic or may not be diagnosed, however they are also an important fracture in many elderly people (<LINK REF="REF-Diez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diez 2002</LINK>). Therefore, osteoporosis has become an important social and medical care problem.</P>
<P>Osteoporosis is often called the 'silent disease' because bone loss occurs gradually and without symptoms or warning signs until the disease is advanced (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NOF-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NOF 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wylie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wylie 2010</LINK>). Some people may suffer from chronic or acute pain, muscle fatigue and limited mobility, but they may not know that they have osteoporosis until their bones become so weak that a sudden strain, bump or fall causes a fracture or a vertebra to collapse. Collapsed vertebrae may initially be felt or seen in the form of severe back pain, loss of height or spinal deformities such as kyphosis (stooped posture) (<LINK REF="REF-IOF-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOF 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xia-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>At present, the pathogenesis of osteoporosis is still not clear, but may be associated with heredity, poor nutrition, malabsorption, gonadal insufficiency, inadequate physical activity, lack of sunlight irradiation and smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Diez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diez 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raisz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raisz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winsloe-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winsloe 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2001b</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-01-28 11:06:19 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Currently, there are a range of therapeutic approaches for osteoporosis. Conventional medicines include oestrogen, raloxifene, bisphosphonates (such as alendronate, etidronate, risedronate), calcitriol, calcitonin, Caltrate (<LINK REF="REF-Confavreux-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Confavreux 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Diez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diez 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guo-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guo 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guo-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guo 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horst_x002d_Sikorska-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horst-Sikorska 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leong-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leong 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rizzoli-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rizzoli 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sambrook-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sambrook 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silverman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverman 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wells-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wells-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wells-2008c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2008c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2012</LINK>). Although fluoride has the ability to increase bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine (<LINK REF="REF-Haguenauer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haguenauer 2005</LINK>), it has been found ineffective for reducing vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Oestrogen therapy has limited effectiveness and long-term use increases the risks of breast cancer, endometrial haemorrhage and endometrial cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Leong-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leong 2002</LINK>). A Cochrane systematic review shows that exercise has the potential to be a safe and effective way to avert bone loss in postmenopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Howe-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howe 2011</LINK>). Although concerted research efforts have been made to identify safe and effective therapies, treatment options are still needed.</P>
<P>In China and other countries, people are looking for alternative modalities to treat osteoporosis and Chinese herbal medicines are one of the popular therapies used. Chinese herbal medicines are defined in this review as products derived from any part of medicinal plants (e.g. leaves, stems, buds, flowers, roots or tubers) used for the treatment of osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Rates-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rates 2001</LINK>) and some non-plant based component (e.g. insects, deer horn, snake, various shells and powdered fossil, etc.) are sometimes included. Chinese herbal medicines can be in the form of raw plant materials, or water or alcohol extracts of raw plant materials, or herbal formulations in capsules, tablets, decoctions or injections.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-01-27 20:06:16 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In China, many herbs have been tested in clinical trials and claims made as to their effectiveness in treating osteoporosis (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-GY-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cao GY 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dong-Y-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dong Y 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jian-QQ-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jian QQ 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-JM-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wang JM 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-XG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang XG 2011</LINK>). For example, Zhang et al found that Zhuangguyin (a formula containing<B> </B>different herbs, such as common yam rhizome, red and white peony root, Chinese angelica, Radix codonopsis pilosulae, liquorice root, etc. plus dry powder of Placenta hominis) improved primary osteoporosis, and proposed that the therapy improved the BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-XG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang XG 2011</LINK>). One clinical trial found that Gujian capsule (studied and produced by Xiyuan Hospital under the Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine) improved BMD, increased levels of calcitonin, oestradiol, testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone, and decreased levels of parathyroid hormone (<LINK REF="REF-Meng-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meng 2003</LINK>).</P>

Chinese herbal medicines are widely used in China for the treatment of osteoporosis and many herbal drugs have been approved by the China State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) for the market. Each year, many clinical trials are published in China, however, there is no critical appraisal of the evidence on the potential benefits and harms of Chinese herbal medicines for treating osteoporosis. The purpose of this review is to systematically identify available randomised clinical trials of Chinese herbal medicines for primary osteoporosis to appraise their benefit and harm in order to inform clinical practice.</P>

<P>The experimental interventions included single herbs, combinations of herbs or Chinese proprietary medicines. There was no standard for the classification of Chinese herbal medicines. Therefore, to make it easier, we classified Chinese herbal medicines into two major types: a) Chinese proprietary medicine which was approved by the China State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) and produced by pharmaceutical companies with good manufacture practices; b) herbal formulae prescribed by Chinese medicine practitioners based on a Chinese medicine diagnosis (i.e. pattern differentiation of symptoms). This type of medicine was usually cooked as decoction by the patients themselves or prepared by a hospital pharmacy. As we predicted great variation in the type, timing, dosage and administration of herbs and their combination with other interventions, we did not limit any of these aspects.</P>
<P>The control intervention could be no treatment, placebo or conventional pharmaceutical medicine (such as hormone replacement therapy, bisphosphonate, calcitonin, calcium and vitamin D), as well as non-pharmaceutical interventions such as exercise. Co-intervention was allowed as long as all groups from the randomised allocation received the same co-intervention.</P>
<P>We excluded studies in which the duration of herbal treatment was less than three months.</P>

The composition and treatment regimens of the Chinese herbal medicines varied (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>: 'The preparation and composition of the Chinese herbal medicines in the included trials'). The median duration of treatment was 5.7 months (ranging from 3 to 12 months).</P>
<P>The control interventions included placebo in three trials and no treatment in five trials. In the other trials the control interventions were conventional pharmaceutical medicine or Chinese herbal medicines plus co-intervention versus the same co-intervention.</P>

None of the 108 trials reported death directly or indirectly caused by osteoporosis. The outcomes reported were mainly surrogate outcomes, including BMD, biochemical indicators (serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, oestradiol, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, bone Gla protein, interleukin-6, etc.), the improvement of lumbago and backache, and adverse effects. Only two trials reported quality of life and medical expenses (<LINK REF="STD-Liang-DB-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Liang DB 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-ZF-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang ZF 2011</LINK>). Adverse effects were reported in 44 trials and included nausea, diarrhoea, dry mouth, constipation, tiredness, dental ulcer, epigastric discomfort, breast pain, dizziness, stomach discomfort, etc. All the reported outcomes were measured at the end of treatment.</P>

<P>The reported outcomes included BMD of the lumbar spine, radius, ulna, femoral neck, Ward's triangle, trochanter, hipbone, distal radius and calcaneus. Levels of oestradiol (E2), serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone Gla protein (BGP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin (CT) were also measured, as was the improvement of lumbago and backache.</P>
<P>We were not able to pool the data due to the variations in the herbal preparations and control interventions that were used in the studies.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-01-28 11:38:48 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to poor study quality and limited data on the individual herbal interventions, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from this review on the effectiveness of any Chinese herbal medicine intervention tested to date.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-01-24 11:27:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One hundred and eight randomised trials were included in this review. Ninety-nine different Chinese herbal medicines were compared with placebo, no intervention, conventional pharmaceutical medicine or with the same co-intervention received by the Chinese herbal medicines group. In this review, many of the trials showed a symptomatic benefit of Chinese herbal medicines in patients with osteoporosis either when compared with placebo, no intervention or conventional western medicine. However, there was a lack of replicable evidence because no more than one trial ever compared the same Chinese herbal medicine and control treatment. Thus, the finding of a benefit of Chinese herbal medicine treatment may not be conclusive. Furthermore, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample sizes and generally low methodological quality of the included studies.</P>
<P>Compared with placebo in three trials, Chinese herbal medicines had a statistically significant effect in increasing bone mineral density (BMD) in each trial. One reported some mild adverse effects (such as stomach/intestinal upset, headache and dizziness) from Chinese herbal medicines, but there were no significant differences between the Chinese herbal medicines and placebo groups.</P>
<P>Five randomised trials compared seven different Chinese herbal medicines with no intervention. Two trials showed Chinese herbal medicines to be significantly effective in increasing BMD, while three others showed no better effect. Four trials reported mild adverse effects (e.g. mild stomach discomfort, intestinal upset, etc.) of Chinese herbal medicines, but this did not affect the continuation of the treatment.</P>
<P>Sixty-one trials compared 58 different Chinese herbal medicines with western medicine. Twenty-three trials showed that Chinese herbal medicines were significantly effective in increasing BMD, while 38 showed no better effect. Twenty-three reported some adverse effects (e.g. dizziness, rash, nausea, vomiting, etc.) from Chinese herbal medicines, but most of them did not affect the continuation of the treatment. Six reported no occurrence of adverse effects and 38 did not report adverse effects.</P>
<P>Forty-eight trials compared 42 different Chinese herbal medicines plus western medicine with western medicine. Twenty-six showed better effects in increasing BMD, while 22 did not. Fourteen reported some adverse symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, etc.) from Chinese herbal medicines, but there was no significant difference between comparison groups. Eight reported no remarkable adverse effects and the other 26 did not report adverse effects.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-01-24 10:29:13 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed this review to evaluate the benefit and harm of Chinese herbal medicines in patients with osteoporosis. Most of the Chinese herbal medicines evaluated were mixtures of different herbs and most of them were prescribed by the investigators without reporting of the quality standards for the preparations. Interpretation of these findings should therefore be cautious considering that along with the other methodological limitations in the study designs, these studies cannot be replicated. There is a risk that statistically significant findings from a handful of studies at questionable risk of bias are given more prominence than the lack of data for relevant endpoints available from the vast majority of included studies in the review.</P>
<P>The Chinese herbal medicines evaluated generally appeared to be safe. However, we cannot conclude that using Chinese herbal medicines in osteoporosis patients is safe, because adverse effects were not sufficiently and adequately reported in all the included trials. In clinical trials beneficial and harmful effects should receive equal attention, and the recording and reporting of adverse effects must improve if we are to draw any conclusions about safety.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-01-24 11:30:16 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to the variations in the Chinese herbal medicines tested and the methodological limitations of the included trials, the evidence for Chinese herbal medicines for the treatment of osteoporosis is not conclusive. In general, Chinese herbal medicines might be a promising treatment. However, it is premature to recommend Chinese herbal medicines for routine use in osteoporosis considering the generally low quality of the evidence.</P>
<P>Most of the included trials suffered from insufficient reporting or inadequate methods of randomisation. The majority of the trials did not report how the random allocation was generated and concealed. Some trials had a significantly skewed distribution of participants among the groups compared which could not be explained if randomisation had been carried out properly. These trials were highly prone to selection bias.</P>
<P>Very few trials used a double-blinding method. The majority of treatment approaches in the included trials aimed to improve pain symptoms, which is a subjective indicator. If the outcome assessment is not blinded, then performance and detection bias may be a problem.</P>
<P>Most of the included trials were small. Although some data analyses did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the groups compared, the results were likely to have been underpowered to demonstrate equivalence. Therefore, the analyses from the small sample trials may not be able to establish with confidence that the two interventions had equivalent effects.</P>
<P>Overall the evidence is limited: potential bias may have occurred in the selection of participants, the administration of treatment and the assessment of outcomes in the included trials, which may obscure or exaggerate treatment effects. Methodologically less rigorous trials have been shown to have significantly larger intervention effects than trials conducted with more rigour (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Therefore, the implications of our findings for clinical practice are very limited.</P>
<P>The trials identified in this review were mostly Chinese and all were conducted in Chinese participants: publication bias might therefore be an issue. An empirical study has shown that Chinese trials are significantly affected by publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Vickers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 1998</LINK>). Furthermore, it is certainly an issue that so few of the included studies actually reported the right outcomes and we downgraded studies for selective reporting. Accordingly, publication bias should be taken into consideration when interpreting the present findings. Moreover, most of the trials were of short duration and were not followed up long-term, thus they were unable to detect endpoint outcomes such as fracture or long-term adverse effects of the herbal treatments in patients with osteoporosis. Primary outcomes such as the occurrence of new fractures were reported in only a few trials, so we could not draw any conclusions about efficacy and safety.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-01-24 10:29:13 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review, we comprehensively searched for studies from appropriate databases, and selected trials and extracted data in duplicate. However, we did not find any unpublished studies or studies published in languages other than Chinese or English. Secondly, due to our limited resources, including time, we were not able to contact the original authors to verify unclear information, such as the methods used for random allocation generation and concealment. Furthermore, almost all Chinese herbal medicines in the included trials were tested only once and on small samples. This made it impossible for us to pool data to draw a robust conclusion.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-01-28 11:38:48 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We<B> </B>could not find any other reviews evaluating the benefits and harms of Chinese herbal medicines in patients with osteoporosis. Therefore, this review is the first time this has been reported. Many trials are not included in this review and are listed as excluded studies. Due to the variation among the Chinese herbal medicine interventions, it is not meaningful to compare the results from these excluded trials with those included in this review. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-01-27 14:29:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on this systematic review, some Chinese herbal medicines may have beneficial effects on the bone mineral density at anatomical sites in people with osteoporosis. However, a large number of the included studies have an uncertain risk of bias, there is a lack of relevant clinical endpoints in the available literature and the evidence is of low quality. Further rigorous studies are needed to demonstrate whether these effects are clinically meaningful and to detect other effects.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-01-27 14:46:00 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The potential benefit of Chinese herbal medicines as a treatment for osteoporosis needs to be further investigated by conducting high-quality trials to produce convincing evidence. Trials comparing Chinese herbal medicines with conventional pharmaceutical medicine should be designed rigorously. It would also be interesting to verify the additional benefits of Chinese herbal medicines when combined with conventional medicine versus the same medicine by itself. There are a wide range of therapeutic strategies in Traditional Chinese Medicine that address osteoporosis and the related Chinese medicine diagnosis of kidney deficiency. It would be useful for those with expertise in Chinese herbal medicine to group the herbal formulae by therapeutic strategy, so that the Chinese herbal medicines can be tested with reference to the therapeutic framework from which they were derived.</P>
<P>Outcome measures should include both clinical and surrogate outcomes. Standardised monitoring and reporting should be used for assessment of adverse effects. The methodological quality of randomised trials of Chinese herbal medicines for osteoporosis needs to be improved. The following aspects should be addressed: (i) detailed reporting of the methods used to generate the allocation sequence and conceal allocation; (ii) sufficient application of double-blinding with the use of an adequate placebo; (iii) clear descriptions of withdrawals/drop-outs during the trial and use of intention-to-treat analysis; (iv) reporting of clinically important outcome measures from long-term follow-up; and (v) reporting of the trial according to the CONSORT Statement guidelines (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>).</P>
