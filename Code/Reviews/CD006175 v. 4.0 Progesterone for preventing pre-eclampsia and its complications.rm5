<P>No good evidence that giving the hormone progesterone to pregnant women will help women and babies avoid the problems of pre-eclampsia.</P>
<P>Pre-eclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy occurring in about 2% to 8% of women. It is identified by increased blood pressure and protein in the urine, but women often suffer no symptoms initially. It can, through constriction of the blood vessels in the placenta, interfere with food and oxygen passing to the baby, thus inhibiting the baby's growth and causing the baby to be born too soon. Women can be affected through problems in their kidneys, liver, brain, and clotting system. One theory is that is that pre-eclampsia might be associated with a shortage of progesterone, and so it has been suggested that giving women progesterone during pregnancy might help them to avoid pre-eclampsia. The review found four trials involving 1445 women. There were insufficient data be to be able to say if progesterone helped, and there was very little information on potential adverse outcomes. So progesterone should not be used in pregnancy for the purpose of trying to reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia, and further testing is needed.</P>

<P>We included four trials of variable quality (1445 women). Three trials compared progesterone injections, and one compared progestogen vaginal gel, with no progesterone. There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate any clear differences between the two groups on risk of pre-eclampsia (three trials, 1277 women; risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.63), death of the baby (four trials, 2594 babies; RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.31), preterm birth (three trials, 1313 women; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.10), small-for-gestational-age babies (one trial, 168 women; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.19 to 3.57), major congenital defects (three trials, 2436 babies; one trial, no events, two trials RR 1.19 , 95% CI 0.31 to 4.52), or any other outcome reported. There were no reported cases of masculinisation of female babies (one trial, 128 women).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-02-10 14:42:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hypertension (high blood pressure) is common during pregnancy. Around 10% of women will have raised blood pressure at some point before delivery. The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy comprise a spectrum of conditions that is usually classified into four categories: (i) gestational hypertension, a rise in blood pressure during the second half of pregnancy; (ii) pre-eclampsia, usually hypertension with proteinuria (protein in urine) during the second half of pregnancy; (iii) chronic hypertension, a rise in blood pressure prior to pregnancy or before 20 weeks' gestation, and (iv) pre-eclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-NHBPEP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHBPEP 2000</LINK>). For women with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension, pregnancy outcome is similar to that for women with normal blood pressure. Outcome deteriorates if blood pressure is very high or if pre-eclampsia develops. Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder, involving the liver, kidneys, brain, and placenta. It affects 2% to 8% of pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1988</LINK>), and is associated with a substantive increase in morbidity and mortality for both the woman and her baby (<LINK REF="REF-DH-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2002</LINK>). Complications for the mother may include eclampsia (seizures), stroke, liver or kidney failure, and abnormal blood clotting, and problems for the baby include poor growth and preterm birth.</P>
<P>The cause of pre-eclampsia is uncertain, but current belief is that reduced blood supply to the placenta leads to abnormal function of endothelial cells, possibly as a result of oxidative stress. Endothelial dysfunction results in generalised vasoconstriction, platelet activation and thrombosis, and decreased plasma volume, with subsequently reduced blood supply to multiple organs. Pre-eclampsia is discussed in more detail in the generic protocol for this review (<LINK REF="REF-Generic-Protocol-05" TYPE="REFERENCE">Generic Protocol 05</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-03-28 04:07:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Progesterone is a hormone which plays an essential role in reproduction, both in the regulation of the menstrual cycle, and in the maintenance of pregnancy. It is used for a range of gynaecological problems such as heavy uterine bleeding, fertility control, and postmenopausal hormone replacement. In addition, it has been suggested that progesterone may have a role in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Ford-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2009</LINK>), threatened miscarriage (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wahabi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wahabi 2007</LINK>), and preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>During pregnancy, progesterone stimulates the growth and differentiation of endometrium to allow implantation, induces immunological tolerance to the fetus, and inhibits uterine contractions (<LINK REF="REF-Szekeres_x002d_Bartho-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szekeres-Bartho 1992</LINK>). Progesterone appears, at least in part, to influence the vascular adaptations of normal pregnancy by decreasing responsiveness of blood vessels to vasoconstrictors and inducing vasodilatation (<LINK REF="REF-Buhimschi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buhimschi 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ito-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ito 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liao-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liao 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radwanska-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radwanska 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of progesterone derivatives are now commercially available. These include dydrogesterone, hydroxyprogesterone, medroxyprogesterone, norethisterone, norgestrel, desogestrel, norgestimate, gestodene, and levonorgestrel. Progestogens may be administered orally, as suppositories or pessaries, by local patches, or as injections. However, progesterone itself is given as injections, vaginal pessaries or rectal suppositories, as absorption from the oral route is unreliable.</P>
<P>Whilst progesterone is not known to be harmful during pregnancy, there is little information about its long-term safety for the fetus or mother. Progesterone does not cause masculinisation of the female fetus, although this is a concern with some of the other synthetic progestogens. Progestogens with more androgenic activity, which may cause masculinisation, should not be used during pregnancy. Side effects of progestogens include symptoms such as bloating, fluid retention, weight gain, breast tenderness, headache, nausea, acne, hirsutism, skin reactions, and depression.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-04-04 12:24:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<P>In the past, administration of progesterone has been suggested for prevention and treatment of pre-eclampsia. In the 1930s, Robson and Paterson observed that a toxic state, convulsions, and death could be produced experimentally in pregnant rabbits if progesterone secretion was reduced in the second half of pregnancy, by removal of the embryo. It was suggested that the 'toxaemia' of pregnancy (pre-eclampsia) might also be associated with progesterone insufficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Robson-1937" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robson 1937</LINK>). Results from several case series were not particularly encouraging (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1939" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1939</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marsden-1937" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsden 1937</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robson-1937" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robson 1937</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Young-1937" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1937</LINK>), and the hypothesis seemed to have been discounted. Two decades later, Katharina Dalton reported the observation that women who developed pre-eclampsia had a high incidence of premenstrual syndrome when they were not pregnant. She also observed that women who experienced what she referred to as 'toxaemic symptoms' such as tiredness, depression, nausea, irritability and headache in early pregnancy were more likely to go on to develop pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Dalton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalton 1960</LINK>). These symptoms she considered to be similar to those of premenstrual syndrome. She therefore suggested that premenstrual syndrome was akin to pre-eclampsia, and that both were related to progesterone deficiency. The hypothesis that progesterone reduced the risk of pre-eclampsia was tested by Dalton (<LINK REF="REF-Dalton-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalton 1954</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dalton-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalton 1957</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dalton-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Dalton 1962</LINK>), but the use of progesterone for prevention of pre-eclampsia has never become widespread in clinical practice.</P>
<P>More recently, a new hypothesis has emerged about the potential role of progesterone in the development of pre-eclampsia. Special placental cells called cytotrophoblasts invade into maternal blood vessels during early placental development. These cells express a protein called HLA-G which is thought to play a key role in enhancing immunological tolerance between the "foreign" fetal tissue and maternal cells (<LINK REF="REF-Kovats-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovats 1990</LINK>). Studies indicate that HLA-G is reduced in the placenta and serum of women with pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Yie-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yie 2004</LINK>), and therefore may play a role in impaired placentation leading to the development of pre-eclampsia. Progesterone has been shown to increase the expression of HLA-G protein in placental cytotrophoblast cells (<LINK REF="REF-Yie-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yie 2006</LINK>), which supports the hypothesis that progesterone may reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia.</P>
<P>Maternal serum progesterone levels increase in normal pregnancy, but a deficiency of progesterone has not been found in association with pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tamimi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tamimi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zeisler-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeisler 2000</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-03-28 04:10:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Progesterone has been proposed for prevention of pre-eclampsia in the past, and again, more recently. The evidence to support this hypothesis has been weak, but new data on the role of progesterone in promoting immunological tolerance appear plausible. Progesterone has never been widely used in clinical practice for this purpose; nevertheless, it remains relevant to review the evidence about the effects of progesterone, and other progestogens, when used for prevention of pre-eclampsia.</P>
<P>Other Cochrane reviews have assessed the role of progesterone for prevention of preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2006</LINK>) and of miscarriage (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2008</LINK>).

<P>If cluster-randomised trials are included in the analyses along with individually randomised trials in future updates, we will adjust their sample sizes<I> </I>using the methods described in the <I>Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>) using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If ICCs from other sources are used, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC if appropriate. If both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials are identified, we will synthesise the relevant information.

For these studies, and outcomes which used the number of babies as the denominator, we adjusted the sample size by using the cluster trial methods specified above, where each woman was regarded as a randomised cluster. We obtained an ICC from the <LINK REF="STD-STOPPIT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">STOPPIT 2009</LINK> trial for analyses. An ICC was not available from <LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2007</LINK> so we used the ICC from <LINK REF="STD-STOPPIT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">STOPPIT 2009</LINK> to analyse the study data from <LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2007</LINK>, as we considered the trials sufficiently similar. we meta-analysed effect estimates and their standard errors using the generic inverse-variance method in RevMan <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>. Data for the outcomes from these trials are available separately in additional tables in the review (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the future, if it is not possible to obtain enough information to make any adjustment for the effects of multiple pregnancies, we will analyse the data as if babies from multiple pregnancies were independent, using the number of babies as the denominator.

If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects would differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we would use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.

<P>We included four studies with 1445 women in this review. Details of the studies are available in the table of <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Two studies were conducted in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="STD-Dalton-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Dalton 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STOPPIT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">STOPPIT 2009</LINK>) and two in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Hauth-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hauth 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2007</LINK>). Two were multicentre trials (<LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STOPPIT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">STOPPIT 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Participants were recruited between 16 and 28 weeks' gestation. In one study, women had normal blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Dalton-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Dalton 1962</LINK>), in another (<LINK REF="STD-STOPPIT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">STOPPIT 2009</LINK>), less than 1% had high blood pressure, and in the other two, blood pressure at trial entry was not reported. Two studies recruited twin pregnancies only (<LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STOPPIT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">STOPPIT 2009</LINK>).The risk of developing pre-eclampsia for women at trial entry is unclear in two trials, and was high risk in the other two studies.</P>
<P>Progesterone was given by intramuscular injection in three studies; in one (<LINK REF="STD-Dalton-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Dalton 1962</LINK>) dosage was from 300 mg daily to 50 mg on alternate days, depending on changes in intensity of 'toxaemic' symptoms, and in the other two studies, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone was given 1000 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Hauth-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hauth 1983</LINK>), or 250 mg weekly (<LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2007</LINK>). In the fourth study (<LINK REF="STD-STOPPIT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">STOPPIT 2009</LINK>), progesterone was given as a vaginal gel of 90 mg daily. Three were placebo controlled trials, but for the fourth study (<LINK REF="STD-Dalton-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Dalton 1962</LINK>), women in the control group were offered simple treatments such as alkalis, analgesics, sedatives, and antihistamines for the relief of their symptoms. It was not reported how many women received these alternative interventions.<BR/>
<BR/>Outcomes reported included development of pre-eclampsia, which in <LINK REF="STD-Dalton-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Dalton 1962</LINK> was defined as blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg with either oedema or albuminuria after 28 weeks. As the definition of pre-eclampsia no longer includes oedema, the number of women reported to have developed pre-eclampsia is likely to be an overestimate. In the review, we therefore used the number of women with proteinuria as a better estimate of the number with pre-eclampsia. In <LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2007</LINK>, data were reported as 'hypertensive disorder' and included both gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, but data were not available separately for the two outcomes so it has been reported under pre-eclampsia in this review, but this may be an overestimation. Side effects were reported in three studies, but data have been excluded from two studies because of attrition above 23% in one (<LINK REF="STD-STOPPIT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">STOPPIT 2009</LINK>) and because side effects have been reported for the progesterone group only in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Dalton-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Dalton 1962</LINK>). For the children, a range of outcomes have been reported. Development at age one year, and intelligence and psychosexual personality at 16 years of age have been reported, but the data are excluded from this review due to large losses to follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Dalton-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Dalton 1962</LINK>).</P>
<P>We excluded five studies from the review: three were not randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dalton-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Dalton 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sammour-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Sammour 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sammour-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sammour 1982</LINK>), and two of these recruited women with established pre-eclampsia. The fourth excluded study was a quasi-randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Zibdeh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">El-Zibdeh 2005</LINK>), and in the fifth, we were unable to use data as presented (<LINK REF="STD-Hartikainen-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Hartikainen 1980</LINK>). Other trials evaluating progesterone during pregnancy were not considered to be potentially eligible for this review, as they focused on preterm birth or miscarriage and did not consider pre-eclampsia or gestational hypertension as outcomes.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-04-07 10:35:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this review was to assess the effects of progesterone on prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications. Of the four included studies, one (<LINK REF="STD-Dalton-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Dalton 1962</LINK>) aimed to test the hypothesis that women at risk of pre-eclampsia developed 'toxaemic symptoms' associated with progesterone deficiency, and so administration of progesterone would reduce these symptoms and prevent the onset of pre-eclampsia. The other three primarily assessed the effects of progesterone on prevention of preterm birth, but also reported data for pre-eclampsia as a secondary outcome (albeit that these data were not in a format that enabled them to be incorporated into the review for all studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hauth-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hauth 1983</LINK>)). Two studies were of uncertain methodological quality, and two were of good quality. Compliance with medication was assessed in two studies. Women took around 95% of their medication in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2007</LINK>), but in another only 58% of women reported taking at least 80% or the treatment (<LINK REF="STD-STOPPIT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">STOPPIT 2009</LINK>). There is insufficient evidence for any reliable conclusions about the benefits or risks associated with progesterone therapy for prevention of pre-eclampsia or its consequences.</P>
<P>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Dalton-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Dalton 1962</LINK>), about one-fifth of women receiving progesterone injections had an urticarial skin reaction, all of which responded to antihistamines, but there was no control group in that study. In <LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2007</LINK>, over 60% of women in both the progesterone and placebo groups had side effects but there was no significant difference between the two groups in risk of side effects, and these appeared to be related to administration of injections. Although data on side effects haven't been included from <LINK REF="STD-STOPPIT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">STOPPIT 2009</LINK> due to attrition, even when progesterone or placebo was given vaginally, over 45% of women in both groups reported a wide range of side effects ranging from bloating and nausea to increased vaginal discharge. As many of the side effects associated with progesterone use are similar to those of pregnancy (bloating, fluid retention, breast tenderness, weight gain, nausea, headache dizziness, drowsiness, depression and skin reactions), to elucidate any differences reliably would require well-controlled and blinded comparisons.</P>
<P>There was no clear difference in the risk of congenital malformations between the two groups. Although data on long-term follow-up of some children born to women recruited (<LINK REF="STD-Dalton-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Dalton 1962</LINK>) have been reported, there is considerable potential for bias due to large losses to follow-up. Less than half the children were available for assessment at one year, and only 20% were available at 16 years of age. Data at one year were collected by a questionnaire administered either by a 'clinic doctor' or by a health visitor. At 16 years, children were assessed by an interviewer in their own homes. At age one year, it was reported that 92% of children in the progesterone group were able to stand alone compared to 68% of controls, and 62% were walking compared to 35% of controls. There were no apparent differences between the two groups in talking or teeth eruption. One boy in the progesterone group had small testes, whilst in the control group two had undescended testes and three had breast engorgement. Assessment at 16 years of age did not appear to show any significant differences between the two groups with regards to intelligence, perception, personality or psychosexual identity, although these data must be interpreted with caution due to the large losses to follow-up.</P>
<P>An additional limitation is that progesterone administration requires frequent intramuscular injections. Its use in clinical practice could only be justified if supported by clear evidence of benefit, and adequate reassurance about safety, in both the short and the long term, for both the child and the woman. Currently such evidence is not available, and so progesterone should not be used for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications outside of clinical trials.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend progesterone for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications. Progesterone should therefore not be used for this purpose in clinical practice at present.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-02-10 13:46:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P> As new and plausible hypotheses have emerged, further trials of progesterone specifically to prevent pre-eclampsia may be justified. As there is a resurgence of interest in progesterone for prevention of preterm birth, those planning trials to evaluate progesterone for women at risk of preterm birth should ensure that pre-eclampsia is one of the outcomes reported.</P>

<P>Progesterone: 100 mg IM daily or on alternate days for 1 week. On subsequent visits, dose and frequency of injection adjusted depending on symptoms (range 300 mg daily to 50 mg on alternate days).

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2011-03-02 14:29:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The following methods were used to assess <LINK REF="STD-Dalton-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Dalton 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hauth-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hauth 1983</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed potentially eligible studies for inclusion. Any differences in opinion were resolved by discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of study quality</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the quality of each trial using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (Higgins 2005). Methods used for generation of the randomisation sequence are described for each trial, where possible. Each study was assessed for quality of concealment of allocation, completeness of follow up, and blinding. If data were missing, we attempted to contact trialists to provide further details.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>A quality score for concealment of allocation was assigned to each trial, using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) adequate concealment of allocation, such as telephone randomisation, consecutively numbered, sealed opaque envelopes;<BR/>(B) unclear whether concealment of allocation was adequate;<BR/>(C) inadequate concealment of allocation such as open random-number tables, sealed envelopes that were not numbered and opaque.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>(2) Completeness of follow up<BR/>
</I>
</B>Completeness of follow up was assessed using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) less than 5% of participants excluded from analysis;<BR/>(B) 5% to 10% of participants excluded from analysis;<BR/>(C) more than 10% and up to and including 20% of participants excluded from analysis.</P>
<P>Studies were excluded if:<BR/>(1) more than 20% of participants were excluded from the analysis;<BR/>(2) more than 10% of participants were not analysed in their randomised groups and it was not possible to restore participants to the correct group;<BR/>(3) more than 10% difference in loss of participants between groups.</P>
<P>Data were analysed based on the group to which the participants were randomised, regardless of whether they received the allocated intervention or not. Where data were missing, clarification was sought from the authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Blinding</HEADING>
<P>Blinding was assessed using the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>blinding of participants (yes/no/unclear or unspecified);</LI>
<LI>blinding of caregiver (yes/no/unclear or unspecified);</LI>
<LI>blinding of outcome assessment (yes/no/unclear or unspecified).</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and data entry</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data. We entered data onto the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>), and these were double checked for accuracy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analyses</HEADING>
<P>We carried out statistical analyses using Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). Results are presented as summary relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. At present, only one trial is included, but when sufficient data become available, we will assess heterogeneity between trials using the I² statistic. In the absence of significant heterogeneity, we will pool results using a fixed-effect model. If substantial heterogeneity is detected (I² more than 50%), we will explore possible causes and perform subgroup analyses for the main outcomes. Heterogeneity that is not explained by subgroup analyses may be modelled using a random-effects analysis, if appropriate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>We planned to do a sensitivity analysis to explore the effects of trial quality based on concealment of allocation, by excluding studies with clearly inadequate allocation concealment (rated C). This analysis will be undertaken once sufficient data are available.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>Prespecified subgroup analyses for the main outcomes were based on the:</P>
<OL>
<LI>risk of women at trial entry: high, moderate, low, or undefined;</LI>
<LI>gestation at trial entry: at and before 20 weeks' gestation, or after 20 weeks' gestation.</LI>
</OL>
<P>These subgroup analyses will be conducted once sufficient data become available.</P>
