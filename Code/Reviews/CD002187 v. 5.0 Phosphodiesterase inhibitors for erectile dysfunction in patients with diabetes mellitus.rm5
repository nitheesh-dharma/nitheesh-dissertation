<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Erectile dysfunction is a common multi-factorial complication of diabetes mellitus. Newer medications, like the so-called PDE-5 inhibitors result in enhancement of penile erection. The introduction of sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra) and tadalafil (Cialis), have altered the management of erectile dysfunction. In this review we assessed the effect of these agents on erectile dysfunction in diabetic people. Eight studies with 976 men randomised to PDE-5 inhibitor therapy and a duration of mainly 12 weeks were evaluated. Compared to placebo treatment, these agents showed favourable effects in scores estimating sexual life, with an increased rate of adverse effects like headache and flushing after PDE-inhibitor therapy. Mortality was not reported in any of the included trials. Quality of life, with the exception of scores for sexual life, was not relevantly affected. If taken as prescribed, PDE-5 inhibitors comprise a valuable treatment option for erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes. </P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Erectile dysfunction is a common multi-factorial complication of diabetes mellitus. Numerous strategies have been tried to overcome this diabetic complication. In recent years, phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors have been introduced in the management of erectile dysfunction.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effect of PDE-5 inhibitors on the management of erectile dysfunction in diabetic men. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Studies were obtained from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials, in which treatment with PDE-5 inhibitors was compared to control, in diabetic patients with erectile dysfunction. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Eight randomised controlled trials were identified. A total 976 men were allocated to receive a PDE-5 inhibitor and 741 were randomised to the control groups. Overall, 80% of the participants suffered from type 2 diabetes mellitus. The weighted mean difference (WMD) for the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questions 3 and 4 (frequency of penetration during and maintaining erection to completion of intercourse) was 0.9 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.1) and 1.1 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.2) at the end of the study period, in favour of the intervention group. The WMD for the IIEF erectile dysfunction domain at the end of the study period was 6.6 (95% CI 5.2 to 7.9) in favour of the PDE-5 inhibitors arm. The relative risk (RR) for answering "yes" to a global efficacy question ( "did the treatment improve your erections?") was 3.8 (CI 95% 3.1 to 4.5) in the PDE-5 inhibitors compared with the control arm. The WMD between the percentage of successful attempts in the PDE-5 inhibitors and in the control arm was 26.7 (95% CI 23.1 to 30.3). Mortality was not reported in any of the included trials. Adverse cardiovascular effects were reported in one study. Headache was the most frequent adverse event reported, flushing was the second most common event, with upper respiratory tract complaints and flu like syndromes, dyspepsia, myalgia, abnormal vision and back pain also reported in a descending order of frequency. The overall risk ratio for developing any adverse reaction was 4.8 (CI 95% 3.74 to 6.16) in the PDE-5 inhibitors arm as compared to the control.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Sufficient evidence exists that PDE-5 inhibitors form a care that improves erectile dysfunction in diabetic men.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-06 11:13:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-05 23:17:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (see 'About the Cochrane Collaboration', 'Collaborative review groups (CRGs)'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main Glossary in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.<BR/>Diabetes mellitus is accompanied by a variety of other chronic complications. Erectile dysfunction, defined as the inability to achieve and maintain an erection sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual intercourse (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-Consensus-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH Consensus 1993</LINK>), is one such complication of diabetic patients. Approximately 50% of diabetic men experience erectile dysfunction at least once in the course of their disease. In the Massachusetts Male Aging Study (MMAS), a landmark community-based survey of predominantly Caucasian men aged 40 to 69 years, the age adjusted risk for developing erectile dysfunction for treated or untreated self reported diabetic patients was 1.83 and statistically significant (<LINK REF="REF-Johannes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johannes 2000</LINK>).<BR/>Various factors are thought to contribute to the development of erectile dysfunction in diabetic men. Neuropathy, vascular disease, diabetes control, nutrition, endocrine disorders and psychogenic factors, as well as drugs used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its complications play a role (<LINK REF="REF-Vinik-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinik 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vinik-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vinik 1998b</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-06 11:13:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Numerous strategies have been tried to overcome this diabetic complication. These include improving glycaemic control, a range of drugs that influence penile rigidity, the use of vacuum assisted devices to produce an erection-like state, operations to apply prostheses within the penis and psychological counselling. In recent years, three phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, that is sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra) and tadalafil (Cialis), have been introduced in the management of erectile dysfunction.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-11-05 23:54:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Nitric oxide is an important regulator of cavernosal smooth muscle relaxation. Nitric oxide also induces arterial dilatation. The actions of nitric oxide on the cavernosal smooth muscle and the arterial blood flow are mediated through the activation of guanyl cyclase and production of cyclic guanidine-mono-phosphate (cGMP) (<LINK REF="REF-Andersson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Christ-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christ 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lue-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lue 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lue-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lue 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naylor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naylor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nehra-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nehra 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rajfer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajfer 1992</LINK>). The enzyme phosphodiesterase type 5 is a selective inactivator of cGMP in the cavernosal smooth muscle (<LINK REF="REF-Andersson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lue-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lue 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naylor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naylor 1998</LINK>). Hydrolysis of cGMP by this enzyme results in reversal of the smooth muscle relaxation and reversal of penile erection. PDE-5 inhibitors prevent breakdown of cGMP and thereby enhance penile erection (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1998</LINK>).<BR/>When sexual stimulation releases nitric oxide into the penile smooth muscle, inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 causes a marked elevation of cGMP concentrations in the glans penis, corpus cavernosum and corpus spongiosum, resulting in better erection. PDE-5 inhibitors have no effect on the penis in the absence of sexual stimulation, when the concentrations of nitric oxide and cGMP are low (<LINK REF="REF-Lue-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lue 2000</LINK>).<BR/>We defined our main outcome measure as the achievement of penile rigidity satisfactory for penetration and sufficiently prolonged to enable sexual intercourse to be completed. This was assessed using the self-administered International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), a 15-item questionnaire and validated measure of erectile function (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1997</LINK>, see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). Each question is scored using a five point ordered categorical scale, with a score of one representing the worst response (almost never/never) and a score of five representing the best response (almost always/always).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>Adverse effects associated with PDE-5 inhibitors are related to their vasodilatory properties and are similar to those induced by nitrates. These include headache, lightheadedness, dizziness, flushing, distorted vision, and, in some cases, syncope. Men at highest risk for syncope are those who take other vasodilators such as nitrates. Thus, men should be cautioned against the combined use of sildenafil and a nitrate because of the risk of hypotension and syncope.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-05 23:18:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Since the release of sildenafil to the market in March 1998, it has become the treatment of choice for most men with erectile dysfunction. Vardenafil and tadalafil are two new PDE-5 inhibitors with reported better tissue specificity and pharmacokinetic profiles than sildenafil. Much have been reported about the clinical efficacy, side effect profile and cost effectiveness of these agents. Publications and reviews on the subject of erectile dysfunction in diabetic patients also exist. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no formal systematic review and meta-analysis have been conducted to assess the management of diabetic men with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-05 23:23:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The quality of reporting each trial was assessed based largely on the quality criteria specified by Schulz and by Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). In particular, the following factors were studied:<BR/>(1) minimisation of selection bias - was the randomisation procedure adequate? Was the allocation concealment adequate?<BR/>(2) minimisation of performance bias - were the patients and people administering the treatment blind to the intervention?<BR/>(3) minimisation of attrition bias - were withdrawals and dropouts completely described? Was analysis by intention-to-treat?<BR/>(4) minimisation of detection bias - were outcome assessors blind to the intervention?</P>
<P>Based on these criteria, studies were broadly subdivided into the following three categories:<BR/>(A) all quality criteria met: low risk of bias;<BR/>(B) one or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate risk of bias; and<BR/>(C) one or more criteria not met: high risk of bias.</P>
<P>This classification was used as the basis of a sensitivity analysis. Additionally, we explored the influence of individual quality criteria in a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>Two reviewers (MV, AN) assessed each trial. Interrater agreement was calculated using the kappa statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1960</LINK>), and reported. In cases of disagreement, judgment was made based upon consensus.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-11-05 23:24:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The outcome data were generally of ordinal nature (including measurement scales), where the outcome is one of several ordered categories or generated by scoring and summing categorical responses (such as in the case of self reported quality of life assessment scale). Some data were presented as counts, for example number of satisfying penetrations per time period.<BR/>Effect measures for ordinal data was assessed as continuous data. Weighted mean difference was measured. This method was used for each of the parameters assessed, after assuring that the different scales used in the trials point towards a single direction. Whenever dichotomizing results seemed statistically feasible and clinically logical, effect measurements for dichotomous data were used, that is risk ratios and odds ratios.<BR/>Effect measures for count and rates data were assessed as continuous data given the anticipation for common event occurrence. Weighted mean difference was used to assess the difference in the mean number of events per group of patients.</P>
<P>Short-, intermediate- and long-term assessment of effect in the case of repeated observations per participant did not seem clinically significant in our review. Therefore, in the case of multiple observations we selected the longest follow-up for each trial and analyse results to that point. This method may induce lack of consistency across trials and give rise to heterogeneity, which was addressed in a sensitivity analysis.<BR/>
<BR/>Intention-to-treat analysis aims to include all participants randomised into a trial irrespective of what happened subsequently. This means that trial participants should be analysed in the group to which they were randomised regardless of which treatment they actually received or other protocol irregularities and all participants should be included regardless of whether their outcomes were actually collected. In this review we adopted an available-case-analysis, in which only the former criterion is met, and analysis was performed for every participant for whom data were available. Thus, filling-in for missing data was not conducted. Special attention was given for three types of exclusions:<BR/>(a) participants excluded for predefined exclusion criteria using information collected before randomisation - considered as legitimate;<BR/>(b) participants excluded immediately after randomisation- considered as illegitimate;<BR/>(c) very high dropout rates or inconsistency across study groups, which may indicate low quality of trial conduction.</P>

<P>Heterogeneity is a term used to describe variability among trials encountered in a meta-analysis. In our review, we anticipated some clinical diversity, for example diabetes status, erectile dysfunction status or treatment, as well as methodological diversity, both giving rise to statistical heterogeneity. On the one hand, the scope of our review was relatively confined, therefore heterogeneity is not inherently large. On the other hand, disease status may be variable among participants and treatment in the study group relates to three different drugs. Methodologically there was no promise for comparable quality. In this review, it seemed appropriate to aim at broader perspective, thus, primarily evaluate the average effect of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors by combining results from trials that evaluate the different drugs in this pharmacological class.<BR/>Heterogeneity was identified using the formal chi-square test, which is intended to assess whether observed differences in results are compatible with chance alone. Chi-squared test have low power when trials have small sample size or are few in number. Therefore a P value of less than 0.10 was considered statistically significant. We also tried to quantify the amount of heterogeneity by describing the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).<BR/>A negative chi-square does not necessarily mean that no heterogeneity exists or should not be further explored. In this view, a subgroup analysis was performed as discussed below.</P>

<P>Data were summarised statistically if they were available, sufficiently similar and of sufficient quality. Heterogeneity was addressed using two meta-analytical methods. Due to the limited number of studies retrieved, a fixed-effect meta-analysis was carried out, ignoring heterogeneity, thus calculating the typical group treatment effect. Fixed-effect analysis was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel methods, which have been shown to have better statistical properties when there are few events.<BR/>When addressing dichotomous data types, the effect of treatment was expressed with relative effect measures, that is risk ratio and odds ratio, which are more consistent than absolute measures. These were calculated for an event (rather then for a non-event). When addressing continuous data type, we expressed the effect of treatment using weighted mean difference.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>A total of 1759 participants were recruited in eight trials. 976 were randomised to receive a PDE-5 inhibitor and 741 were randomised to the control groups. Twenty-one participants in the one cross-over design study received both a PDE-5 inhibitor and placebo. All were men. Treatment groups within studies did not differ significantly with respect to age, medical history, concomitant medication, diabetes mellitus severity or duration, and erectile dysfunction severity (when described). Valid diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus were described in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Boulton-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boulton 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rendell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rendell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saenz-de-Tejada-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Saenz de Tejada 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stuckey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stuckey 2003</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>All eight trials compared a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor with placebo. No head to head comparisons between the different PDE-5 inhibitors, or any comparison with other treatment modalities for erectile dysfunction were conducted. One trial compared tadalafil at a fixed dose of 10 mg and 20 mg with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Saenz-de-Tejada-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Saenz de Tejada 2002</LINK>). Another trial compared vardenafil at a fixed dose of 10 mg and 20 mg with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 2003</LINK>). The remaining six trials compared sildenafil with placebo at doses titrated between 25 mg and 100 mg. Patients were instructed to use the medication no more than once daily, within 30 minutes to one hour of sexual intercourse. Treatment duration was 10 days in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Price-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Price 1998</LINK>), 16 weeks in one study (Safarinejad 2004) and 12 weeks in the remaining trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>The main outcome measure was defined as the achievement of penile rigidity satisfactory for penetration and sufficiently prolonged to enable sexual intercourse to be completed. This was assessed using the self-administered International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), a 15-item questionnaire and validated measure of erectile function (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1997</LINK>, see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). Each question is scored using a five point ordered categorical scale, with a score of one representing the worst response (almost never/never) and a score of five representing the best response (almost always/always). We focused on two questions within the IIEF questionnaire which specifically address the key aspects of erectile dysfunction as defined by the National Institute of Health: IIEF question 3, which assesses the ability to achieve an erection for sexual intercourse, and IIEF question 4, which assesses the ability to maintain an erection after penetration. Additionally, we assessed the Erectile Function domain within the IIEF, which is a summation of questions 1 through 5 and question 15. Efficacy was assessed via the difference in means at the end of the study period.<BR/>A global efficacy question ("did the treatment improve your erections?") and an event log in which patients recorded the number of attempts at sexual intercourse and the number of attempts that were successful were also addressed. Quality of life was also investigated.<BR/>Additional outcome measures were predefined as all-cause mortality, morbidity and adverse effects. Issues regarding costs were not addressed.<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity and subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>Due to the limited number of studies retrieved for this meta-analysis, a fixed effect meta-analytic model was used (Mantel-Haenszel method). The chi-squared test was performed with a P value of less than 0.10. When addressing the global efficacy question, the chi-squared test yielded a P value &lt; 0.0001 with I<SUP>2</SUP>=77.4%. Therefore, the effect of treatment for this particular question must be interpreted cautiously, as observed differences in results are probably not compatible with chance alone, and statistical heterogeneity exists. For all other effect estimates, no significant heterogeneity was found.<BR/>To further explore heterogeneity we explored treatment effect with respect to baseline diabetes status. Only three studies addressed this issue. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Boulton-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Boulton 2001</LINK>, effect of sildenafil versus placebo was significant for IIEF question 3, IIEF question 4, IIEF EF domain, percentage of successful attempts and the global efficacy question for both low and high baseline glycated haemoglobin groups (threshold was defined as 8.3%). In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Saenz-de-Tejada-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Saenz de Tejada 2002</LINK>, baseline glycated haemoglobin did influence response to tadalafil treatment, particularly in the poorly controlled diabetic patients receiving a low dose tadalafil, whereas the change in the IIEF EF-domain was similar for both placebo and tadalafil 10 mg groups (groups were stratified according to glycated haemoglobin - below 7%, 7% to 9.5% and above 9.5%). <LINK REF="STD-Stuckey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stuckey 2003</LINK> showed the relationship between response to treatment and baseline glycated haemoglobin to be non-significant with respect to the individual success rate of erection with a duration sufficient to complete intercourse from a diary question sexual encounter profile.<BR/>Baseline erectile function status was addressed by two authors: <LINK REF="STD-Stuckey-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stuckey 2003</LINK> reported significant treatment effects for sildenafil in type 1 diabetic patients regardless of erectile dysfunction severity (defined as mild or moderate versus severe), with respect to IIEF question 3, IIEF question 4, IIEF EF domain and percent of successful intercourse; <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 2003</LINK> reported a significantly higher rate of successful intercourse attempts in the severe baseline erectile dysfunction group receiving a high dose vardenafil (20 mg).</P>
<P>We intended to perform a subgroup analysis with respect to gender but all participants across studies were male. A subgroup analysis for the type of PDE-5 inhibitor revealed that all three types of PDE-5 inhibitors were superior to placebo in the IIEF EF domain and global efficacy question. Studies addressing IIEF questions 3 and 4 have all compared sildenafil with placebo.</P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a common and debilitating disease that affects patients' quality of life, morbidity and mortality. In particular, its multifactorial effect on sexual performance is of high prevalence and impact on one's perception of well-being. Many therapeutic options have been proposed prior to the introduction of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, none of which showed a definite therapeutic effect. PDE-5 inhibitors have shown to be effective in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in the general population. The goal of this review was to systematically analyse their effect in diabetic patients. The meta-analysis presented here has clearly shown that when comparing PDE-5 inhibitors as a group with placebo, their relative as well as absolute effect on sexual activity is clinically favourable, with consistent statistical significance. This is reflected in the scores of the International Index of Erectile Function, the percentages of successful attempts, and in a global efficacy question. Interestingly, quality of life questionnaires have shown improvement in scores for sexual life, but did not yield statistically significant differences in other domains, such as life as a whole, partnership relation, family life, contact with friends, leisure situation, vocational situation and financial situation. Presumably, this result is a reflection of the complexity of one's life experience. <BR/>In terms of adverse reactions, only one study reported serious cardiovascular morbidity in the intervention arm, including four events of documented myocardial infarction with ST-elevation and congestive heart failure. These events were not reported by other authors. Effects of PDE-5 inhibitors on the cardiovascular system have been studied thoroughly, specifically with sildenafil which was first developed as an anti-anginal agent. A recent review has been published on the subject (<LINK REF="REF-Culley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Culley 2005</LINK>). In short, clinical trials not specifically designed for diabetic patients showed no statistically significant difference in myocardial infarctions or other vascular deaths between PDE-5 inhibitors users and placebo users. On the contrary, a trend of reduction in these events in the investigational arm was noted (<LINK REF="REF-Bischoff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bischoff 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cialis-presc-info" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cialis presc info</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kloner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kloner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levita-presc-info" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levita presc info</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mittleman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mittleman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zusman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zusman 1999</LINK>). Specifically in men with diabetes, one study showed that placebo-treated patients had a rate of myocardial infarction of 2.1 per 100 patient-years, compared with 0.7 in patients treated with tadalafil (<LINK REF="REF-Kloner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kloner 2004</LINK>). Thus, PDE-5 inhibitors should be considered safe for treatment of erectile dysfunction in stable coronary artery disease, and should probably be considered safe in diabetic patients as well.<BR/>In general, the prevalence of other mild adverse effects was low, and was considered by authors to be none-significant clinically. When prescribing these agents, physician and patients must be aware of their tendency to elicit headaches, flushing, upper respiratory tract complaints and flu like syndromes, dyspepsia, myalgia, abnormal vision and back pain. <BR/>One methodological drawback must be emphasized. None of the studies included in this review has shown a low risk for bias. This may reflect flaws in conduction, or merely lack of adequate reporting. Nevertheless, sensitivity analyses taking account of specific quality criteria and excluding trials with inadequate reporting did not influence the robustness of the results. <BR/>It is clear from the meta-analysis presented that PDE-5 inhibitors should be considered a primary treatment for erectile dysfunction in diabetic men. They have proved to be effective and safe. It seems that their effect may wane in low doses in patients with uncontrolled diabetes, with higher baseline glycated haemoglobin. Higher doses may be required for this particular subgroup. <BR/>Unfortunately, we found no head to head comparisons between the three available PDE-5 inhibitors, and no trials comparing them with other available therapeutic options. Another issue of interest which is yet in its infancy is the effect of PDE-5 inhibitors on female sexual dysfunction, particularly diabetic women.</P>
