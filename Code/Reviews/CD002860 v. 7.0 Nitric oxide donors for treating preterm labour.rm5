<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-03 11:17:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks) increases the baby's risk of death or disability. Several drugs are available to try and slow down labour so that corticosteroid drugs can be given to help the baby's lungs mature quickly. Nitric oxide donors (glyceryl trinitrate) are drugs that may slow down contractions. They can cause headaches, low blood pressure and increased heart rate for the mother, but they might cause fewer problems than some of the other options. This review gathered the evidence on nitric oxide donors compared with no treatment and compared with other drugs to inhibit preterm labour.</P>
<P>We identified 12 trials involving 1227 women. We found that there is not enough evidence to show whether or not nitric oxide donors can slow down preterm labour.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-03-20 10:57:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>A number of tocolytics have been advocated for the treatment of threatened preterm labour in order to delay birth. The rationale is that a delay in birth may be associated with improved neonatal morbidity or mortality. Nitric oxide donors, such as nitroglycerin, have been used to relax the uterus.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-14 13:55:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Twelve trials, including a total of 1227 women at risk of preterm labour, contributed data to this updated review. The methodological quality of trials was mixed; trials comparing nitric oxide donors with other types of tocolytics were not blinded and this may have had an impact on findings.</P>
<P>Three studies compared nitric oxide donors (glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)) with placebo. There was no significant evidence that nitric oxide donors prolonged pregnancy beyond 48 hours (average risk ratio (RR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.90, two studies, 186 women), and although for most adverse effects there was no significant difference between groups, women in the active treatment group in one study were at higher risk of experiencing a headache. For infant outcomes there was no significant evidence that nitric oxide donors reduced the risk of neonatal death or serious morbidity (stillbirth RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.59, one study, 153 infants; neonatal death RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.89, two studies, 186 infants). One study, using a composite outcome, reported a reduced risk of serious adverse outcomes for infants in the GTN group which approached statistical significance (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.00, 153 infants). Overall, these studies were underpowered to identify differences between groups for most outcomes.</P>
<P>When nitric oxide donors were compared with other tocolytic drugs there was no significant evidence that nitric oxide donors performed better than other tocolytics (betamimetics, magnesium sulphate, a calcium channel blocker or a combination of tocolytics) in terms of pregnancy prolongation, although nitric oxide donors appeared to be associated with a reduction in most adverse effects, apart from headache. There was no significant difference between groups for infant morbidity or mortality outcomes.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-30 12:04:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-22 11:01:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm birth complicates around 10% of pregnancies and the rate is increasing in almost every country with reliable data. It is the largest cause of death in newborns (<LINK REF="REF-Kinney-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinney 2012</LINK>). The consequences of preterm birth for parents and children are enormous. It is a huge financial burden on healthcare resources and, although the costs of immediate neonatal care are high, these are dwarfed by the financial implications of long-term disability (<LINK REF="REF-Stevenson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevenson 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the perinatal risks are inversely proportional to the gestational age at birth, it has been assumed that delaying preterm birth will reduce perinatal mortality and morbidity. However, preterm labour is multifactorial and it is unlikely that a single treatment will be appropriate for all women. Indeed, the perinatal risks in certain conditions, such as fetal compromise, may even be reduced by expedited birth. The management of preterm labour must therefore be carefully considered on an individual basis.</P>
<P>There are numerous pharmacological treatments available for tocolysis (reducing uterine activity) in uncomplicated preterm labour, which can be used in an attempt to delay birth. The ß-sympathomimetics (ritodrine, salbutamol, terbutaline) (<LINK REF="REF-Anotayanonth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anotayanonth 2004</LINK>) have largely been replaced by other drugs due to potentially serious maternal adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2011</LINK>). Compared with placebo, other drugs such as calcium channel blockers (<LINK REF="REF-King-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2002</LINK>), and prostaglandin synthase inhibitors (non-selective and selective Cox 2) (<LINK REF="REF-King-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2005</LINK>) have been suggested to be effective in terms of pregnancy prolongation, although there is little clear evidence that tocolysis reduces the risk of adverse outcomes for neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinical trials in women with threatened preterm labour are complex. There are no uniform diagnostic criteria. Many women who present with increased uterine activity subsequently deliver at term without treatment and the frequency of threatened preterm labour is higher at later gestational ages when morbidity and mortality are less. Consequently, many studies have reported secondary outcome variables such as delay in birth, mean birthweight or the incidence of preterm birth that may not reflect changes in morbidity or mortality. The situation is further complicated by the relatively short duration of action of a number of treatment options. This, coupled with a failure to demonstrate improved perinatal outcome with long-term treatment, has led to administration of tocolytics in the short term (up to 48 hours). The rationale is that a short delay in birth may allow interventions to improve perinatal outcome, such as prenatal steroid administration (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>) or transfer to a unit with neonatal intensive care facilities.</P>
<P>The basis for the administration of a nitric oxide donor for the treatment of preterm labour is largely derived from observations in animals. L-arginine (the substrate for nitric oxide synthase) reduces, and inhibition of nitric oxide formation increases, myometrial contractility in the rat (<LINK REF="REF-Yallampalli-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yallampalli 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yallampalli-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yallampalli 1994</LINK>). In the rabbit and human, nitric oxide synthase activity is increased during pregnancy and reduced at the onset of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Arthur-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arthur 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sladek-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sladek 1993</LINK>). Functional experiments in vitro have reported that nitric oxide donors decrease myometrial contractility (<LINK REF="REF-Buhimschi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buhimschi 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Momohara-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Momohara 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 1996</LINK>) and there may be a reduction in the myometrial response in late pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Okawa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okawa 2005</LINK>). Thus, there is a scientific rationale for the clinical administration of nitric oxide donors. However, maternal adverse effects due to vasodilatation such as headache, flushing, hypotension and tachycardia may be anticipated. Theoretical fetal adverse effects could result from a direct effect of increased nitric oxide or maternal vasodilatation leading to changes in uterine blood flow. The current review considers the maternal and infant effects of nitric oxide donors for tocolysis in threatened preterm labour. For this review, nitric oxide donors are defined as drugs which increase nitric oxide, either due to an effect on formation or degradation. Nitric oxide donors may be administered intravenously, transdermally or sublingually.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials examined the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used a random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials.

<P>Two trials examined pregnancy prolongation beyond 24 hours for women randomised to receive GTN patches versus betamimetic tocolytic treatment; there were no significant differences between groups (average RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.08, 264 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-03 11:18:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Compared with placebo, there was no significant evidence that nitric oxide donors prolonged pregnancy, and although for most adverse effects there was no significant difference between groups, women in the active treatment group were at higher risk of experiencing a headache. For infant outcomes there was no significant evidence that nitric oxide donors reduced the risk of neonatal death or serious morbidity, although one study, using a composite outcome, reported a reduced risk of serious adverse outcomes for infants in the glyceryl trinitrate group which approached statistical significance. Overall, these studies were underpowered to identify differences between groups for most outcomes.</P>
<P>When nitric oxide donors were compared with other tocolytic drugs there was no clear evidence that nitric oxide donors performed better than other tocolytics (betamimetics, magnesium sulphate, a calcium channel blocker or a combination of tocolytics) in terms of pregnancy prolongation although nitric oxide donors appeared to be associated with a reduction in most adverse effects apart from headache. There was no significant difference between groups for infant morbidity or mortality outcomes.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-04-14 14:02:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This review update demonstrates that, despite several new studies, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of nitric oxide donors for the treatment of uncomplicated threatened preterm labour. The purpose of maternal administration of a tocolytic is to improve neonatal outcome. This has not been conclusively demonstrated for any tocolytic and most studies have used surrogate outcomes such as the rate of preterm birth or an increase in gestational age. Future demonstration of benefit will require high quality placebo or comparator trials. Nitric oxide donors (compared with placebo and other tocolytics) are associated with an increased incidence of headache but may be associated with fewer other adverse effects compared with other tocolytics. The only difference in perinatal morbidity or mortality is a decrease in admission to NICU with nitric oxide donors (compared with betamimetics) although the numbers are small. In the absence of clear beneficial effects on perinatal morbidity or mortality, routine administration of nitric oxide donors cannot be advocated.</P>

<P>The studies included in the review were of mixed methodological quality; studies comparing different treatment regimens were not blinded and this may have had an impact on outcomes, lack of blinding may have affected other aspects of care, clinical decision-making and may possibly have affected responses for more subjective outcomes (some adverse effects).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-04-14 14:02:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of nitric oxide donors in the treatment of threatened preterm labour. The most recent trial included in this version of the review was published in 2009, and up to that time nitric oxide donors had been compared with only a limited number of other types of tocolytics. Future trials should investigate whether compared with other tocolytics, nitric oxide donors improve perinatal morbidity and mortality as well as surrogate outcomes such as the effect on preterm birth. Such trials should be adequately powered and of high quality. They should also record whether other therapy (such as steroids and antibiotics) have been given and to how many women since such therapy may influence outcome. Placebo-controlled trials are the gold standard in this context , but other trials comparing nitric oxide donors with other commonly used tocolytics such as calcium channel blockers and atosiban would be helpful.</P>

<P>Randomisation with stratification by gestational age (&lt; and &gt; 30 weeks) and blocking in groups of 2 were performed before the study by the clinical investigations unit of the hospital. Sealed study envelopes coded with the randomisation number and used in order of randomisation number, contained the study patches, instructions for the nurses and bags to collect all used and unused patches. Therapy blinded to participant, doctor and outcome assessor although not to nurses who either peeled off the impermeable protective backing to use the active patch or kept the backing on if placebo was required. Both patches were covered with non-transparent tape so would appear similar to all participants. Intention-to-treat analysis. Designed as pilot study.

<P>For the <LINK REF="REF-Duckitt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duckitt 2002</LINK> review, we used the search strategy developed for the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group as a whole. The full list of journals and conference proceedings as well as the search strategies for the electronic databases, which are searched by the Group on behalf of its reviewers, are described in detail in the 'Search strategies for the identification of studies section' within the editorial information about the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. Briefly, the Group searches on a regular basis MEDLINE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and reviews the Contents tables of a further 38 relevant journals received via ZETOC, an electronic current awareness service.</P>
<P>Relevant trials, which are identified through the Group's search strategy, are entered into the Group's Specialised Register of Controlled Trials. Please see Review Group's details for more detailed information. Date of last search: March 2002.</P>
<P>In addition, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2002) was searched using the following terms:</P>

<P>Studies were reviewed by two independent reviewers (S Thornton, K Duckitt) to determine if they met the inclusion criteria and to grade the methodological quality. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion until a consensus was reached. Methods for the consideration of trials for inclusion, evaluation of methodological quality, trial data extraction and processing was undertaken as described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>). Methodological quality was categorised as low, moderate or high risk of bias depending on randomisation methods, allocation concealment, blinding and use of placebo. All eligible trials were included in the initial analysis. It was planned to assess the influence of trial quality on the findings of the review by conducting a sensitivity analysis of high versus low quality. High quality trials were those classified as having a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>). An a priori decision was made to exclude trials when outcome data were unavailable for more than 20% of participants, in order to minimise attrition bias. Data were abstracted independently by the two reviewers and checked and entered by one (K Duckitt). Results are presented using risks (RR) for categorical data and weighted mean difference (WMD) for variables measured on a continuous scale and will include 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>The review will assess the effects of nitric oxide donors when compared with:</P>
<P>- placebo or no treatment;<BR/>- any other tocolytic agent.</P>
<P>It was planned to carry out subgroup analyses as determined below to try and clarify in which particular circumstances surrounding preterm labour, if any, nitric oxide donors may exert an effect.</P>
