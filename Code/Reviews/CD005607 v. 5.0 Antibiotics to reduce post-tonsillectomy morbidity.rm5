<TITLE>Antibiotics to reduce pain and improve recovery following tonsillectomy</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-09 14:30:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tonsillectomy is a commonly performed operation in children and adults. Following the operation nearly all patients experience significant pain, need regular painkillers and are unable to resume normal diet and activities for several hours. Rarer but more dangerous complications, such as bleeding from the operated area, also occur. Antibiotics are commonly prescribed to reduce some or all of these undesirable consequences of tonsillectomy.</P>
<P>The present review, however, suggests that antibiotics do not reduce pain, the need for painkillers or bleeding. They do, however, appear to reduce fever. This relatively minor benefit is more likely to be due to weaknesses in the studies themselves than any direct antibiotic effect. The risk of adverse events, such as skin rash and diarrhoea, is also slightly higher in patients who were prescribed antibiotics. Therefore, in the absence of clear-cut and significant benefit, and with the potential for harm, we advocate against prescribing antibiotics routinely for patients undergoing tonsillectomy.</P>

<P>Tonsillectomy continues to be one of the most common surgical procedures performed in children and adults. Despite improvements in surgical and anaesthetic techniques, postoperative morbidity, mainly in the form of pain, remains a significant clinical problem.

<P>Two authors independently collected data.

<P>Ten trials, comprising a pooled total of 1035 participants, met the eligibility criteria. Most did not find a significant reduction in pain with antibiotics. Similarly, antibiotics were mostly not shown to be effective in reducing the need for analgesics. Antibiotics were not associated with a reduction in significant secondary haemorrhage rates (risk ratio (RR) 0.49, 95% CI 0.08 to 3.11, P = 0.45) or total secondary haemorrhage rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.44, P = 0.66).

<P>The present systematic review, including meta-analyses for select outcomes, suggests that although individual studies vary in their findings, there is no evidence to support a consistent, clinically important impact of antibiotics in reducing the main morbid outcomes following tonsillectomy (i.e. pain, need for analgesia and secondary haemorrhage rates). The limited benefit apparent with antibiotics may be a result of positive bias introduced by several important methodological shortcomings in the included trials. Based on existing evidence, therefore, we would advocate against the routine prescription of antibiotics to patients undergoing tonsillectomy. Whether a subgroup of patients who might benefit from selective administration of antibiotics exists is unknown and needs to be explored in future trials.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-10-10 14:34:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 2, 2008 and previously updated in 2010.</P>
<P>Tonsillectomy continues to be one of the most common surgical procedures performed in children and adults. Despite improvements in surgical and anaesthetic techniques, postoperative morbidity remains a significant clinical problem. The most common problems encountered in the postoperative period include pain, which is almost universal, and the consequent need for analgesics, as well as the inability to resume normal diet and activity for a few hours to several days. Post-tonsillectomy pain has been estimated to last well beyond the first week in the majority of patients, and the resultant economic and social costs are considerable (<LINK REF="REF-Salonen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salonen 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, the incidence of postoperative haemorrhage in various studies ranges from 2% to 40% depending on the definition of haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lowe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wei-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wei 2000</LINK>) and this may incur additional morbidity in the form of readmission, blood transfusion and return to theatre for haemostasis. Several adjuvant techniques such as administration of potent systemic analgesics, local infiltration with anaesthetic and topical analgesic sprays have all been studied, but their efficacy remains to be proven (<LINK REF="REF-Dhiwakar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhiwakar 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>After tonsillectomy the tonsillar bed heals by secondary intention and is contaminated by bacteria normally present as commensals in the oropharyngeal mucosa (<LINK REF="STD-Telian-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Telian 1986</LINK>). Several authors argue that this predisposes the patient to an inflammatory reaction and infection and contributes to postoperative morbidity. They therefore recommend prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the morbidity (<LINK REF="STD-Colreavy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Colreavy 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grandis-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Grandis 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Telian-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Telian 1986</LINK>); their routine perioperative administration is frequent and has been well established for decades in otolaryngology practice (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krishna-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishna 2004</LINK>). However, there is considerable variation in practice worldwide: a recent study from the UK showed that only 12% of otolaryngologists routinely prescribe antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Dhiwakar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhiwakar 2005</LINK>), while another study showed a figure of 79% among American otolaryngologists (<LINK REF="REF-Krishna-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishna 2004</LINK>). Those who favour routine administration of antibiotics cite decreased pain, decreased inflammation and faster healing as the most common reasons (<LINK REF="REF-Krishna-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishna 2004</LINK>). Other authors, however, do not favour routine antibiotic administration, citing a lack of evidence to support a direct causal link between infection and postoperative morbidity (<LINK REF="STD-Cannon-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cannon 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Reilly-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Reilly 2003</LINK>), hence the subject remains contentious. Furthermore, while traditionally secondary haemorrhage is attributed to infection and in such patients antibiotics are prescribed (<LINK REF="REF-Pavelic-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavelic 1960</LINK>), it is unclear if a causal relationship exists and whether or not antibiotics reduce the risk.</P>
<P>Due to the high potential for contamination by commensals, culture results of the tonsillar bed are difficult to interpret. Hence the definition and incidence of post-tonsillectomy infection are unclear. Clinically worsening pain, continuing inability to resume diet and raised temperature are considered features of infection and these patients are typically administered antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Murthy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murthy 1998</LINK>). However, it is unclear whether infection contributes to postoperative morbidity in all or a majority of patients, what the risk factors for infection are and whether they are different for adults and children. The role of routine antibiotics therefore remains unclear. For transurethral resection of the prostate, which is analogous to tonsillectomy in that tissue resection leaves denuded mucosa to heal by secondary intention in a bacterial milieu, a recent systematic review suggests that antibiotic prophylaxis improves some outcomes such as high fever and bacteraemia (<LINK REF="REF-Qiang-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qiang 2005</LINK>). A systematic review is similarly required to evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotics in reducing post-tonsillectomy morbidity. Furthermore, while individual trials might not be sufficiently large, a meta-analysis would potentially have sufficient power to determine whether antibiotics reduce rarer complications such as secondary haemorrhage.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>From all identified studies, two authors (MD and MS) independently selected trials for possible inclusion. We initially assessed all trials examining the impact of systemic antibiotics on post-tonsillectomy morbidity and randomised controlled trials were included in the review. The senior author (WM) resolved any disagreement in study selection.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>Two authors (MD and AC) independently assessed studies included in the review for quality. We assessed four components of quality.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Adequacy of randomisation (randomisation sequence generation, allocation concealment and implementation)</HEADING>
<P>Trials were scored as follows.<BR/>Grade A: all three sub-components adequately fulfilled.<BR/>Grade B: adequate allocation concealment, but one or both of the other sub-components unsatisfactory.<BR/>Grade C: unclear allocation concealment.<BR/>Grade D: clearly inadequate concealment.<BR/>(Grade A, B = high quality).</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Reporting of participants by allocated group (intention-to-treat analysis)</HEADING>

<P>A: Minimisation of bias (i.e. high quality) in all four components above.<BR/>B: Less than high quality (but not lowest quality) in one or more of the components above.<BR/>C: Lowest quality in one or more of the components above.</P>
<P>Where necessary, we contacted the principal author of the relevant trial for additional information regarding methodology and/or results. The senior author (WM) resolved any disagreement.</P>
<P>We examined any actual or potential conflicts of interest in the included trials (such as whether sponsored by a drug company). We also noted whether surgical and anaesthetic techniques were controlled and exclusion criteria explicitly applied, but this did not necessarily serve to include/exclude trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Two authors independently extracted data (MD and AC) and separately entered these into a specific, pre-designed pro forma. One author (MD) then entered data into RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>) for analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we extracted mean and standard deviation (SD) values to facilitate meta-analysis. If mean and/or SD values were not explicitly stated, we used raw data, t values, P values and/or graphs to generate mean/SD values. For dichotomous outcomes, we converted percentage values to the nearest number for meta-analysis.</P>
<P>If insufficient data were available, we considered children and adults together for outcome analysis. If an eligible trial did not evaluate or report any of the outcomes detailed above, we excluded that trial from the analysis of that particular outcome. We attempted intention-to-treat analysis, wherein all participants randomised into a trial, irrespective of which (or how much) treatment they actually received and regardless of other protocol irregularities such as ineligibility, were included for analysis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Statistics</HEADING>
<P>We calculated summary measures where possible for combinable data. Given the expected variability in participants, interventions, outcomes studied and trial design and quality, we used DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models to generate summary measures. For rarer outcomes, such as secondary haemorrhage and adverse events, if sufficient numbers of patients were not available, we calculated number needed to treat or number needed to harm as appropriate. We used RevMan version 5.1 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>) for the analysis.</P>

<P>We again updated the searches in March 2012. In total the searches retrieved 104 references; this number dropped to 85 once duplicates were removed. We screened the titles and abstracts of the 85 references and looked at five potentially relevant references in detail, however none were eligible for inclusion in the review. One had already been excluded at a previous update of the review (<LINK REF="STD-Inci-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Inci 2009</LINK>); we excluded <LINK REF="STD-Zagolski-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Zagolski 2012</LINK> because tonsillotomy with incision of the tonsil was performed instead of tonsillectomy; <LINK REF="STD-Dawar-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dawar 2011</LINK> was excluded as it was a non-randomised trial and <LINK REF="STD-Miura-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Miura 2009</LINK> was excluded as it assessed the efficacy of a topical antibiotic.

<P>Ten randomised controlled trials examining the impact of systemic antibiotics on post-tonsillectomy morbidity fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included for analysis. The characteristics of these trials are set out in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. All studies compared a short course of systemic antibiotics versus placebo. Many trials included children with no explicit information about the age range, or reported children and adults together with no means to extract data separately. Hence all participants, irrespective of age, were included in the analyses.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pain</HEADING>
<P>Of the six studies that assessed pain using linear pain scores (<LINK REF="STD-Colreavy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Colreavy 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grandis-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Grandis 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guerra-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guerra 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mann-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mann 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Reilly-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Reilly 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramos-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ramos 2000</LINK>), only one (<LINK REF="STD-Colreavy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Colreavy 1999</LINK>) found a significant reduction with antibiotics. <LINK REF="STD-Khan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 1994</LINK> calculated the mean number of days with sore throat (10.3 in antibiotic group versus 11 in control group) and otalgia (8.1 versus 7.8), and found no significant difference. However, <LINK REF="STD-Guerra-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guerra 2008</LINK>, while assessing pain each day during the first postoperative week, found a significant reduction with antibiotics on day four, with no benefit on the other days. <LINK REF="STD-Telian-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Telian 1986</LINK> found the mean number of days with continuous subjective pain to be improved with antibiotics (3.3 versus 4.4, P &lt; 0.05).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Need for analgesia</HEADING>
<P>Six studies assessed for the need for analgesics (<LINK REF="STD-Colreavy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Colreavy 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grandis-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Grandis 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guerra-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guerra 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linden-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Linden 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Reilly-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Reilly 2003</LINK>). Four did not find a significant reduction with antibiotic use, one (<LINK REF="STD-Colreavy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Colreavy 1999</LINK>) found a significant reduction, while in the last (<LINK REF="STD-Linden-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Linden 1990</LINK>) the result was indeterminate. <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Reilly-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Reilly 2003</LINK> reported a mean of 43% and 46% patients in the antibiotic and placebo groups, respectively, needing to consume additional analgesics. A respective mean of 63% and 51% contacted primary care physicians for analgesia. <LINK REF="STD-Grandis-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Grandis 1992</LINK> found no difference between the antibiotic and placebo groups in the mean number of days wherein more than five doses of pain medicine was taken (1.8 versus 2.4 respectively), or in the mean number of doses of pain medication (19.45 versus 19.23). <LINK REF="STD-Guerra-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guerra 2008</LINK> reported that 79% and 88% patients in the antibiotic and control groups respectively required analgesic medication with no statistical difference between the groups. Similarly <LINK REF="STD-Khan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 1994</LINK> calculated the number of days taken until no analgesia was needed and found no significant difference (8.2 versus 8.5). However <LINK REF="STD-Colreavy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Colreavy 1999</LINK> found a significant reduction in analgesic consumption with antibiotics. The antibiotic group consumed on average 112 mg/kg of paracetamol in 24 hours as opposed to the control group which used on average 200 mg/kg in the same period (P = 0.038). Given the variability in the parameters used, we could not perform meta-analysis for analgesic consumption.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Postoperative haemorrhage</HEADING>
<P>Seven studies evaluated postoperative haemorrhage and reported incidence rates (<LINK REF="STD-Colreavy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Colreavy 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grandis-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Grandis 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guerra-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guerra 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mann-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mann 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Reilly-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Reilly 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Telian-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Telian 1986</LINK>). Where not clear, correspondence with the first author of the relevant trials clarified the distinction between significant and insignificant but documented haemorrhage. <LINK REF="STD-Cannon-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cannon 1996</LINK> reported that the rate of postoperative haemorrhage was the same in both groups, but did not give the exact incidence rates. We therefore excluded this trial from the meta-analyses for haemorrhage. There was only one primary haemorrhage reported among all seven trials (in the control group in the trial <LINK REF="STD-Khan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 1994</LINK>). No fatality occurred and no bleeding event re-occurred in the same patient.</P>
<P>Among a total of 567 participants, 14 (2.5%) significant and 70 (12.3%) total secondary haemorrhages occurred. This is comparable to rates cited in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Krishna-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishna 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lowe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowe 2004</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Total secondary haemorrhage</HEADING>
<P>We combined data from the seven studies in a meta-analysis for total secondary haemorrhage. We deemed pooling appropriate because the outcome parameters used fulfilled the predefined criteria, precise incidence rates were available and there was excellent overlap of confidence intervals in the forest plot. Meta-analysis confirmed that antibiotics did not reduce the total secondary haemorrhage rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 1.44, P = 0.66) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic revealed minimal heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Significant secondary haemorrhage</HEADING>
<P>With regard to significant secondary haemorrhage, the incidence rate was lower; in fact it was zero in several studies. Confidence intervals were therefore wider and could be derived only for a limited set of data. Nevertheless, the outcome parameter used fulfilled the predefined criteria, which were more rigid than for total haemorrhage, precise outcome data were available and there was good overlap of confidence intervals in the forest plot. Therefore, despite moderate heterogeneity demonstrated by the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic (54%), we combined data in a meta-analysis. This confirmed that antibiotics did not reduce significant secondary haemorrhage rates (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.08 to 3.11, P = 0.45) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). However, unlike for total secondary haemorrhage, the data for significant secondary haemorrhage may be underpowered to detect any difference.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fever</HEADING>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Grandis-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Grandis 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Telian-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Telian 1986</LINK>) used the same parameter (temperature &gt; 99.9 °F) to define fever. Both measured the outcome for the first seven days following surgery. We therefore combined these data in a meta-analysis, which revealed antibiotics to reduce the number of patients manifesting fever (RR with antibiotics 0.63, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.85, P = 0.002) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). There was no heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic = 0%), excellent overlap of the confidence intervals and unidirectional outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Telian-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Telian 1986</LINK> also reported a significant reduction in the mean number of oral temperature recordings more than 100 °F (1.5 versus 2.9, P &lt; 0.05) and more than 101.5 °F (0.02 versus 0.23, P &lt; 0.05), with use of antibiotics. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Cannon-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cannon 1996</LINK> reported a significant reduction in the number of patients with fever (&gt; 99 °F, 6 versus 16, P = 0.003). <LINK REF="STD-Grandis-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Grandis 1992</LINK> reported reduction in the mean number of days with fever (&gt; 99.9 °F) (0.35 versus 0.51, P &gt; 0.05). On the contrary, <LINK REF="STD-Guerra-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guerra 2008</LINK> reported no difference in the percentage of patients in the antibiotic and control groups having fever (48% versus 49%); <LINK REF="STD-Ramos-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ramos 2000</LINK> reported mean of subjective intensity of fever on a scale of 0 to 3, and found no difference (0 versus 0.2); and <LINK REF="STD-Mann-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mann 1999</LINK> reported no significant difference in postoperative fever (no data available).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-10-09 15:02:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The present systematic review suggests that although individual studies vary in their findings, there is no evidence to support a consistent, clinically important impact of antibiotics in reducing the main morbid outcomes following tonsillectomy (i.e. pain, need for analgesia and secondary haemorrhage rates). There is some evidence to suggest that antibiotics may reduce fever. With regard to other secondary outcomes, such as time taken to resume normal diet and activity, there is no clear evidence that antibiotics are beneficial.</P>
<P>These results challenge the widely held rationale for the routine prescription of antibiotics. A causal relationship between bacterial inflammation of the tonsillar fossa and postoperative morbidity, such as pain, need for analgesia and secondary haemorrhage, has not been proven. The difficulty of establishing such a correlation is complicated by the variety of commensals harboured in the oropharyngeal mucosa. This renders bacterial culture results of the postoperative tonsillar fossa as reported in a few studies (<LINK REF="STD-Colreavy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Colreavy 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grandis-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Grandis 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Telian-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Telian 1986</LINK>) difficult to interpret. While some studies show that antibiotics reduce the bacterial count in the postoperative tonsillar fossa (<LINK REF="STD-Colreavy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Colreavy 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grandis-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Grandis 1992</LINK>), a clinical correlation in terms of reduction in morbidity is lacking. This suggests that other proposed mechanisms, such as surgical trauma to the peritonsillar tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Parsons-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoker 2004</LINK>), ensuing inflammatory response to tissue damage (<LINK REF="STD-Akbas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Akbas 2004</LINK>), loss of pharyngeal mucosa with exposed muscle and nerve endings (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Eredita-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Eredita 2004</LINK>), and ensuing nerve irritation and spasm of the pharyngeal muscles (<LINK REF="STD-Akbas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Akbas 2004</LINK>) account for postoperative pain and morbidity, with minimal or nil additional morbidity conferred by bacterial inflammation.</P>
<P>Similarly, secondary haemorrhage is widely assumed to be caused by bacterial infection (<LINK REF="REF-Pai-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pai 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Timms-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Timms 2002</LINK>) and is commonly treated with antibiotics, despite scant evidence to support an infective aetiology (<LINK REF="REF-Pai-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pai 2005</LINK>). Kumar found that of 24 patients with secondary post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage who were not on antibiotics, only four had a positive culture on throat swab (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 1984</LINK>). The current review similarly fails to show that antibiotics protect against secondary haemorrhage and therefore bacterial infection as an aetiology is questionable. A more plausible explanation is that sloughing of the primary eschar, which usually occurs between day five and day 10 in the postoperative period, manifests as secondary haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Krishna-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishna 2001</LINK>). Further support for this theory comes from the large prospective audit of tonsillectomies conducted in England, in which diathermy dissection was found to increase the risk of secondary haemorrhage. The authors conclude that compared to traditional cold steel, diathermy dissection causes more tissue damage and hence a larger eschar formation, thus conferring a higher risk of secondary haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Lowe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowe 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Reduction of fever apparent with antibiotic therapy is likely due to the amelioration of bacteraemia, which is recognised to occur during and immediately after tonsillectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Soldado-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soldado 1998</LINK>). However, given the varying parameters used, no quantification of the reduction in fever is possible and the overall clinical benefit derived is unclear.</P>
<P>The potential for adverse events needs to be considered while prescribing antibiotics. Antibiotic allergy is unpredictable and not dose dependent (<LINK REF="REF-Gruchalla-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gruchalla 2000</LINK>), therefore it is difficult to quantify the risk of allergy in an individual patient precisely (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2002</LINK>). The overall frequency of allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin is cited as 2% per course (<LINK REF="REF-Saxon-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saxon 1987</LINK>). However, a history of allergy to penicillin is elicited in 5% to 20% of the population (<LINK REF="REF-Adkinson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adkinson 1998</LINK>). In this population, the risk of allergy is as high as 60% on re-exposure to beta-lactams (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1977</LINK>) and 13% on exposure to a different antibiotic (<LINK REF="REF-Moseley-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moseley 1991</LINK>). Further, although no major adverse event has been reported in the included trials in this review, anaphylaxis is estimated to occur in 0.01% to 0.05% of all penicillin courses (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberger-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberger 2002</LINK>). Given the frequency and volume of tonsillectomy as a surgical procedure, this small risk of minor and major allergic events may translate into significant harm when balanced against the lack of evidence to support a consistent, clinically important impact of antibiotics. However non-allergic adverse events such as toxicity, side effects and drug interactions may be minimised by reducing the dose or length of treatment, i.e. single perioperative administration (<LINK REF="REF-Gruchalla-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gruchalla 2000</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>The main limitation of this review is the weak methodology of the included trials. First, allocation concealment, the most important criterion in the randomisation process, was adequate in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Reilly-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Reilly 2003</LINK>). Studies with inadequate allocation concealment may overestimate treatment effect by 37% (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>). Second, only five out of the 10 included trials had adequate double-blinding. Unblinded trials are well known to produce bias favouring treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Noseworthy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noseworthy 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002</LINK>), particularly so when subjective outcomes such as pain are assessed (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002</LINK>). Third, intention-to-treat analysis was possible in only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Reilly-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Reilly 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Telian-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Telian 1986</LINK>). There is some evidence to suggest that meta-analyses of trials which do not report all participants by allocated group (i.e. inadequate intention-to-treat analysis) produce results favouring the treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2004</LINK>). It is likely that all these shortcomings have aggregated to produce significant bias favouring antibiotics. Finally, the overall drop-out rate was high. This leaves a large potential for attrition bias, despite a comparable number being lost to follow-up, within each trial, between the study and control groups.</P>
<P>There is also considerable heterogeneity between studies in terms of methodological quality, participants, interventions (type, dose, method and duration of administration of antibiotics) and outcome assessment. This is, however, unlikely to have significantly impacted on the results of this review, as results from individual trials broadly conform to one another, and to the results of meta-analyses, where done. It is, however, not known if the dosage and antibacterial spectrum of antibiotics used in the trials have been adequate or if there exists a dose-response effect. Further, it was not possible to analyse data stratified on the basis of indications for tonsillectomy (i.e. sleep apnoea, recurrent tonsillitis, etc.). Hence it is not clear whether a subgroup of patients exists (i.e. severe recurrent tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess) in whom antibiotics might reduce morbidity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Conclusion</HEADING>
<P>The present review including meta-analyses for select outcomes suggests that there is no evidence to support a consistent, clinically important impact of antibiotics in reducing the main morbid outcomes following tonsillectomy (i.e. pain, need for analgesia and secondary haemorrhage rates). Any limited benefit apparent with antibiotics may be a result of positive bias introduced by several important methodological shortcomings in the included trials. Any putative benefit of antibiotics also needs to be carefully weighed against the risk of adverse events and other negative consequences that are more difficult to evaluate and quantify, such as the possible emergence of resistant bacteria and fungal colonisation and infection.</P>
<P>Based on this review, therefore, we advocate against prescribing antibiotics routinely to all patients undergoing tonsillectomy. Whether a subgroup of patients who might benefit from selective administration of antibiotics exists is unknown and needs to be explored in future trials. Further well-designed trials are recommended to confirm and expand our findings. In future studies, continuous outcome values need to be explicitly stated with mean and SD in order to facilitate meta-analyses.</P>
