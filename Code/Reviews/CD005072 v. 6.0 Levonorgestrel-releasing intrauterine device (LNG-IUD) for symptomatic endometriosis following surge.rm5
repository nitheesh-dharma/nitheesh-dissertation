<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-12-10 09:34:33 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, usually in the pelvis, that can lead to infertility and pelvic pain. It is managed with surgery, hormonal medications, or a combination of both. The progestogen levonorgestrel is one such hormonal medication. The aim of this review was to assess whether the use of a hormone-releasing intrauterine device was beneficial for managing associated painful symptoms and for preventing recurrence of endometriosis following surgery. Although preliminary findings are encouraging, at this stage there is only limited evidence from three randomised trials of a beneficial role with the use of the LNG-IUD in reducing the recurrence of painful periods following surgery for endometriosis. The strength of the evidence was graded as moderate reflecting our belief that future evidence will most likely not change these findings.</P>

<P>Various options exist for treating endometriosis, including surgical, medical, such as ovarian suppression, or a combination of these strategies. Surgical treatment of endometriosis aims to remove visible areas of endometriosis. The aim of medical therapy is to inhibit growth of endometriotic implants by induction of a hypo-estrogenic state.

<P>To determine whether postoperative LNG-IUD insertion in women with endometriosis improves pain and reduces recurrence of symptoms compared with no postoperative treatment, postoperative insertion of a placebo, or postoperative therapy.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-11-27 23:18:48 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The following databases were searched from inception to June 2012: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register of controlled trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. EMBASE was searched from 2010 to June 2012. The citation lists of relevant publications, review articles, abstracts of scientific meetings, and included studies were also searched.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-11-27 23:19:51 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trials were included if they compared women undergoing surgical treatment for endometriosis with uterine preservation and then randomised within three months to LNG-IUD insertion versus no postoperative treatment, placebo (inert IUD), or other treatment. Diagnostic laparoscopy alone was not considered suitable treatment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-11-27 23:20:31 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data to allow for an intention-to-treat analysis. For dichotomous data, the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects method. For continuous data, the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI were calculated using the inverse variance random-effects method.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-27 23:59:23 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three randomised controlled trials were included. In two trials, there was a statistically significant reduction in the recurrence of painful periods in the LNG-IUD group compared with expectant management (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.60, 95 women, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, moderate strength of evidence). The proportion of women who were satisfied with their treatment was also higher in the LNG-IUD group but did not reach statistical significance (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.82, 95 women, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). The number of women reporting a change in menstruation was significantly higher in the LNG-IUD group (RR 37.80, 95% CI 5.40 to 264.60, 95 women, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) but the number of women not completing the allocated treatment did not differ between groups (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.25, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 43%).</P>
<P>In one trial, women receiving LNG-IUD noted lower pain scores compared with women receiving gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (MD -0.16, 95% CI -2.02 to 1.70, 40 women) but this did not reach statistical significance.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-11-27 23:42:35 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endometriosis is defined as the presence of ectopic deposits of endometrial tissue. These deposits usually, but not exclusively, occur in the pelvis and may lead to infertility and pelvic pain. The disease is known to be estrogen dependent (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 1991</LINK>) even though the exact pathogenesis is uncertain. Dysmenorrhea is by far the most frequent symptom reported by women with endometriosis (<LINK REF="REF-Vercellini-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vercellini 1996</LINK>). However, both cyclic and non-cyclic pain as well as deeply painful sexual intercourse, painful passage of stools, and menorrhagia are described; as many as 70% of the women experience some degree of chronic pelvic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Carter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koninckx-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koninckx 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ling-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ling 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Overton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overton 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vercellini-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vercellini 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Endometriosis is a heterogeneous disease with both typical and atypical morphology and a clinical appearance ranging from a mild, singular 1 mm peritoneal implant to extensive and multiple large endometriomata that may cause cul-de-sac obliteration. Transvaginal ultrasound can help establish a presumptive diagnosis of endometriosis but it is less accurate for uterosacral, vaginal, and rectovaginal septum involvement (<LINK REF="REF-Bazot-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bazot 2004</LINK>). A clinical staging system has been developed to allow researchers and clinicians to describe the extent of disease but this requires laparoscopy (<LINK REF="REF-ASRM-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASRM 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Various treatment options exist for endometriosis, including ovarian suppression therapy, surgical treatment, or a combination of these strategies. Surgical treatment of endometriosis aims to remove visible areas of endometriosis and to restore the anatomy by division of adhesions. Surgically there are a number of techniques by which endometriosis can be removed or destroyed, each with potential advantages, disadvantages, and differences in efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Duepree-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duepree 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fedele-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fedele 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ford-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wellbery-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wellbery 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 2000</LINK>). The role of surgery differs depending upon the site of the endometriotic deposits, extent of disease, and reproductive status of the women (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicklin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicklin 1999</LINK>). Surgery may be as conservative as laparoscopic cauterization of endometriotic deposits or as radical as hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy and resection of portions of bowel.</P>
<P>Although the use of laparoscopic treatment has been shown to improve pelvic pain associated with endometriosis, a proportion of women continue to experience pain following laparoscopic surgery or the pain recurs within one to two years after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Crosignani-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crosignani 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacobson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vercellini-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vercellini 2000</LINK>). Therefore, adjuvant medical therapies have been considered in addition to surgery in order to reduce surgical treatment failures. Perioperative medical therapy should theoretically induce resorption of microscopic foci and lesions that could not be surgically removed, reduce the risk of iatrogenic dissemination of endometriotic cells, and improve pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-ASRM-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASRM 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vercellini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Vercellini 2003</LINK>). The aim of medical therapy is to inhibit the growth of endometriotic implants by suppression of ovarian steroids and induction of a hypo-estrogenic state (<LINK REF="REF-Vercellini-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vercellini 1998</LINK>). Anti-estrogens and regimens that induce either a medical menopause (such as gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists) or a pseudo-pregnant state (for example continuous combined oral contraceptive or progestogens) are among the systemic medical therapeutic options used (<LINK REF="REF-Luciano-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luciano 1988</LINK>). Danazol was the main agent used in the 1980s, and GnRH analogues were the standard treatment in the 1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Vercellini-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vercellini 1998</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-09-24 22:47:29 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUD) provides an alternative means of administering progestogens. Levonorgestrel is a 19-nortestosterone that induces decidualisation and acyclic endometrium, and atrophy of endometriotic tissue.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-11-27 23:46:31 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Locally administered levonorgestrel acts through the intrauterine system and has a profound effect on the endometrium, which becomes atrophic and inactive while ovulation is usually not suppressed (<LINK REF="REF-Crosignani-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crosignani 1997</LINK>). Its effects are predominantly localized to the endometrium with the high concentrations of levonorgestrel inducing atrophy and pseudo-decidualisation (<LINK REF="REF-Maruo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maruo 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silverberg-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverberg 1986</LINK>). The systemic levels following LNG-IUD administration are less than those achieved with therapeutic oral or parenteral doses of progestogens (<LINK REF="REF-Du-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Du 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fedele-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fedele 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luciano-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luciano 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moghissi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moghissi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 1978</LINK>) hence side effects should theoretically be less severe. When provided immediately or very soon after surgical removal or ablation of endometriotic patches, levonorgestrel is expected to suppress the regeneration of endometriosis.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-11-27 23:47:46 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although systemic drugs are effective, side effects commonly affect compliance or preclude long-term use. The need for regular administration may result in further poor compliance, which undermines the efficacy of the intervention. In addition, the low estrogen state associated with GnRH analogues may induce acceleration of the loss of bone mineral density (<LINK REF="REF-Sagsveen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sagsveen 2003</LINK>). A Cochrane review of the use of perioperative medical therapy for women with endometriosis did not find evidence that medical therapy in association with surgery was associated with a significant benefit with regard to any of the pre-determined outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Furness-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furness 2004</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-28 00:16:32 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The insertion of an LNG-IUD significantly reduced the incidence of recurrence of painful periods in women with endometriosis compared to no postoperative treatment. The intensity of pain was similar for women receiving LNG-IUD or a GnRH analogue.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-11-28 00:19:30 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this updated Cochrane review support the findings from the previous reports that LNG-IUD insertion is associated with preferable patient outcomes compared with no postoperative treatment. Additionally, its use seems to be similar to the results found with the use of systemic GnRH analogue treatment. From a methodological perspective, additional properly randomised and reported long-term trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this method of therapy. The included trials lacked proper reporting on all aspects of potential biases thereby limiting the internal validity of the results. Furthermore, as most were short-term trials, it is not clear whether patient compliance over a prolonged period might affect the overall results. Even so, the consistent results presented by the trials regarding the decreased incidence of recurrence of painful periods is encouraging. Finally, it should be noted that the majority of outcomes were not analysed due to unavailability of data, and even those that were analysed came from only three small trials that compared LNG-IUD insertion to no postoperative treatment or a GnRH analogue.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-11-28 00:20:25 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available data came from three small trials that included only 135 women. One of the trials was at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding (open-label study) and two were at an unclear risk of bias because blinding may have been compromised or not reported. <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> shows a moderate strength of evidence for recurrence of painful symptoms.

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-11-28 00:21:23 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All of the evidence from the included trials were homogenous and in line with the results of this review. Even studies that did not meet our inclusion criteria had similar conclusions. As a case in point, one study was identified that compared the LNG-IUD with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) (<LINK REF="STD-Petta-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Petta 2005</LINK>) but was excluded because women commenced treatment up to two years after surgery. Both treatments were found to be similarly effective in the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis. The authors concluded that the advantage of an LNG-IUD over the GnRHa was the avoidance of low estrogen levels and the need for only one medical intervention every five years. Additionally, two systematic reviews on the use of LNG-IUD in women with chronic pelvic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Anpalagan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anpalagan 2008</LINK>) and endometriosis (<LINK REF="REF-Bahamondes-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bahamondes 2007</LINK>) reached similar conclusions to this review.</P>

<P>Well-designed and sufficiently powered RCTs are needed to support these initial findings. Additionally, trials are needed to investigate the comparative effectiveness of LNG-IUD with active systemic treatment. Researchers undertaking these studies need to consider randomising women at the time of surgery, or in the few months immediately following surgery, and to continue the follow-up so that recurrence of endometriosis, need for further surgery, and fertility outcomes can also be evaluated.</P>
