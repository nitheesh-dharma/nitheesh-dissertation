<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-22 10:21:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When preterm or low birth weight infants are too immature or unwell to suck feeds they can receive their milk through a feeding tube passed via either the nose or the mouth. Although tubes placed via the nose may be more stable and less prone to displace than tubes passed via the mouth, there is concern that nasal tubes will partially obstruct breathing. Only three small trials were found that compared these two options and these did not find convincing evidence to support routine use of one route rather than the other.</P>

<P>We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by two review authors.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-17 14:12:20 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three studies fulfilled the review eligibility criteria. Two were parallel group trials (<A HREF="van Someren 1984">van Someren 1984</A>; <A HREF="Dsilna 2005">Dsilna 2005</A>) and one was a cross-over trial (<A HREF="Bohnhorst 2010">Bohnhorst 2010</A>). The two parallel group randomised controlled trials enrolled 88 preterm infants. Only one trial reported data on the pre-specified primary outcomes for this review. This trial found no evidence of effect on the time taken to establish enteral feeding or the time taken to regain birth weight. However, the trial was underpowered to exclude modest effect sizes. We identified one randomised cross-over trial in which 35 very preterm infants participated. This study did not find any statistically significant effects on the incidence of apnoea, desaturation, and bradycardia during the study period.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-17 14:15:19 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Julie Watson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-11-07 12:55:30 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The establishment of safe oral feeding in preterm or low birth weight infants may be delayed because of poor co-ordination of sucking and swallowing, neurological immaturity and respiratory distress.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-11-07 12:55:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Enteral feeds may be delivered through a catheter (feeding tube) passed via the nose or via the mouth into the stomach or upper small intestine. There are potential advantages and disadvantages to both the nasal and oral routes for enteral feeding tube placement. Policy and practice varies between and within neonatal care units (<LINK REF="REF-Shiao-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shiao 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Birnbaum-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birnbaum 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gregory-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregory 2012</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-01-17 14:12:42 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Enteral feeding tubes passed via the nose are easier to secure to the face than orally placed tubes. However, since newborn infants are obligate nose breathers, feeding tubes placed via the nose can cause partial nasal obstruction, which increases airway resistance and work of breathing (<LINK REF="REF-Stocks-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stocks 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenspan-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenspan 1990</LINK>). Airway resistance may differ between infants of similar weights due to differences in nasal size and structure. Naso-enteric intubation through the larger nostril may increase airway resistance as the infant is forced to breathe through an airway of smaller calibre. This increase in energy expenditure may potentially affect nutrient requirements and growth.</P>
<P>Orally placed enteral tubes are more frequently malpositioned compared to nasally placed tubes (<LINK REF="REF-Ellett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellett 1998</LINK>). Incorrect placement, or subsequent displacement, of feeding tubes into the lower oesophagus or into the lung can lead to aspiration, respiratory compromise, and increased energy expenditure. Furthermore, orally placed tubes may be easier to displace as they can loop inside the mouth. Repetitive movement of the orally placed tube may result in mucosal trauma and may increase the incidence of apnoea and bradycardia due to vagal stimulation. Similarly, orally placed duodenal and jejunal tubes may be easier to displace proximally, potentially increasing the risk of aspiration and respiratory compromise.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-01-17 14:15:19 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the potential for the route of enteral tube placement to affect important outcomes for preterm or low birth weight infants, we have attempted to detect, appraise and synthesise the available evidence from randomised controlled trials to inform practice and research.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-van-Someren-1984" TYPE="STUDY">van Someren 1984</LINK> enrolled 42 preterm infants who required feeding via an enteral feeding tube. Gestational age at birth ranged from 30 to 34 weeks. Infants were randomised to receive either naso-enteric or oro-enteric feeding. Some of the infants in each group received transpyloric feeds, but the report of the trial does not state how many. The oral feeding tube was secured to the palate with a grooved orthodontic appliance (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1981</LINK>). Infants were recruited to the trial at a postnatal age of between one and 12 days and remained in the study until breast or bottle-feeding had been established. The primary outcome of the trial was the incidence of episodes of periodic breathing and central apnoea assessed by respiratory and polygraphic monitoring on the third and seventh days after randomisation. The investigators also assessed rate of weight gain during the first two weeks of participation, the incidence of local complications such as oral ulceration, and a composite 'sickness score' (mainly a score of the need for and duration of respiratory support).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK> recruited 46 infants (gestational age &lt; 30 weeks or birth weight &lt; 1200 g) who required feeding via an enteral feeding tube. Infants were randomly allocated to either gavage feeding via a nasogastric or an orogastric tube until 32 weeks' postmenstrual age. Subsequently, all infants were fed via the orogastric route. The outcomes assessed were nutrient intake during the trial period, time to achieve full enteral feeding, time to regain birth weight, and the incidence of various neonatal morbidities (including necrotising enterocolitis).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-17 14:15:19 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are only limited data available from two small parallel group randomised controlled trials and one cross-over trial on the effect of the nasal versus the oral route for placing feeding tubes in preterm or low birth weight infants. These trials had some methodological limitations including lack of blinding of caregivers and assessors and incomplete follow-up assessment. The trials did not find evidence that the route of placement of enteral feeding tubes affects important outcomes.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-01-17 14:15:19 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The identified trials were small, contained methodological weaknesses, and did not report all important outcomes. None of the trials reported the incidence of non-intentional removal or displacement of feeding tube, yet this is the most commonly expressed anxiety from parents attempting to perform this activity on the neonatal unit or when discharged home with an infant receiving enteral tube feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Howell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howell 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We excluded two trials that compared feeding with indwelling nasogastric tubes versus intermittently placed orogastric tubes (<LINK REF="STD-Symington-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Symington 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kublick-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kublick 2011</LINK>). This co-intervention (leaving the nasogastric tube in place versus replacing the orogastric tube at each feed) prevents independent assessment of the effects of nasal versus oral tube placement. However, it may be that this comparison is viewed as pragmatic by some clinicians, caregivers and parents and that a separate or subgroup review of trials of these two approaches is merited.</P>
<P>It may also be appropriate to consider whether the route of placement of feeding tubes affects other outcomes including infant distress during placement, and parental views. These might include parental perceptions of ease of placement and security, especially given that infants may be discharged home with a feeding tube in situ (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2003</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-01-17 14:16:54 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included trials contained various methodological weaknesses (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-van-Someren-1984" TYPE="STUDY">van Someren 1984</LINK>, the method of randomisation was not stated so it is possible that allocation was not concealed and the assignment of infants to one or other feeding route could have been predicted. This may have allowed bias in allocation of infants that could have affected the outcomes independently of the intervention. The mean postnatal age of entry into the study was two days for the nasal group compared to six days for the oral group. This difference may have been a factor in the lower rate of weight gain in the nasal group during the first seven days of assessment. More infants in the oral group would have already transitioned through the normal postnatal weight loss that occurs during the first week of postnatal life, whereas many infants in the nasal group were still in this postnatal weight loss phase. The difference in weight gain was not sustained during the second week of the study period. Furthermore, the finding of a difference in the frequency of apnoea identified on the seventh day after entry into the trial should also be interpreted cautiously. Follow-up assessment was incomplete and the definition of apnoea used in the trial was different from that of consensus agreements of the definition of clinically significant apnoea. Finally, oral placement of the feeding tube relied on the use of a palatal appliance to secure the tube thus limiting the applicability of the study findings to the more common practice of securing orally placed tubes at the lips.</P>
<P>The second parallel group trial was more methodologically rigorous but assessed only short-term outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Dsilna-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dsilna 2005</LINK>). The trial did not provide any evidence of effect on the time taken to establish enteral feeds, weight gain during the early neonatal period, or time taken to wean from oxygen supplementation. However, only 46 infants in total participated and the trial was underpowered to exclude modest but plausible effect sizes.</P>
<P>The cross-over trial used a computer-generated random sequence to determine the sequence in which infant received naso-enteric versus oro-enteric feeding (<LINK REF="STD-Bohnhorst-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bohnhorst 2010</LINK>). The method of allocation concealment was not stated but this may be less important as a source of bias given that all infants received both interventions and acted as their own 'internal' controls. Caregivers were aware of the feeding route but the assessment of respiratory monitor recordings was undertaken blind to the identity of the infant and the feeding route. Although 32 of 35 infants completed the assessment, the three excluded infants all had episodes of apnoea and desaturation or bradycardia sufficient to require respiratory support. Inclusion of outcomes data for these infants may have altered the findings of the trial.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-10-23 10:51:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The data recovered in this review do not provide sufficient evidence to inform policy or practice regarding whether the nasal versus the oral route of enteral feeding tube placement is preferable for preterm or low birth weight infants. The trials do not provide evidence that the route of feeding tube placement affects feed tolerance (time to achieve full enteral feeds) or the incidence or frequency of apnoea or desaturation or bradycardia. In current practice, the decision regarding the route of tube placement seems to be based on clinician preference and local or regional precedence (<LINK REF="REF-Birnbaum-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birnbaum 2009</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-11-07 12:11:50 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A large randomised controlled trial would be needed to determine if the use of nasally compared with orally placed feeding tubes improves feeding and growth without increasing adverse consequences in preterm or low birth weight infants. Such trials should probably focus on very low birth weight or very preterm infants since this population is more likely to be affected by respiratory compromise and other adverse events associated with feeding tube placement. Engagement with parent and family advocates is needed to inform the development of these trials and ensure that the strategies for nutrition support are consistent with the ethos of family-centred care and that the outcomes assessed are those of most importance to infants and families (<LINK REF="REF-POPPY-Steering-Group-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">POPPY Steering Group 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Howell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howell 2011</LINK>).</P>
