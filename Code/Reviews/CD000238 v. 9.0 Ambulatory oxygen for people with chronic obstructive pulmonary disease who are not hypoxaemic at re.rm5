I would suggest that you remove 1.6 as a Forest plot (as it based on a transformation with assumptions that may not be met in this cross-over study) and just report what the authors say in their paper in the text of the review. I think you are also wise not to combine the N-of-1 results with the cross-over study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma's notes 13/02/2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDonald is included in PAL-COP. Becasue PAL-COP is about non-hypoxaemic people, I checked the inclusion criteria and the characteristics of included studies I wonder if any of the following should actually be included? maybe the inclusion criteria should be changed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eaton should be excluded? 9.2 kPa = 69 mmHg and cor pulmonale is not stated&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;McDonald again inclusion criteria are kPa &amp;gt; 60 and cor pulmonale not stated, although participants had exertional dyspnoea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moore kPa &amp;gt; 7.3 kPa equates to &amp;gt; 57.7 mmHg no co-morbidities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nonayama - inclusion criteria is simply 'do not meet LTOT criteria' and I thought this review was about people who met those criteria?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faisal: The inclusion criteria for this review actually has four 'or' options, being:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) patients with hypoxaemia without &lt;i&gt;cor pulmonale&lt;/i&gt; (i.e. cor pulmonale is failure of the right side of the heart caused by an increase in blood pressure in the pulmonary artery, the vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs), or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) PaO&amp;#8322; &lt;u&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/u&gt; 60 mmHg, or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) patients developed hypoxaemia on activity (PaO&amp;#8322; &amp;lt; 60 mmHg or desaturates to &amp;lt; 88% SpO&amp;#8322;) with &lt;i&gt;cor pulmonale &lt;/i&gt;and developed symptoms on exertion, or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) patients developed hypoxaemia on activity (PaO&amp;#8322; &amp;lt; 60 mmHg or desaturates to &amp;lt; 88% SpO&amp;#8322;) or without &lt;i&gt;cor pulmonale &lt;/i&gt;and developed symptoms on exertion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such we believe all studies identified for inclusion in this review do actually meet our pre-specified criteria. Happy to discuss further if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plain language summary - there are some new guidelines for this - I have reformatted it for you - can you complete please&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faisal: Yes, completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General comment: the comparison group you are calling placebo. In the review 'Symptomatic oxygen for non-hypoxaemic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, they used the term 'medical air'.' Do you think this is better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faisal: Yes, agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Types of interventions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;what is meant by co-interventions in the following sentence? &amp;quot;Eligible control groups were placebo air cylinders, usual medical care or&lt;u&gt; co-interventions.&lt;/u&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faisal :co-intervention mean other treament modalities( other than placebo or usual medical care) such as counselling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changed wording around long term interventions to over two weeks. This is because you talk about less than 6 months follow-up being short term, so it doesn't work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faisal :Yes , we agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;unit of analysis issues &lt;/b&gt;- says there were no cross-overs - but what about McDonald 1995?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faisal: Sorry, we changed the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;included studies &lt;/b&gt;- please can you provide a brief note about the n of 1 study design? It's uncommon so it would help the reader if you could briefly summarise it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faisal: Done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;effects of interventions - &lt;/b&gt;QoL - what about the total CRQ score? was it reported? If not, do you suspect the trialist were trying to present the statistically significant results?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faisal: Yes, all studies reported CRQ score( with mean and SD).Because, we have parallel and cross-over trials we have convert data into GIV to combine these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion -&lt;/b&gt; high I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for QoL. This needs to be mentioned in this section and not just brought into the discussion. Was there underlying clinical heterogeneity? If so I would suggest you state this and present the random effects model instead. I would say that the I2 value is high in all domains of the CRQ, not just when its over 60%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faisal: After Chris's suggested change for the CRQ Forest plot, none of the CRQ sub-groups have an I-squared statistic of above&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;60%, as per our pre-specified heterogeneity cut off. This section has now been deleted from the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;data and analysis - &lt;/b&gt;can you make the label for analysis 1.6 match that in the text currently desaturation - but should it be &amp;quot;Arterial oxygen saturation during exercise&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faisal: corrected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is a clunky sentence (double negative) which I tried to edit. Highlighted - please check&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faisal:Done, thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;n-value - what is this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faisal: n-value mean sample size or total number of studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;The overall quality of included studies in this review were good,&amp;quot; what do you mean by good? You go on to say that the methods were not well-reported, so now sure how you assessed this? can you stick to using terms from the summary of findings table e.g. low-moderate-high quality please&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faisal: Corrected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews &lt;/b&gt;- the yellow text is basically re-stating the results of the review again. Are there any other reviews/guidelines you could cite and say whether your review agreed with them? You talk about current clinical practice in the conclusions, so it would be helpful to explain what current clinical practice is here or in the background (or both!)&lt;span&gt; reference Abernathy 2011 Cochrane review: &lt;/span&gt;Symptomatic oxygen for non-hypoxaemic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faisal : Done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary of findings table&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;suggest adding hospitalisation, adverse events, dyspnoea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;include only one line for quality of life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faisal: Following discussions with all co-authors we think our primary outcomes (i.e. mortality and exercise capacity) in addition to QOL CRQ are the key issues in COPD. Also, none of the studies report hospitalisation data, adverse events were not pre-specified as outcomes in the included studies and dyspnoea is included in the sub-set of the CRQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;characteristics of included studies&lt;/b&gt; - it's now expected that the notes section contain a statement about the funding of the trial - can you add please and make a brief factual comment in the included studies section&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faisal :done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.1&lt;br&gt;14/8/2001&lt;br&gt;Technical Editing by CJC&lt;br&gt;1. Totals removed from QOL outcomes to prevent multiple counting.&lt;br&gt;2. Metaview checked and reported results all match. Labels look fine. Totals altered for each trial to 9 and 26 (not 18 and 52 as shown in RevMan as the trials are cross-overs). Also CI changed to read x to y not x - y to avoid confusion.&lt;br&gt;This is now ready for Paul&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2015-01-26 12:59:02 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh" REVIEW_NO="AOX-COP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.3.5 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="9.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-01-26 11:12:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Some people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have low oxygen levels in their blood when they are resting or when moving. Low oxygen levels are known as hypoxaemia. These patients can carry around an oxygen supply (oxygen in small cylinders, portable liquid oxygen systems or battery-powered oxygen concentrators) so that they have oxygen to breathe to make simple tasks such as getting dressed, leaving the house, doing chores or even walking around their own home easier, and to help them to breathe. This portable oxygen device is referred to as 'ambulatory oxygen.'</P>
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>We conducted this review to find out the long-term benefit of ambulatory oxygen therapy for people who are not severely hypoxaemic at rest.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>We looked at randomised controlled trials that compared ambulatory oxygen versus a placebo (normal air). We found four studies on 331 people with a mean age of 71 years. Two of the included studies were from Australia, one from New Zealand and one from Canada. The method of oxygen delivery and the dose of oxygen varied, although equipment in all instances consisted of light-weight or portable cylinders with flow ranging from 3 L/min to 6 L/min. Final follow-up was reported as 12 weeks for three studies and two weeks for the Nonoyama study.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>We found that ambulatory oxygen therapy reduced breathlessness and decreased the number of patients who felt tired. However, the distance that people could walk in five to six minutes and survival (death rate) did not change.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>The overall quality of evidence from the studies in this review was moderate. The way the studies were conducted (methods) was not fully reported in all cases. Most studies were lacking the pre-published study plan (protocol).<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Bottom line</B>
<BR/>From this review, it is not possible to know whether ambulatory oxygen therapy should be provided during exercise or for day-to-day activities for patients with COPD who are not severely hypoxaemic at rest.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-05-27 10:05:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often become transiently hypoxaemic (low oxygen levels in blood) on exercise, necessitating oxygen therapy to improve breathlessness and exercise capacity and to reduce disability. Ambulatory oxygen therapy refers to provision of oxygen therapy during exercise and activities of daily living. Ambulatory oxygen therapy is often used by patients on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) during exercise or by non-LTOT users with or without resting hypoxaemia when they show evidence of exercise de-saturation and demonstrate improvement in exercise capacity with supplemental oxygen.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-05-27 10:05:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the longer-term efficacy of ambulatory oxygen therapy only in patients with COPD who do not meet the criteria for LTOT, with respect to improvement in exercise capacity, mortality, quality of life and other relevant measures of improvement.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-05-27 10:05:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, was searched. Online clinical trial registers, including Controlled Clinical Trials (www.controlled-trials.com), government registries (clinicaltrials.gov) and World Health Organization (WHO) registries (www.who.int/trialsearch), were screened for ongoing and recently completed studies. Bibliographies of included studies were searched for additional trials that may meet the inclusion criteria and were not retrieved by the above search strategy. Authors of identified trials were contacted to provide other published and unpublished studies. Searches were current as of November 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-05-27 10:05:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compare ambulatory oxygen therapy provided through portable oxygen cylinders/battery-powered devices or liquid oxygen canisters versus placebo air cylinders, usual medical care or co-intervention in study participants with COPD who did not meet criteria for LTOT.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-05-27 10:05:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four studies met the inclusion criteria (331 participants), with two studies producing a statistically and clinically significant benefit in favour of the intervention for dyspnoea post exercise.The quality of life domain for all four included studies produced a statistically significant benefit for the subcategories of dyspnoea and fatigue, in favour of the oxygen group (dyspnoea mean difference (MD) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10 to 0.45; P value 0.002; fatigue MD 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.31; P value 0.009). No evidence of any effect was reported for survival, and limited benefits were observed for exercise capacity (as measured by step test and distance walk test), with one study showing a statistically significant improvement in the number of steps taken in the oxygen group for group N-of-1 studies only. No other statistically significant benefits were observed for exercise capacity among the other trials or individual N-of-1 studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-05-27 10:05:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In patients with COPD with moderate hypoxia, current evidence on ambulatory oxygen therapy reveals improvements in dyspnoea post exercise and in the dyspnoea and fatigue domain of quality of life. However, evidence for the clinical utility and effectiveness of ambulatory oxygen in improving mortality and exercise capacity was not evident in this review. Methodologically rigorous RCTs with sufficient power to detect a difference are required to investigate the role of ambulatory oxygen in the management of COPD.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-21 15:16:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-05-27 10:06:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) primarily consists of chronic bronchitis and emphysema&#8212;conditions that are characterised by inflammation of the airways and destruction of pulmonary tissue. The diagnosis of COPD is based on documentation of a postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>)/forced vital capacity (FVC) less than 70% of that predicted in an otherwise healthy person (<LINK REF="REF-Rabe-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 2007</LINK>). COPD has variable illness trajectories characterised by worsening breathlessness, exercise limitations and progressive deterioration of quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Seamark-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seamark 2007</LINK>). Exertional de-saturation (i.e. oxygen level in the blood decreases during exercise) and dyspnoea (breathlessness) are the markers of poor prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Tham-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tham 2011</LINK>). The mechanisms behind exertional hypoxaemia include ventilation/perfusion mismatch, shunting and limitations in diffusion capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Tham-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tham 2011</LINK>). Many patients with COPD identify exertional dyspnoea as the key factor in functional decline (<LINK REF="STD-Nonoyama-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nonoyama 2007</LINK>). As the condition progresses, some patients become transiently hypoxaemic with exercise, necessitating oxygen therapy to attempt to improve breathlessness and exercise capacity, and to reduce disability (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-05-27 10:06:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ambulatory oxygen therapy refers to provision of oxygen during exercise, activities of daily living or both. It is often used during exercise by patients on long-term oxygen treatment (LTOT) or by non-LTOT users without resting hypoxaemia when they show evidence of oxygen de-saturation and demonstrate improvement in exercise capacity with supplemental oxygen (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2006</LINK>). Ambulatory oxygen therapy is usually provided in small oxygen cylinders lasting up to four hours at 2 L/min or through liquid oxygen systems that have a higher oxygen-carrying capacity lasting around six to 10 hours at 2 L/min (<LINK REF="STD-Bradley-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bradley 2007</LINK>). Ambulatory oxygen therapy can also be dispensed in an oxygen-conserving device (OCD) and with battery-powered portable oxygen concentrators. OCDs deliver bolus amounts of oxygen in response to the patient&#8217;s inspiratory effort (or demand), as detected through a nasal cannula (<LINK REF="REF-Katsenos-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katsenos 2011</LINK>). This system of oxygen delivery not only improves the duration of supply, it also improves the cost/benefit ratio of oxygen treatment. The battery-powered oxygen device weighs approximately 2 kg, which is about half the weight of an oxygen cylinder. The rationale of using these lightweight devices is that they improve compliance and facilitate ambulation; however, no known studies have validated this assumption to date.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-06-02 14:51:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kristin V Carson">
<P>Ambulatory oxygen has been shown to improve pulmonary hypertension and reduce dynamic hyperinflation in patients with COPD (<LINK REF="STD-Fujimoto-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fujimoto 2002</LINK>). Ambulatory oxygen may also delay diaphragmatic muscle fatigue and reduce lactic acidosis (<LINK REF="REF-Garrod-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garrod 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>

<P>The prevalence of COPD is increasing worldwide, and COPD is associated with a variety of adverse effects for patients and the healthcare system. Dyspnoea, one of the most common symptoms of COPD, can be present at rest or during exercise, and this can ultimately lead to reduced quality of life. Exercise training and supplemental oxygen (in advanced cases) are generally recommended for control of dyspnoea symptoms during exercise (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1999</LINK>). LTOT is usually prescribed for patients with severe hypoxia (i.e. partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO&#8322;) &lt; 55 mmHg or PaO&#8322; of 55 to 59 mmHg with evidence of right heart failure). Current evidence suggests that LTOT improves survival and quality of life for these hypoxaemic patients with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Ringbaek-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ringbaek 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoller-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoller 2010</LINK>). However, a significant proportion of patients with COPD do not have severe resting hypoxia but develop symptoms of severe hypoxia with exercise. Some studies suggest that in patients with stable COPD, 4% de-saturation during the six-minute walk test may predict long-term mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Casanova-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casanova 2008</LINK>). Unfortunately longer-term effects on survival time or quality of life of ambulatory oxygen in people with COPD with resting mild to moderate hypoxia and exertional dyspnoea or hypoxia remain unclear. Most relevant studies are inconclusive or have provided a short intervention period, used a small sample size or both (<LINK REF="STD-Jolly-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jolly 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1995</LINK>). Hence it is important to perform a systematic review of trials of interventions to assess the current level of evidence for long-term ambulatory oxygen in this particular population.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Exercise capacity</HEADING>
<P>Four studies on 267 randomly assigned participants (n = 331 when doubling up for cross-over and N-of-1 studies) reported exercise capacity through 'minute walking distance' via six-minute walking distance (6MWD) (<LINK REF="STD-Eaton-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Eaton 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2011</LINK>) or five-minute walking distance (5MWD) (<LINK REF="STD-Nonoyama-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nonoyama 2007</LINK>). In the Eaton study, exercise capacity was assessed as an acute and short-term response and therefore could not be analysed in this review of 'long-term' treatment. The manuscript provides P values only for the impact of distance walked on oxygen, depending on long-term use of cylinder air or oxygen (P value 0.9); therefore we have not included in the meta-analysis the results of the 6MWD from the <LINK REF="STD-Eaton-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Eaton 2002</LINK> study. From the remaining three studies, the 6MWD outcome was split into three categories, depending on whether exercise capacity was assessed through 6MWD using cylinder air or oxygen or a cylinder similar to the one participants had used while they were at home. When exercise capacity was assessed through 6MWD using cylinder air (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2011</LINK>) or cylinder oxygen (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1995</LINK>), no statistically or clinically significant benefit was seen to favour the intervention group (cylinder air MD 1.19, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.77; P value 0.38; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; cylinder oxygen MD 1.27, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.39; P value 0.63; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Authors of the <LINK REF="STD-Nonoyama-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nonoyama 2007</LINK> study reported a statistically significant improvement in the number of steps taken by participants when on oxygen compared with placebo for group N-of-1 RCTs (MD 14.90, 95% CI 0.85 to 28.94; P value 0.04); however, no statistically significant effect was observed for individual N-of-1 RCTs. A step exercise test was also performed in the <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1995</LINK> study, and no difference was observed between groups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Mortality</HEADING>
<P>Two studies on 179 participants (of whom 86 were on oxygen and 93 on air) reported deaths during the study periods. Two people in the intervention group of <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1995</LINK> died (cerebrovascular accident and overwhelming pneumonia), as did one participant in the intervention group of <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2011</LINK>. Although deaths occurred only in the intervention arms of these studies, they were not believed to be a result of the intervention. When data were pooled in a meta-analysis, the outcome favoured the control group; however this was not statistically significant (RR 4.17, 95% CI 0.48 to 36.32; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dyspnoea scores</HEADING>
<P>Dyspnoea was measured in three studies using the Borg scale, with <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1995</LINK> (52 participants) reporting on dyspnoea during the 6MWD (MD -0.60, 95% CI -1.39 to 0.19) and during the step exercise test (MD -0.60, 95% CI -1.28 to 0.08; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). A statistically significant improvement in acute post-6MWD dyspnoea scores was reported with cylinder oxygen by authors for the <LINK REF="STD-Eaton-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Eaton 2002</LINK> study (cylinder oxygen 4.1 ± 1.8; cylinder air 4.8 ± 1.5; P value 0.005; 39 participants); however, over the six-week study period, no difference in dyspnoea that was dependent on whether participants were assigned to cylinder air or cylinder oxygen was observed on cylinder oxygen. The <LINK REF="STD-Nonoyama-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nonoyama 2007</LINK> study also produced a statistically significant reduction in dyspnoea scores for the oxygen group post 5MWD compared with placebo (MD -0.44, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.02; P value &lt; 0.05; 27 participants). </P>

<P>One cross-over study with 26 participants (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1995</LINK>) measured arterial oxygen saturation during exercise for the 6MWD (MD -0.60, 95% CI -2.32 to 1.12) and for the step exercise test (MD -0.60, 95% CI -2.32 to 1.12), neither of which produced a statistically or clinically significant difference between groups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>

A statistically significant difference favoured the oxygen group for the pooled dyspnoea component (MD 0.28, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.45; P value 0.002) and the fatigue component (MD 0.17, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.32; P value 0.009). However, pooled results for emotional function (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.25) and mastery (MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.33) showed no evidence of an effect (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-05-27 10:41:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary aim of this review was to assess the effects of ambulatory oxygen in people with COPD who have exertional hypoxia or are not hypoxic at rest. All of the included studies reported as an outcome the primary outcome for this review, exercise capacity, leading to the overall sample size of 331 participants. All four studies reported this outcome as distance walked during the 6MWT or the 5MWT. Although the meta-analysis favoured the intervention group, benefit did not reach statistical or clinical significance. One study not included in the meta-analysis did produce statistically significant improvements in the oxygen group in the 5MWT for group N-of-1 studies; however, this effect was not observed for individual N-of-1 studies. Mortality, the other primary outcome in our review, was reported by only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2011</LINK>). Overall, three deaths were reported in the intervention group; however, these events were not statistically significant, and the deaths were unlikely to be caused by the intervention. It is difficult to interpret mortality on the basis of results from cross-over studies and follow-up of short duration; therefore, these results are limited and should be interpreted with caution. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Eaton-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Eaton 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nonoyama-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nonoyama 2007</LINK>) reported dyspnoea post exercise (6MWT or 5MWT), and both studies indicated statistically and clinically significant benefits in favour of oxygen. One study (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1995</LINK>) reported dyspnoea and oxygen de-saturation during 6MWT and exercise testing; however, no significant change was noted. Quality of life was reported by all four included studies using the CRQ. Statistically significant improvement was observed for the dyspnoea and fatigue domains, although no significant improvements were noted for emotional function or mastery. Adverse events were reported by two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Eaton-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Eaton 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1995</LINK>). None of the included studies reported incidents of oxygen-related fire or CO&#8322; retention. Although three participants in one control group reported muscular pain related to pulling cylinders, no significant difference was observed in the pooled analysis. Length of stay, rate of hospitalisation and spirometry were not reported in any of included studies.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-01-26 11:20:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite an extensive literature search and the high burden of disease in the community, only four studies met our inclusion criteria. The primary aim of this review was to address the possible benefit of supplementary/ambulatory oxygen in mildly to moderately hypoxic patients for exercise capacity and mortality. Although only four studies met the inclusion criteria of this review, the overall sample size for the primary outcome of exercise capacity was moderate (n = 331). Other outcomes such as quality of life, dyspnoea and adverse events were not consistently reported amongst the included studies. We report a statistically significant mean difference of 0.28 (0.1 to 0.45) for the pooled dyspnoea component of the CRQ, favouring the oxygen group. However, this improvement needs to be interpreted in relation to the known minimally important difference (MID)of 0.5.This review provides a reasonable pooled analysis of relevant outcomes for the population with COPD requiring ambulatory oxygen; however, methodologically sound trials of sufficient power to allow confidence in the results are lacking. Good methodological rigour would include publication of a prespecified protocol outlining trial design, adequate sequence generation, randomisation, blinding (for participants and for outcome assessors) and transparent reporting of appropriate outcomes at baseline in a format suitable for meta-analysis (e.g. mean and corresponding standard deviation and sample size).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-01-26 11:21:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall quality of included studies in this review was moderate. Methodology not always explicitly reported.Most included studies did report the methods used to blind assessors and participants from allocation; however, not enough information was provided for assessment of incomplete outcome data in two of four studies. Also, most studies did not have a prepublished protocol, which again increases the potential for selective outcome reporting. Sensitivity analysis was not conducted, as none of the included studies were assessed to be at high risk of bias.</P>

<P>No significant biases were anticipated or were found to occur during the review process. Criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>were strictly followed to limit the potential for bias during screening, data extraction and analyses of included studies. Risk of bias was independently assessed by two review authors, and conflicts were resolved by discussion with a third review author. Corresponding authors of one included study (<LINK REF="STD-Nonoyama-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nonoyama 2007</LINK>) were contacted for raw data and clarification of methodological techniques. In response to <LINK REF="FBK-01" TYPE="FEEDBACK">Feedback 1</LINK>, a second study author team were contacted for clarification of methodology (<LINK REF="STD-Moore-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2011</LINK>).

<P>The utility of ambulatory oxygen in patients who do not fulfil the criteria for continuous long-term oxygen therapy is controversial. Similar to this review, the previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Ram-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2002</LINK>) derived no firm conclusion from available evidence about the effectiveness of this intervention in patients with COPD and mild hypoxaemia. Our review does not fully support the prescription of ambulatory oxygen in patients with moderate hypoxaemia and exercise de-saturation, per guidelines of the British Thoracic Society (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2006</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-08-29 12:13:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>As a result of the limitations in methodological quality for some studies (due to lack of reporting) and lack of evidence to determine treatment effect on exercise capacity, mortality and quality of life, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the use of ambulatory oxygen therapy in patients not meeting criteria for LTOT. However some statistical benefits were observed for dyspnoea post exercise and for the dyspnoea and fatigue domains of the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire. Prescription of ambulatory oxygen therapy is recommended in current clinical practice guidelines for patients with moderate hypoxaemia (PaO&#8322; &gt; 7.3 kPa) who are not on LTOT but do show exercise de-saturation (with a fall in SpO&#8322; of 4% to a value &lt; 90%), improvement in exercise capacity and/or less breathlessness with ambulatory oxygen therapy (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2006</LINK>). The discrepancy between current clinical practice and available evidence from this review has important clinical implications. First, patients may be prescribed ineffective treatment, which may result in functional limitations from pulling oxygen cylinders and cylinder tubing. Second, oxygen therapy is an expensive treatment for both patients and the healthcare system, with ongoing prescriptions of ambulatory oxygen producing significant financial burdens for both. The decision to prescribe ambulatory oxygen for patients not meeting the criteria for LTOT (in an attempt to improve dyspnoea) should be made on a case-by-case basis until sufficient evidence has been obtained to support the clinical application of ambulatory oxygen.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-05-27 10:41:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Few long-term studies of ambulatory oxygen have been conducted in participants with COPD. The role of ambulatory oxygen therapy in patients with COPD with moderate hypoxia requires further investigation through adequately powered RCTs of sufficient methodological quality (including a prespecified published protocol, adequate sequence generation, randomisation, blinding and outcome reporting); in particular, the outcomes listed in the results section of this meta-analysis should be assessed in all future studies.</P>

<P>We note with interest the updated Cochrane review on &#8220;Ambulatory oxygen for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#8221;. We are concerned that the review has some major limitations that require addressing. We have detailed our concerns below but broadly they go to the clinical validity of the questions posed in the review, the assessment of trial quality and the evidence synthesis itself. </P>
<P>
<B>Outcome measure selection. </B>Why was mortality included and in particular why as a primary outcome? Ambulatory oxygen is clinically an adjuvant therapy provide with the aim of alleviating hypoxaemia and dyspnoea during activity. What is the evidence that ambulatory oxygen for these clinical indications and typically delivered at low to moderate flow rates, would be expected to modify mortality? </P>
<P>
<B>Dyspnoea data reporting including the summary of findings table.</B> The aims of the review clearly state that dyspnoea is included as a secondary outcome yet the data from Moore et al 2011 are not included in the meta-analyses. While it is absolutely true that scores on the Borg scale and measures made on the BDI/TDI are not directly comparable as they tap into different domains and constructs, to fail to analyse the BDI data without an explanation is puzzling. Perhaps the authors could comment on this omission. The mean increase in CRQ Dyspnoea domain score is 0.28 (0.1 to 0.45). While the MID is quoted correctly at 0.5 there is no discussion in the review of the clinical significance of this result-that while there is a small positive benefit of oxygen on this measure the estimate and the associated confidence intervals are well within the MID. This omission speaks to the limited clinical utility of the review we believe. </P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>. The assertion that the quality of the evidence in the included studies was low overall seems at odds with both the risk of bias tables and the narrative description of the studies. In the risk of bias table, the &#8220;failures&#8221; appeared predominantly to be failures of reporting rather than clear omissions and in the narrative it is noted that the &#8220;+&#8221; were all associated with low risk of bias. Why were the study authors not contacted to resolve these issues? In the largest included trial (Moore 2011) the narrative in the review notes that all quality domains were met and at n=143 randomised was larger than the other 3 studies combined (n=124)! It is this apparent disconnect between the narrative of the review and the summary/conclusions that is striking. </P>
<P>Thank you for your consideration and we look forward to your response. Regards. </P>

<P>
<B>Outcome measure selection</B>. Mortality is an important outcome in many trials of COPD treatment. Pulmonary hypertension is one of the inevitable outcomes of COPD and ambulatory oxygen has been shown to improve pulmonary hypertension and reduce dynamic hyperinflation in patients with COPD (<LINK REF="STD-Fujimoto-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fujimoto 2002</LINK>). The relief of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction with oxygen may contribute to a decrease in pulmonary hypertension and some studies suggest that in patients with stable COPD, 4% de-saturation during the six-minute walk test may predict long-term mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Casanova-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casanova 2008</LINK>). Unfortunately longer-term effects on survival time or quality of life of ambulatory oxygen in people with COPD with resting mild to moderate hypoxia and exertional dyspnoea or hypoxia remain unclear. This led us to include mortality as well as exercise capacity as a primary outcome. However, the studies we identified for inclusion were of maximum 12 weeks' duration, leaving us unable to comment on the long term effects of ambulatory oxygen on mortality. Long-term mortality is important and unknown and we recognise that short term mortality is not a good surrogate. Therefore, we conclude that the decision to prescribe ambulatory oxygen should be made on a case-by-case basis until sufficient evidence has been obtained to support the clinical application of ambulatory oxygen.</P>
<P>
<B>Dyspnoea data reporting including the summary of findings table.</B> We did not feel it was appropriate to meta-analyse data from the Moore study together with the other studies as they use the Borg score. However dyspnoea (measured by CRDQ) for the Moore study has indeed already been included in <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>. We have added information on the MID for dyspnoea to the discussion.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence. </B>In response to the feedback received, we have made the appropriate changes to the reporting on the risk of bias after receiving additional core data from study authors.</P>
