<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The induction of a seizure (fit) for therapeutic purposes by the administration of an electrical stimulus (electroconvulsive therapy or ECT) remains a common treatment option for people with schizophrenia. This review pools data from 26 studies that included over 798 participants in receipt of this treatment. The evidence suggests that courses of ECT can, in the short term, result in an increase in global improvement for some people with schizophrenia.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) involves the induction of a seizure for therapeutic purposes by the administration of a variable frequency electrical stimulus shock via electrodes applied to the scalp. The effects of its use in people with schizophrenia are unclear.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) results in clinically meaningful benefit with regard to global improvement, hospitalisation, changes in mental state, behaviour and functioning for people with schizophrenia, and to determine whether variations in the practical administration of ECT influences outcome.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We undertook electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1982-1996), EMBASE (1980-1996), MEDLINE (1966-2004), PsycLIT (1974-1996),SCISEARCH (1996) and the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (July 2004). We also inspected the references of all identified studies and contacted relevant authors.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all randomised controlled clinical trials that compared ECT with placebo, 'sham ECT', non-pharmacological interventions and antipsychotics and different schedules and methods of administration of ECT for people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or chronic mental disorder.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Working independently, we selected and critically appraised studies, extracted data and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Where possible and appropriate we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) with the number needed to treat (NNT). For continuous data Weighted Mean Differences (WMD) were calculated. We presented scale data for only those tools that had attained pre-specified levels of quality. We also undertook tests for heterogeneity and publication bias.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>This review includes 26 trials with 50 reports. When ECT is compared with placebo or sham ECT, more people improved in the real ECT group (n=392, 10 RCTs, RR 0.76 random CI 0.59 to 0.98, NNT 6 CI 4 to 12) and though data were heterogeneous (chi-square 17.49 df=9 P=0.04), its impact on variability of data was not substantial (I-squared 48.5%). There was a suggestion that ECT resulted in less relapses in the short term than sham ECT (n=47, 2 RCTs, RR fixed 0.26 CI 0.03 to 2.2), and a greater likelihood of being discharged from hospital (n=98, 1 RCT, RR fixed 0.59, CI 0.34 to 1.01). There is no evidence that this early advantage for ECT is maintained over the medium to long term. People treated with ECT did not drop out of treatment earlier than those treated with sham ECT (n=495, 14 RCTs, RR fixed 0.71 CI 0.33 to 1.52, I-squared 0%). Very limited data indicated that visual memory might decline after ECT compared with sham ECT (n=24, 1 RCT, WMD -14.0 CI -23 to -5); the results of verbal memory tests were equivocal.</P>
<P>When ECT is directly compared with antipsychotic drug treatments (total n=443, 10 RCTs) results favour the medication group (n=175, 3 RCTs, RR fixed 'not improved at the end of ECT course' 2.18 CI 1.31 to 3.63). Limited evidence suggests that ECT combined with antipsychotic drugs results in greater improvement in mental state (n= 40, 1 RCT, WMD, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale -3.9 CI - 2.28 to -5.52) than with antipsychotic drugs alone. One small study suggested more memory impairment after a course of ECT combined with antipsychotics than with antipsychotics alone (n=20, MD serial numbers and picture recall -4.90 CI -0.78 to -9.02), though this proved transient. When continuation ECT was added to antipsychotic drugs, the combination was superior to the use of antipsychotics alone (n=30, WMD Global Assessment of Functioning 19.06 CI 9.65 to 28.47), or CECT alone (n=30, WMD -20.30 CI -11.48 to -29.12). </P>
<P>Unilateral and bilateral ECT were equally effective in terms of global improvement (n=78, 2 RCTs, RR fixed 'not improved at end of course of ECT' 0.79 CI 0.45 to 1.39). One trial showed a significant advantage for 20 treatments over 12 treatments for numbers globally improved at the end of the ECT course (n=43, RR fixed 2.53 CI 1.13 to 5.66).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The evidence in this review suggests that ECT, combined with treatment with antipsychotic drugs, may be considered an option for people with schizophrenia, particularly when rapid global improvement and reduction of symptoms is desired. This is also the case for those with schizophrenia who show limited response to medication alone. Even though this initial beneficial effect may not last beyond the short term, there is no clear evidence to refute its use for people with schizophrenia. The research base for the use of ECT in people with schizophrenia continues to expand, but even after more than five decades of clinical use, there remain many unanswered questions regarding its role in the management of people with schizophrenia.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) involves the induction of a seizure (fit) for therapeutic purposes by the administration of a variable frequency electrical stimulus (shock) to the brain via electrodes applied to the scalp. The procedure is usually modified by the use of short acting anaesthetics and muscle relaxants. The former reduces apprehension and the latter avoids unwanted adverse side events such as fractures of the spine or extremities due to the vigorous muscular convulsions that occur if a muscle relaxant is not used. In parts of the world where anaesthetics are not readily available, ECT is still administered without muscle relaxants and anaesthetic agents as unmodified or direct ECT (<LINK REF="REF-Andrade-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrade 1993</LINK>). Modifications in ECT practice over the last five decades have considerably increased its safety (<LINK REF="REF-Sackeim-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackeim 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Shapira-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapira 1991</LINK>). Although concerns exist (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2003</LINK>), there is currently no conclusive evidence that ECT results in brain damage (<LINK REF="REF-Weiner-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Devanand-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devanand 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ende-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ende 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>ECT is a treatment that has generated considerable controversy since its introduction in 1938. It predates the era of modern psychopharmacology (drug treatment) by more than a decade, and initially gained acceptance because of its perceived benefits in the context of few alternatives and lack of emphasis on clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 1993</LINK>). Both the introduction of antipsychotics and antidepressants in the 1950s, and public and professional concerns that ECT is invasive and causes brain damage, resulted in a decline in its use. It was in fact subject to legal restrictions in parts of the world (<LINK REF="REF-Fink-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fink 1991</LINK>). A series of well-conducted studies since the 1970s, have established the efficacy of ECT in the treatment of depressive disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-APA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-UK-ECT-Group-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK ECT Group 2003</LINK>). It has been demonstrated that during the first month of ECT, quality of life and function have improved along with cognitive behaviour and mood in those with depression (<LINK REF="REF-McCall-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCall 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although initially introduced as a treatment for schizophrenia, the use of ECT for this condition is now not widespread in the developed world (<LINK REF="REF-Small-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Small 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Khan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 1993</LINK>) although in some developing areas it is still used for psychosis associated with childbirth. However, in many parts of the developing world, where ECT is available and inexpensive, schizophrenia continues to be an indication for the use of ECT (<LINK REF="REF-Agarwal-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agarwal 1992</LINK>). For people with schizophrenia, antipsychotic drugs effectively treat symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations and reduce the rate of relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Schooler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schooler 1993</LINK>). Twenty percent of people with schizophrenia, however, fail to respond to antipsychotics (<LINK REF="REF-Marder-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marder 1993</LINK>). This fact, together with concern over the distressing and enduring adverse effects of antipsychotic medication, has revived interest in the use of ECT for schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Devanand-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devanand 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lock-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lock 1995a</LINK>). </P>
<P>There is a marked lack of consensus among expert groups and clinicians regarding the efficacy of ECT when used for people with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Salzman-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salzman 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fink-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fink 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Johns-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johns 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kruger-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruger 1995</LINK>). The American Psychiatric Association Committee on Electroconvulsive Therapy, in its Task Force Report (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2001</LINK>), recommends the use of ECT in people with schizophrenia in the following cases: psychotic exacerbations of an abrupt or recent onset; catatonic schizophrenia (a subtype of schizophrenia where the person becomes mute and stuporous often adopting bizarre postures, known as catatonic stupor, or demonstrates excessive activity (catatonic excitement); where a history of a favourable response to ECT is present or for treating related psychotic disorders such as schizophreniform disorder (where the symptoms of schizophrenia have been present for less than six months) and schizoaffective disorder (where there is a mixture of symptoms of schizophrenia and that of a mood disorder). The Royal College of Psychiatrists' Special Committee on ECT in its second report (<LINK REF="REF-Royal-College-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royal College 1995</LINK>) also considers ECT to be effective in people with schizophrenia with positive, affective or catatonic symptoms. However, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2003</LINK>) does not recommend the general use of ECT for people with schizophrenia, although catatonia (which may occur in depressive disorders as well) is considered an indication.</P>
<P>Technical background<BR/>Much of our current knowledge regarding efficacy comes from studies conducted over the last 30 years for people with depressive disorders. These studies have demonstrated that, apart from clinical and diagnostic issues, variations in the practical administration of ECT impact substantially on the rate and extent of improvement, as well as on the unwanted cognitive adverse effects (confusion, memory impairment). These variations include: the type of ECT machine and stimulus wave form used; the degree to which the stimulus intensity exceeds the threshold at which seizures are elicited; the duration of seizures; bilateral versus unilateral placement of stimulus electrodes; the frequency and duration of prior resistance to antidepressant drugs and continuation treatment with suitable antidepressant drugs. ECT is a highly ritualised treatment, with considerable potential for a placebo response, and simulated or sham ECT (the use of anaesthetics, with or without muscle relaxants, minus the electrical stimulus) also exerts a powerful antidepressant effect when used to treat people with depression.</P>
<P>Frequency and schedules<BR/>Although schedules of treatment with ECT for depression vary, it is commonly administered twice a week in the UK compared to three times a week in the US (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1995</LINK>). Evidence from trials comparing the two schedules for depressed people demonstrates that the two are equal in efficacy, though treatments administered three times a week result in faster onset of improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Lerer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lerer 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Shapira-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapira 1998</LINK>). In the past ECT used to be administered daily (<LINK REF="STD-Abrams-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 1967</LINK>) or many times a day until a state of regression was induced (regressive ECT) (<LINK REF="STD-King-1959" TYPE="STUDY">King 1959</LINK>). These practices are still followed, but by only a few clinicians in some parts of the world (<LINK REF="REF-Agarwal-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agarwal 1992</LINK>). Some clinicians still administer more than one ECT per day or daily ECT for a few days when a rapid response is desired (<LINK REF="REF-Maletzky-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maletzky 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Agarwal-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agarwal 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Andrade-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrade 1993</LINK>). The courses range from four to 12 treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Weiner-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 1994</LINK>). For people with schizophrenia, it is believed that between 12 and 20 treatments are necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Kendell-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendell 1981</LINK>), though it is unclear how prevalent this is in current. Less commonly, it is given fortnightly or monthly as 'continuation ECT' or 'maintenance ECT', to prevent relapse of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Monroe-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monroe 1991</LINK>). The frequency of ECT administration also influences therapeutic outcome and cognitive adverse effects.</P>
<P>Stimulus<BR/>Early ECT machines delivered an alternating sine-wave stimulus at mains frequency and constant voltage. Modern machines, however, deliver a constant current, variable frequency, brief -pulse stimulus. This is more efficient than the sine-wave stimulus at eliciting seizures, and utilises less electrical energy. Whether the sine-wave stimulus is more effective than brief pulse stimulus in treating depression is debatable (<LINK REF="REF-Robin-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robin 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Andrade-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrade 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1992</LINK>) but the latter is associated with less cognitive adverse effects. </P>
<P>Seizure threshold<BR/>This refers to the minimum electrical stimulus required to elicit a generalised seizure. It has been shown to vary 40-fold between individuals, and to increase over the course of ECT (<LINK REF="REF-Sackeim-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackeim 1991</LINK>). Factors that raise seizure threshold and make it more difficult to elicit seizures include: the use of benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotic drugs; anticonvulsant medication; anaesthetic drugs; older age; male sex; dehydration; low oxygen saturation of blood and electrical parameters that raise impedance, such as poor contact between electrodes and the scalp. It was initially believed that the production of a generalised seizure was both necessary and sufficient for the antidepressant effect of ECT, as sub convulsive stimuli were without therapeutic benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Ottosson-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Ottosson 1960</LINK>). Later, it was demonstrated that generalised seizures of adequate duration could be reliably produced but can sometimes fail to demonstrate therapeutic effect in depression (<LINK REF="REF-Sackeim-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackeim 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>Seizure duration<BR/>In clinical practice, generalised motor seizures less than 15 seconds long are considered inadequate. Seizures of 25 to 30 seconds duration are desirable and thus monitored. This is done either via EEG, or by observing and timing motor convulsions in extremities or in a forearm isolated from muscle relaxants by an inflated blood-pressure cuff (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>It is now appreciated that there exists a complex interplay between the degree to which the stimulus dose exceeds the seizure threshold, electrode placement, the rate and extent of recovery, and the degree of adverse cognitive effects when ECT is used to treat people with depression. Electrical stimuli just above individually titrated seizure threshold are effective in treating depression with bilateral electrode placements but ineffective with unilateral placements (<LINK REF="REF-Sackeim-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackeim 1987</LINK>). Increasing the dose further, to 2.5 times seizure threshold, results in faster response with both bilateral and unilateral ECT. Though the efficacy with bilateral electrode placements is still superior; unilateral non-dominant ECT is associated with less severe cognitive effects than bilateral ECT (<LINK REF="REF-Sackeim-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackeim 1993</LINK>). The stimulus dose needs to be increased to between five to six times higher than seizure threshold for unilateral ECT to equal bilateral ECT in efficacy in treating depression (<LINK REF="REF-Sackeim-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackeim 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>Antidepressant use<BR/>Placebo controlled trials have demonstrated that relapse rates are roughly 20% to 60% in people continuing on antidepressants after successful treatment with ECT, versus 50% to 84% in people on placebo after ECT (<LINK REF="REF-Devanand-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devanand 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sackeim-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackeim 2001</LINK>). In people with depression who have failed to respond to adequate trials of antidepressants before initiation of ECT, only 50% respond to ECT compared to 86% of people who had not failed an adequate trial of antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Prudic-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prudic 1990</LINK>). Relapse rates are also higher and more rapid in medication resistant depressed individuals who are successfully treated with ECT. Such individuals are also less responsive to continuation pharmacotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Devanand-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devanand 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sackeim-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackeim 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Symptoms<BR/>It is uncertain whether the factors detailed above have any bearing on the outcome of ECT when applied to people with schizophrenia. It is also not clear at present which group of people with schizophrenia is most likely to benefit from ECT. It is held that people with schizophrenia who have prominent depressive symptoms, positive symptoms or catatonic symptoms of recent onset, are most likely to respond to ECT (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2001</LINK>). In the light of the reputed efficacy of ECT for affective disorders (depression and mania), it is possible that this treatment benefits those with schizophrenia solely by modifying affective symptoms and does not modify symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thinking (<LINK REF="REF-Johns-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johns 1995</LINK>). In addition, those with poorly defined illness, such as the chronically/seriously mentally ill/disordered, may also be given ECT. However it is possible that this diagnostically heterogeneous group has a differential response to the treatment due to inclusion of people with either chronic or psychotic affective disorder or treatment resistant illnesses. </P>
<P>Other physical methods of treatment<BR/>Apart from ECT, other physical methods of treatment in use for people with schizophrenia include electric acupuncture convulsive therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Xue-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Xue 1985</LINK>). This is a treatment used in China and is a procedure that resembles ECT but delivers different electrical stimulus frequencies and intensities via acupuncture needles, clips, plates and other forms of electrodes to direct the stimulus to the brain at acupuncture points on the head. More recently, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), has been used to treat people with psychiatric disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Daskalakis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daskalakis 2002</LINK>). In this procedure, non-invasive stimulation of the brain is achieved by the use of alternating magnetic fields to induce electric currents in the brain, that depending on the frequency of these fields, either excite or inhibit stimulated areas. Studies of rTMS in depressive disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders are covered in other Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Martin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2003</LINK>). Another therapy still in its infancy is magnetic seizure therapy (MST}. This involves the use of high-intensity rTMS to elicit seizures like with ECT, but with less potential for cognitive deficits, since rTMS offers greater control over sites stimulated and current densities (<LINK REF="REF-Burt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burt 2002</LINK>). An alternative approach to treating mental disorders is to stimulate the vagus nerve in the neck via an implanted device similar to a cardiac pacemaker. As opposed to electroconvulsive therapy, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is not associated with cognitive impairment, and has shown some promise in the treatment of depressive disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Goodnick-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodnick 2001</LINK>). Finally, high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus or basal ganglia represents an effective clinical technique for the treatment of several medically refractory movement disorders (e.g. Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia), and is being increasingly used in treatment refractory psychiatric disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Kopell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kopell 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Earlier versions of this review addressed four questions with regard to the use of ECT for those with schizophrenia: <BR/>1. Does ECT have a beneficial effect, and if it does, do particular subgroups of people with schizophrenia exist who are most likely to respond to this treatment? <BR/>2. How does ECT compare with antipsychotic drug treatments? <BR/>i.Does it increase the rate and/or extent of clinical recovery in people treated with drugs?<BR/>ii.Does concurrent antipsychotic medication improve the efficacy of ECT? <BR/>iii.Is ECT effective in those whose illness is non-responsive to antipsychotic medication? <BR/>3. Do factors related to the administration of ECT affect efficacy and adverse effects? Do the stimulus waveform, stimulus intensity, electrode placement, frequency and number of treatments alter the rate and/ or extent of clinical recovery?<BR/>4. Does continuation and/or maintenance ECT reduce the risk of relapse? <BR/>5. How does ECT compare in efficacy and safety with other physical treatments used for people with schizophrenia such as electric acupuncture convulsive therapy, vagus nerve stimulation, rTMS, and deep brain stimulation?</P>
<P>This version does not cover comparisons of magnetic seizure therapy (MST) with ECT in those with schizophrenia. We hope to cover this in future versions of this review.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>1. Our primary objectives were to determine whether ECT results in clinically meaningful benefit with regard to global improvement, changes in mental state, hospitalisation, behaviour and functioning for people with schizophrenia, in the short term (less than six weeks), medium term (six weeks to six months) and long term (more than six months). </P>
<P>2. Our secondary objectives were to determine whether ECT produces a differential response in people: <BR/>2.1 With well defined schizophrenia as opposed to those with less rigorously defined schizophrenia, with the assumption that the latter group will have a greater affective component to their illness and be more responsive <BR/>2.2 With catatonic (stupor or excitement) schizophrenia<BR/>2.3 With schizophrenia characterized by predominant delusions and hallucinations (positive symptoms) as opposed to social withdrawal, apathy and emotional unresponsiveness (negative symptoms)<BR/>2.4 Who are early in the course of their illness (less than two years)<BR/>2.5 Who are diagnosed as suffering from schizoaffective disorder as opposed to those with 'pure' schizophrenia<BR/>2.6 Who are also on antipsychotic drugs <BR/>2.7 Who have not responded to antipsychotic drugs and are considered 'treatment resistant' <BR/>2.8 Who have undergone a long (more than 12) or short (12 or less) course of ECT<BR/>2.9 Who have more frequent treatments than those who have less frequent treatments<BR/>2.10 Who are treated with unilateral compared to bilateral ECT<BR/>2.11 Who are treated with threshold level compared to suprathreshold level electrical stimuli <BR/>2.12 Who are given continuation or maintenance ECT.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included all relevant randomised controlled trials.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included those with shizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or chronic mental disorder (non-affective), diagnosed by any criteria.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>1. ECT (modified or unmodified) - any dose, frequency, level of stimulus against one or more of the following:<BR/>2. ECT (modified or unmodified) - threshold dose vs greater than threshold dose<BR/>3. ECT (modified or unmodified) - Unilateral vs bilateral<BR/>4. ECT (modified or unmodified) - given 3 days / week vs given more or less than three days per week<BR/>5. ECT (modified or unmodified) - course of 12 treatments vs course of over 12 treatments to 30 treatments vs continuation treatment<BR/>6. Placebo<BR/>7. 'Sham ECT' or 'simulated ECT' (the procedure of ECT minus the electrical stimulus) or 'subconvulsive' ECT (with an electrical stimulus but without the induction of a seizure)<BR/>8. Pharmacological interventions such as antipsychotics, or other drug treatments<BR/>9. Non-pharmacological interventions such as psychotherapy, social casework or milieu therapy<BR/>10. Electric acupuncture convulsive therapy<BR/>11. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation<BR/>12. Vagus nerve stimulation<BR/>13. Deep brain stimulation</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The outcomes of primary interest were as follows:</P>
<P>1. Clinically meaningful benefits in overall functioning<BR/>2. Changes in mental state, hospitalisation status, behavioural, social and occupational functioning<BR/>3. Remission of symptoms, however defined <BR/>4. Discharge from hospital or care </P>
<P>As various scales were used for each primary outcome, the definition of 'clinically meaningful benefit' was obtained from the validation of the original scale. Where possible, data were made binary in order to generate relative risks. If this was not possible, continuous data was evaluated and the 'clinically meaningful benefit' of changes assessed in the light of the original validation of each scale. </P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures used were: <BR/>1. Premature withdrawal of people from the trial by a decision of (i) the person in the trial, or (ii) the researchers; and <BR/>2. Any adverse event during the course of treatment or within the period of follow up. </P>
<P>We reviewed each outcome during the ECT course, in the short term (less than six weeks), medium term (six weeks to six months), and long term (over six months).</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>1. Electronic searching <BR/>1.1 We searched Biological Abstracts (January 1966 to January 1996), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 1996), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2004) and PsycLIT (Tier 1 and 2 as specified in the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Search Strategy) (January 1974 to January 1996) using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's phrase for randomised controlled trials for schizophrenia (see Search Strategy) with the addition of: </P>
<P>[and (ECT or electroconvuls* or electro-convuls* or electroshock* or electro-shock*)] </P>
<P>1.2 We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Specialised Register (July 2004) using the <BR/>phrase: </P>
<P>{(ECT * in title, or * ECT * abstract, index or title terms of REFERENCE] or (ECT and (transcranial*, (*electro* and *acupuncture*), or (*deep* and *brain*) or (*vagus* and *nerve*) or [Electroconvulsive* in interventions of STUDY]} </P>
<P>The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Specialised Register is based on regular searches of BIOSIS Inside, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO, hand searching of relevant journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources. </P>
<P>1.3 Current Controlled Trials<BR/>We searched this data base (November 2004) for ongoing trials using the terms schizophrenia AND *ECT* or *transcranial* or (*deep* and *brain* ) or (*vagus* and *nerve* ).</P>
<P>2. Reference searching <BR/>Once a study was selected (see below), we searched citations for additional trials. We contacted the first author of each trial published since 1980 for additional references and for unpublished trials. We also searched the references cited in narrative reviews and guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Andrade-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrade 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-APA-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-APA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-APA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fink-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fink 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fink-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fink 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Johns-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johns 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kruger-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruger 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lock-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lock 1995a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-NIMH-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIMH 1976</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Salzman-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salzman 1980</LINK>). We additionally hand searched the Indian Journal of Psychiatry (January 1960 - October 2004) for controlled trials of ECT. </P>
<P>3. Personal contact <BR/>We contacted manufacturers of ECT machines and members of the editorial board of the journal 'Journal of ECT'. We also sought all selected studies as a citation on ISI database in order to identify more studies.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>1. Selection of trials <BR/>We independently assessed every report identified by the electronic search for relevance to this review. In cases of disagreement we obtained the article and independently assessed each article for relevance to the review. We resolved any arising disagreements by discussion and where there was still doubt, we added the study to those awaiting assessment and contacted the study authors for further clarification. Failing a satisfactory result, we excluded the study from the review.</P>
<P>2. Assessment of methodological quality <BR/>We independently assigned each selected trial to quality categories described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>). Only trials assigned to categories A and B were selected and those assigned to category C were excluded. In case of disagreement, we sought clarification from the authors of the trial and added these to the list of those awaiting assessment. </P>
<P>3. Data management <BR/>3.1 Data extraction<BR/>We independently extracted data. Prathap Tharyan (PT) undertook all data extraction and Clive Adams (CEA) checked ten percent of this work. We attempted to resolve any disagreement by discussion. Where disagreement persisted and published results made data extraction difficult, we attempted to obtain clarification from the authors of the trial, pending which the trial was assigned to those awaiting assessment. </P>
<P>3.2 Binary outcomes<BR/>Where binary outcomes (proportions) were used, we calculated relative risks (RR), fixed and confidence intervals for each outcome. In addition we calculated absolute measures, the number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH). We undertook analyses on an intention to treat basis. </P>
<P>3.3 Continuous outcomes<BR/>We excluded continuous data if more than 50% of people were lost to follow up. We reported continuous data as presented in the original studies without making any assumptions about those lost to follow up. For continuous outcomes, we calculated pooled weighted mean differences (WMD) and confidence intervals for outcomes using similar scales. </P>
<P>3.3.1 Validity of continuous measures<BR/>We only included continuous data from rating scales if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal and the instrument was either a self report or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). Unpublished instruments are more likely to report statistically significant findings than those that have been peer reviewed and published (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>3.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>People dropped out of each of the studies of their own volition or as a result of a decision made by the trialists. For binary outcomes, we assigned people who left of their own accord to the least favourable outcome group. We tested the effects of this assignment in a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>3.5 Normal distribution of continuous data<BR/>Data on continuous outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, all data included in the review met the following criteria: <BR/>i. standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; <BR/>ii. when a scale started from 0 the standard deviation (SD), when multiplied by two was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). <BR/>iii. if a scale started from a positive value (such as PANSS that can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above in ii) was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skewness was considered present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. </P>
<P>Data that did not meet these standards were not entered into the RevMan software (which assumes a normal distribution). However, we reported data not meeting these criteria in additional tables and in the text if they had been analysed with appropriate non-parametric tests. </P>
<P>3.6 Endpoint versus change data<BR/>Where possible we presented endpoint data, and if both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcomes, then we reported only the former. </P>
<P>3.7 Presentation of data<BR/>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for the intervention of interest. For some scales a high score indicates a bad outcome, but for others, high scores indicate a positive outcome. In the case of the latter, the area to the left of the line indicates a favourable outcome for the control group and is labelled accordingly.</P>
<P>3.8 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect. </P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC) Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>4. Heterogeneity <BR/>After considering the likelihood of clinical heterogeneity based on comparisons of the included studies, we supplemented graphical display of results with the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test of heterogeneity to check whether differences in results were due to chance alone. Since this test has low power to detect heterogeneity, a significance level less than 0.10 was interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity. In addition, for this version of the review, we quantified inconsistency across studies and its impact on the meta-analysis by examining the value of I-squared to estimate the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. We interpreted an I-squared value of 50% or greater as indicating substantial levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If heterogeneity was detected but not quantified as contributing substantially to variation in data, all data were pooled and interpreted using the random-effects model. If inconsistency was substantial, data from the responsible studies were not pooled and the results were presented separately and reasons for heterogeneity were explored. In any event, if substantial heterogeneity was present, we undertook a sensitivity analysis to the presence or absence of these data.</P>
<P> 5. Sensitivity and subgroup analysis<BR/>We undertook sensitivity analyses in all instances when heterogeneity was detected. The effect of including studies with high attrition rates was also analysed in a sensitivity analysis. In addition, it was hoped that differences in outcomes would be detected for (a) people with operationally defined schizophrenia as opposed to those diagnosed by clinical consensus, (b) people with varying degrees of treatment resistance and those whose illness was not designated as such, (c) people having predominantly positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia and those without this designation, and (c) people who had been ill for less than two years and those at a later stage of their illness.</P>
<P>6. Publication bias<BR/>When outcomes included data from five or more trials, we entered data into a funnel graph (trial effect versus trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>For detailed descriptions of individual studies please see 'Characteristics of included and excluded studies' tables. </P>
<P>1. Excluded studies<BR/>Many studies that we found by the search strategy were so clearly irrelevant that is was not necessary to report them in the excluded studies table. In the excluded studies table we describe the 105 studies (120 reports) that had to be inspected in hard copy in order to decide on their relevance. Of these, 21 were described as randomised controlled trials, though nine were quasi randomised. Of the 17 that were randomised, seven reported comparisons, four involved participants, and one reported outcomes not relevant to this review. Four relevant randomised trials had to be excluded due to lack of any usable data (<LINK REF="STD-Gambill-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Gambill 1966</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Langsley-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Langsley 1959</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Natani-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Natani 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Reichert-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Reichert 1976</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Gambill-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Gambill 1966</LINK> compared ECT with antipsychotics and with sham ECT. <LINK REF="STD-Langsley-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Langsley 1959</LINK> compared chlorpromazine with ECT. <LINK REF="STD-Natani-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Natani 1983</LINK> evaluated both ECT with and without antipsychotics, and antipsychotics alone. <LINK REF="STD-Reichert-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Reichert 1976</LINK> compared unilateral with bilateral ECT. Of the non-randomised studies, 45 were controlled trials, 30 were case series or reports, seven were retrospective chart reviews and two were narrative reviews.</P>
<P>2. Awaiting assessment<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Yao-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2000</LINK> is described as randomised and compared ECT with subconvulsive ECT but presented no usable data; we hope to obtain more details from the authors. </P>
<P>3. Ongoing studies<BR/>We identified one ongoing multi-centre, open label randomised trial in the US of ECT in people with schizophrenia resistant to clozapine (<LINK REF="STD-Petrides-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Petrides 2000</LINK>). The trialists hope to randomise 64 people with schizophrenia aged 18 to 65 years who have not responded to at least two trials of antipsychotic drugs given at doses equivalent to 400 mg of chlorpromazine. Another condition of trial entry is that these people continue to have substantial psychotic symptoms despite at least 12 weeks of treatment of clozapine (at least eight weeks at a consistent dose). These people were to receive ECT and clozapine or clozapine alone. Recruitment commenced in 2000 and completion was expected by November 2003, but available information suggests that the study was still recruiting participants in November 2004.</P>
<P>4. Included studies<BR/>We identified 26 studies (50 reports) for inclusion in this version of the review. There was considerable variation between trials in the: clinical and demographic profile of the participants; criteria used to establish the diagnosis of schizophrenia; methods of administering ECT; comparisons and outcome measures used; duration of follow up and treatments given during follow up. </P>
<P>4.1 Participants</P>
<P>4.1.1 Diagnoses <BR/>Fifteen of the 26 trials used operationally defined criteria to establish the diagnosis of schizophrenia. The remainder diagnosed the disorder by clinical consensus. Diagnostic criteria used included ICD 9, ICD 10, DSM III R, DSM IV, Feighner's criteria, Present State Examination and CATEGO Research Diagnostic Criteria, and the Chinese Medical Council Clinical Diagnostic Criteria. <LINK REF="STD-Ungvari-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ungvari 1982</LINK> classified participants based on the classification of <LINK REF="REF-Leonhard-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonhard 1979</LINK> into systematic and unsystematic schizophrenia; a classification similar to the process and reactive or non-process classification of <LINK REF="REF-Langfeldt-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langfeldt 1960</LINK>. Three trials included people with homogenous clinical subtypes of schizophrenia, namely chronic catatonic schizophrenia or non-affective catatonia (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1953</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Girish-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Girish 2003</LINK>) and paranoid schizophrenia (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1980</LINK>). One trial, <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1994</LINK>, included only young males with schizophreniform disorder. <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1989</LINK> included 12 people with unspecified psychosis among the 40 participants in the trial. None of the included trials studied people with schizoaffective disorder. </P>
<P>4.1.2 Age and gender <BR/>The participants in all included trials were adults; none were children or adolescents. <LINK REF="STD-Abrams-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 1967</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1994</LINK> included only men, while <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1958</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1960</LINK> included only women. </P>
<P>4.1.3 Treatment resistant schizophrenia<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goswami-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goswami 2001</LINK> included people with treatment resistant schizophrenia that fulfilled modified criteria for treatment resistant schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1988</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1960</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1980</LINK> also included participants who had failed to respond to antipsychotics, though it is uncertain how many would meet stringent criteria for treatment resistance. The other trials included people with varying degrees of non-response to conventional antipsychotics, though <LINK REF="STD-Abrams-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 1967</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1994</LINK>, and possibly <LINK REF="STD-Ungvari-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ungvari 1982</LINK> included people who were acutely ill and hence unlikely to be resistant to treatment.</P>
<P>4.1.4 Duration of disorder<BR/>Little homogeneity was evident between trials in the duration of the disorder. Six trials stipulated a duration of less than two years, and of these, <LINK REF="STD-Abrams-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 1967</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1994</LINK> included participants with onset of disorder of less than three months and two months respectively. Five trials included participants who had been ill for more than two years and two of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Naidoo-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Naidoo 1956</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1953</LINK>) included individuals with chronic illness hospitalised for ten years or more, with the former including some individuals who had also been treated with leucotomy. Thirteen trials included people with varying duration of the disorder ranging from one month to thirty-two years. From the reports of <LINK REF="STD-Bagadia-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bagadia 1981</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1960</LINK>, it was unclear how long the participants had been ill. </P>
<P>4.2 Setting<BR/>Eleven of the included trials were conducted in India, five in the USA, four in the UK, two in Thailand, one each in Canada, China, Hungary and Nigeria. <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK> utilised two and <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK> three sites, while the remaining trials were conducted at single sites. Eighteen of the trials were conducted in hospital, four included only outpatients and four included both outpatients and inpatients.</P>
<P>4.3 Study size<BR/>The 26 trials in this review involved 1485 participants of whom 798 were treated with ECT. <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK> had the largest number of participants, (247), while <LINK REF="STD-Abrams-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 1967</LINK> included only ten. Seven trials had less than 30 participants, eight randomised between 30 and 50 individuals, ten included between 51 and 100, and only one study had more than 100 participants. </P>
<P>4.4 Length of trials <BR/>The period of follow up in the included trials varied from six days (<LINK REF="STD-Ungvari-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ungvari 1982</LINK>) to five years (<LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>). Fifteen of the trials conducted end point evaluations within a week after the course of ECT, and courses of treatment varied from six days to 12 weeks. Eight trials reported follow up periods of up to six weeks, thirteen trials followed up participants for between six weeks to six months and only five trials had follow up periods of greater than six months. Of these, <LINK REF="STD-Brandon-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Brandon 1985</LINK> followed participants for 26 weeks after the course of ECT, <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1994</LINK> for six months, and <LINK REF="STD-Small-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1982</LINK> evaluated outcomes over 12 months. <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK> evaluated continuation ECT over a six-month period for people with treatment resistant schizophrenia. The remarkable trial by <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK> had a follow-up period of three to five years. The interpretation of the long-term effects of treatments in this trial is limited by the naturalistic follow-up and uncontrolled treatment conditions, which in some instances included further ECT. </P>
<P>4.5 Interventions<BR/>There was considerable variation in the quality of reporting of details of the administration of ECT. Fifteen of the trials described that ECT was modified, while seven appear to have used unmodified ECT. From three reports it was unclear whether or not ECT was modified. </P>
<P>The trials by <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Girish-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Girish 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goswami-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goswami 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarita-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sarita 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ukpong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ukpong 2002</LINK> stated that brief pulse ECT devices were used; the remainder appear to have used sine-wave machines. The quality of reporting on electrode placement, frequency and duration of ECT administration was generally adequate in the selected trials. With the exception of seven out of the 26 studies, little information was provided in the trial reports on methods used to ensure adequacy of treatments with ECT. <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK> titrated individual thresholds for participants and monitored seizures with the cuff method and EEG recordings. <LINK REF="STD-Girish-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Girish 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goswami-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goswami 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sarita-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sarita 1998</LINK> used suprathreshold stimuli and monitored motor and electrical seizure activity as above. <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1994</LINK> used sine-wave stimuli at settings sufficient to ensure seizures of 25 seconds or more, and <LINK REF="STD-Ukpong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ukpong 2002</LINK> delivered fixed brief pulse stimuli. These two trials monitored motor seizures in a forearm isolated from muscle relaxant by an inflated blood-pressure cuff. </P>
<P>4.5.1 Comparisons<BR/>ECT was compared with other interventions in 23 trials, while three trials addressed various aspects of the practical administration of ECT that were considered to potentially alter outcome. </P>
<P>4.5.1.1 ECT versus Sham ECT<BR/>Twelve trials compared ECT with sham ECT. All but two trials also used additional antipsychotic drugs (chlorpromazine, haloperidol, or trifluoperazine). (<LINK REF="STD-Brill-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Brill 1959</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1953</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Bagadia-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bagadia 1981</LINK> used additional chlorpromazine only for people given sham ECT, while participants allocated to ECT were given placebo. Similarly <LINK REF="STD-Girish-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Girish 2003</LINK> compared ECT plus placebo with risperidone plus sham ECT </P>
<P>4.5.1.2 ECT versus placebo<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Naidoo-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Naidoo 1956</LINK> had a trial arm that compared ECT plus placebo with placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Small-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1982</LINK> had a trial arm that compared combined ECT with antipsychotic drug versus placebo.</P>
<P>4.5.1.3 ECT versus antipsychotic drugs<BR/>Ten trials compared ECT directly with antipsychotic drugs. Five used chlorpromazine as the comparator drug, <LINK REF="STD-Small-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1982</LINK> compared ECT with thiothixine, <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK> with trifluoperazine and <LINK REF="STD-Naidoo-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Naidoo 1956</LINK> used reserpine, a drug that pre-dated chlorpromazine. <LINK REF="STD-Girish-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Girish 2003</LINK> compared ECT plus placebo versus risperidone and Sham ECT. <LINK REF="STD-Ungvari-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ungvari 1982</LINK> compared ECT plus low dose haloperidol with very high dose haloperidol, while <LINK REF="STD-Janakiramiah-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Janakiramiah 1982</LINK> compared ECT in two groups of people treated with low dose and high dose chlorpromazine, with two other groups given the two strengths of the drug without ECT. </P>
<P>There was some variability in the doses of antipsychotics used in these trials, as well as in the trials of ECT versus sham ECT that used concurrent antipsychotics. <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Brandon-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Brandon 1985</LINK> used doses of antipsychotics that were lower than those used in the other trials and lower than those currently recommended for acute phase treatment in people with schizophrenia. </P>
<P>4.5.1.4 ECT versus psychotherapy and milieu therapy<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK> compared five treatment conditions for those with schizophrenia: bilateral ECT; antipsychotic drugs alone or in combination with psychoanalytic psychotherapy; psychoanalytic psychotherapy alone and milieu therapy. We were unable to find any trials that compared ECT with other forms of psychotherapy, psychological or psychosocial interventions.</P>
<P>4.5.1.5 ECT versus insulin coma<BR/>One early trial compared ECT with insulin coma (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1958</LINK>), a treatment in vogue when ECT was introduced to psychiatric practice. </P>
<P>4.5.1.6 Continuation ECT<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK> compared continuation ECT with and without flupentixol versus flupentixol alone, over a six-month period, for people with treatment resistant schizophrenia who had responded to an open trial of ECT and flupentixol. We were unable to find any randomised trials of the use of 'maintenance ECT' in schizophrenia (where the ECT is continued for even longer than six months). One excluded study (<LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1998</LINK>) described a case series treated with maintenance ECT and another from the same research group described a non-randomised open trial of maintenance ECT (<LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000b" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000b</LINK>).<BR/> <BR/>4.5.1.7 Unilateral versus bilateral ECT<BR/>Two of the included trials compared unilateral with bilateral ECT (<LINK REF="STD-Bagadia-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bagadia 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Doongaji-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Doongaji 1973</LINK>) without concurrent antipsychotic drugs. <LINK REF="STD-Sarita-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sarita 1998</LINK>, on the other hand, involved trial arms that compared unilateral with bilateral ECT for people who also had been given concurrent haloperidol.</P>
<P>4.5.1.8 Frequency of treatments<BR/>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Abrams-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 1967</LINK>) compared unilateral ECT given daily for five days per week with unilateral ECT given three times a week without concurrent antipsychotics. Trials of regressive ECT (<LINK REF="STD-King-1958" TYPE="STUDY">King 1958</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-King-1959" TYPE="STUDY">King 1959</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-King-1960" TYPE="STUDY">King 1960</LINK>) were excluded, as allocation was sequential in all three. <LINK REF="STD-Ungvari-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ungvari 1982</LINK> delivered ECT twice a day on alternate days over six days. ECT is more commonly given two or three times a week together with concurrent antipsychotic drugs and we were unable to find any randomised trials of ECT directly comparing these frequencies. Among the excluded trials was one study that was a retrospective chart review of matched ECT responders who were part of an earlier randomised trial drawn from two hospitals that used either twice or three times weekly treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999d" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999d</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.5.1.9 Number of treatments<BR/>The included trials used varying numbers of ECT, ranging from five to 45 treatments. However, <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1960</LINK> directly compared fixed courses of 12 versus 20 ECT given at different frequencies without concurrent antipsychotics. </P>
<P>4.5.1.10 Stimulus intensities<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK> compared ECT given at stimulus intensities just above individually titrated seizure thresholds with ECT given at twice seizure threshold and four times greater than seizure threshold. All participants in this study were resistant to conventional antipsychotics but were nevertheless treated with flupentixol. </P>
<P>4.6 Outcomes</P>
<P>4.6.1 Global improvement<BR/>Eighteen trials presented data on global impressions of improvement, and for the majority we extracted data to dichotomise this outcome. Eight trials used Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, but two (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Janakiramiah-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Janakiramiah 1981</LINK>) presented CGI data as continuous measures without standard deviations. The first author of <LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1987</LINK> provided dichotomised CGI data for this version of the review but we were unable to use data for global improvement from the latter trial. We derived data on global improvement for <LINK REF="STD-Small-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1982</LINK> based on the proportions of those for whom the study was terminated due to non-response or to clinical deterioration. <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Small-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1982</LINK> used the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale to assess global improvement, though the latter two trials reported no usable data on this measure. <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK> also defined global improvement as reduction in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores of &lt;25 after ECT maintained over a three-week stabilisation period. <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1994</LINK> used a five point Global Assessment Scale to categorise global outcome. <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK> used the Meninger Health Sickness scale to assess initial and end point global status. <LINK REF="STD-Girish-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Girish 2003</LINK> provided data on the number of participants in each trial arm who required more ECT at the end of the three-week trial, and we used this to assess global improvement. </P>
<P>4.6.2 Mental state<BR/>Fourteen trials assessed mental state with the BPRS, though data using this measure from <LINK REF="STD-Bagadia-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bagadia 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Janakiramiah-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Janakiramiah 1982</LINK> were unusable since they presented only mean scores without standard deviations. <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Small-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1982</LINK> did not present BPRS data in an extractable form. <LINK REF="STD-Bagadia-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bagadia 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ukpong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ukpong 2002</LINK> did report both means and standard deviations. For <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1994</LINK> this was provided by the first author, but data from all three were skewed and we did not add them to comparisons but reported them in additional tables. Some trials used other scales to assess mental state, but with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>, data from these scales were not usable (see 'Included studies table' for details).</P>
<P>4.6.3 Behaviour<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1953</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Small-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1982</LINK> used nurse rated behaviour scales, but data from the latter two trials were not usable. We extracted behavioural data from the former trial for both the short and medium term. </P>
<P>4.6.4 Employment<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1953</LINK> provided data on employment while in hospital, and while <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK> provided some data on employment during follow up, this was unusable. </P>
<P>4.6.5 Discharge<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1958</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK> provided data on numbers of participants who were discharged post interventions, based on clinicians' overall impressions about their fitness for discharge. </P>
<P>4.6.6 Leaving the study early<BR/>We obtained data from 22 of the 26 included trials on the numbers of those who left the trials early. Reasons for losses from trials were not always available. Two trials were notable for the large numbers of participants who left early. <LINK REF="STD-Bagadia-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bagadia 1988</LINK> lost 21/61 participants (35%) over the 20 day trial, and <LINK REF="STD-Doongaji-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Doongaji 1973</LINK> lost 32/86 participants (37%) by end of the course of ECT, and only 25 completed the three month follow up (70% drop out). Neither of the trials provided the numbers of those participants initially allotted to the different interventions, and both only presented data for those who completed the trial. For this reason, we were unable to use an intention-to-treat analysis in these two instances. Nor were we able to use data from these trials for the outcome leaving the study early. Data from these two trials were eliminated in a sensitivity analysis. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK>) provided data for both intention-to-treat and completer samples, and in keeping with our pre-stated protocol, we used the scale derived outcomes provided for mental state, global functioning, and cognitive adverse effects for the intention-to-treat sample provided. The primary analysis, performed on the two samples by the trialists, revealed similar results.</P>
<P>4.6.7 Relapse<BR/>ECT is a treatment that is usually discontinued once clinical improvement is observed, and schizophrenia is a disorder with a relapsing course in the absence of continuous treatment. Relapse rates after successful ECT are therefore an important indicator of the efficacy of ECT. Trials provided details on relapse in the short term (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Brandon-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Brandon 1985</LINK>), medium term (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1980</LINK>), and long term (<LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>) against sham ECT. <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1958</LINK> reported relapse rates in the short term for people treated with ECT versus those treated with antipsychotics and insulin coma. <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK> provided details of relapse over six months in people with treatment resistant schizophrenia treated with continuation ECT, with or without antipsychotics, versus antipsychotics alone. <LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1958</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Brandon-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Brandon 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1980</LINK> did not pre-define relapse, but appear to have used clinical appraisal of deterioration in clinical condition to record relapses. For <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>, we used re-hospitalisation data within two years as a proxy measure for relapse over the long term. <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK> used stringent criteria to define relapse, pre-stating that BPRS scores of at least 37 that persisted for two consecutive ratings done three days apart would be deemed a relapse. </P>
<P>4.6.8 Adverse effects<BR/>A number of trials assessed participants for adverse effects, notably cognitive events such as memory impairment, though some information was also provided for other events.</P>
<P>4.6.8.1 Cognitive adverse effects<BR/>Most of the trials that assessed memory functions after ECT did so using sub-tests from validated neuropsychological test batteries that evaluated visual and verbal memory. <LINK REF="STD-Sarita-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sarita 1998</LINK> compared paired associate learning and visual memory after the interventions between people treated with ECT and sham ECT. <LINK REF="STD-Bagadia-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bagadia 1981</LINK> reported subjective forgetfulness and objective evidence of cognitive impairment in the short term for people on placebo and ECT, versus those on sham ECT and antipsychotics. <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1989</LINK> assessed short-term memory in people treated with ECT versus those on antipsychotics. The assessments were made before and immediately after ECT, as well as nine weeks after the course of ECT. <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK> used the relatively insensitive but commonly used Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) over a six month course of continuation ECT. We extracted categorical data on subjective and objective memory functions (<LINK REF="STD-Bagadia-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bagadia 1988</LINK>) and continuous data on visual and verbal memory (<LINK REF="STD-Sarita-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sarita 1998</LINK>) for the comparison of unilateral and bilateral ECT. <LINK REF="STD-Abrams-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 1967</LINK> reported categorical clinical and neuropsychological test data on memory impairment for people treated with unilateral ECT three and five times a week. <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK> assessed cognitive functions using the MMSE on people treated with different stimulus intensities but we were unable to use the data provided as the senior authors were not able to supply this information. In the comparison of 12 versus 20 treatments, <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1960</LINK> presented no data on memory impairment. Since the trials used different tests and different comparisons, we were unable to synthesise data from trials so we have presented them separately.</P>
<P>4.6.8.2 Other adverse effects<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ungvari-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ungvari 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bagadia-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bagadia 1981</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Girish-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Girish 2003</LINK> provided data on adverse effects, mainly acute extrapyramidal adverse effects produced by antipsychotics in people treated with and without ECT.</P>
<P>4.6.9 Death<BR/>Only <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK> explicitly provided data on mortality after ECT over the long term. </P>
<P>4.7 Outcome scales<BR/>A number of outcomes used in this review presented continuous data derived from a variety of measuring instruments/scales. Brief details of the various scales used in this review are provided below. </P>
<P>4.7.1 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)<BR/>This is a brief rating scale used to assess the severity of a range of psychiatric symptoms, including psychotic symptoms. The original scale has 16 items (although a revised 18-item scale is commonly used). Each item is defined on a seven-point scale varying from 'not present' to 'extremely severe', scoring from 0-6 or 1-7. Total scores can range from 0-126, with high scores indicating more severe symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-Ukpong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ukpong 2002</LINK> used a modified nine-item version of this scale.</P>
<P>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD/HAM-D, Hamilton 1960) <BR/>The instrument is designed to be used only on patients already diagnosed as suffering from affective disorder of depressive type. It is used for quantifying the results of an interview, and its value depends entirely on the skill of the interviewer in eliciting the necessary information. The scale contains 17 variables measured on either a five-point or a three-point rating scale, the latter being used where quantification of the variable is either difficult or impossible. Among the variables are: depressed mood, suicide, work and loss of interest, retardation, agitation, gastro-intestinal symptoms, general somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of insight, and loss of weight. It is useful to have two raters independently scoring a patient at the same interview. The scores of the patient are obtained by summing the scores of the two physicians. A score of 11 is generally regarded as indicative of a diagnosis of depression.</P>
<P>4.7.2 Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS, <LINK REF="REF-Bush-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bush 1996</LINK>)<BR/>This 14-item scale scores the presence of catatonic signs such as: excitement, stupor, mutism, staring, posturing, mannerisms, negativism and withdrawal. Higher scores indicate more catatonic signs. </P>
<P>4.7.3 Clinical Global Impression (CGI, <LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This rating instrument is commonly used in studies on schizophrenia and enables clinicians to quantify severity of illness and overall clinical improvement during therapy. A seven point scoring system is usually used with low scores indicating decreased severity and/or greater recovery and higher scores indicating increased severity and/or clinical worsening. Modifications of this instrument were used by some identified trials and this review dichotomized the data into the categories 'improved' or 'not improved'. </P>
<P>4.7.4 Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF, <LINK REF="REF-APA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1995</LINK>)<BR/>This modified version of the Global Assessment Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Endicott-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Endicott 1976</LINK>) is itself a revision of the Health Sickness Rating Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Luborsky-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luborsky 1962</LINK>). It considers psychological, social and occupational functioning on a hypothetical continuum of mental health-illness and is rated from 0-100. Higher scores indicate a better outcome.</P>
<P>4.7.5 Jenkins Symptom Rating Scale (JSRS, <LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 1959</LINK>)<BR/>This scale quantifies symptoms and behaviour with a high score indicating a poor outcome. It is a modified abbreviated version of the Lorr Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Lorr-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorr 1953</LINK>) and was used by <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>. This scale is not commonly used today. </P>
<P>4.7.6 Meninger Health Sickness Scale (MHS, <LINK REF="REF-Luborsky-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luborsky 1962</LINK>)<BR/>This scale, developed from psychotherapy research, defines health by comparing people under consideration with a standard series of patients graded in degrees of mental health. High scores indicate good outcome. This was used by <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK> to provide initial and terminal clinical global status but is not presently in common use.</P>
<P>4.7.7 Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE, <LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>)<BR/>This clinician-administered clinical evaluation assesses cognition in five areas: orientation; immediate recall; attention and calculation; delayed recall, and language. The test takes 15 minutes to administer and the score ranges from 0 (severe impairment) to 30 (normal). The Thai version of the MMSE (<LINK REF="REF-Kongsakon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kongsakon 1994</LINK>) was used in the <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK> studies. </P>
<P>4.7.8 Motility Affect Cooperation Communication Scale (MACC, <LINK REF="REF-Ellsworth-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellsworth 1959</LINK>) <BR/>This scale measures behaviour and social adjustment and was developed to be used by nursing staff with high scores indicating a good outcome. Though used by <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>, it is not commonly used at present. </P>
<P>4.7.9 Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS, <LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1982</LINK>)<BR/>This is a six-point scale providing a global rating of the following negative symptoms: alogia; affective blunting; avolition-apathy; anhedonia-asociality and attention impairment. Higher scores indicate more symptoms. </P>
<P>4.8 Missing outcomes<BR/>None of the included trials provide details of participants' satisfaction with ECT, quality of life, or economic evaluations.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The 26 studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review spanned five decades with considerable variations in methodological quality. </P>
<P>1. Randomisation<BR/>All the included trials were described as randomised but only <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK> described the process of randomisation adequately. Subsequently to the initial publication of this review, senior authors of <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goswami-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goswami 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Girish-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Girish 2003</LINK> provided further details as to how randomisation took place and these five trials were finally assigned a quality assessment score of A. This may indicate problems in the quality of reporting in the other trials, rather than genuine inadequate concealment of randomisation. <LINK REF="STD-Doongaji-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Doongaji 1973</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1980</LINK> used stratified randomisation. <LINK REF="STD-Small-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1982</LINK> randomised within a pre-designated ratio and <LINK REF="STD-Abrams-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 1967</LINK> randomised participants by the toss of a coin.</P>
<P>2. Blinding<BR/>Fifteen of the 26 trials were described as double blind.<BR/>This included 11 of the 13 trials comparing ECT with sham ECT. Eight trials used only blind raters, though <LINK REF="STD-Janakiramiah-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Janakiramiah 1982</LINK> reported that rater blindness was compromised in "a dozen instances". <LINK REF="STD-Abrams-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 1967</LINK> did not describe blinding, and in all probability this trial was unblinded. It was unclear from <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1958</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1960</LINK> whether raters were blind. The design of some of the trials precluded blinding of participants, especially the trials comparing ECT with antipsychotics. Due to this fact, <LINK REF="STD-Naidoo-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Naidoo 1956</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Small-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1982</LINK> involved people who were blinded with respect to placebo and antipsychotics, but not to ECT, while raters were blind to the nature of all interventions. None, except <LINK REF="STD-Doongaji-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Doongaji 1973</LINK>, attempted to formally evaluate the blindness of raters. </P>
<P>3. Leaving the study early<BR/>In general, few people were lost to follow up in most of the included studies, with the notable exception of <LINK REF="STD-Bagadia-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bagadia 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Doongaji-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Doongaji 1973</LINK>. Both of these trials assessed unilateral versus bilateral ECT and involved outpatients. Both failed to report participants' reasons for leaving the study early, and both lost people during the course of ECT. The trial with the longest follow up, <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>, lost 186/247 (70%) of participants over the five year follow up period, though in the medium term only 19 people (8%) left the trial. </P>
<P>4. Quality of reporting<BR/>There was considerable variation in the quality of reporting of results. Studies frequently presented both dichotomous and continuous data in graphs, or as the results of analyses such as survival analysis or analysis of variance, or reported only statistical measures of probability (p-values). This often made it impossible to acquire raw data for synthesis. Nine studies presented means for some outcomes with no numerical description of the variance around these averages (standard deviations or standard errors), rendering the results unusable without further data. We were unsuccessful in our attempts to obtain these missing data from trialists. In six trials, although mean and standard deviations were provided, data did not assume a normal distribution precluding further analyses without individual primary data. <LINK REF="STD-Bagadia-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bagadia 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1958</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Brandon-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Brandon 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarita-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sarita 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1994</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Small-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1982</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Girish-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Girish 2003</LINK>, presented data for primary outcomes in a form that made data extraction impossible. The senior authors of the first two trials are unable to provide usable data but we hope to obtain usable data from <LINK REF="STD-Girish-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Girish 2003</LINK> for inclusion in future versions of this review.</P>
<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Bagadia-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bagadia 1988</LINK> posed problems in interpretation of the number of participants, as this trial was reported initially as a preliminary report (<LINK REF="STD-Bagadia-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bagadia 1981</LINK>), and later as a completed trial as well as a composite report of both papers. It is unclear whether the results of cognitive tests pertained to the preliminary or final report. Data for memory impairment from this trial have been taken from the preliminary report while clinical global improvement was obtained from the completed trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bagadia-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bagadia 1988</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>1. The search and trial selection<BR/>The search from the original version of the review in 1996 yielded 20 reports from 12 trials for inclusion. The second update of the review included 24 trials with forty-six associated reports. Five trials awaited assessment and have since been excluded. Seven trial authors have thus far provided additional and previously unpublished information (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goswami-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goswami 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarita-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sarita 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Small-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1980</LINK>), but we could not obtain usable data on some primary outcomes from the first authors of <LINK REF="STD-Small-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1982</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Goswami-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goswami 2001</LINK> was included in the second update of this review as an unpublished conference presentation, with a manuscript and additional clarification of this trial of ECT versus sham ECT for treatment resistant schizophrenia kindly provided by the trial authors. This trial was subsequently published in 2003 and we used both sources for data for this review. This update includes two additional trials that were published since the update in 2002 (<LINK REF="STD-Ukpong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ukpong 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Girish-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Girish 2003</LINK>), though continuous data from some primary outcomes are unfortunately skewed and therefore presented in additional tables. We identified one ongoing multicentre randomised open trial of ECT plus clozapine versus clozapine in people with schizophrenia who were resistant to conventional and non-conventional antipsychotics and to clozapine (<LINK REF="STD-Petrides-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Petrides 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>One trial awaits assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Yao-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2000</LINK>). If usable data are obtained from trialists, this will be added to the next version of the review.</P>
<P>We were unable to include the trials of electro-acupuncture therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Gang-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gang 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Xue-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Xue 1985</LINK>). We did not find any randomised trials comparing ECT with rTMS, vagus nerve stimulation or deep brain stimulation.</P>
<P>For the original version of this review, Rochelle Seifas independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data from the twelve included trials. Clive Adams undertook trial assessment and data extraction of the newly included trials for subsequent versions, including this update.</P>
<P>2. Limited data <BR/>There appears to be a shortage of good quality randomised trials to enable data synthesis for some outcomes. Comparisons of ECT with antipsychotics or with non-pharmacological interventions offer very little data. Continuation ECT, comparisons of bilateral with unilateral ECT or different methods of administering ECT continue to be under-researched areas. Nevertheless, the selected trials do provide sufficient data to allow some conclusions to be drawn regarding numbers of participants showing improvement at the end of a course of ECT, when compared to placebo, sham ECT or antipsychotics. Usable but very little data are also available for many important outcomes, such as relapse and discharge from care. None of the selected trials directly addressed the issue of the acceptability of ECT to those treated, although, the numbers of people who left the studies early may serve as an indirect measure of this. </P>
<P>3. Comparisons<BR/>We extracted data for nine comparisons for this update. Four of these compared courses of ECT with other interventions, one evaluated the efficacy of continuation ECT in people who had already responded to a course of ECT and four assessed different methods of administering ECT.</P>
<P>3.1 ECT versus Sham ECT or Placebo (12 RCTs, 405 participants of whom 212 treated with ECT). </P>
<P>3.1.1 Global improvement<BR/>Previous versions of this review included <LINK REF="STD-Janakiramiah-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Janakiramiah 1982</LINK> in this comparison but in this version we more appropriately analysed the data from this trial in the comparison of ECT versus antipsychotics. For this update we added unpublished data obtained from authors of <LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Small-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1982</LINK> on proportions not globally improved to this comparison. Pooled data from ten trials indicated that treatment with ECT was significantly more likely to result in clinical global improvement at the end of the course than with placebo/sham ECT (n=392, RR 0.71 fixed CI 0.59 to 0.86, NNT 6 CI 4 to 12), and though data were heterogeneous (chi-square 17.49 df=9 P=0.04), inconsistency was not substantial (I-squared 48.5%). Using a random-effects model resulted in the expected wider confidence intervals without reversing the direction, or substantially reducing the effect estimate (RR 0.76 random CI 0.59 to 0.98). When the small trial with the largest estimate of effect (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1980</LINK>) was excluded, homogenous data still attested to the superior effect of ECT in helping people with schizophrenia to attain global clinical improvement by the end of the course (n=372, 9 RCT, RR 0.76 fixed CI 0.63 to 0.92, NNT 7 CI 4 to 20, I-squared 31.3%). <LINK REF="STD-Goswami-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goswami 2001</LINK> is the only trial in this comparison to recruit people with clearly defined treatment resistance. Exclusion of this clinically heterogenous data did not significantly reduce statistical heterogeneity or the significance of the effect estimate, though the effect of the former on the variability of data remained unsubstantial (n=362, 9 RCT, RR 0.71 random CI 0.54 to 0.94, NNT 5 CI 3 to 10, I-squared 42.6%).</P>
<P>The evidence from <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1994</LINK>, a small trial of ECT (n=30) in people with early symptoms of schizophrenia (less than six months), was equivocal regarding the benefit of ECT combined with antipsychotics versus antipsychotics alone, in global improvement in the short to medium term (RR 0.71 fixed CI 0.3 to 1.8).</P>
<P>There was also a suggestion that ECT resulted in fewer relapses in the short term than sham ECT (n=47, RR fixed 0.26 CI 0.03 to 2.2) and a greater likelihood of being discharged from hospital (n=98, RR fixed 0.59, CI 0.34 to 1.01), though the data on which these outcomes are based are limited. There is no evidence that this early advantage for ECT is maintained over the medium to long term, as assessed by other measures of symptomatic improvement over a six-month and two year follow up period, though the trend favoured ECT. Again, the data on which these results are based are sparse. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> reports some skewed and difficult to interpret data on global outcomes.</P>
<P>3.1.2 Mental State<BR/>The moderate advantage of ECT over sham ECT was again evident when symptomatic improvement was assessed with limited data from BPRS scores at the end of the course of ECT (n=52, WMD -6.14, CI -10.01 to -2.27). ECT also resulted in a significantly faster rate of improvement as assessed by reduction in BPRS scores midway through the course of ECT (n=52, WMD -4.72 CI -8.87 to -0.57). This early advantage of ECT over sham ECT was maintained in the short term (six weeks) after the course of treatment (n=52, WMD -6.38 CI -10.74 to -2.02). The available data from one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ukpong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ukpong 2002</LINK>) did not show an advantage for ECT plus antipsychotic drugs over sham ECT and antipsychotic drugs in the medium term (n=16, WMD -0.29 CI -3.49 to -2.91). <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> reports some skewed and difficult to interpret data on mental state.</P>
<P>3.1.3 Behaviour and social functioning<BR/>Only one study, <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>, reported on behaviour and social functioning and suggested that ECT afforded a little improvement for this outcome (n=90, 1 RCT, MD on average score on the Motility Affect Co-operation Communication Scale 4.1 CI -0.4 to 8.6). <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1953</LINK> reported on within ward employment and no differences in the two groups were apparent (n=30, RR employed on ward 0.95 CI 0.8 to 1.2). <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> reports a little more data on employment.</P>
<P>3.1.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>Homogeneous data from the 12 trials comparing ECT with sham ECT did not suggest that people treated with ECT dropped out of treatment earlier than those treated with sham ECT (n=405, RR fixed 0.84 CI 0.57 to 1.24, I-squared 0%).</P>
<P>3.1.5 Adverse effects: memory<BR/>Very limited data indicated that visual memory declined after ECT compared with sham ECT (n=24, 1 RCT, WMD -14.0 CI -23 to -5); the results of verbal memory tests were equivocal. <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> report some skewed data for memory tests. </P>
<P>3.1.6 Death<BR/>One trial reported on mortality over a three-year follow up (<LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>). No deaths were reported in this trial (n=98).</P>
<P>3.2 ECT vs Antipsychotic drugs</P>
<P>3.2.1 Global impression<BR/>When ECT given without antipsychotics is directly compared to treatment with antipsychotics alone, the pooled dichotomous results strongly favour the medication group (n=175, 3 RCTs, RR fixed 2.18 CI 1.3 to 3.6, I-squared 3.6%). Homogenous data also favour antipsychotic drugs over ECT with regard to numbers discharged after treatment (n=135, RCTs, RR fixed 1.98 CI 0.97 to 4, I-squared 43.7%). Very limited data indicated that people treated with ECT are less likely to relapse than those treated with antipsychotics (n=32, 1 RCT, RR fixed 0.33 CI 0.1 to 0.9). Continuous measures of global improvement from one trial favoured ECT in the short term, though the results were equivocal in the long term.</P>
<P>One of our secondary objectives was to evaluate whether the addition of ECT is beneficial to those being treated with antipsychotic drugs. There is some data to suggest that the combination results in an increase in the number of those improved at the end of the course of treatment compared to those treated with ECT alone. Seven of the ten trials that contributed data on clinical global improvement in the comparison of ECT and sham ECT/placebo studied ECT plus antipsychotics against sham ECT plus antipsychotics (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Brandon-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Brandon 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goswami-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goswami 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Naidoo-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Naidoo 1956</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarita-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sarita 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1980</LINK>). The remaining three did not use antipsychotics in combination with ECT or sham ECT/placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Brill-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Brill 1959</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Small-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1982</LINK>). Analysis of heterogeneous data from these seven trials showed a non-significant trend favouring the ECT and antipsychotic combination (n=203, RR random 0.76 CI 0.52 to 1.10, I-squared 62.1%). Reducing heterogeneity by removing one visibly outlying trial (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1980</LINK>) marginally reduces the uncertainty around the estimate of effect (n=183, 6 RCT, RR 0.81 fixed CI 0.66 to 1.00, I-squared 44.6%). </P>
<P>Conversely, homogenous data from the three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Brill-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Brill 1959</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Small-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1982</LINK>) that compared ECT to sham ECT/placebo that did not use antipsychotics in either arm, fuels the evidence that ECT is more effective than sham ECT in facilitating global clinical improvement (n=189, RR 0.70 fixed CI 0.49 to 0.98, NNT 7 CI 4 to 10, I-squared 0%). However, the overlap in the confidence limits for the effect estimates in both subgroups does not allow us to provide a definitive answer to this clinically important question. There is a suggestion of effect for the addition of antipsychotics to those receiving ECT from the subgroup analysis, but this is not supported by homogenous data from the three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Janakiramiah-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Janakiramiah 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Naidoo-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Naidoo 1956</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Small-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1982</LINK>) that directly compared the combination of ECT and antipsychotics versus antipsychotics alone (n=151, RR 1.15 fixed CI 0.73 to 1.82, I-squared 43.4%). </P>
<P>3.2.2 Mental state<BR/>When participants were treated with ECT alone, mental state was less likely to improve over the medium term than if they were also given antipsychotic drugs (n=94, 1 RCT, MD on Jenkins Scale 2.20 CI -0.4 to 4.75). However, BPRS scores from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1989</LINK>), indicate that when antipsychotics were added to ECT, the combination offered significant advantages over antipsychotics alone after the course of ECT (n=40 MD -3.9 CI -2.3 to -5.5), and suggest that this was maintained over the medium term (n=40, MD -7.20 CI -0.3 to -14.1).</P>
<P>Skewed data in a trial on ECT in people with catatonia (<LINK REF="STD-Girish-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Girish 2003</LINK>), analysed by repeat measures analysis of variance in the publication, favoured ECT and placebo over sham ECT and risperidone as assessed by the Bush-Francis Catatonia Scale (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). </P>
<P>3.2.3 Behaviour<BR/>Limited data from one trial indicated that antipsychotics improved nurse rated continuous measures of behaviour more than treatment with ECT alone (n=95, WMD -6.00 CI -2.82 to -9.18).</P>
<P>3.2.4 Leaving the study early<BR/>As with the comparison with sham ECT, no differences were seen in numbers leaving the study early in the trials that compared ECT to treatment with antipsychotics (n=529, 9 RCT, RR fixed 0.99 CI 0.78 to 1.27, I-squared 0%). Similar numbers remained in the trial <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>, five years after treatment with ECT or antipsychotics. However by this time, 73% of the people in both arms were lost to follow up.</P>
<P>3.2.5 Adverse effects<BR/>Data from a small trial (n=40) that was assessed for subjective and objective evidence of memory impairment failed to find significant differences between treatment with ECT or antipsychotics (<LINK REF="STD-Bagadia-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bagadia 1981</LINK>). However, on objective testing, an equally small Chinese trial (n=40) (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1989</LINK>) detected greater memory impairment after a course of ECT combined with antipsychotics than with antipsychotics alone (n=20, MD serial numbers and picture recall -4.90 CI -0. 8 to -9). However, when re-tested nine weeks later, memory functions had improved in both groups and no significant differences were detected. </P>
<P>Limited data (n=52, <LINK REF="STD-Bagadia-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bagadia 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Girish-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Girish 2003</LINK>) suggests that ECT given without antipsychotics does not result in the occurrence of extrapyramidal side effects compared to treatment with antipsychotic drugs (RR 0.09 fixed CI 0.01 to 0.69, I-squared 0%). Treatment with ECT, or antipsychotics with sham ECT, did not differ in the frequency of reporting of a variety of other adverse effects, but again data were limited (n=38, <LINK REF="STD-Bagadia-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bagadia 1981</LINK>). </P>
<P>3.2.6 Death<BR/>One patient who had not received ECT died within the three-year follow up by <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK> (n=149, 1 RCT, RR 0.63 CI 0.03 to 15).</P>
<P>3.3 ECT versus psychodynamic-psychotherapy alone or with antipsychotic drugs</P>
<P>Limited data from one study comparing ECT with individual psychoanalytic psychotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>) showed a consistent, though non-significant, trend favouring ECT (both short term and two years later) on several outcomes. When antipsychotics were added to psychoanalytic psychotherapy however, a significant advantage of the drug group over ECT is seen in the short term (n=90, WMD -5.0 CI -0.54 to -9.46) with a continuing trend two years later. <LINK REF="TBL-15" TYPE="TABLE">Table 15</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK> present limited data on employment. </P>
<P>Skewed data on employment are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-15" TYPE="TABLE">Table 15</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>
</P>
<P>3.4 ECT versus insulin coma therapy <BR/>It is unclear if insulin coma treatment is used in present day treatment anywhere in the world. This review provides limited evidence that, when ECT is compared with insulin induced coma, the results are equivocal (n=33, 1 RCT, RR not improved at end of course of ECT 0.7 CI 0.3 to 1.8). </P>
<P>3.5 Continuation ECT versus antipsychotics <BR/>The data for this comparison comes from a single trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK>) that compared continuation ECT alone with antipsychotics, with continuation ECT added to antipsychotics, for people with treatment resistant schizophrenia.</P>
<P>3.5.1 Global impression<BR/>When CECT was compared with antipsychotics, the results at the end of the six-month trial, when measured on the GAF scale were equivocal (n=30, 1 RCT, MD -1.24 CI -6.4 to 3.9). However, when CECT was added to antipsychotic drugs, the combination was clearly superior to the use of antipsychotics alone (n=30, WMD 19.1 CI 9.7 to 28.5), or CECT alone (n=30, WMD -20.3 CI -11.5 to -29.1).</P>
<P>Equal numbers (14/15) of people on CECT alone or antipsychotics alone relapsed over the six-month trial period. The addition of CECT to antipsychotic drugs, however, was clearly beneficial in reducing relapses compared with antipsychotics alone or CECT alone (n=30, RR fixed 0.43 CI 0.23 to 0.81, NNT 2 CI 1.5 to 2.5). </P>
<P>3.5.2 Mental state<BR/>Similarly, at six months, CECT was no better than treatment with antipsychotic drugs in reducing BPRS scores, though the combination of CECT and antipsychotics was superior to CECT alone (n=30, WMD 18.6 CI 8.6 to 27.6), or antipsychotics alone (n=30, WMD -19.8 CI -10.3 to 29.2).</P>
<P>3.5.3 Leaving the study early<BR/>Few people (6/45) left this study early (<LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK>), with no clear pattern emerging to suggest a trend in favour of any of the three comparisons. </P>
<P>3.5.4 Adverse effects<BR/>No significant differences were seen in cognitive impairment scores between those treated for six months with CECT or antipsychotics. CECT added to antipsychotics resulted in non-significant trends favouring antipsychotic drugs used alone and the combination versus CECT used alone.</P>
<P>3.6 Electrode placement: unilateral versus bilateral ECT<BR/>Neither unilateral nor bilateral ECT was superior in terms of global improvement (n=78, 2 RCTs, RR not improved at end of course of ECT 0.79 CI 0.5 to 1.4). There were also no clear differences for outcomes of changes in mental state (<LINK REF="TBL-10" TYPE="TABLE">Table 10</LINK>) or cognitive functions (<LINK REF="TBL-16" TYPE="TABLE">Table 16</LINK>) over the course of ECT and in the medium term from the limited data from three trials (total n=118). </P>
<P>3.7 ECT dose: threshold stimulus versus suprathreshold stimulus intensities <BR/>The data for this comparison comes from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK>, n=64). People with treatment resistant schizophrenia were administered variable numbers of ECT at stimulus intensities just above the seizure threshold (T), twice the seizure threshold (2T), or four times the seizure threshold (4T). Endpoint average scores for global impression (GAF), mental state (BPRS), and cognitive function (MMSE) were not extractable, but we hope to obtain further details on these measures for future updates of this review.</P>
<P>3.7.1 Global impression<BR/>The three stimulus doses did not differ in numbers improved at the end of the course of ECT (~50% in each group).</P>
<P>3.7.2 Leaving the study early<BR/>Only five out of 67 people left this study before completion, with no clear trend favouring any one group. </P>
<P>3.7.3 Number and days of ECT treatments<BR/>In the subgroup of people given ECT who met the criteria for remission (n=22, 34% of sample), those given ECT at twice the threshold required fewer doses of ECT to attain remission, than those given threshold doses (WMD 6.1 CI 2.4 to 10). Similarly those given 4T required fewer treatments than those treated at threshold doses (WMD 9.4 CI 6.3 to 12.5). Treatment at 4T was non-significantly superior to treatment at 2T in reducing the number of treatments required to achieve remission (WMD 3.23 CI 0.8 to 5.6). Similarly, those treated at 2T and 4T required fewer days to attain remission than those given threshold stimuli, but those treated at 4T required on average fewer days of treatment than those given ECT at 2T (WMD 9.4 CI 2.1 to 16.8). </P>
<P>3.8 ECT frequency: three days perweek versus five day per/week <BR/>Limited data from one trial comparing unilateral ECT given three times a week versus five times a week (n=10, <LINK REF="STD-Abrams-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 1967</LINK>) had usable data only for adverse effects. Average endpoint scores on the results of neuropsychological testing indicated no significant advantage for the less frequent treatments and none developed clinical evidence of cognitive impairment.</P>
<P>3.9 ECT number of treatments: 12 versus 20 treatments<BR/>Limited data from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1960</LINK>) showed a significant advantage for 20 treatments over 12 treatments in numbers globally improved at the end of the ECT course (n=43, RR fixed 2.53 CI 1.1 to 5.7). None had concurrent antipsychotics. </P>
<P>4. Sensitivity and sub group analyses<BR/>Other secondary objectives were to evaluate the possibility that ECT may have differential effects in certain subpopulations of people with schizophrenia or with certain schedules of administration of ECT. </P>
<P>4.1 Diagnostic criteria <BR/>When studies that used diagnostic criteria to diagnose schizophrenia were evaluated separately, a modest but insignificant advantage of ECT over sham ECT in the numbers improved at the end of the course of treatment was maintained from heterogeneous data from seven trials (n=187, RR random 0.70 CI 0.46 to 1.08, I-squared 63%). A significant advantage for ECT for this outcome was more evident when the three trials that did not use operational definitions of schizophrenia (<LINK REF="STD-Brill-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Brill 1959</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Naidoo-1956" TYPE="STUDY">Naidoo 1956</LINK>) were separately analysed (n=205, RR fixed 0.74 CI 0.57 to 0.98, I-squared 0%). The degree of overlap in the confidence intervals of these comparisons, however, indicates that the rigour with which the diagnosis of schizophrenia was made did not significantly affect the outcome with ECT. </P>
<P>4.2 Subtypes of schizophrenia and symptom profile <BR/>ECT did not have significant beneficial effects in people with chronic catatonic schizophrenia who took part in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1953</LINK>, although this finding could equally be attributed to chronicity rather than the subtype of schizophrenia. Skewed data from one small trial (n=14, <LINK REF="STD-Girish-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Girish 2003</LINK>), comparing ECT and placebo with risperidone in people with catatonic schizophrenia of varying duration of illness, were analysed by the trialists with repeat measures analysis of variance. This data suggest that ECT produces a faster improvement than risperidone, although dichotomous data of global improvement were equivocal. ECT did significantly result in clinical improvement by the end of the course for those people diagnosed to have paranoid schizophrenia in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1980</LINK> (n=20, RR fixed 0.74, CI 0.6 to 0.91). It was not possible to separate the influence of the duration of illness from the symptom profile of the participants in the selected trials to assess whether ECT has differential effects on positive or negative symptoms. The trials that favoured ECT (<LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Brandon-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Brandon 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1989</LINK>) reported a beneficial effect on positive symptoms. These trials included participants with varying durations of illness. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK> on people with treatment resistant schizophrenia provided data on symptom clusters on BPRS, in those responding to ECT prior to randomisation to continuation treatments. These data indicate significant reductions in positive and negative symptoms, as well as depressive and aggressive symptoms. </P>
<P>None of the identified trials assessed the effects of ECT in people with postpartum exacerbations of schizophrenia. </P>
<P>4.3 Duration of illness <BR/>The power of this review to detect a differential response to ECT for those with a short duration of illness (less than two years) as opposed to those with chronic schizophrenia is very limited. Six trials restricted inclusion to participants with durations of illness less than two years (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Abrams-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 1967</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Doongaji-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Doongaji 1973</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Janakiramiah-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Janakiramiah 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1994</LINK>). Two of these (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 1985</LINK>) provided the data used in the comparison of mental state assessment. This demonstrated a significant advantage for an ECT/antipsychotic drug combination over sham ECT and antipsychotics in both the rate of clinical improvement and the degree of improvement at the end of the course and in the short term. The participants in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1994</LINK> were acutely ill with onset of symptoms less than two months before commencement of treatment. This trial found the combination of ECT and antipsychotics provided no additional benefit to treatment with antipsychotics (and sham ECT) in terms of the numbers improved at the end of the course of ECT, or in the short to medium term. The trials by <LINK REF="STD-Brill-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Brill 1959</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1953</LINK> included people with chronic schizophrenia. ECT alone did not result in greater clinical improvement than sham ECT by the end of treatment in these trials. <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK> included participants who had been ill from between 3 and 30 years and duration of illness did not significantly alter outcome. The remainder of the selected trials were heterogeneous for illness duration, thus preventing their inclusion in the evaluation of the effect of this variable on ECT response. </P>
<P>4.4 Number of ECT treatments<BR/>The only included trial that directly compared differing numbers of ECT treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1960</LINK>) provided limited evidence that courses of ECT comprising 20 treatments resulted in greater numbers of people showing global clinical improvement than among those given 12 treatments. An earlier trial (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1958</LINK>) comparing fixed courses of 20 treatments without antipsychotics, did not result in greater numbers improved than those given antipsychotic drugs. However, both trials used the ectonus technique to elicit seizures and did not use concurrent antipsychotic drugs. The relevance of these trials to current clinical practice is questionable. <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Brandon-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Brandon 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1987</LINK> provide evidence that courses of ECT comprising up to 12 treatments, when given with antipsychotics, may be sufficient to result in significant clinical improvement in people not clearly treatment resistant, but who had shown a limited improvement with antipsychotics compared with antipsychotics and sham ECT (n=67, RR fixed 0.30 CI 0.16 to 0.55, I-squared 11%). Limited evidence for people with short duration illness (&lt; two months; <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1994</LINK>) clearly indicates that shorter courses of six treatments added to antipsychotics result in equal numbers improved when compared to antipsychotic medication and sham ECT. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1989</LINK>) added to the evidence that courses of ECT ranging from six to ten treatments, when combined with moderate doses of antipsychotics, resulted in greater improvement in mental state than treatment with similar doses of antipsychotics alone, after ECT and maintained in the medium term. </P>
<P>We did not select any trial for inclusion that studied people treated with courses of ECT greater than 20 treatments versus less than 20 treatments. </P>
<P>5. Small trial or publication bias<BR/>Funnel plot asymmetry for the ten trials that provided data for the dichotomous outcome 'not improved', in the comparison of ECT versus sham ECT, raised the possibility that smaller negative trials may exist that have not been published. However, no asymmetry was evident when the funnel plot for the thirteen trials that contributed data for the outcome 'leaving the study early' in the same comparison was examined. There were too few studies for the individual outcomes in the other comparisons to be evaluated for publication bias.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>1. Strengths and weakness of the review <BR/>Since the original version of this review was published in 1997 in which we concluded that, "In spite of more than five decades of widespread clinical use, the administration of ECT for those with schizophrenia lacks a strong research base", we have included fourteen more trials, six of which have been conducted since the initial publication of the review. Though the research base for using ECT for people with schizophrenia is expanding in light of continued clinician interest in its use for this group of people, at least in low and middle income countries, there is still a lack of good quality trials for some participants, comparisons and outcomes. This is most notable for the use of ECT for postpartum exacerbation of schizophrenia, maintenance ECT in schizophrenia, and the relative efficacy of ECT versus atypical antipsychotics. Even the number of well-conducted trials comparing ECT with conventional antipsychotics is minimal. </P>
<P>The conclusions made in this review are also weakened by the limited data available for some outcomes and comparisons. The former is partly due to poor reporting that rendered data unusable. With the help of trialists, we have been able to recover some valuable data that permits less tentative conclusions for the outcomes of some comparisons that were previously not possible. However, some data do rest on assumptions of global improvement derived from other data and not directly rated prospectively using the CGI. The simplicity and robustness of the measure does lend itself to such interpretations, but the reliability of such assumptions remains untested. Additionally, the limitations posed (even when reported data are adequate) by the exclusion of skewed data in meta-analyses, unless individual data are available for all studies to be included in the outcomes of interest, still remain. This limits the inclusion of data for primary outcomes from some good quality trials. </P>
<P>Trials in this review spanned five decades, and it is not surprising that there was considerable variation in research design, trial quality, quality of reporting, and methods of administering ECT. The major strength of this review continues to be that it is a maintained quantitative overview of this topic, with all the advantages and limitations of such an endeavour.</P>
<P>2. Applicability of results<BR/>This review uses data from trials conducted in eight countries on four continents (Africa, Asia, Europe and North America), with the majority of the trials originating in two Asian countries, India and Thailand. There was no clear pattern differentiating trials among countries with different levels of income. </P>
<P>Our search did not find any trial in which the effects of ECT were studied in people diagnosed to have 'chronic non-affective mental disorder', though Wu 1988 included participants with "unspecified psychosis". None of the trials included people with schizo-affective disorder, except <LINK REF="STD-Brill-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Brill 1959</LINK>, and in this trial it was not possible to separate out the data from a group of depressed and schizo-affective participants so we had to exclude it from our analysis. The results of this review are subsequently most directly relevant to the use of ECT for adults with schizophrenia, with some relevance to people with schizophreniform disorder and unspecified psychosis. The diagnosis of schizophrenia was based on operational criteria in over half the studies, and depended on clinical judgement in just less than half of the trials. We suggest therefore, that the results of this review are applicable to people with schizophrenia commonly encountered in clinical practice.</P>
<P>3. Homogeneity<BR/>In spite of considerable clinical heterogeneity in the included trials, the comparisons revealed little statistical heterogeneity barring the outcome 'numbers not improved' for the comparison of ECT versus sham ECT. However, the introduction of a measure to quantify the impact of inconsistency in meta-analyses permits us to retain all ten trials in deriving pooled estimates of effect for this outcome. As a result we are now able to provide clearer guidance on this key outcome compared to earlier versions of this review. </P>
<P>4. Comparisons</P>
<P>4.1 ECT versus Sham ECT<BR/>Within the acknowledged limitations, the existing data suggests that ECT may be better than sham ECT/placebo in the short term across different outcomes. This advantage is statistically significant for the relatively crude (though pragmatic and arguably the most clinically relevant) outcome for which the most data is available (n=382, numbers improved/ not improved at the end of the course of ECT). Though there is some heterogeneity, this appears to contribute less to the variability in the outcome estimates across studies than that attributable to sampling error (chance). The results of consecutive sensitivity analyses, wherein removal of data from a small, but very favourable study (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1980</LINK>) and from the one trial that studied people with stringently defined treatment resistant schizophrenia (<LINK REF="STD-Goswami-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Goswami 2001</LINK>), did not result in the pooled estimate favouring those given ECT losing its significant advantage over those given sham ECT. This strengthens the evidence for the use of ECT in people with schizophrenia. The pooled results from the other sensitivity analysis of the three trials that compared ECT with sham ECT/placebo without the use of antipsychotics (<LINK REF="STD-Brill-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Brill 1959</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Small-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1982</LINK>), suggests that true differences in estimates of effect favouring ECT over sham ECT may be obscured in trials by co-intervention with antipsychotics, which are un-disputably effective in improving the symptoms of schizophrenia. However the quality of reporting and allocation concealment of many included studies was relatively poor, and this has been shown to be associated with over estimates of effect in meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>). Such problems are quite common in schizophrenia research (<LINK REF="REF-Thornley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornley 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>This advantage of ECT appears largely to lie in a more rapid improvement in symptoms, but there is insufficient evidence to indicate that this advantage over sham ECT, with or without concurrent antipsychotics, persists beyond the initial six to eight weeks. However, this is similar to the effect of ECT in the treatment of depressive disorders, where ECT is recommended for short term improvement in acute symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2003</LINK>) and relapse rates are high without appropriate continuation treatment with medication and psychosocial interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Devanand-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devanand 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Prien-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prien 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Prudic-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prudic 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sackeim-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackeim 1990</LINK>). This advantage for ECT is only for people who are later on in the course of their illness, where antipsychotic drugs with sham ECT appear at least as effective. Nor do the results apply to people with stringently defined treatment resistance, where the results for 'not improved' were equivocal. However, both these assertions are weakened by the small sample sizes of representative participants. There was also a suggestion that ECT is superior to sham ECT in facilitating discharges and reducing relapses in the medium term relative to sham ECT. </P>
<P>Since there is now more compelling evidence to support the positive effects of ECT in the treatment of schizophrenia, there is justification for large, well designed trials with clear cut outcomes of clinical relevance, of which dichotomous measures of global clinical improvement appear the most widely used by clinicians and consumers.</P>
<P>In view of the doubts raised regarding the dubious ethical status of sham ECT (given the potential risks with anaesthesia and the possibility that recipients may be misled into thinking that it is risk-free (<LINK REF="REF-Lock-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lock 1995b</LINK>)), together with the evidence contained in this review, it would appear that further trials of ECT versus sham ECT without concurrent antipsychotics are unjustified. </P>
<P>4.2. ECT versus antipsychotic drugs <BR/>Data from this review suggest that ECT given alone is significantly less effective than antipsychotic medication across several outcomes, even in the short term. This would seem to support clinical experience. </P>
<P>However, the review also contains some evidence to support the impression that a faster and greater symptomatic improvement in mental state occurs when ECT is added to antipsychotic medication. For the outcome of 'global impression' there was no clear difference between the combined results of trials using antipsychotics as well as ECT or sham ECT, and those that used no antipsychotic drugs. In one mental state outcome there was a difference, suggesting a possible added benefit to combining ECT with antipsychotics. These data are so limited that they should only be considered as hypothesis generating. The results of trials most strongly favouring ECT in the short term (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Brandon-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Brandon 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1989</LINK>) do suggest a role for the addition of ECT for people who show limited response to antipsychotic medication, but this needs further evaluation. </P>
<P>Considering the controversy, there are very few data on adverse effects in general, especially as regards memory loss. One small study failed to detect any (n=40, <LINK REF="STD-Bagadia-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bagadia 1981</LINK>), and another (n=40, <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1989</LINK>) detected subtle memory impairment after a course of ECT combined with antipsychotics compared to a course of antipsychotics alone, though this disappeared nine weeks later. The clinical impression is that memory impairment is not gross and is transient, though some reports question the validity and perspective of these impressions (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 2003</LINK>). The studies included in this review support clinical impressions but their results should not be considered conclusive. </P>
<P>4.3. ECT versus psychotherapy <BR/>Very limited data from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>) suggest that, in the short and long term, ECT is better than psychoanalytical psychotherapy for those with schizophrenia, but that adding medication to psychotherapy reverses the trend. This update found no evidence on the relative efficacy of ECT and other psychological treatments such as cognitive behaviour therapy or family interventions in hastening recovery, alleviating persistent symptoms or preventing relapses that might guide opinion or practice</P>
<P>4.4. ECT versus insulin coma therapy <BR/>Limited data (n=33, <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1958" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1958</LINK>) suggest that insulin coma therapy is as effective, or ineffective as ECT in the short term. If as the above comparisons seem to suggest, ECT does have some effect, this may indicate that even the outmoded insulin coma therapy may have an effect. It is unlikely however that this intervention will receive much research interest. </P>
<P>4.5. Continuation ECT versus antipsychotic drugs<BR/>Limited evidence from one well-conducted trial (n= 51, <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK>) provides some support for continuation ECT added to antipsychotics. Participants were those who exhitbited clear treatment resistance to conventional antipsychotics. The low number of people required to be treated to prevent a single person relapsing (NNT 2 CI 1.5 to 2.5) is all the more remarkable considering the comparison was not with placebo, but against active treatments, and was amongst a group of people who had exhausted conventional treatment options. Further well conducted studies are required to confirm and elaborate upon these findings for people with less established treatment resistance, and for those resistant to conventional antipsychotics in receipt of atypical antipsychotics.</P>
<P>4.6 Electrode placement: bilateral versus unilateral ECT <BR/>The limited data from the three small trials (n=118) contributing to this comparison was further restricted by one of the trials reporting no information for numbers improved or changes in mental state. Data from two trials did not reveal any differences between the two forms of ECT in numbers clinically improved at the end of the course of ECT or in the medium term, or in changes in mental state at the end of the course of ECT. This does not necessarily confirm that the two methods are equal in efficacy. One of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Doongaji-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Doongaji 1973</LINK>) did not use antipsychotics in either arm, and had lower overall rates of improvement than the other (<LINK REF="STD-Sarita-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sarita 1998</LINK>), where a non-significant trend marginally favoured bilateral ECT. The results of randomised trials undertaken on people with depression reveal that unilateral ECT needs to be administered at stimulus doses considerably above individually titrated seizure threshold to equal the efficacy of bilateral ECT (<LINK REF="REF-Sackeim-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackeim 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sackeim-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackeim 2000</LINK>). Data contained in this review provide evidence that suprathreshold stimuli improve the rate, if not the extent of, improvement with bilateral brief pulse ECT in people with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK>) and it might transpire that the effects of ECT differ between people with depression and those with schizophrenia. However, because unilateral ECT, at moderately suprathreshold stimulus intensities, is inferior in efficacy but superior to bilateral ECT with regard to cognitive impairment in people with depression (<LINK REF="REF-Sackeim-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackeim 1993</LINK>), further trials are necessary. These trials for people with schizophrenia would compare unilateral and bilateral ECT with varying doses of electrical stimuli and would hence supplement lower levels of evidence (<LINK REF="STD-El-Islam-1970" TYPE="STUDY">El Islam 1970</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.7 Threshold stimulus versus suprathreshold stimulus intensities <BR/>Limited data from a subgroup of people in another well-conducted trial (n=22/64, <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK>) attests to faster clinical improvement if ECT is administered at stimulus doses, four times individually titrated seizure threshold, than at lower stimulus doses. Data on such small groups of people are intriguing and should encourage the creation of large studies which would finally resolve the issue of stimulus intensity.</P>
<P>4.8 ECT frequency: three times weekly versus five times weekly <BR/>All data are derived from a study size of ten people (<LINK REF="STD-Abrams-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 1967</LINK>). From this study we cannot draw any conclusions regarding the relative merits and adverse effects of different frequencies of administering ECT. This is another unanswered question regarding ECT that warrants further evidence. (<LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999d" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999d</LINK>).</P>
<P>4.9 ECT - number of treatments: short versus long courses <BR/>The basis of the common assertion that people with schizophrenia require longer courses of ECT than those with depression does not appear to be supported by randomised evidence (n=43, <LINK REF="STD-Baker-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1960</LINK>). </P>
<P>Some data from other studies not directly comparing length of treatment, do suggest that for those with acute illness, short courses of up to six treatments may suffice, while for people with longer duration of illness, courses of ECT numbering between six and 12, when added to antipsychotic drugs, increase the likelihood of attaining clinical remission. For people with schizophrenia clearly resistant to conventional antipsychotics, however, longer courses of up to 20 treatments with bilateral ECT, administered at four times seizure threshold, could increase the chances of a positive outcome. However data for the number of treatments required for people with treatment resistant schizophrenia is not based on randomised comparisons of short versus long courses of treatment, but on two trials that studied up to 20 treatments with ECT in those with treatment resistant schizophrenia (<LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK>). These two trials used a 'stabilisation period ' after obtaining remission with courses of ECT. That period consisted of further ECT spaced at longer intervals over three weeks in order to consolidate remission. Spacing ECT treatments after an initial course of twice or three times weekly treatments is a practice followed by some clinicians, though the evidence for the efficacy of this in people with schizophrenia is limited to uncontrolled case series (<LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999b</LINK>). In view of the results from the two trials in this review that used this practice and longer courses of treatment, together with the speculation in <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1980</LINK> that premature termination of treatment after apparent remission may have contributed to relapses, we suggest the need for further trials on the optimal number of treatments and patterns of termination of treatments in people with schizophrenia.</P>
<P>5. Differential effects in subgroups<BR/>There is no clear evidence to support or refute the use of ECT for particular subgroups of schizophrenia. There is a suggestion from the primary analysis of limited and skewed continuous data (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>) by the trialists in <LINK REF="STD-Girish-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Girish 2003</LINK>, that people with catatonic schizophrenia who do not show rapid improvement following an initial trial of a benzodiazepine, improve faster with a course of ECT than with the newer antipsychotic risperidone. However resolution of symptoms in some people in this subgroup may require more than six applications of ECT. It is ironic that the frequently quoted assertion (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-APA-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kruger-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruger 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lock-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lock 1995a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2003</LINK>) that catatonia is an important indication for ECT in people with schizophrenia is currently supported by data of the highest level of evidence from a single trial of only 14 participants, eight of whom were given ECT and four of whom were required to continue with ECT beyond the period of the trial. </P>
<P>Limited data suggests that ECT does not provide additional benefit over antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia whose illness is of very short duration (less than two months, <LINK REF="STD-Sarkar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkar 1994</LINK>) or those hospitalised with chronic illness (10 years or more, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1953" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1953</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Brill-1959" TYPE="STUDY">Brill 1959</LINK>). However, data from some of the trials included in this review suggest that people with exacerbations of symptoms of schizophrenia may respond to ECT irrespective of the duration of illness (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Small-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1989</LINK>). </P>
<P>The efficacy of ECT, when schizophrenia is diagnosed using operationally defined criteria, indicates a specific effect on schizophrenic symptoms, rather than causing an improvement in those with affective disorder misdiagnosed as schizophrenia. </P>
<P>Many people referred for ECT in the trials included in this review had to various extents, failed to respond to treatment with conventional antipsychotics. However, since people in the trials were not stratified before randomisation based on prior response to antipsychotics, this review is unable to report clear data for this population. However, data from the only trial that directly studied the effects of ECT versus sham ECT in people with stringently defined treatment resistant schizophrenia on concurrent antipsychotics, did not support the use of ECT. This is in contrast to the results obtained in phase I of the continuation ECT trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chanpattana-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Chanpattana 1999a</LINK>) for people with treatment resistant schizophrenia referred for ECT where 58/101 patients treated with ECT met pre-stated criteria for remission after seven to 25 treatments (mean 13.9 SD 4.8). While these results approximate or better those obtained in trials of clozapine in treatment resistant schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1988</LINK>), the lack of a control group and randomisation limits their strength. We await the results of the ongoing trial of ECT in people with schizophrenia who have exhausted all other established treatment options other than ECT (<LINK REF="STD-Petrides-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Petrides 2000</LINK>). This important trial will still not provide an answer to whether ECT, when added to conventional or newer antipsychotic drugs, would benefit those who show an insufficient response to sequential trials of available drugs, but for whom clozapine may not be a viable option. Unfortunately, this is the case with the majority of people with treatment resistance in low income countries.</P>
<P>6. Acceptability of ECT<BR/>None of the included trials directly addressed the acceptability of treatments for people with schizophrenia. However, data from trials that provided numbers for those leaving the trials early did not suggest that those given ECT dropped out earlier than those given antipsychotics or sham ECT/placebo. </P>
<P>7. Adverse effects<BR/>The use of ECT appears to be associated with greater cognitive impairment at the end of the course of treatment than the use of conventional antipsychotics, but from the data available, this impairment appears to be transient. Limited evidence indicates normalisation of cognitive functions over the medium term after courses of ECT. This review did not find data to support lower levels of evidence that ECT may have a protective effect on the emergence of extra-pyramidal symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Goswami-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goswami 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mukherjee-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mukherjee 1994</LINK>) or tardive dyskinesia (<LINK REF="REF-Gardos-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardos 1980</LINK>) for people also receiving antipsychotic drugs.</P>
<P>8. Death<BR/>None of the included trials, barring <LINK REF="STD-May-1968" TYPE="STUDY">May 1968</LINK>, specifically reported on mortality after interventions. However, none of the 779 people given ECT from among the included trials were reported to have died during the course of ECT or during the immediate period of follow up. The very few deaths that did occur in these trials do not implicate the course of ECT, and, overall, mortality seems low.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. For people with schizophrenia<BR/>The evidence in this review suggests that courses of ECT, when added to antipsychotic medication, in the short term, can result in an increase in global improvement for some people with schizophrenia. There are some data indicating a transient and probably slight memory impairment resulting from ECT. </P>
<P>There is no suggestion that ECT should be a sole treatment or treatment of first choice in schizophrenia. Antipsychotic drugs remain the preferential treatment. There is some evidence to suggest that ECT appears to benefit some who have shown a limited response to antipsychotic medication. Also, in those who improve with ECT but relapse in spite of continuing on the prescribed antipsychotics, the continuation of ECT, given at longer intervals, together with antipsychotic drugs could reduce the possibility of relapse in the medium term.</P>
<P>2. For clinicians<BR/>The overall evidence for the effectiveness of ECT suggests that this approach should remain a potential treatment option for people with psychoses. Despite drugs remaining the preferential treatment for schizophrenia, ECT added to antipsychotic drug treatment does have its place. Data could be used to support the use of courses of up to 12 ECT, and for some people up to 20 treatments. There is no evidence to suggest that only those with schizophrenia experiencing depressive or catatonic features will benefit from this treatment. Limited evidence suggests that electrical stimulus doses during ECT, two to four times greater than the minimum dose required to elicit a seizure, are likely to increase the rate of recovery and reduce the number and duration of treatments with bilateral ECT. There is also some data to suggest that the use of continuation ECT along with antipsychotics, for those who respond to an initial course of ECT, is superior to continuation treatment with antipsychotics alone or ECT alone in preventing relapses in the medium term. Even if the benefit of ECT is short term, this may be of particular relevance in situations where speed of improvement is important. There are no data relating to treatment of women who have become psychotic in the postpartum period.</P>
<P>There remain many unanswered questions for this intervention. The use of ECT for people with schizophrenia from within a well-designed randomised trial, non intrusive on routine care, is justified. </P>
<P>3. For policy makers<BR/>While some of the evidence in this review only points to the effectiveness of ECT for certain outcomes, there is enough data to suggest the inclusion of ECT as an option for the treatment of people with schizophrenia (NNT 6 CI 4 to 12 for clinical global improvement at the end of the course). There is sufficient evidence of effect to justify funding of well designed, pragmatic trials of ECT in people with varying degrees of antipsychotic non-response and for other unanswered questions regarding this treatment. Guidelines for the use of ECT that based their recommendations (at least in part) on the results of earlier versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2003</LINK>), might wish to consider the results of this update when reviewing the evidence for future recommendations. In the light of this update it would seem unfortunate if current guideline recommendations, due to their perceived adherence to evidence based approaches and widespread impact on clinical opinion and practice, outside their intended sphere of influence, preclude the option of ECT as a treatment. This is especially the case for those who have exhausted other options or who have limited options to begin with.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. General<BR/>In agreement with many other reviewers, we suggest that strict adherence to CONSORT recommendations for reporting of trials (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) would greatly increase the usefulness of data, avoid redundancy and facilitate the production of more clear results. Making raw data available at the time of publication, possibly on a web site (<LINK REF="REF-Hutchon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutchon 2001</LINK>), though not without it's problems (<LINK REF="REF-Eysenbach-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eysenbach 2001</LINK>), would greatly reduce errors of interpretation while extracting data, prevent exclusion of valuable data and trials from inclusion in meta-analyses, permit log transformation of skewed data and facilitate individual-patient meta-analysis. </P>
<P>2. Specific to ECT for schizophrenia<BR/>There are still many unanswered questions regarding the efficacy of ECT for people with schizophrenia. The small number of participants in many trials fuels the case for a large, well planned randomised trial of ECT and antipsychotics (conventional and atypical) compared to antipsychotics (with or without sham ECT). This trial would benefit from uncomplicated outcome measures such as 'clinical global improvement' in order to confirm the suggestions of efficacy indicated by this review. </P>
<P>Other areas of interest are: <BR/>i. People with schizophrenia who show limited response to conventional and atypical antipsychotics and evaluating suprathreshold electrical stimulus doses<BR/> ii. Comparisons of long (&gt;=12) versus short (&lt;12) courses of ECT for people with schizophrenia stratified according to prior response to antipsychotic drugs<BR/> iii. Simple and preferably categorical measures of social and occupational functioning in the medium to long term<BR/> iv. Assessment of cognitive and other adverse effects, including mortality through suicides or other causes. In particular, assessing the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia and other movement disorders in these populations would answer the question as to whether the use of ECT protects against the emergence of these syndromes through a direct protective effect or by reducing antipsychotic drug requirement<BR/> v. Some direct measure of acceptability of the intervention to the participants, perhaps undertaken by a mixed team of proponents and opponents of the use of ECT<BR/> vi. The efficacy of ECT for mothers with postpartum exacerbations of schizophrenia, where ECT might be given to hasten recovery and reduce antipsychotic drug exposure during breast feeding<BR/> vii. The benefits and risks of adding ECT to newer atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine and risperidone for people who have failed trials of both conventional and newer drugs and have therefore exhausted treatment options<BR/> viii. The role of continuation and maintenance ECT in preventing relapse of symptoms<BR/> ix. Comparisons of costs of ECT versus other treatments<BR/> ix. Comparisons of the efficacy and safety of ECT and other emerging physical treatments such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for people with schizophrenia with persistent symptoms.</P>
