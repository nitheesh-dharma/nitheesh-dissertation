<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>This review, carried out by authors of the Cochrane Oral Health Group, was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of current screening programmes in detecting oral cancer at an early stage and whether or not they can assist in decreasing deaths due to oral cancer.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Oral cancer is increasing worldwide and it is the sixth most common cancer overall. The highest rates of oral cancer occur in the most disadvantaged sections of the population. Important risk factors in the development of the disease are tobacco, alcohol, age, gender and sunlight although a role for candida (which causes thrush) and the human papillomavirus (which causes warts) has also been documented. People who are heavy drinkers and also smoke have 38 times the risk of developing oral cancer compared with people who do neither. These factors are considered to be especially important in the development of the disease in young people, a group experiencing an increasing incidence of the disease, particularly in countries with a high incidence of it.</P>
<P>Geographic variation in the occurrence of oral cancer around the world is wide. For example it is the most common cancer for men in India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan and 30% of all new cases of cancer in these countries is oral cancer whereas only 3% of new cases of cancer in the United Kingdom are oral cancer.</P>
<P>When people first seek medical help, their oral cancer is usually at a late or advanced stage and the effects of the condition as well as the treatment for it can be extremely debilitating. Death rates from oral cancer and the negative effects of the disease are high and increasing rather than declining as for other cancers such as breast and colon.</P>
<P>Prevention screening programmes for other cancers have proven to be effective in early detection. However, whilst there maybe advantages to screening there are disadvantages because screening has the potential to produce either false positive or false negative results. Screening can be targeted at high-risk groups, it can be opportunistic, for example when people attend health services for other reasons, or can be done by looking at statistics across the population as a whole.</P>
<P>The aim of preventive screening for early detection of oral cancer is to screen individuals for pre-cancerous conditions which are lesions such as leukoplakia. The most common screening method is visual inspection by a clinician but other techniques include the use of a special blue dye, the use of imaging techniques and measuring biochemical changes to normal calls.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence on which this review is based is up to date as of 22 July 2013. The only study included was based in rural areas of the city of Trivandrum in Kerala, India. The study included 191,873 apparently healthy adults aged 35 years or older living in 13 clusters with an average of 14,759 participants in each cluster. Screening took place in seven clusters (96,517 participants) and six clusters acted as a control (95,356 participants). Participants were excluded if they were bedridden, if they had open tuberculosis, other debilitating diseases or were already suffering from oral cancer.</P>
<P>Healthcare workers trained in the detection of oral lesions undertook the screening of participants and the social history of participants including use of paan, tobacco, alcohol and dietary supplements was recorded.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The review found that overall there is not enough evidence to decide whether screening by visual inspection reduces the death rate for oral cancer and there is no evidence for other screening methods. However, there is some evidence that it might help reduce death rates in patients who use tobacco and alcohol although the only included study may be affected by bias.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence presented is of low quality and limited to one study assessed as at high risk of bias.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-12 16:57:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oral cancer is an important global healthcare problem, its incidence is increasing and late-stage presentation is common. Screening programmes have been introduced for a number of major cancers and have proved effective in their early detection. Given the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with oral cancer, there is a need to determine the effectiveness of a screening programme for this disease, either as a targeted, opportunistic or population-based measure. Evidence exists from modelled data that a visual oral examination of high-risk individuals may be a cost-effective screening strategy and the development and use of adjunctive aids and biomarkers is becoming increasingly common.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-09-12 17:01:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effectiveness of current screening methods in decreasing oral cancer mortality.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-09-12 16:58:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Littlewood">
<P>We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 22 July 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2013, Issue 6), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 22 July 2013), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 22 July 2013) and CANCERLIT via PubMed (1950 to 22 July 2013). There were no restrictions on language in the search of the electronic databases.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-10-06 12:41:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of screening for oral cancer or potentially malignant disorders using visual examination, toluidine blue, fluorescence imaging or brush biopsy.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-11-19 11:27:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors screened the results of the searches against inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias independently and in duplicate. We used mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous data and risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs for dichotomous data. Meta-analyses would have been undertaken using a random-effects model if the number of studies had exceeded a minimum of three. Study authors were contacted where possible and where deemed necessary for missing information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-11-19 11:28:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 3239 citations were identified through the searches. Only one RCT, with 15-year follow-up met the inclusion criteria (n = 13 clusters: 191,873 participants). There was no statistically significant difference in the oral cancer mortality rates for the screened group (15.4/100,000 person-years) and the control group (17.1/100,000 person-years), with a RR of 0.88 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.12). A 24% reduction in mortality was reported between the screening group (30/100,000 person-years) and the control group (39.0/100,000) for high-risk individuals who used tobacco or alcohol or both, which was statistically significant (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97). No statistically significant differences were found for incidence rates. A statistically significant reduction in the number of individuals diagnosed with stage III or worse oral cancer was found for those in the screening group (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.93). No harms were reported. The study was assessed as at high risk of bias.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-11-19 11:29:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence that a visual examination as part of a population-based screening programme reduces the mortality rate of oral cancer in high-risk individuals. In addition, there is a stage shift and improvement in survival rates across the population as a whole. However, the evidence is limited to one study, which has a high risk of bias and did not account for the effect of cluster randomisation in the analysis. There was no evidence to support the use of adjunctive technologies like toluidine blue, brush biopsy or fluorescence imaging as a screening tool to reduce oral cancer mortality. Further RCTs are recommended to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a visual examination as part of a population-based screening programme in low, middle and high-income countries.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-11-19 11:39:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oral cancer is the sixth most common cancer globally and represents a group of conditions with a range of sites and a varied aetiology. Its annual estimated incidence is approximately 275,000, but unlike many other cancers, its incidence is increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2009</LINK>). There is a wide geographic variation in the incidence of the disease with two-thirds of the burden born by low-income and middle-income countries from South and South-East Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. However, the incidence continues to rise in the West (<LINK REF="REF-IARC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">IARC 2010</LINK>) and the age standardised incidence of oral cancer in Western Europe has steadily increased over the past two decades (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2005</LINK>). Within the European Union countries, the highest male incidence rates are found in France and Hungary, whilst the lowest rates are found in Greece and Cyprus (<LINK REF="REF-IARC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">IARC 2010</LINK>). India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan have the highest levels of disease, making it the most common cancer for men in these countries and accounts for up to 30% of all new cases of cancer compared to 3% in the United Kingdom (UK) and 6% in France (<LINK REF="REF-Cancer-Research-UK" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cancer Research UK</LINK>). The age-adjusted incidence rate from these countries cancer registries range from 3.4 to 13.8 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Ministry-of-Health-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ministry of Health 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2009</LINK>). The incidence of oral cancer for men in Brazil is second only to France and India with an estimated crude rate of 11 per 100,000. In the UK, the incidence of oral cancer is increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Conway-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conway 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doobaree-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doobaree 2009</LINK>) and 6236 cases of oral cancer were diagnosed in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Cancer-Research-UK" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cancer Research UK</LINK>). This represents a doubling of the number of cases seen in 1989 and represents a year on year increase of approximately 2.7% per year (<LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2009</LINK>). The incidence of oral cancer is strongly associated with social and economic deprivation (<LINK REF="REF-Scully-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scully 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Conway-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conway 2010a</LINK>), with the highest rates occurring in the most disadvantaged sections of the population. Across Europe, inequalities tend to be observed among men, particularly in the UK and Eastern Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Conway-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conway 2010b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Important risk factors in the development of the disease are tobacco, betel quid, alcohol, age, gender and sunlight. More recently, a role for candida and the human papillomavirus (HPV) has been documented (<LINK REF="REF-Scully-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scully 2009</LINK>). Epidemiological evidence from US populations indicates a strong association between HPV and oropharyngeal cancers (<LINK REF="REF-Cleveland-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleveland 2011</LINK>). Incidence of HPV globally is unknown but thought to be rising, but estimates from the United States of America (USA) show a substantial increase of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers, rising by 225% in the period between 1984 and 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Sanders-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 2011</LINK>). Increased consumption of alcohol has been implicated in the increasing incidence of the disease in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Hindle-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hindle 2000</LINK>) at a time when tobacco use is falling (<LINK REF="REF-Ogden-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogden 2005</LINK>), although the precise mechanism remains unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Ogden-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogden 1998</LINK>). Heavy drinkers and smokers have 38 times the risk of developing oral cancer compared to abstainers (<LINK REF="REF-Blot-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blot 1988</LINK>). This is thought to be due to acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of alcohol, which is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen and is also present in tobacco (<LINK REF="REF-Salaspuro-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salaspuro 2011</LINK>). Historically, the risk of developing oral cancer increased with age, however, the age group with the highest incidence (26.8%) in the USA between 2003 and 2007 was between 55 and 64 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-SEER-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">SEER 2010</LINK>). In contrast, many patients from high-incidence countries are below the age of 40 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of equal concern to the increasing incidence, is the lack of any change in the age-standardised mortality rates, despite advances in surgical and management techniques. This is unlike the falling rates for cancer of the breast and colon (<LINK REF="REF-Cancer-Research-UK" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cancer Research UK</LINK>). The five-year survival rates for oral cancer for most countries is approximately 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2009</LINK>). These have been estimated at 3 to 4 per 100,000 men and 1.5 to 2.0 per 100,000 for women respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2009</LINK>). Mortality rates from oral cancer have also increased in certain European countries (<LINK REF="REF-La-Vecchia-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">La Vecchia 2004</LINK>). The most important determinant factor in cancer survival is diagnostic delay (<LINK REF="REF-Onizawa-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onizawa 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McLeod-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLeod 2005</LINK>), as over 60% of patients present with stage III and IV disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lingen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lingen 2008</LINK>), meaning that their management is complex and multidisciplinary. The stage at diagnosis significantly affects five-year survival, with survival rates approaching 80% for stage I disease, whilst dropping significantly for stage IV disease (<LINK REF="REF-Rusthoven-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rusthoven 2010</LINK>). In addition, the morbidity associated with surgery is high, the rate of second primary tumours is greater than any other type of cancer (3% to 7% per annum) (<LINK REF="REF-Day-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 1992</LINK>) and is more often the cause of death (<LINK REF="REF-Lippman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lippman 1989</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-09-12 17:11:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prevention strategies are important to meet the World Health Organization's (WHO) resolution to incorporate oral cancer into national cancer control programs (<LINK REF="REF-Petersen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 2009</LINK>). Although it is important to continue to clarify the public health message and promote primary prevention, determining the feasibility of a national screening programme is an important step in the prevention of the disease. The National Screening Committee define screening as "a process of identifying apparently healthy people who may be at increased risk of a disease or condition" (<LINK REF="REF-NSC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSC 2010</LINK>). Screening can be undertaken across the whole population, opportunistically, when individuals are attending for some other purpose, or selectively, where high-risk groups are targeted. Programmes for major cancers, such as breast, cervical and bowel cancer have effectively improved the mortality rates and helped to decrease the incidence of these cancers (<LINK REF="REF-G_x00f8_tzsche-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gøtzsche 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hewitson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hewitson 2007</LINK>). However, it is important to consider both the harms and benefits of any screening programmes. For example, screening for breast cancer has recently been associated with over-diagnosis and unnecessary treatment causing further physical and psychological harms (<LINK REF="REF-G_x00f8_tzsche-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gøtzsche 2013</LINK>) and so any future programme should always balance these considerations.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-11-19 11:46:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Screening is predicated on the idea that malignancy is preceded by clinically evident lesions, which if identified early and removed, can either prevent their malignant transformation or reduce their staging. The majority of oral carcinomas are preceded by visible lesions, known as potentially malignant disorders (PMDs) (<LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Waal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Waal 2009</LINK>) that exhibit oral epithelial dysplasia (<LINK REF="REF-Scully-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scully 2009</LINK>). A visual screen is not surgically invasive, is painless and has been found to be socially acceptable. Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> highlights the different types of PMDs that were considered by the WHO's Working Party on Oral Cancer and Precancer to be important (<LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2007</LINK>). The most common form of PMD is leukoplakia (<LINK REF="REF-Napier-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Napier 2008</LINK>), which has an estimated global prevalence of 2.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72% to 2.74%) (<LINK REF="REF-Petti-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petti 2003</LINK>). However, the extent and rate of progression of dysplasia in leukoplakia is not uniform and can vary from site to site and within the same lesion (<LINK REF="REF-Napier-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Napier 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overall malignant transformation rate for oral leukoplakia is up to 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Scully-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scully 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Waal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Waal 2009</LINK>), but the lack of uniformity in the extent and the rate of dysplastic change in PMDs means that predicting malignant transformation is problematic. However, there remains a consensus in the literature that the majority of cancers are preceded by a detectable pre-clinical phase (<LINK REF="REF-Napier-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Napier 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although there have been no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in any developed or low-prevalence populations (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 2010a</LINK>), Speight et al demonstrated using a simulated model that an oral examination of high-risk individuals may be a cost-effective screening strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Speight-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speight 2006</LINK>). A recent diagnostic test accuracy review looking at the accuracy of conventional oral examination as a screening test in primary settings found sensitivity estimates to range from 0.50 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.93) to 0.99 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.00) with specificity estimates 0.98 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.00) to 0.99 (95% CI 0.99 to 0.99) (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2013</LINK>). Positive predictive values ranged from 0.31 to 0.86; negative predictive values ranged from 0.96 to 0.99 (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2013</LINK>). Other adjunctive and diagnostic aids can be grouped into visual staining (toluidine blue), oral cytology using brush biopsy and a number of light-based techniques (e.g. ViziLite (Zila Pharmaceuticals, AZ, USA) and VELscope (LED Dental Inc, BC, Canada)) (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 2010a</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-09-12 17:15:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The RCT provides the strongest level of evidence on which to base clinical decisions (<LINK REF="REF-Clarkson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarkson 2003</LINK>) and so represents a level of rigor that is appropriate for assessing the effectiveness of any intervention or programme. As with other cancers, screening for oral cancer and PMDs has potential advantages and disadvantages (<LINK REF="REF-Speight-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speight 1992</LINK>). Screening and treatment may offer the opportunity to reduce the incidence of invasive lesions and also could help in decreasing the mortality rates associated with oral cancer. Speight et al demonstrated that targeting high risk groups could result in a pronounced increase in the Quality Adjusted Life Years saved and any associated stage shifts could produce significant cost savings (<LINK REF="REF-Speight-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speight 2006</LINK>). However, screening also has the potential to generate false positives and false negatives (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1968</LINK>). Earlier versions of this Cochrane review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of screening for oral cancer in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Kujan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kujan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kujan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kujan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-2010c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 2010c</LINK>).

<P>A total of 3239 citations were identified through the MEDLINE searches. The full text of 30 articles were retrieved. Following further screening, 26 of these were excluded with reasons (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). One of the excluded studies did undertake a community-based randomised controlled trial to examine the efficacy of toluidine blue in Taiwan (<LINK REF="STD-Su-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2010</LINK>). However, the primary aim was to determine whether toluidine blue enhanced the detection rate for potentially malignant disorders (PMD), not mortality rate. Although they did link the examined cohort with the National Cancer Registry to determine five-year follow-up, the power calculation was based on the former not the latter. As a result, the study was excluded from this review but included in an accompanying diagnostic test accuracy review (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2013</LINK>). Only one study (four reports) met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Sankaranarayanan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sankaranarayanan 2000</LINK>). The principal investigator of the included trial (Dr Sankaranarayanan) was also contacted and no other relevant trials were identified (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The included study (Trivandrum Oral Cancer Screening Study; <LINK REF="STD-Sankaranarayanan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sankaranarayanan 2000</LINK>) was designed to have an 80% power at the 5% significance level to detect a 35% reduction in the cumulative mortality rate of oral cancer in 12 years of enrolment between the intervention and the control groups. The study commenced in October 1995 and three rounds of screening at three-year intervals were planned for the study. The first round was completed in May 1998 and the second was completed in June 2002. The third round was completed in October 2004. A final round of screening was completed in 2009.</P>
<P>All participants (n = 191,873) were apparently healthy residents aged 35 years or older and lived in 13 rural clusters around Trivandrum City, Kerala, India, The mean number of eligible participants in each cluster was 14,759. These clusters were allocated into an intervention arm (n = 7) and a control arm (n = 6) by a blocked randomisation process. Those residents who were bedridden, suffering from open tuberculosis or other debilitating diseases were excluded alongside those participants who had already been diagnosed with oral cancer prior to entry into the study.</P>
<P>In the intervention arm, non-medical university graduates were initially trained and were provided with two simple manuals on oral visual examination with colour photographs and descriptions of various oral lesions. Eligible participants were interviewed and information relating to demographic, social and personal habits including the use of paan, tobacco, alcohol and dietary supplements was recorded. Tobacco and alcohol cessation advice was provided as appropriate. Oral visual inspections were performed in daylight with the help of a flashlight. All the intra-oral sites were carefully examined and palpated and the neck was also palpated to detect enlarged lymph nodes. The findings were recorded as normal, non-referable lesions and referable lesions.</P>
<P>Participants who had a positive screen were referred for examination by a dentist or physician for confirmation. It is unclear whether these clinicians were also trained in the recognition of oral cancer or PMDs. Oral biopsies were performed in those with clinically confirmed homogeneous leukoplakias, non-homogeneous leukoplakias, oral submucous fibrosis and oral cancers. Surgical excision was undertaken for leukoplakia wherever possible. All PMDs were reviewed regularly.</P>
<P>In the control arm, participants were visited by a "control health worker" who recorded the same sociodemographic information and measured height, weight, blood pressure and respiratory peak flow measurements. The health workers in the control arm were not trained to undertake a visual oral inspection.</P>
<P>Oral cancer mortality was reported as the main outcome measure.</P>
<P>Of the 96,517 eligible subjects in the intervention arm, 25,144 (26.1%) had one, 22,382 (23.2%) had two, 22,008 (22.8%) had three and 19,288 (20.0%) had four cycles of screening. 49,179 (51.0%) individuals were screened in the first round and 55,993 (58.0%), 64,898 (67.2%) and 43,014 (44.6%) were screened in the second, third and fourth cycles respectively. The participation rate (at least one screen) for this group was 88,822 (92%); males (86%) and females (94%). Of the 95,356 eligible subjects in the control group, 43,992 (46.1%) were screened in the fourth cycle.</P>
<P>Demographic details were not provided for the final (fourth) cycle of screening, but were provided for the first three cycles (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Across the period of the study (all four cycles), 6.3% (n = 5586) of subjects screened as part of the intervention group had a referable lesion and 59% (n = 3298) of these screen positive subjects complied with referral (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). The control group consisted of 95,356 persons. 46% (n = 43,992) of the control group were screened in the final (fourth) cycle and 2.6% (n = 1163) of these were found to have a referable lesion with 16.3% (n = 189) complying with referral.</P>

<P>Positive cases were referred to dentists and physicians to make a diagnosis, but it is unclear whether standardised criteria were used by these clinicians or whether they had received any formal training. It is stated that subjects with confirmed oral cancer and PMDs were biopsied and those with confirmed oral cancer were referred. However, this detail was absent and only 26.4% and 26.0% of subjects with a PMD had a biopsy in the second or third cycle respectively. It is not clear whether all suspected oral cancer cases did receive a biopsy, but given the definition of "interval cases" in the third paper, it would appear not.</P>
<P>In addition, it is stated in the third paper that the reference investigation for final diagnosis was clinical examination by physicians or histology or both. As it is not possible to diagnose early malignancy by visual appearance alone, this may have led to substantial under-reporting of oral cancer. The lack of a histological diagnosis for many of the PMDs also makes it difficult to accurately assess the correct diagnosis and true prevalence of these disorders. Prevalence of PMDs is provided in detail for the first two cycles only. The fourth paper presents incidence and mortality data for each round of screening. Neither the third or fourth papers present data regarding prevalence of PMDs.</P>
<P>In the included study the health workers reported on 24 baseline variables including multiple age strata, occupation, education, income, household belongings such as television and personal habits of chewing, smoking, and drinking. The intervention and control cohorts appear to have been well matched for the stratified variable age at the baseline. However, the distribution of income, education, use of tobacco and alcohol varied across the intervention and control groups, with the former demonstrating higher levels of consumption (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Men smoked and drank alcohol more than females in both groups, but the prevalence of chewing tobacco was not as marked across gender differences. Although, such differences in baseline variables might be expected to occur in cluster randomised studies, the differences between the numbers who used tobacco and alcohol need to be borne in mind when interpreting the results.</P>

Of those diagnosed with suspicious growths, 84.9% (n = 163) were confirmed as squamous cell carcinoma and 1.6% (n = 3) as verrucous carcinoma.</P>
<P>The detection rate of PMD and oral cancer in the first, second, and third and fourth rounds of screening were 28.0, 11.9, 11.6 and 3.9 per 1000 screened subjects respectively. The crude incident rate of oral cancer was 31.2 per 100,000 person-years in the screening group and 27.2 per 100,000 person-years in the control group, with a risk ratio of 1.14 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.44).

<P>The incidence of oral cancer is increasing in low, middle and high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Warnakulasuriya-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnakulasuriya 2009</LINK>). Delays in diagnosis and management persist (<LINK REF="REF-Onizawa-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onizawa 2003;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-McLeod-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLeod 2005</LINK>) and are associated with a dramatic deterioration in five-year survival rates. Effective primary and secondary prevention strategies are critical in delivering the World Health Organization's (WHO) resolution that oral cancer should be an integral part of national cancer control programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Petersen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given that the majority of oral carcinomas are preceded by visible lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Scully-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scully 2009</LINK>), determining the efficacy and effectiveness of screening warrants attention, whilst balancing the potential benefits with any potential negative consequences of any programme (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1968</LINK>).</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-22 10:33:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The study reported a sensitivity of the visual examination in detecting oral cancer was 67.4%. However, the data for users of tobacco, alcohol or both demonstrated a reduction in mortality rates of 24% after four cycles (15 years), which was statistically significant. In addition, there was a statistically significant difference in the number of stage III cancers between the intervention and control arms, suggesting that the screening programme was identifying cancers at an early stage. When these results are combined with the significant stage shift and survival rate in the intervention group, it would appear that visual examination could be effective at reducing mortality rates for oral cancer when used within a targeted screening programme. However, the included study had a high risk of bias.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-11-19 11:52:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The purpose of health care is to improve both the quantity and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 2005</LINK>). The evidence from the Kerala trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sankaranarayanan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sankaranarayanan 2000</LINK>) is that visual screening can reduce the mortality rate in users of tobacco, alcohol or both and can produce a stage shift. Given that late stage disease is recognised as a major contributory factor for cancer survival (<LINK REF="REF-Onizawa-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onizawa 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McLeod-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLeod 2005</LINK>), it would appear that the screening of high-risk individuals could be warranted. However, the evidence from this study stems from a population with a high incidence of oral cavity cancer, and its applicability to other countries with lower incidence rates is unknown. In addition, the efficacy of the early management of potentially malignant disorders (PMDs) is a controversial area (<LINK REF="REF-Holmstrup-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmstrup 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holmstrup-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmstrup 2009</LINK>). Holmstrup argues that even if early lesions are surgically removed, the risk of malignant change can remain as a result of "field change" i.e. the lesion represents only a small area of a wider field of damaged mucosa (<LINK REF="REF-Holmstrup-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmstrup 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holmstrup-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmstrup 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trial used non-medical university graduates, trained specifically to perform visual inspection of the oral mucosa, with the help of a flashlight. The screening was undertaken in individuals own home, with the health workers going 'door-to-door'. The ability to translate this screening model to other settings is unclear. However, the Kerala study does demonstrate the potential of allied health professionals to screen for oral cancer and PMDs. This is becoming increasingly relevant as more regulators allow patients to directly access allied providers of dental care (oral health practitioners), in addition to the dentist.</P>
<P>The cost-effectiveness of the Kerala study was reported after three cycles (nine years) (<LINK REF="REF-Subramanian-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subramanian 2009</LINK>), demonstrating that 1437.64 life-years could be saved per 100,000 high-risk individuals, with an incremental cost per life-year saved of USD 156. According to the authors, this fulfils the target set by the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, who define an intervention as being cost-effective when its cost-effectiveness ratio is less than a country's gross domestic product per capita. However, these results also need to be read in context of the relative prevalence of the condition and account for the potential problem of compliance; out of the 5586 participants that were screened positive, only 59% (n = 3298) complied with referral.</P>
<P>The consideration of both the benefits and harms of screening is an essential component of any programme (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1968</LINK>) and is fundamental to the satisfactory introduction of any technology into daily practice (<LINK REF="REF-Duffy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duffy 2001</LINK>). The sensitivity reported in the Kerala study was relatively low (67%). In addition, false positives can have unintended psychological consequences, for example, increasing anxiety and exposing the patient to unnecessary further investigations. However, these could be reduced by careful patient management and by educating screened patients about the positive benefits of screening (<LINK REF="REF-Speight-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speight 1992</LINK>). Recent studies by Brocklehurst, highlighted the need to train general dental practitioners to discuss positive findings (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 2010b</LINK>) and the need for standardised criteria to avoid both under and over-referral in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 2010</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-09-17 15:46:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Kerala study had a number of methodological weaknesses that may have introduced bias. These included a lack of detail about the process of sequence generation to ensure random assignment, no analysis of the impact of clustering on the results and no detail about allocation concealment. In addition, there was no blinding of the outcome assessment and withdrawals and drop-outs were not described. More importantly, only 59% of individuals with screen-positive lesions in the intervention arm complied with referral and it was unclear whether the clinicians who saw these patients followed any standardised criteria. In addition, only 26.4%, 26.0%, and 21.4% of subjects had a biopsy in the second, third cycle or fourth cycle respectively, with no detail being provided from the first cycle. As it is not possible to diagnose early malignancy by visual appearance alone, this may have led to substantial under-reporting of oral cancer and the lack of a histological diagnosis makes it difficult to accurately assess the correct diagnosis and true prevalence of these disorders. It has been argued that the small number of randomised clusters could also produce statistical heterogeneity and the close geographical proximity of the clusters may have led to contamination (<LINK REF="REF-Kujan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kujan 2005</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>A meta-analysis of visual screening found a weighted and pooled sensitivity of 84.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 73.0 to 91.9) and specificity of 96.5% (95% CI 93.0 to 98.2) (<LINK REF="REF-Downer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downer 2004</LINK>). However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the studies pooled due to differences in the size of the target populations and it is arguable that a meta-analysis was inappropriate. A more recent review has evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of non-specialist conventional oral examination, vital rinsing, light-based detection, biomarkers and mouth self examination for the identification of individuals with suspected oral squamous cell carcinoma or PMD. Sensitivity values for studies for all tests were varied and relatively imprecise with sensitivity values ranging from 0.59 (0.39 to 0.78) to 0.99 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.00) for the conventional oral examination (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>These values of sensitivity and specificity for visual examination have not been surpassed by any other type of method, such as self examination, vital staining (toluidine blue), oral cytology or light-based techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Lingen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lingen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patton 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2013</LINK>). The review by Walsh et al showed sensitivity values ranging from 0.18 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.24) to 0.33 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.65) for mouth self examination and a sensitivity value of 0.20 (95% 0.01 to 0.72) for the addition of toluidine blue (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2013</LINK>). In Patton's systematic review, 23 studies met the inclusion criteria, yet there remained insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of adjunctive techniques to the visual examination (<LINK REF="REF-Patton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patton 2008</LINK>). In another review, Lingen found that the majority of the published studies had employed these techniques on patients who had already received a diagnosis and that they did not improve upon the sensitivity or specificity of the visual examination (<LINK REF="REF-Lingen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lingen 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>The results suggest that there is insufficient evidence to recommend a whole population screening programme for oral cancer. However, the results from the Kerala study suggest that a targeted population approach could reduce the mortality rate and produce a stage shift, but the risk of bias in the included study means that further well-designed randomised controlled trials are necessary to establish the validity of this relationship.</P>
<P>In the meantime, opportunistic visual screening by appropriately trained dentists and oral health practitioners is recommended for all patients and particularly for those who use tobacco, alcohol or both. Systematic examination of the oral cavity by front-line health workers should remain an integral part of their routine for routine recall appointments.</P>

<P>Given the high risk of bias in the study included in this review, a lack of randomised controlled studies associated with adjunctive methods (e.g. brush biopsy, fluorescence imaging) and a lack of understanding of the natural history of oral cancer, further randomised controlled trials are recommended. These should ensure the method of randomisation is accounted for in the analysis, that there is adequate allocation concealment, a standardised intervention and a clear follow-up procedure.<BR/>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Positive cases were referred to dentists and physicians to make a diagnosis, but it is unclear whether standardised criteria were used by these clinicians or whether they had received any training in identification of positive lesions.</P>
<P>It is stated that subjects with confirmed oral cancer and PMDs were biopsied and those with confirmed oral cancer were referred. However, although not detailed in the first cycle, only 26.4% of subjects with a PMD had a biopsy in the second cycle and only 26% in the third cycle. It is not clear whether all suspected oral cancer cases did receive a biopsy, but given the definition of "interval cases" in the third paper, it would appear not. In addition, it is stated in the third paper that the reference investigation for final diagnosis was clinical examination by doctors or histology or both. As it is not possible to diagnose early malignancy by visual appearance alone, this may have led to substantial under-reporting of oral cancer. The lack of a histological diagnosis for many of the PMDs also makes it difficult to accurately assess the correct diagnosis and true prevalence of these disorders.</P>
<P>Prevalence of PMD and mortality data is only provided in detail for the first two cycles only. The third paper presents the results over the three cycles from 1996 to 2004 and so does not provide individual detail about the results of the third cycle. It is not clear why this was the case.</P>
