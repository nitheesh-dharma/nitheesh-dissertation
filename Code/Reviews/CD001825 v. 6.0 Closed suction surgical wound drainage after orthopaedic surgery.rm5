<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Wound drains in orthopaedic surgery (surgery on the joints or limbs)</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Drainage systems may be used to drain fluid, mostly blood, from surgical wounds after an operation. The drains can either be open or closed. Closed drains use vacuum bottles and plastic conduits to draw fluid away from the wound by producing a negative pressure. They have been evaluated within trials for a number of elective and emergency orthopaedic operations. Closed surgical drainage systems reduce the need for reinforcement of the dressing and bruising around the wound, but increase the need for blood transfusion. Wound drains do not appear to have any effect on the occurrence of wound infections, large blood collections within the wound (haematomas), or the need for additional surgery to correct wound healing complications.</P>
<P>Closed suction wound drains in orthopaedic surgery are of doubtful benefit.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Closed suction drainage systems are frequently used to drain fluids, particularly blood, from surgical wounds. The aim of these systems is to reduce the occurrence of wound haematomas and infection.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of closed suction drainage systems for orthopaedic surgery.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (March 2006), and contacted the Cochrane Wounds Group. We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2006, Issue 1), and MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006). Articles of all languages were considered.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing the use of closed suction drainage systems with no drainage systems for all types of elective and emergency orthopaedic surgery.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality, using a nine item scale, and extracted data. Where appropriate, results of comparable studies were pooled.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty-six studies involving 5464 participants with 5697 surgical wounds were identified. The types of surgery involved were hip and knee replacement, shoulder surgery, hip fracture surgery, spinal surgery, cruciate ligament reconstruction, open meniscectomy and fracture fixation surgery. </P>
<P>Pooling of results indicated no statistically significant difference in the incidence of wound infection, haematoma, dehiscence or re-operations between those allocated to drains and the un-drained wounds. Blood transfusion was required more frequently in those who received drains. The need for reinforcement of wound dressings and the occurrence of bruising were more common in the group without drains.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to support the routine use of closed suction drainage in orthopaedic surgery. Further randomised trials with larger patient numbers are required for different operations before definite conclusions can be made for all types of orthopaedic operations.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-05 10:35:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Surgical drainage systems may be either open drains or closed suction drains. An open drain is when an artificial conduit is left in the wound to allow drainage of fluids to the exterior. Closed suction drains consist of a perforated drainage tube placed within the wound and connected to a drainage bottle. Reducing the pressure within the drainage bottle encourages drainage of fluid from the wound. This review applies purely to closed suction drainage of surgical wounds in orthopaedic surgery (surgery of the musculoskeletal system).</P>
<P>Drains may be used in any orthopaedic operation. Common procedures in which they are used include joint replacement surgery such as that for hip, knee or shoulder replacement, fracture fixation and spinal surgery. The aim of using drains is to reduce the formation of haematomas thereby decreasing the likelihood of prolonged drainage from the wound, delayed wound healing or infection of the wound.</P>
<P>A potential adverse effect of surgical drains is that they may become contaminated and act as a conduit for infection into the depths of the wound (<LINK REF="REF-Willett-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willett 1988</LINK>). Furthermore, on rare occasions they may be difficult to remove post-operatively and can even require additional surgery to remove if they have been inadvertently misplaced or sutured to surrounding tissues. Conversely, drains may be displaced or removed prematurely by confused patients pulling on them. Using drains may add additional cost to the procedure but may reduce the number of wound dressings needed.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine, based on the evidence from randomised controlled trials, if closed suction drainage is preferable to no drainage of the wounds for different types of orthopaedic surgery. </P>
<P>The following null hypothesis was tested: </P>
<P>There is no difference in outcome between closed suction drainage of the wound and no drainage after orthopaedic surgery. Different types of surgical operation were considered separately.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (March 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2006, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), MEDLINE Pending (March 2006), EMBASE (1988 to March 2006), CINAHL (1982 to March 2006), reference lists of articles and contacted trialists.

<B>Assessment of methodological quality</B>
</P>
<P>In this review, risk of bias is implicitly assessed in terms of methodological quality.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>The main assessment of methodology was the method of randomisation. A further eight aspects of methodology were used (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Though the scores of the individual items were summed, this was to gain an overall impression rather than for quantitative purposes. Where necessary and practical, we contacted trialists for additional data and clarification.</P>
<P>
<B>Data collection</B>
<BR/>Data for the outcomes listed above were independently extracted by two of the authors and each trial assessed independently without masking of the study names for its quality of methodology. Differences were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>
<B>Data synthesis</B>
<BR/>For each study, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for continuous outcomes. Where appropriate, results of comparable groups of trials were pooled using both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models. Heterogeneity between comparable trials was investigated by visual inspection of the forest plot and tested using a standard chi-squared test with additional consideration of the I-squared statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The results for the random-effects model are presented when there is significant heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.10; I-squared = 50% or more) in the results of individual trials.</P>
<P>Many of the studies included in this review had a unit of analysis problem. This arose due to two situations. In the first situation, all the participants in a study had bilateral surgery and the side to get the drain was decided randomly. Hence, those studies had a paired design. In the second situation some of the participants had more than one wound. Participants were randomly assigned to the drain or no-drain group and outcomes were measured for all wounds on that individual. Hence, those studies had a cluster randomised design. We planned to perform a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect on the results of taking into account the cluster randomised design of some studies and the paired design of others.</P>

This is a grading of wound erythema (redness), exudates, isolation of bacteria and need for further treatment. A higher score represented impaired wound healing. Wounds were assessed at two, five and eight days after surgery. Mean scores for the drained versus un-drained group were 1.02 versus 1.26 at day two, 1.05 versus 1.13 at day five and 1.33 versus 2.05 at day eight. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant at day 8 (P = 0.018 t-test). </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The methodology of the studies identified and included in the analysis varied considerably. Some trials scored poorly for the methodology assessment, although in some of these cases the low score may reflect a poor reporting of trial methods rather than poor trial methodology. In addition, because few studies used a blinded assessment of outcome, there may be biases in the reporting of subjective outcome measures. In addition the follow-up period for a number of the studies was short, often involving only the time the patient was in hospital and this may have resulted in under-reporting of outcomes. </P>
<P>Because of the variety of surgical procedures performed, the characteristics of the participants included in the different studies varied considerably, from adolescent patients having major spinal surgery, to young, predominantly male patients undergoing cruciate ligament reconstruction and meniscectomy, to arthritic patients having hip and knee replacements and the very elderly, mainly female patients undergoing surgery for a hip fracture. Because of this, data for all the individual surgical procedures has been presented separately, with less reliance placed on the summated data for all the surgical procedures. However despite this difference in surgical procedures, there was homogeneity between results for many of the reported outcomes, particularly the important outcomes of wound infection, haematoma and re-operations.</P>
<P>There was a unit of analysis problem for some of the studies included in this review. Six of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-DV-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez DV 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paessler-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Paessler 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ravikumar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ravikumar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sasso-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sasso 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walmsley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Walmsley 2005</LINK>) had individual patients with more than one surgical wound (cluster randomised study) while two of the studies, <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1998b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1998a</LINK> were a paired design with the side to get the drain decided at random. These study designs could be accommodated in RevMan using the inverse variance method if the relevant information was available from the individual studies. However, the statistical analyses reported for the individual studies did not take into account the non-independence of data from the same individual and hence we did not have the necessary information from the studies to use the inverse variance method. As an alternative, we performed sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of the study designs on the results from the meta-analysis. For the cluster randomised studies, if the average cluster size is close to one, we would expect that there would be very little impact on the meta-analysis if we took the study design into account. The average cluster size for five of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-DV-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez DV 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Paessler-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Paessler 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ravikumar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ravikumar 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sasso-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sasso 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Walmsley-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Walmsley 2005</LINK>) is close to 1. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken for these studies and even when we took the worst case scenario (intra class correlation coefficient = 1.0), this had little impact on the results that are currently presented. The average cluster size for <LINK REF="STD-Lang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 1998</LINK> was a little larger (= 1.4) so this could potentially have more impact on the results. However, <LINK REF="STD-Lang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 1998</LINK> was not combined with any other studies in the sub-group analysis. The reader should be aware that the 95% confidence intervals from Lang's study reported in this review are narrower than the 95% confidence intervals would be if the clustering had been accounted for. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess the impact of the paired study design on the outcome of the meta-analysis. The review authors used the maximum possible correlation for a particular study given the observed data and the results from that meta-analysis were compared to those from a meta-analysis assuming zero correlation (i.e. a parallel group analysis). Taking into account the pairing of the studies did not change the reviewers' conclusions.</P>
<P>The primary outcome measures for an investigation of drains should be the incidence of wound infections. The results of this analysis indicate no statistically significant difference for either the wound infection rate or the incidence of deep wound infection. Care should be taken before making definite conclusions for these outcomes, as the overall numbers of wound infections was small. Furthermore there may be an under-reporting of many of these events - the follow-up for some of the studies was short and inadequate to assess the true prevalence of wound healing complications. Because the occurrence of wound infection is low, a large sample size is required with numbers in excess of 2000 participants within each group before it is possible to make any conclusions on the presence of absence of benefit for wound drains on the occurrence of wound infections. </P>
<P>There was a possible trend to more wound haematomas in the undrained group as shown in Analysis 01.03. However this outcome is easily influenced by the method of assessment of this outcome. Most of the haematomas were reported in the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Tjeenk-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tjeenk 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 1998</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Lang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 1998</LINK> reported most of the haematomas occurred in the un-drained group but only two patients, both in the drained group had haematomas considered large enough to require surgery to evacuate. Wound dehiscence (Analysis 01.04), which may occur as a consequence of a haematoma showed no difference in frequency between groups.</P>
<P>An outcome in favour for the use of drains was the reduction in the amount of blood leaking through the wound as demonstrated by the lower number of times the dressing needed to be reinforced in the drained group. This may cause some inconvenience, require additional nursing care and provoke some distress for the patient. In addition there was a reported reduction in persistent discharge from the wound for the drained cases for TKR. Erythema and bruising of the wound were also reduced for the drained wounds, although these outcomes were only reported in limited studies and these findings did not seem to have any significant detrimental effect for the patient. </P>
<P>No difference between drains and un-drained wounds were found for the outcome of re-operation for wound healing complications (Analysis 01.10). The overall number of operations was small, 28 in total, and the type of operations when specified were either for treatment of wound infection, drainage of haematoma or removal of a trapped drain (four reported cases). </P>
<P>Blood transfusion requirements tended to be lower for those patients in the un-drained group and this may be a consequence of there being no loss of blood into the drain. This was a consistent finding for both hip and knee replacement surgery. There were insufficient studies or reporting of data to make any firm conclusions for other types of surgery. Pooling of the results in the Analyses indicated that the use of surgical drains increased the numbers of patients who required transfusion from 31% to 40% for THR and from 31% to 50% for TKR (Analysis 01.11). Statistical analysis for the outcomes of mean volume of blood transfused could only be done to a limited extent because of the failure to report on standard deviations for this outcome, but again showed increased blood transfusion for the drained wounds. The outcomes of change in haemoglobin or haematocrit were less useful and may be influenced by the extent to which the patient was transfused.</P>
<P>There were no definite differences or trends demonstrated between the drained and un-drained groups for the outcomes of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, mortality, swelling of the limb, range of movement, pain, function and hospital stay. However, due to the variable reporting and small number of reported cases for some of these outcomes, significant differences between trial groups cannot be definitely excluded. Cost analysis for the use of drains was not adequately reported and only mentioned in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Holt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Holt 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1998a</LINK>). </P>
<P>This review did not compare the use of re-infusion drains, in which the blood drained into the suction bottles is re-infused back into the patient. Theoretically this type of drainage system may reduce the fall in haemoglobin or the need for blood transfusion after surgery. The search strategy for this review found a number of studies which compared a re-infusion drain with a standard closed suction drain. Review of these studies was felt to be outside the scope of this review. Future studies may compare a re-infusion drain with no drain and such studies will be considered for inclusion in this review.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Based on the randomised trials undertaken to date, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of closed suction drainage in orthopaedic surgery. The use of drains was associated with a more frequent need for transfusion. Wound drains do not appear to have any effect on the incidence of wound infections or haematomas, but bruising of the wound and the need for reinforcement of dressings is less for drained wounds.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further randomised trials of surgical drains in orthopaedic surgery are appropriate, particularly for surgical procedures that have not been adequately studied such as fracture surgery and spinal surgery. Such studies should have a larger number of patients, appropriate trial methodology, longer follow-up and full reporting of outcomes. Until these studies are completed, the routine use of a closed suction drainage system in orthopaedic surgery will remain open to question.</P>

The text of the article stated that allocation to the drainage and cast immobilisation group was 'random', but later in the text it stated that patients could not be allocated to each group at random. The patients were operated on by a number of surgeons, some of which did not use all the four methods of treatment. The study was excluded, as the method of allocation to the different groups was not considered to be a random method. In addition, open meniscectomy is an operation that is now performed less frequently since the introduction of arthroscopy of the knee.

<P>(1) Was there clear concealment of allocation? <BR/>Score 3 (and code A) if allocation clearly concealed (e.g. numbered sealed opaque envelopes drawn consecutively). <BR/>Score 2 (and code B) if there was a possible chance of disclosure before allocation. <BR/>Score 1 (and code B) if the method of allocation concealment or randomisation was not stated or was unclear. Score 0 (and code C) if allocation concealment was clearly not concealed such as those using quasi-randomisation (e.g. even or odd date of birth).<BR/>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>(3) Were the outcomes of patients who withdrew or were excluded after allocation described and included in an intention to treat analysis? <BR/>Score 1 if yes or text states that no withdrawals occurred or data are presented clearly showing 'participant flow' which allows this to be inferred. Otherwise score 0.</P>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>(4) Were the treatment and control groups adequately described at entry and, if so, were the groups well matched for co-morbidity, or appropriate co-variate adjustment made? <BR/>Score 1 if at least four admission details given (e.g. age, sex, mobility, function score, mental test score) with either no important difference between groups or appropriate adjustment made. Otherwise score 0.</P>
