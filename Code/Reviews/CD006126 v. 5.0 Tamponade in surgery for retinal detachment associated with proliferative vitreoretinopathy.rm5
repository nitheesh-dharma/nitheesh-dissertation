<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the effect of tamponade agents used in surgery involving pars plana vitrectomy in participants with retinal detachment (RD) associated with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>The retina is the light-sensing tissue in the back of the eye (similar to the film within a camera), and its normal function depends on its attachment to an underlying layer called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). RD, a physical separation of the retina from the RPE, remains an important cause of visual loss. The macula is the centermost part of the retina and is responsible for central vision and perception of fine details. RD may or may not involve the macula, but patients with macular detachment typically have more severe visual loss than patients without macular detachment. RD is generally treated with surgery, but surgery is not always successful. In some patients surgery is initially successful but RD may recur months or years later. Most recurrent RDs, and some primary RDs, are associated with varying degrees of PVR, or the growth of fibrous membranes (similar to scar tissue) along the surface of the retina. The only proven therapy for RD with PVR is further surgery; where the membranes must be physically removed from the surface of the retina. In addition, injection of a material to hold the newly attached retina in position, called a tamponade agent, is performed to reduce the rate of fluid flow through open retinal tears, which would cause recurrent RD. The major tamponade agents that are available today are various gases and silicone oils.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 516 participants that compared tamponade agents. All participants underwent surgery to treat RD associated with PVR. The Silicone Study compared the use of silicone oil to either sulfur hexafluoride (SF<SUB>6</SUB>) gas or perfluropropane (C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB>) gas in two RCTs. Both gases and silicone oil are less dense than water, so that they float upwards or towards the top of the eye while a patient is sitting or standing. This is sometimes but not always beneficial, so a denser-than-water silicone oil called heavy silicone oil has been investigated, primarily outside the US. The Heavy Silicone Oil Study compared the use of heavy silicone oil to standard silicone oil in participants with RD involving the lower parts of the retina. The evidence was current to June 2013.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>When silicone oil was compared to SF<SUB>6</SUB> gas, eyes randomized to receive silicone oil more often achieved a visual acuity of 5/200 or better at one year, and more often achieved macular attachment at one year but with no difference at two years. When silicone oil was compared with C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB> gas, there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to visual acuity or macular attachment at one year. When heavy silicone oil was compared to standard silicone oil, there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to retinal re-attachment or visual acuity at one year. Heavy silicone oil did not demonstrate any significant benefit over standard silicone oil. Adverse events were only reported for the Heavy Silicone Oil Study; however, only the total number of adverse events was reported, and the numbers for each group were not specified: of the 94 participants, there were four deaths, 26 recurrent RDs, 22 patients with glaucoma, four patients with cataract, and two patients with capsular fibrosis (scarring behind a lens implant).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The overall quality of these studies was moderately satisfactory. Although all trials employed proper randomization methods for participants, the masking of participants was unclear in all of the three RCTs, and masking of outcome assessors was not performed in two RCTs.</P>

<P>Retinal detachment (RD) with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) often requires surgery to restore normal anatomy and to stabilize or improve vision. PVR usually occurs in association with recurrent RD (that is, after initial retinal re-attachment surgery) but occasionally may be associated with primary RD. Either way, a tamponade agent (gas or silicone oil) is needed during surgery to reduce the rate of postoperative recurrent RD.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-05 07:14:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The review included 516 participants from three RCTs. One study was conducted in the USA and consisted of two trials: the first trial randomized 151 adults to receive either silicone oil or sulfur hexafluoride (SF<SUB>6</SUB>) gas tamponades; and the second trial randomized 271 adults to receive either silicone oil or perfluropropane (C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB>) gas tamponades. The third trial was a multi-center international trial and randomized 94 participants (age range not specified) to receive heavy silicone oil (a mixture of perfluorohexyloctane (F<SUB>6</SUB>H<SUB>8</SUB>) and silicone oil) versus standard silicone oil (either 1000 centistokes or 5000 centistokes, per the surgeon's preference).</P>
<P>In participants with RD associated with PVR, outcomes after pars plana vitrectomy and infusion of either silicone oil, perfluropropane gas, or sulfur hexafluoride gas appeared comparable for a broad variety of cases. There were no significant differences between silicone oil and perfluoropropane gas in terms of the proportion of participants achieving at least 5/200 visual acuity (risk ratio (RR) 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.31) or achieving macular attachment (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15) at a minimum of one year. Although sulfur hexafluoride gas was reported to be associated with significantly worse anatomic and visual outcomes than was silicone oil at one year (quantitative data not reported), there were no significant differences between silicone oil and sulfur hexafluoride gas in terms of achieving at least 5/200 visual acuity at two years (RR 1.57; 95% CI 0.93 to 2.66). For macular attachment, participants treated with silicone oil received significantly more favourable outcomes than did participants who received sulfur hexafluoride at both one year (quantitative data not reported) and two years (RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.86). The first two trials did not perform any sample size calculation or power detection. In the third trial, which had a power of 80% to detect differences, heavy silicone oil was not shown to be superior to standard silicone oil. There were no significant differences between standard silicone oil and heavy silicone oil in the change in visual acuity at one year using adjusted mean logMAR visual acuity (mean difference -0.03 logMAR; 95% CI -0.35 to 0.29). Adverse events were not reported for the first two trials. For the third trial, only the total number of adverse events was reported, and adverse events for each group were not specified. Of the 94 participants, four died, 26 had recurrent retinal detachment, 22 developed glaucoma, four developed a cataract, and two had capsular fibrosis.</P>
<P>All three trials employed adequate methods for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. None of the trials employed masking of participants and surgeons, and only the third trial masked outcome assessors. The first trial had a large portion of participants excluded from the final analyses, while the other two trials were at low risk of attrition bias. All trials appear to be free of reporting bias. The first two trials were funded by the National Eye Institute, and the third trial was funded by the German Research Foundation.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-01-06 21:30:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of either perfluropropane or standard silicone oil appears reasonable for most patients with RD associated with PVR. Because there do not appear to be any major differences in outcomes between the two agents, the choice of a tamponade agent should be individualized for each patient. Heavy silicone oil, which is not available for routine clinical use in the USA, has not demonstrated evidence of superiority over standard silicone oil.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Retinal detachment (RD) remains a significant cause of vision loss. A variety of surgical techniques are available to treat RD. For primary RD, these procedures have a very high rate of successful anatomic retinal reattachment (overall above 90%) (<LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 2004</LINK>). The Scleral Buckling versus Primary Vitrectomy in Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment (SPR) study, which excluded many relatively straightforward cases, reported single operation success rates between 60% to 80%, depending on the subgroup, and 73% overall (<LINK REF="REF-Heimann-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heimann 2007</LINK>). Most recurrent RDs, and some primary RDs, are associated with varying degrees of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), or the growth of fibrous membranes (similar to scar tissue) along the surface of the retina, which leads to traction on the retina (<LINK REF="REF-TRSTC-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">TRSTC 1983</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Recurrent RD with PVR occurs in about 5% to 10% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Charteris-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charteris 2002</LINK>). Major risk factors for recurrent RD with PVR include RD in the inferior (lower) portion of the eye (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 1986</LINK>), severe ocular trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Kruger-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruger 2002</LINK>), and giant retinal tears (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2002</LINK>). Other reported risk factors for recurrent RD with PVR include the inability to identify a retinal break, the use of pars plana vitrectomy in the initial repair, preoperative PVR, preoperative choroidal detachment, and a relatively greater use of cryopexy (<LINK REF="REF-Cowley-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cowley 1989</LINK>). Recurrent RD with PVR may require multiple additional surgeries and is associated with poorer visual outcomes. These additional surgeries are associated with significantly increased costs (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2004</LINK>). Some patients with primary RD may also present with PVR; risk factors include large or giant retinal tears, longstanding RD, and other factors (<LINK REF="REF-Garweq-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garweq 2013</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>PVR is usually diagnosed within the first few months after RD surgery. Symptoms include decreased vision in the affected eye. The diagnosis is made by dilated fundus examination in the office or outpatient clinic.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-02-05 07:18:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vitreoretinal surgery is standard treatment for RD with PVR. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), removal of the epiretinal membranes; treatment of the retinal breaks; and injection of a tamponade agent are performed. In some cases, removal of the lens (either the crystalline lens or a previously placed intraocular lens) is performed. Tamponade is necessary to reduce the rate of fluid flow through open retinal tears, which would cause recurrent RD. The major tamponade agents available today are various gases and silicone oils. Currently available gases include air, sulfur hexafluoride (SF<SUB>6</SUB>), hexafluroethane (C<SUB>2</SUB>F<SUB>6</SUB>), and perfluropropane (C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB>). The major advantage of gas tamponade is that the gas spontaneously dissipates, usually over several weeks. Currently available silicone oils come in 1000 centistoke and 5000 centistoke viscosities. Silicone oil is permanent and may eventually require surgical removal.</P>
<P>There are several investigational tamponade agents, including polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 1000 (<LINK REF="REF-Tognetto-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tognetto 2005</LINK>), perfluorohexylethan (O62) (<LINK REF="REF-Hoerauf-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoerauf 2005</LINK>), perfluoro-n-octane (PFO) (<LINK REF="REF-Rofail-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rofail 2005</LINK>), a mixture of perfluorohexyloctane (F<SUB>6</SUB>H<SUB>8</SUB>) in silicone oil (<LINK REF="REF-Stappler-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stappler 2008</LINK>), and a mixture of perfluorohexyloctane (F<SUB>6</SUB>H<SUB>8</SUB>) in PDMS 1000 (<LINK REF="REF-Heimann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heimann 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tognetto-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tognetto 2008</LINK>). Various tamponade agents with a specific gravity greater than that of water have shown evidence of toxicity in animal models, in rat retinal cell cultures in vitro, and in clinical reports (<LINK REF="REF-Eckardt-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eckardt 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matteucci-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matteucci 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2001</LINK>). These investigational agents are not available for routine clinical use in the USA.</P>
<P>Tamponade agents are useful in four broad categories of patients with RD.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Patients with primary RD, treated with PPV as a first-line procedure. These patients are usually treated with gas tamponade rather than silicone oil.</LI>
<LI>Patients with complex or recurrent RD associated with PVR. These patients are the focus of this review. These patients are typically treated with either gas or silicone oil.</LI>
<LI>Patients with RD associated with a giant retinal tear. These patients are treated with either gas or silicone oil.</LI>
<LI>Patients with inferior RD, treated with PPV as a first-line procedure. Some surgeons use heavy liquids, such as PFO or heavy silicone oil, as investigational agents in these patients.</LI>
</OL>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-02-05 05:55:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tamponade agents are believed to work by reducing or eliminating fluid vectors through open retinal breaks until the applied retinopexy (typically photocoagulation or cryopexy) creates a permanent seal. Gases such as SF<SUB>6</SUB> and C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB> spontaneously dissipate, while silicone oil is permanent and may eventually require removal.</P>

<P>The primary outcome for this review was visual acuity at one year. We analyzed outcomes at additional times of follow-up as reported in the included trials. We intended to compare visual acuity as a dichotomous outcome (the proportion of participants who lost three or more lines of logMAR visual acuity; participants who lost one or two lines of logMAR visual acuity were considered stabilized) and also as a continuous outcome (mean logMAR scores). We considered other dichotomous and continuous visual acuity outcomes at other time points as reported in the included trials.</P>

<P>We identified two studies that met our inclusion criteria. One study consisted of two trials conducted in the USA. Enrollment for the first trial comparing silicone oil to SF<SUB>6</SUB> gas occurred from September 1985 to September 1987 (<LINK REF="STD-Silicone-Study-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Silicone Study 1992a</LINK>). For the second part of the study period, SF<SUB>6</SUB> gas was replaced with the longer-lasting C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB> gas. Enrollment for the second trial comparing silicone oil to C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB> occurred between September 1987 to October 1990 (<LINK REF="STD-Silicone-Study-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Silicone Study 1992b</LINK>). Participants aged 18 years or older and with RD associated with PVR were offered randomization. One eye per patient was randomized and grouped as eyes that had not undergone prior vitrectomy (Group 1) or eyes that had undergone vitrectomy but without silicone oil injection (Group 2). The first trial included 113 eyes in Group 1 and 38 eyes in Group 2; the second trial included 132 eyes in Group 1 and 139 eyes in Group 2. The exclusion criteria were uncontrolled concomitant eye disease, a history of blunt trauma within three months of entry into the study, a history of penetrating trauma, a giant retinal tear of 90 ° or greater, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and any medical condition that could preclude participation in a three year study.</P>
<P>The other study, the Heavy Silicone Oil Study (<LINK REF="STD-HSO-Study" TYPE="STUDY">HSO Study</LINK>), compared vitrectomy with heavy silicone oil (a mixture of perfluorohexyloctane (F<SUB>6</SUB>H<SUB>8</SUB>) and silicone oil) versus standard silicone oil (either 1000 centistokes or 5000 centistokes, per the surgeon's preference) and was performed between December 2003 and February 2008. The HSO Study was a multi-center study conducted in Germany, Austria, Sweden, Great Britain, China, Poland, Portugal, the Netherlands, Italy, Hungary, and USA. Ninety-four participants with RD associated with inferior and posterior PVR or inferior RD with inferior giant retinal tear were randomized into the two intervention groups, with 46 participants in the heavy silicone oil group and 48 in the standard silicone oil group. The exclusion criteria included: RD associated with superior anterior PVR; superior giant retinal tear; retinotomies, holes or tears between 10 and 2 o&#8217;clock; diabetic retinopathy requiring treatment; glaucoma resulting in visual field defects requiring treatment; no written informed consent; age below 18 years; participation in another clinical trial; or pregnancy.</P>

Since the two trials of the Silicone Study were part of the same study protocol, they follow the same design, methods, and analyses (Azen 1991 in <LINK REF="STD-Silicone-Study-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Silicone Study 1992a</LINK>). Both the Silicone Study and HSO Study were of good methodological quality and at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) except that whether the participants were masked was not reported explicitly in any of these trials and the Silicone Study did not mask all outcome assessors.</P>

<EXCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-02-05 06:43:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>For the Silicone Study, the last observation carried forward method was used for missing data. Data were imputed for participants who missed intermediate examinations, but attended prior and subsequent examinations, only when findings were deemed consistent. In the event that a retinal detachment recurred during the study period and required surgery, participants were analysed using the original random treatment allocation. Randomized participants from a study centre that ceased recruitment during the study period were excluded from the analysis (12 out of 151 participants from <LINK REF="STD-Silicone-Study-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Silicone Study 1992a</LINK> and six out of 271 participants from <LINK REF="STD-Silicone-Study-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Silicone Study 1992b</LINK>). However, the first trial (<LINK REF="STD-Silicone-Study-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Silicone Study 1992a</LINK>) also excluded 38 participants that had previous vitrectomy from the final analyses, therefore, almost a third of participants in this study did not contribute to any outcome data (51 participants out of 151), so we assessed the risk of bias as high.</P>
<P>For the HSO Study (<LINK REF="STD-HSO-Study" TYPE="STUDY">HSO Study</LINK>), participants who did not satisfy the major inclusion criteria but were already randomized (performed preoperatively) were all included in the full analysis set; three participants in the heavy silicone oil group and five participants in the standard silicone group fulfilled intraoperative exclusion criteria. One participant was excluded from analysis due to a lack of pre- and post-surgical assessment and data (only randomization sheet present).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Silicone oil versus gas tamponades</HEADING>
<P>The Silicone Study conducted two trials, one comparing silicone oil (1000 centistokes) with SF<SUB>6</SUB> and one comparing silicone oil (1000 centistokes) with C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB>. Below we have described results for each outcome we pre-specified in the methods section of this review. For the first trial comparing silicone oil (1000 centistokes) with SF<SUB>6</SUB>, the study investigators performed statistical analyses only on non-vitrectomized eyes (group 1) because the sample size of eyes that had already undergone vitrectomy (group 2) was small (38 participants).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Visual acuity</HEADING>
<P>We intended to compare visual acuity as a dichotomous outcome (the proportion of participants who lost three or more lines of logMAR visual acuity; participants who lost one or two lines of logMAR visual acuity were considered stabilized) and also as a continuous outcome (mean logMAR scores); however, no studies reported the proportion of participants who lost three or more lines of visual acuity, instead, participants achieving 5/200 or better visual acuity were reported for both groups. The cut-off point of 5/200 was chosen because 5/200 is considered 'ambulatory vision' (enough vision not to bump into large objects while walking) and is used in some clinical trials with severe diseases and generally bad outcomes. The Silicone Study recorded visual acuity using the Diabetic Retinopathy Vitrectomy Study protocol and charts.</P>
<P>Two trials including 352 eyes of 352 participants contributed to this outcome at 24 months (87 eyes in <LINK REF="STD-Silicone-Study-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Silicone Study 1992a</LINK>) or at the last follow-up evaluation (265 eyes in <LINK REF="STD-Silicone-Study-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Silicone Study 1992b</LINK>). When silicone oil was compared with SF<SUB>6</SUB>, the study investigators reported that eyes that had not undergone prior vitrectomy (Group 1) and were randomized to receive silicone oil more often achieved a visual acuity of 5/200 or better at one year (P &lt; 0.05; visual acuity data not reported), but there was no statistically significant difference between the groups at two years (RR 1.57; 95% CI 0.93 to 2.66) (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>When silicone oil (1000 centistokes) was compared with C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB>, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with respect to visual acuity of 5/200 or better at a minimum of one year (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.31) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>

When silicone oil was compared with SF<SUB>6</SUB>, the study investigators reported that eyes that had not undergone prior vitrectomy (Group 1) and were randomized to receive silicone oil were 37% more likely to achieve macular attachment at both one year (P &lt; 0.05; data not reported) and two years (RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.86) (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>When silicone oil (1000 centistokes) was compared with C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB>, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with respect to macular attachment at a minimum of one year follow-up (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15) (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). However, the proportions of eyes with postoperative macular attachment were higher in eyes randomized to C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB> versus silicone oil at each time point, and this difference was of borderline statistical significance at 36 months (83% versus 60%; P = 0.045; standard deviation or 95% CI not provided).</P>

<P>SF<SUB>6</SUB>, C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB>, and silicone oil can worsen cataracts. However, it was unlikely that cataract progression played a major role in the visual outcomes because most eyes were pseudophakic or aphakic at one year. In the silicone oil versus SF<SUB>6</SUB> study, about 40% of the eyes were phakic at baseline, and the lens was subsequently removed in 69% of the eyes in the silicone oil group and 90% in the SF<SUB>6</SUB> group for the non-vitrectomized eyes (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.09) (<LINK REF="STD-Silicone-Study-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Silicone Study 1992a</LINK>). In the silicone oil versus C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB> study, 48% of eyes were phakic at baseline, and the lens was subsequently removed in 91% of these eyes in the silicone oil group and 86% in the C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8 </SUB>gas group for the non-vitrectomized eyes (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26), and in 93% of the eyes in the silicone oil group and 100% in the C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB> group (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.95) (<LINK REF="STD-Silicone-Study-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Silicone Study 1992b</LINK>).</P>

<P>We intended to compare visual acuity as a dichotomous outcome (the proportion of participants who lost three or more lines of logMAR visual acuity; participants who lost one or two lines of logMAR visual acuity were considered stabilized) and also as a continuous outcome (mean logMAR scores); however, change in visual acuity as a dichotomous outcome was not reported, instead the investigators reported mean change in visual acuity and rates of recurrent RD. A total of 93 eyes of 93 participants contributed to this outcome at one year. The adjusted mean logMAR visual acuity was 1.24 (standard error (SE) 0.116) in the standard silicone oil group and 1.27 (SE 0.117) in the heavy silicone oil group. Non-inferiority of heavy silicone oil compared to standard silicone oil could not be demonstrated with respect to change in visual acuity at 12 months (mean difference -0.03; 95% CI -0.35 to 0.29) (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-05 07:33:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The Silicone Study comprised two well-designed prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trials of participants with RD associated with PVR. The first trial, comparing silicone oil to SF<SUB>6</SUB>, was conducted between 1985 and 1987. The second trial, comparing silicone oil to C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB>, was conducted between 1987 and 1990. Pars plana vitrectomy and infusion of either silicone oil or C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB> gas appeared to show comparable results for final visual acuities of 5/200 or better at one year and macular attachments at one year. SF<SUB>6</SUB> gas was associated with worse anatomic and visual outcomes than silicone oil, although some of these differences diminished after two years.</P>
<P>The HSO Study was a well-designed prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial of participants with RD associated with PVR. The trial compared standard silicone oil (either 1000 centistokes or 5000 centistokes, per the surgeon's preference) with heavy silicone oil (a mixture of perfluorohexyloctane (F<SUB>6</SUB>H<SUB>8</SUB>) and silicone oil), which is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is not available outside a clinical trial. Despite the many theoretical benefits of a heavier-than-water tamponade agent in treating participants with inferior vitreoretinal pathology, no important advantages were reported in this study.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-02-05 07:36:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>In the intervening two decades since the Silicone Study began, there have been many advances in vitrectomy instrumentation, intraoperative viewing systems, and surgical techniques. The silicone oil used in the Silicone Study was not approved by the US FDA and differed in many respects from the higher quality, more purified oils used today.</P>
<P>In addition, although SF<SUB>6</SUB> and C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB> are still used today, many surgeons now prefer 5000 centistoke silicone oil to the 1000 centistoke oil used in the Silicone Study, although anatomic and visual outcomes are similar with either oil viscosity (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Perfluoro-n-octane (PFO) became available in 1988 as an intraoperative tool to achieve retinal re-attachment. PFO was not available for any of the participants enrolled in the first trial of the Silicone Study (oil versus SF<SUB>6</SUB>), which completed enrollment in 1987. PFO was available for some, but not all, participants enrolled in the second trial (oil versus C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB>). In addition, the investigational use of PFO and other heavy liquids as intermediate-term tamponade agents was not described until more recently.</P>
<P>The Silicone Study also excluded participants with a history of penetrating trauma, giant retinal tears greater than 90 °, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Similarly, the HSO Study excluded participants with active diabetic retinopathy, visually significant glaucoma, pregnancy, and participants under 18 years of age. For these reasons, the results reported in these trials may not be applicable to many participants undergoing contemporary surgical procedures.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-02-05 07:39:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall quality of the evidence is moderately satisfactory. All three trials employed proper methodology for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. None of the trials clearly stated whether the study participants were masked, so we assessed performance bias as unclear for all three trials. The HSO Study (<LINK REF="STD-HSO-Study" TYPE="STUDY">HSO Study</LINK>) performed masking of outcome assessors while the Silicone Study (<LINK REF="STD-Silicone-Study-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Silicone Study 1992a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silicone-Study-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Silicone Study 1992b</LINK>) did not, so we assessed two trials from the Silicone Study as at high risk of detection bias, and the trial from HSO Study as at low risk. Two out of the three trials had less than 10% of participants lost to follow-up (low risk of attrition bias for <LINK REF="STD-Silicone-Study-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Silicone Study 1992b</LINK> from the Silicone Study, and the <LINK REF="STD-HSO-Study" TYPE="STUDY">HSO Study</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Silicone-Study-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Silicone Study 1992a</LINK> had almost a third of participants lost to follow-up (50/151 were excluded from analyses), so we assessed it as at high risk of attrition bias. We assessed the Silicone Study as at low risk of reporting bias and the HSO Study at high risk because it pre-specified measurement of a quality of life outcome but no data were reported.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-02-05 07:39:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although conducting a highly sensitive search for studies, we identified only three trials relevant to this review topic. These trials compared different tamponade agents, used different statistical methods, and reported outcomes at different time points. Due to the heterogeneity among the trials, comparing the treatment effects in meta-analysis was not possible. Rather, we presented the results of the individual studies, which carry their own potential biases as discussed in other sections of this review. If adequately designed randomized controlled trials are published in the future with standardized outcomes, then additional data could improve the overall evidence in this review.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-02-05 07:43:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-02-05 07:42:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on results from the Silicone Study, participants with RD associated with PVR had good results with PPV with either C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB> gas or silicone oil tamponades. There is a suggestion that C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB> may have certain advantages with respect to long-term anatomic outcomes in some participants, although the visual results appear similar between the tamponade agents. The choice of tamponade agent is usually made on an individual, patient-by-patient basis. Factors to be considered include the configuration of the detachment, the location of the retinal breaks, the lens status, the visual status of the fellow eye, the patient's ability to comply with postoperative positioning requirements, the patient's need to travel by air in the early postoperative period, and individual physician and patient preferences.</P>
<P>As tamponade agents, C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB> and silicone oil appear to have visual and anatomic advantages over SF<SUB>6</SUB>, especially within the first year after surgery, but SF<SUB>6</SUB> may be a reasonable choice in certain clinical situations.</P>
<P>Based on the results of the HSO Study, the heavy silicone oil mixture used in this trial (a mixture of perfluorohexyloctane (F<SUB>6</SUB>H<SUB>8</SUB>) and silicone oil) does not offer any additional benefits relative to standard silicone oil (either 1000 centistokes or 5000 centistokes, per the surgeon's preference) in participants with complex or recurrent RD associated with PVR.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-02-05 07:43:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Silicone Study delineated various relative advantages and disadvantages of 1000 centistoke silicone oil, SF<SUB>6</SUB>, and C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>8</SUB> as tamponade agents. Formal evaluation of 5000 centistoke silicone oil in a prospective clinical trial appears warranted, but to our knowledge there are no plans for such a trial at this time. Future research may develop alternative tamponade agents, particularly with a density greater than water, which would reduce the postoperative positioning requirements for many patients. Properties of an ideal tamponade agent include optical clarity, lack of toxicity, no effect on the eye's refractive state, no effect on IOP or cataract formation, inhibition of cellular migration, and inhibition of gliosis or glial proliferation.</P>

<P>"participants were examined postoperatively within the one week of surgery, preremoval, 2 months after removal surgery, and one year after initial surgery"</P>
<P>"Attachment of the retina is assessed blindly by the endpoint committee, who compare the preoperative fundus documentation with that taken 12 months after initial surgery. Fundus photos are taken according to the nine field regimen introduced by Irvine et al. (1988) and Azen et al. (1998); fundus drawings are in accordance with Meyer-Schwickerath &amp; Wessing (1975). Visual acuity is the main subjective criterion for assessing the function of an eye, reflecting the patient&#8217;s point of view that the improvement of VA is the most important parameter of a successful operation. The endpoint is defined as a change of VA 12 months after initial surgery compared with the preoperative measurement using letter- by-letter scoring on ETDRS charts."</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>&#8220;None of the randomized patients was excluded by the end-point committee. As patients who did not satisfy the major inclusion criteria were in all cases already randomized (performed preoperatively), all of them are therefore part of the full analysis set. One patient (&#8216;8701001&#8217;) was excluded due to a lack of pre- and postsurgical assessment and data (only randomization sheet present). Three patients in the HSO group and five patients in the standard silicone group fulfilled intraoperative exclusion criteria.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Concerning the evaluation of the anatomical success, in 20 cases the 12-month visit was substituted by the delayed 12-month visit. In cases where a 12-month visit was not available, the anatomical success was assessed as treatment failures. This is applied to 18 cases in the HSO group and 16 in the standard group.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;For the analysis of VA, in cases of no valid 12-month visit, the last available observation was used (last observation carried forward) for 18 patients in the HSO group and 15 patients in the standard group.&#8221;</P>
