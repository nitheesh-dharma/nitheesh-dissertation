<P>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common virus causing disease and death in solid organ transplant recipients (kidney, heart, liver, lung and pancreas) during the first six months after transplantation. This review looked at the benefits and harms of IgG, anti CMV vaccines and interferon to prevent CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients. Thirty seven studies (2185 participants) were identified. This review shows that IgG did not reduce the risk of CMV disease or all-cause mortality compared with placebo or no treatment.

However IgG significantly reduced the risk of death from CMV disease (6 studies, 346 patients: RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80). There was no difference in the risk for CMV disease (4 studies, 298 patients: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.86), CMV infection (4 studies, 298 patients: RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.52) or all-cause mortality (2 studies, 217 patients: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.29) between antiviral medication combined with IgG and antiviral medication alone.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-13 13:20:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common virus causing disease and death in solid organ transplant recipients during the first six months post-transplant with an overall incidence of 30% to 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Fishman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 2000</LINK>). Like all herpes viruses, CMV has the propensity to establish lifelong 'latency' infection in the host after the initial infection has resolved. Therefore, solid organ transplant recipients may be infected either by exogenous virus or by reactivation of latent virus if they were CMV positive pre-transplant. Those at highest risk of symptomatic CMV disease are CMV sero-negative patients who receive organs from CMV sero-positive donors, and CMV sero-positive patients on heavily immunosuppressive regimens (<LINK REF="REF-Fishman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>CMV may manifest as a non-specific illness characterised by fever, mononucleosis, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia, or as a variety of clinical syndromes including pneumonitis, hepatitis, encephalitis and focal gastrointestinal disease. In addition, CMV causes morbidity in organ recipients through indirect effects on their immune response (<LINK REF="REF-Rubin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 1989</LINK>), and is associated with increased risk of allograft injury and rejection (<LINK REF="REF-Grattan-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grattan 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keenan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keenan 1991</LINK>), opportunistic infections (<LINK REF="REF-Fishman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hadley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Berg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Berg 1996</LINK>) and late onset malignancies such as EBV-lymphoproliferative disease (<LINK REF="REF-Basgoz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basgoz 1995</LINK>). For these reasons, many strategies have been proposed to prevent CMV infection and/or prevent systematic CMV disease. Two main strategies to prevent CMV disease have been adopted; prophylaxis of all organ recipients with antiviral medications and/or immunoglobulins (IgG), or 'pre-emptive therapy' or 'targeted therapy' for high-risk groups such as patients receiving antilymphocyte antibody preparations (<LINK REF="REF-Rubin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 1989</LINK>). Pre-emptive therapy relies upon monitoring for CMV infection by newly available sensitive techniques such as antigenaemia or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that allow the diagnosis of CMV infection to be made much earlier than traditional culture methods (<LINK REF="REF-Emery-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emery 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review of prophylactic treatment using antiviral medications (aciclovir, ganciclovir, valaciclovir, valganciclovir) versus placebo/no treatment has demonstrated the efficacy of prophylactic therapy to prevent CMV disease (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2005b</LINK>). In addition, a second review evaluating pre-emptive therapy at detection of CMV viraemia has demonstrated its efficacy compared with placebo/no treatment on the prevention of CMV disease (<LINK REF="REF-Strippoli-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strippoli 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strippoli-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strippoli 2006b</LINK>). In this review we examined the benefits and harms of prophylaxis using IgG including hyperimmune CMV IgG, vaccines, interferon compared with placebo/ no specific therapy or other agents in recipients of solid organ transplant on CMV disease, all CMV infection, the incidence of acute rejection, graft loss, opportunistic infections and death. Data on the use of vaccines and interferon in prophylaxis is included in this review for historical interest. However although valganciclovir has largely replaced other therapies for prevention or pre-emptive therapy of CMV disease, some transplant centres continue to use hyperimmune CMV IgG in combination with antiviral medications in solid organ transplant recipients. Previous reviews of IgG therapy, published in 1994 (<LINK REF="REF-Glowacki-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glowacki 1994</LINK>) and 1996 (<LINK REF="REF-Wittes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wittes 1996</LINK>), included 12 randomised controlled trials (RCT) using IgG or CMV IgG and of four RCTs using CMV IgG respectively. Both concluded that IgG prophylaxis was more effective than placebo or no specific treatment in preventing CMV disease. In addition we needed to determine whether the addition of CMV IgG to antiviral therapy was more effective than antiviral therapy alone. A previous review published in 1999 included four RCTs and concluded that there was no convincing evidence for an additional benefit of CMV IgG (<LINK REF="REF-King-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1999</LINK>). Additional RCTs have now been published necessitating an update of these reviews.<BR/>
</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of IgG, anti-CMV vaccines or interferon for preventing symptomatic CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients of all ages, irrespective of CMV sero-status prior to transplantation. The secondary aims were to evaluate the efficacy of these agents in preventing all CMV infection (symptomatic and asymptomatic where CMV is detected only by laboratory investigation) and in decreasing the incidence of acute rejection, graft loss, death (all-cause mortality and mortality due to CMV disease), opportunistic infections and to evaluate the harms of each antiviral medication. </P>
<P>Firstly, the review examined studies of IgG alone with placebo/no treatment. Secondly, it explored comparisons between IgG and other antiviral medications including aciclovir and ganciclovir, IgG and antiviral medications with IgG alone and IgG and antiviral medications with antiviral medications alone. Thirdly, it compared the treatment effect of each regimen between different solid organs and between the different risk groups (i.e. pre-existent CMV sero-status and/or level of immunosuppression). Finally it examined the benefits and harms of anti-CMV vaccine or interferon in comparison with placebo.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-05-13 12:24:11 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The primary outcome measures were the incidence of symptomatic CMV disease and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of all CMV infection (symptomatic and asymptomatic), acute rejection, graft loss, death, opportunistic infections, harms (including nephrotoxicity, bone marrow suppression). No data could be obtained on time to CMV disease or emergence of resistant CMV strains. All outcomes were recorded as present/absent.</P>
<P>CMV infection was defined as reported by the investigators of included studies. This was usually the isolation of CMV from a cultured specimen from any site, or positive histopathology or CMV antigen detection in a tissue specimen, or the presence of CMV pp65 antigenaemia, or an elevation in CMV viral load as detected by quantitative PCR (as defined by the investigator). 'Symptomatic CMV disease' was defined by the investigator. This was usually the diagnosis of CMV infection in association with one or more of the following: CMV syndrome (temperature of 38<SUP>o</SUP>C or more with no other documented source in association with one or more of atypical lymphocytosis, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia), pneumonitis, focal gastrointestinal disease, liver function abnormality, or encephalitis. Graft loss was defined as the need for dialysis or further kidney transplantation or re-transplantation for other organs during the follow-up period of the study. Acute rejection was defined as used by the individual authors. This was either biopsy proven or clinical, defined by rise in creatinine levels with respect to kidney transplants or response to rejection treatment.</P>

To determine whether there were any differences between study results due to plausible effect modifiers, subgroup analysis were performed, whenever sufficient number of studies were available for analysis.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">CMV disease and CMV infection in all patients</HEADING>
<P>The results for CMV disease and CMV infection did not differ between studies comparing CMV IgG and placebo/no treatment and IgG and placebo/no treatment so studies have been combined. Overall there was no significant difference in the risk for CMV disease (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> (16 studies, 770 patients): RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.05) or in the risk for CMV infection (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> (14 studies, 775 patients): RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.10). For the outcome of CMV disease, the point estimate favoured the use of IgG in nine studies (CMV IgG (6), IgG(3)) while the point estimate favoured the use of placebo/no treatment in seven studies (CMV IgG (5), IgG(2)). There was some heterogeneity among results of this analysis for CMV disease (I = 23.6%) and CMV infection (I = 24.2%). For CMV disease, the heterogeneity of 34.4% among studies comparing CMV IgG with placebo/no treatment could be eliminated by excluding studies which reported larger numbers of patients with CMV disease in the CMV IgG group compared with placebo/no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Greger-85b_x002d_Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Greger 85b-Kidney</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kruger-03_x002d_Lung" TYPE="STUDY">Kruger 03-Lung</LINK>). It is not clear why these studies contributed to the heterogeneity. One study involved lung transplant recipients (immunosuppressed with antilymphocyte preparations and cyclosporin), who are known to be at a high risk of CMV pneumonitis (<LINK REF="STD-Kruger-03_x002d_Lung" TYPE="STUDY">Kruger 03-Lung</LINK>) while in the other study all patients were receiving antilymphocyte globulin, which increases the risk for CMV disease (<LINK REF="STD-Greger-85b_x002d_Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Greger 85b-Kidney</LINK>). However other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Grundmann-87_x002d_Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Grundmann 87-Kidney</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kasiske-89_x002d_Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Kasiske 89-Kidney</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snydman-93_x002d_Liver" TYPE="STUDY">Snydman 93-Liver</LINK>), in which immunosuppression included antilymphocyte preparations and cyclosporin, found a reduced number of patients with CMV disease during IgG treatment.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-13 13:21:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Thirty seven studies were identified and included in this systematic review. Seventeen studies compared CMV IgG or IgG with placebo or no specific therapy, four studies compared different types of IgG, nine studies compared various combinations of IgG and antiviral medications and seven studies examined vaccines or interferon. Overall study quality was poor particularly in the 30 studies involving IgG with only three studies reporting adequate allocation concealment, four blinding of investigators and participants, six blinding of outcome assessors and six an intention-to-treat analysis. Inadequate study quality can result in overestimation of benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Schultz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 1995</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Hyperimmune CMV IgG and IgG have been widely used as prophylaxis against CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients following the publications of two large studies, which demonstrated a benefit of CMV IgG in reducing CMV disease in kidney (<LINK REF="STD-Snydman-87_x002d_Kidney" TYPE="STUDY">Snydman 87-Kidney</LINK>) and liver transplants (<LINK REF="STD-Snydman-93_x002d_Liver" TYPE="STUDY">Snydman 93-Liver</LINK>). This systematic review identified 17 studies which compared hyperimmune CMV IgG or IgG with placebo or no specific treatment in 793 of the 893 enrolled patients. Although the amount of anti-CMV antibody present in IgG preparations can be expected to vary and be less than the amount in CMV IgG preparations, no difference between the efficacy of IgG and CMV IgG could be detected so studies were combined. Overall no benefit of IgG as prophylaxis to prevent CMV disease or CMV infection could be demonstrated. However a small but clinically important benefit of IgG against CMV disease cannot be completely excluded as the summary RR of 0.80 favoured IgG though the 95% CI (0.61 to 1.05) just crossed the line of no effect. In addition, for the outcome of CMV disease, there was heterogeneity among studies with point estimates favouring IgG in nine studies and favouring placebo in seven. The heterogeneity could be related to differences in immunosuppression used, the higher risk of CMV disease in lung transplant recipients as well as to differences in study quality and design including definitions of CMV infection and disease and duration of follow-up. The significant reduction in death from CMV disease raises the possibility that CMV IgG reduced the severity of CMV disease. However only 8/17 studies (492 patients) provided data on all-cause mortality and only 4/17 (279 patients) of these contributed data to the meta-analysis. In addition only 6/17 studies provided data on death from CMV disease and only 4/17 (283 patients) contributed data to the meta-analysis. Three of these 4 studies (244 patients) provided data on deaths due to both CMV disease and other causes. Thus the apparent positive effect of IgG on death from CMV disease may have resulted from outcome reporting bias. There was no significant benefit of IgG on acute rejection, graft loss or opportunistic infections overall. Opportunistic infections appeared to be less frequent in CMV IgG treated patients but there was significant heterogeneity between studies. Adverse effects appeared uncommon and limited to mild reactions which did not require discontinuation of IgG. However adverse effects were not reported in 12 studies comparing IgG with placebo or no specific treatment or comparing two IgG preparations.<BR/>
<BR/>Only four studies (392 patients) have examined the relative efficacies of antiviral medications (aciclovir, ganciclovir) and IgG and the meta-analysis demonstrated a benefit of antiviral medications. However the meta-analysis is dominated by a single large study (<LINK REF="STD-Dunn-94_x002d_all_x002f_ACV" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 94-all/ACV</LINK>) in which IgG was only administered for one week rather than the more usual period of three months. When this study is excluded, the meta-analysis of the remaining three studies showed no significant difference in the risk of CMV disease. However studies in this meta-analysis only enrolled 126 patients so the small numbers of patients and events resulted in wide confidence intervals indicating imprecision in the results. Thus further studies would be required to determine the relative efficacy of IgG and antiviral medications. However such studies are unlikely to be carried out since the use of IgG has now been largely replaced by antiviral medications based on efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2005b</LINK>) with reduced CMV disease, CMV infection, all-cause mortality and opportunistic infections as well as cost and ease of administration.<BR/>
<BR/>There are few data on the relative efficacies of IgG and antiviral medications and antiviral medications given alone in preventing CMV disease. Only four studies (298 patients) have addressed this question. No significant differences in the risk of CMV disease, CMV infection or all-cause mortality were demonstrated suggesting that there is no benefit of administering IgG together with an antiviral medication. However the small patient numbers resulted in wide 95% CIs indicating substantial imprecision for estimates of the effect size for all outcomes. For example for the outcome of CMV disease, the wide 95% CI (0.74 to 1.86) make it plausible that the combination of an antiviral medication and IgG could reduce the risk of CMV disease by 25% or almost double the risk compared with an antiviral medication alone. In addition existing studies have provided few data on the value of combination therapy in high risk patients such as CMV negative recipients of CMV positive organs (<LINK REF="REF-Fishman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 2000</LINK>) and patients on antilymphocyte preparations (<LINK REF="REF-Fishman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubin 2000</LINK>). There are extensive data from studies comparing the antiviral medications (aciclovir, ganciclovir and valaciclovir) with placebo/no treatment to show that prophylaxis with these antiviral medications reduces the risk for CMV disease by 60% (19 studies, 1981 patients: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.52) and all-cause mortality by 40% (17 studies, 1838 patients: RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.92) (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2005b</LINK>). Based on the data available it is unlikely that IgG and antiviral medications together will significantly improve the efficacy of prophylaxis compared with antiviral medications alone. In addition IgG is expensive and is a blood product, which has to be given intravenously over an extended period.</P>
<P>A single small study (<LINK REF="STD-King-97_x002d_Liver_x002f_GCV" TYPE="STUDY">King 97-Liver/GCV</LINK>) compared IgG and ganciclovir with IgG alone and found no significant difference in CMV disease or all-cause mortality. Since ganciclovir was only administered for four weeks, it is possible that the short duration of administration of the antiviral medication compared with 16 weeks of IgG could have influenced the results.</P>
<P>Adverse effects in studies comparing antiviral agents and IgG were generally seen in the antiviral medication treatment group but were only reported in 4/9 studies.</P>
<P>In the 1980s anti-CMV vaccines were developed and tested in well designed RCTs. However no benefit could be demonstrated in the reduction of CMV disease though fewer patients developed severe CMV disease and adverse effects were significantly more common in vaccine treated patients. Similarly interferon was tested in RCTs; no benefit was demonstrated and adverse effects were slightly but not significantly more common in interferon treated patients.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-05-14 08:41:05 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<UL>
<LI>Hyperimmune CMV IgG or IgG do not significantly reduce the risk for CMV disease, CMV infection and all-cause mortality compared with placebo/no treatment.</LI>
<LI>There is no evidence for increased efficacy to prevent CMV disease using a combination of IgG and antiviral medications compared with antiviral medications alone.</LI>
<LI>Currently there is no indication for CMV IgG or IgG in the prophylaxis of CMV disease in recipients of solid organ transplants in view of the demonstrated efficacy of antiviral medications (valganciclovir, ganciclovir, aciclovir, valaciclovir) on reducing CMV disease, CMV infection, all-cause and CMV related mortality and opportunistic infections (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2005b</LINK>).</LI>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-14 08:40:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<UL>
<LI>Since antiviral medications are very effective in reducing CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients and the addition of IgG is unlikely to improve efficacy, it is unlikely that large studies will be carried out to test the relative efficacies of valganciclovir (the most commonly used antiviral medication) alone and in combination with IgG. Such a study is only likely to be considered if failure of prophylaxis with a single antiviral medication becomes a major clinical problem.</LI>
