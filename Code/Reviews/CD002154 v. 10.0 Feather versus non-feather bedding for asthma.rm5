<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>An allergen is the substance that causes an allergic reaction in someone who is hypersensitive to it. A major allergen for asthma is the house dust mite. It is thought that artificial (man-made) fibre fillings for pillows and bedding are less likely to gather allergens than feather-filled pillows and quilts. However, there is some evidence that in fact, feather bedding may in fact be less likely to cause asthma. The review found no trials comparing feathers with man-made fibres, and research is needed to be certain which is better for people with asthma.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-18 16:05:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-18 16:05:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is estimated that there are over 150 million people world-wide have asthma (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1995</LINK>) and there is an accumulating body of evidence from epidemiological surveys suggesting that it is becoming more common (<LINK REF="REF-ONS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ONS 1998</LINK>). The rising trend in asthma prevalence and its heavy costs in terms of morbidity, mortality, and upon health services provide a sound rationale for interventions aimed at its primary prevention and reduction in severity of symptoms.</P>
<P>The allergic nature of asthma has led to the pursuance of measures designed to reduce exposure to prevailing inhaled allergens. It has long been recognised that the faecal pellets of house dust mites are the principal source of allergen in house dust and their role in asthma provocation has been further implicated in studies which demonstrated an improvement in mite sensitive children in dust mite free environments. The evidence from this and other work has led some to argue that allergen avoidance should be regarded as a first line anti-inflammatory treatment for asthma. </P>
<P>The highest degrees of infestation have been reported in domestic beds and on upholstered furniture, so mite sensitive subjects are recommended to take measures that will reduce the levels of dust mite allergen. Such measures have included the use of synthetic pillows, duvets, eiderdowns and mattresses in preference for natural fillings such as feather and kapok. This topic has been the subject of another Cochrane Airways Group Review which found no evidence that currently used methods of house dust mite reduction have benefit in asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Gotzsche-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotzsche 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The assumption that non-feather bedding is preferable for asthmatics has been challenged by the findings of epidemiological studies (<LINK REF="STD-Butland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Butland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strachan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Strachan 1997</LINK>). These studies sought to explore changes in the home environment and its relationship with the rising prevalence of childhood wheeze. They found that children using non-feather pillows were more likely to be suffering from more frequent episodes of wheeze than those using feather pillows. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The purpose of this systematic review was to search for and evaluate the evidence for the use of feather or non-feather bedding and establish whether these are effective in relieving and preventing asthma symptoms, ascertaining how significant the benefit may be which type of patient would benefit.<BR/> </P>

<P>From the first literature search, 126 abstract were identified from the database and 10 were selected for possible inclusion in the review. One abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Hallam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hallam 1998</LINK>) was identified from the references in the retrieved papers.</P>
<P>None of the studies were eligible for inclusion in this review and were excluded for the following reasons:<BR/>1. not randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Crane-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Crane 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hallam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hallam 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kemp-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kemp 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rains-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rains 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Strachan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Strachan 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Strachan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Strachan 1997</LINK>)<BR/>2. allocation of a specific bedding type was combined with other dust mite reduction strategies thus preventing analysis of bedding type distinct from the effects of other interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Burr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Burr 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Butland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Butland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gillies-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gillies 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Korsgaard-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Korsgaard 1983</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The suggestion that the use of synthetic pillows is associated with more severe asthma arose from the findings of epidemiological surveys (<LINK REF="STD-Strachan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Strachan 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Butland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Butland 1997</LINK>). These studies suggested that even when analysis was adjusted to account for allergic asthmatics choosing synthetic pillows as a means of allergen avoidance, the risk of severe wheezing was two or three times higher than for those using feather pillows.</P>
<P>Prompted by these findings, further research has also served to raise doubts about the benefit of synthetic bedding for asthmatics. Synthetic pillows appear to accumulate dust mite allergen more rapidly than feather pillows (<LINK REF="STD-Rains-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rains 1999</LINK>). Synthetic pillows have also been found to contain significantly higher levels of mite allergen than feather pillows (<LINK REF="STD-Kemp-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kemp 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hallam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hallam 1998</LINK>). One explanation for this difference is that feathers are contained within more tightly woven fabrics than synthetic fillings. The close weave may therefore act as a barrier to dust mites and their allergens. </P>
<P>The possibility that the higher levels of dust mite allergen found in synthetic pillows might lead to more severe symptoms of asthma is supported by findings from <LINK REF="STD-Hallam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hallam 1998</LINK>. They demonstrated a positive correlation between levels of mite allergen in bed and the clinical activity and severity of asthma in mite-sensitive patients. </P>
<P>The findings outlined above challenge the long held view that asthmatics would be better using a synthetic pillow, but specific recommendations can only be made following appropriate randomised controlled trials.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Whilst recent epidemiological studies suggest that feather bedding is associated with less frequent wheeze than man-made fibre filling, the currently available evidence is insufficient to assess the clinical benefits of feather bedding in the management of asthma.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The current association seen between feather and synthetic bedding and asthma severity requires further investigation and validation. Firstly the mechanisms behind the possible differences in dust mite allergen accumulation in feather and non feather bedding should be the subject of further study. Once the causes behind these differences is established and understood the potential clinical benefit can be ascertained and measured in a randomised controlled trial. As a preventive measure the use of feather bedding offers an acceptable and inexpensive strategy and as such justifies further exploration.</P>
