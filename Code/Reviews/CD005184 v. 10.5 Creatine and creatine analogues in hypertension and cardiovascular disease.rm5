<P>Creatine kinase is an enzyme that regenerates cellular ATP, which is used for energy demanding processes. This review evaluated existing therapeutic strategies that target the creatine kinase system in cardiovascular disease. The available trials indicate an improvement in abnormal heart rhythm and shortness of breath in heart disease. The effect on death and the size of myocardial infarction and the heart function were unclear. Given the small sample size of the discussed trials and the heterogeneity of the population included in these reports, larger clinical studies are needed to confirm these observations.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-08-09 18:47:00 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>Full reports or abstracts from 1164 papers were reviewed, yielding 11 trials considering treatment with creatine or creatine analogues in 1474 patients with heart failure, ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction. No trial in patients with hypertension was identified. Eleven trials (1474 patients, 35 years or older) comparing add-on therapy of the creatine-based drug on standard treatment to placebo control in patients with heart failure (6 trials in 1226 / 1474 patients ), or acute myocardial infarction (4 trials in 220 / 1474 patients) or 1 in ischemic heart disease (28 / 1474 patients) were identified. The drugs used were either creatine, creatine phosphate (orally, intravenously, or intramuscular) or phosphocreatinine. In the trials considering heart failure all three different compounds were studied; creatine orally (<A HREF="Gordon 1995">Gordon 1995</A>, <A HREF="Kuethe 2006">Kuethe 2006</A>), creatine phosphate via intravenous infusion (<A HREF="Ferraro 1996">Ferraro 1996</A>, <A HREF="Grazioli 1992">Grazioli 1992</A>), and phosphocreatinine orally (<A HREF="Carmenini 1994">Carmenini 1994</A>, <A HREF="Maggi 1990">Maggi 1990</A>). In contrast, the acute myocardial infarction trials studied intravenous creatine phosphate only. In the ischemic heart disease trial (<A HREF="Pedone 1984">Pedone 1984</A>) creatine phosphate was given twice daily through an intramuscular injection to outpatients and through an intravenous infusion to inpatients. The duration of the study intervention was shorter for the acute patients, from a two hour intravenous infusion of creatine phosphate in acute myocardial infarction (<A HREF="Ruda 1988">Ruda 1988</A>, <A HREF="Samarenko 1987">Samarenko 1987</A>), to six months in patients with heart failure on oral phosphocreatinine therapy (<A HREF="Carmenini 1994">Carmenini 1994</A>). In the acute myocardial infarction patients the follow-up period varied from the acute treatment period (<A HREF="Ruda 1988">Ruda 1988</A>) to 28 days after start of the symptoms (<A HREF="Samarenko 1987">Samarenko 1987</A>) or end of the hospitalization period (<A HREF="Zochowski 1994">Zochowski 1994</A>). In the other trials there was no follow-up after discontinuation of treatment, except for <A HREF="Gordon 1995">Gordon 1995</A> which followed the patients until four days after stopping the intervention.</P>
<P>Only two out of four trials in patients with acute myocardial infarction reported mortality outcomes, with no significant effect of creatine or creatine analogues (RR 0.73, CI: 0.22 - 2.45). In addition, there was no significance on the progression of myocardial infarction or improvement on ejection fraction. The main effect of the interventions seems to be on improvement of dysrhythmia.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-08-09 18:48:55 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>This review found inconclusive evidence to decide on the use of creatine analogues in clinical practice. In particular, it is not clear whether there is an effect on mortality, progression of myocardial infarction and ejection fraction, while there is some evidence that dysrhythmia and dyspnoea might improve. However, it is not clear which analogue, dose, route of administration, and duration of therapy is most effective. Moreover, given the small sample size of the discussed trials and the heterogeneity of the population included in these reports, larger clinical studies are needed to confirm these observations.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-04-14 08:45:23 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The creatine kinase system, the central regulatory system of cellular energy metabolism, is central to cardiovascular function (<LINK REF="REF-Brewster-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewster 2000</LINK>). Creatine kinase regulates, buffers and transports, via creatine phosphate and creatine, ATP produced by glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, to sites of energy consumption such as myofibrils and membrane ion pumps. The enzyme substrate creatine is normally found in meat and fish, but it is also synthesized in the human body from dietary amino acids. Synthesis begins in the kidney with arginine and glycine forming guanidoacetic acid. This product is methylated in the liver, forming creatine (methylguanidine-acetic acid). Normal creatine plasma levels are 40 -100 micromoles/liter (mcM/L); levels are about 25 mcM/L in vegetarians. The total adult body pool is approximately 120-140 grams. About 95% of body stores are found in muscle; creatine is also found in the liver, kidney, sperm, brain, eyes and the nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-Wyss-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyss 2000</LINK>).<BR/>Myocytes use creatine (Cr) to make creatine phosphate (CrP) via creatine kinase. Creatine phosphate is used to convert adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP). By using hydrogen ions to make ATP, creatine kinase also buffers intracellular hydrogen ions associated with lactate production and muscle fatigue during muscle contraction. There is evidence that the creatine kinase system protects the cardiovascular system from ischaemia and increases contractility. Cardiovascular implications are that high blood pressure is proposed to occur earlier and to be more severe with greater activities of this enzyme system (<LINK REF="REF-Brewster-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewster 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brewster-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewster 2006</LINK>). On the other hand, low CK activities are associated with heart failure (<LINK REF="REF-Ingwall-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingwall 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Neubauer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neubauer 2007</LINK>). The system could therefore be a target for pharmacologic intervention in cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Field-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schaufelberger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaufelberger 1998</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-08-09 18:57:14 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>High activity of the creatine kinase energy system has been associated with a greater risk to develop high blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Brewster-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewster 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Brewster-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewster 2006</LINK>). On the other hand, too low activity might lead to heart failure and myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Ingwall-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingwall 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Neubauer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neubauer 2007</LINK>) Although there is evidence that the creatine kinase system has a crucial role in the energy homeostasis, cardiovascular contractility, and ischaemic resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Brewster-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewster 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Brewster-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewster 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ingwall-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingwall 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Neubauer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neubauer 2007</LINK>), to our knowledge, the existing evidence on drugs directly targeting this system in humans has not been systematically reviewed previously. In this review, we found no trials of drugs targeting the CK system in patients with hypertension. The existing trials considered myocardial infarction and heart failure mainly. We found little evidence of a beneficial effect of creatine and creatine analogues in the prespecified outcomes, including ejection fraction and mortality. Pooling of the data resulted in a point estimate of 0.71 for mortality without evidence of heterogeneity, but this outcome did not reach statistical significance. With no significance on the progression of myocardial infarction or improvement on ejection fraction, the main effect seems to be on improvement of dysrhythmia. Ventricular premature beats, ventricular extrasystoles and atrioventricular blocks were reported to be significantly reduced with the use of creatine phosphate or phosphocreatinine.</P>
<P>Limitations of this review are the small sample size of the discussed trials and the clinical heterogeneity in patients, duration, mode of treatment (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous), and the drugs used (creatine, creatine phosphate, and phosphocreatinine). Therefore, larger clinical studies are needed to confirm these observations. In particular, the potential effect on mortality needs further study with a larger sample size. The importance of the creatine kinase system for cardiovascular functions renders the system an interesting therapeutic target for drug intervention in cardiovascular disease.</P>

<P>There is inconclusive evidence to decide on the use of creatine analogues in clinical practice. In particular, it is not clear whether there is an effect on mortality, progression of myocardial infarction and ejection fraction. There is some evidence that dysrhythmia and dyspnoea might improve. However, it is not clear which analogue, dose, route of administration, and duration of therapy is most effective.</P>

<P>the total number of ventricular premature beats (VPBs) during the Holter monitoring period (24 hours) was 690 ± 179 in the CrP group compared to 2468 ± 737 in the control group (p &lt; 0.02); this was a result of a reduction in the number of complex forms of VPBs, the total number of single VPBs did not differ significantly between the two groups</P>
<P>during the CrP infusion period the total number of VPBs (18 ± 6 intervention vs 111 ± 41 controls), single VPBs (15 ± 5 vs 85 ± 33) , and paired VPBs (1.0 ± 0.4 vs. 9 ± 3) were significantly reduced compared to control (p &lt; 0.05)</P>
<P>during the monitoring period a significant reduction in the number of ventricular tachycardia paroxysms (VT) was found in favour of the CrP group (6 ± 2 vs 97 ± 35, p &lt; 0.01). During the infusion period the mean number of VTs in the CrP group was 0.3 ± 0.1 vs 2 ± 1 (p &lt; 0.05)</P>

<P>
<B>Handsearching</B>: six new eligible trials, not found in any database with systematic searching. This was either because the clinial trial was absent from the database (EMBASE and Cochrane), or the "clinical trial" identifier was missing (MEDLINE). However, none of these papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review.</P>
<P>A total of 12 trials were included, please see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>. The literature search was updated until January 2011 (Appendices 1-4). No additional eligible trials were found.</P>
