<P>February 2005: "Perioperative increase in global blood flow to explicit defined goals and outcomes following surgery" was withdrawn from The Cochrane Library in issue 2, 2005 on the advice of the Cochrane Funders Arbiter. This was because the authors received funding from a commercial source (Elan Pharma) for the preparation of this review. This contravenes the current Cochrane policy on sponsorship.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-03 04:17:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Death and serious complications commonly occur following major surgery and are a significant public health problem. These outcomes might be prevented by using fluids and drugs to maintain the supply of oxygen and other nutrients to vital organs. Global blood flow, adjusted to maintain specific targets, might serve as a proxy in determining whether administered fluid and drugs maintain critical nutrient supply. In this Cochrane review of 31 studies conducted in 5292 patients undergoing major surgery, the use of fluids, with or without additional drugs, to achieve defined targets associated with increased total blood flow did not reduce mortality. There was a reduction in the number of patients with complications and the length of time patients stayed in hospital (by 1.2 days). However, the quality of the studies in this area was mediocre.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-10-03 03:53:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2012) and EMBASE (1982 to March 2012). We manually searched the proceedings of major conferences and personal reference databases up to December 2011. We contacted experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies for published and unpublished data.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-10-03 03:56:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials with or without blinding. We included studies involving adult patients (aged 16 years or older) undergoing surgery (patients having a procedure in an operating room). The intervention met the following criteria. 'Perioperative' was defined as starting up to 24 hours before surgery and stopping up to six hours after surgery. 'Targeted to increase global blood flow' was defined by explicit measured goals that were greater than in controls, specifically one or more of cardiac index, oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, stroke volume (and the respective derived indices), mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO<SUB>2</SUB>), oxygen extraction ratio (0<SUB>2</SUB>ER) or lactate.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-10 18:57:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 31 studies of 5292 participants. There was no difference in mortality: 282/2615 (10.8%) died in the control group and 238/2677 (8.9%) in the treatment group, RR of 0.89 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.05, P = 0.18). However, the results were sensitive to analytical methods and the intervention was better than control when inverse variance or Mantel&#8211;Haenszel random-effects models were used, RR of 0.72 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.95, P = 0.02). The results were also sensitive to withdrawal of studies with methodological limitations. The rates of three morbidities were reduced by increasing global blood flow: renal failure, RR of 0.71 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.90); respiratory failure, RR of 0.51 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.93); and wound infections, RR of 0.65 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.84). There were no differences in the rates of nine other morbidities: arrhythmia, pneumonia, sepsis, abdominal infection, urinary tract infection, myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure or pulmonary oedema, or venous thrombosis. The number of patients with complications was reduced by the intervention, RR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.80). Hospital length of stay was reduced in the treatment group by a mean of 1.16 days (95% CI 0.43 to 1.89, P = 0.002). There was no difference in critical care length of stay. There were insufficient data to comment on quality of life and cost effectiveness.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-10-11 08:53:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It remains uncertain whether increasing blood flow using fluids, with or without inotropes or vasoactive drugs, reduces mortality in adults undergoing surgery. The primary analysis in this review (mortality at longest follow-up) showed no difference between the intervention and control, but this result was sensitive to the method of analysis, the withdrawal of studies with methodological limitations, and is dominated by a single large RCT. Overall, for every 100 patients in whom blood flow is increased perioperatively to defined goals, one can expect 13 in 100 patients (from 40/100 to 27/100) to avoid a complication, 2/100 to avoid renal impairment (from 8/100 to 6/100), 5/100 to avoid respiratory failure (from 10/100 to 5/100), and 4/100 to avoid postoperative wound infection (from 10/100 to 6/100). On average, patients receiving the intervention stay in hospital one day less. It is unlikely that the intervention causes harm. The balance of current evidence does not support widespread implementation of this approach to reduce mortality but does suggest that complications and duration of hospital stay are reduced.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-10-11 08:53:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-10-03 04:20:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has been known for many years that patients undergoing surgery are more likely to have serious complications or die if they have limited physiological reserve (<LINK REF="REF-Boyd-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyd 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clowes-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clowes 1960</LINK>). Post hoc analysis of patients undergoing major surgery revealed that survivors had a higher cardiac index and lower systemic vascular resistance than those who died (<LINK REF="REF-Shoemaker-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shoemaker 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shoemaker-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shoemaker 1973</LINK>). Commonly monitored vital signs (heart rate, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, temperature, haemoglobin concentration) were found to be poor predictors of mortality when compared with the flow related variables cardiac output and total body oxygen delivery (DO<SUB>2</SUB>) (<LINK REF="REF-Shoemaker-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shoemaker 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shoemaker-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shoemaker 1993</LINK>). In particular, survivors of major surgical procedures were found to have higher values for cardiac output or DO<SUB>2</SUB>. More recent studies have shown mixed results for the impact of oxygen transport on postoperative morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Kusano-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kusano 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peerless-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peerless 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Polonen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polonen 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-10-03 04:20:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>New therapeutic options and monitoring techniques that became available in the 1970s, particularly the introduction of the pulmonary artery flow directed catheter (PAC) (<LINK REF="REF-Ganz-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ganz 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swan-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swan 1970</LINK>), opened up the possibility of measuring and then manipulating an individual's cardiovascular system. It was hypothesized that targeting goals for cardiac output and DO<SUB>2</SUB> in all patients to the values manifested by the survivors of surgery would improve outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1978</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-10-03 04:21:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An important principle of this intervention is that the perioperative manipulation to augment cardiac output and DO<SUB>2</SUB> would lead to an improved tissue perfusion and oxygenation. This physiological improvement would lead to better survival and fewer postoperative complications in patients undergoing major surgery.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-10-11 08:53:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is almost 30 years since the initial uncontrolled data were presented suggesting that perioperative manipulation of flow related cardiovascular variables might improve outcomes in higher risk surgical patients (<LINK REF="REF-Shoemaker-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shoemaker 1982</LINK>). Since then, a number of randomized trials have been undertaken in patients in the perioperative period which have investigated this issue. However, these trials differ in:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the case mix of the patients recruited (different operation severities, comorbidities and, therefore, expected mortalities);</LI>
<LI>the techniques used to measure cardiac output (pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) thermodilution, Doppler velocimetry);</LI>
<LI>the specific goals targeted (cardiac output, DO<SUB>2</SUB>, maximum stroke volume);</LI>
<LI>the techniques used to achieve the goals (fluids, fluids plus inotropes or vasoactive drugs);</LI>
<LI>the management of the control arm.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In addition, some of the studies were not blinded and many had small sample sizes leading to limited statistical power. Despite this, a number of non-systematic reviews have attempted to combine studies in order to draw general conclusions from the studies (<LINK REF="REF-Boyd-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyd 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boyd-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyd 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forst-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forst 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ivanov-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ivanov 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leibowitz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leibowitz 1997</LINK>). However, these reviews have identified varying numbers of trials and have not been undertaken systematically, using scientifically rigorous techniques for literature searching or for abstraction and analyses of data. Three previous systematic reviews have addressed this question (<LINK REF="REF-Heyland-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyland 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kern-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kern 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poeze-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poeze 2005</LINK>) and reported improved outcomes. They do not include recently published studies and did not focus exclusively on perioperative data. Among recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses, one study included patients with trauma and sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2011</LINK>) while other studies analysed renal function (<LINK REF="REF-Brienza-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brienza 2009</LINK>) and gastrointestinal complications (<LINK REF="REF-Giglio-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giglio 2009</LINK>) as primary outcomes.</P>
<P>The time is now ripe for a systematic review of the literature to address the important question: does perioperative administration of fluids, with or without vasoactive drugs, targeted to increase global blood flow in adults undergoing surgery reduce mortality, morbidity and resource utilization?</P>

We used mean differences (standard deviation) for continuous variables such as length of hospital or ICU stay. We explored the robustness of these estimates by comparing both fixed-effect and random-effects models for the primary outcome.</P>

<P>We performed sensitivity analyses of the analysis method used to generate relative risks for mortality (<LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK>). The results were dependant upon both the analytical method and whether a random-effects model or fixed-effect model was used. There was no difference in mortality when small studies (fewer than 100 participants) were excluded (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), consistent with <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>. The effect of small studies was significant in the Harbord analysis, with a regression slope of -0.72 (95% CI -0.08 to -1.39).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-03 06:55:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The key finding of this review is that the perioperative administration of fluids, with or without vasoactive drugs, targeted to increase global blood flow defined by explicit measured goals reduced postoperative complications and length of stay but did not reduce mortality, using the inverse variance method. The exclusion of larger studies (&gt; 100 participants) resulted in mortality being reduced by the intervention (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.90, P = 0.02). Mortality was also significantly reduced when we used random-effects models (Mantel-Haenszel and inverse variance, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.95, P = 0.02), but not fixed-effect models (Mantel-Haenszel RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.00, P = 0.05; inverse variance RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05, P = 0.18; or Peto odds ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.00, P = 0.05). We calculated similar results for hospital and 28 day mortality. When control group care was managed using a protocol that included explicit goals less than the intervention group (in contrast to 'usual care'), mortality was not reduced (longest follow-up inverse variance RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.12, P = 0.45; hospital or 28 day inverse variance RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.07, P = 0.14). When studies with intervention groups that were less well controlled for the intervention (for example pulmonary artery catheters were not matched to intervention groups) were excluded, there was a significant reduction in mortality at the longest follow-up (inverse variance RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.89, P = 0.007) and hospital or 28 day mortality (inverse variance RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.92, P = 0.01). It is notable that the sensitivity analyses are of limited value as they tend to reflect the inclusion or exclusion of the single largest study (<LINK REF="STD-Sandham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandham 2003</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>The limited data indicate that for every 100 patients exposed to treatment, one can expect 13 in 100 (from 40/100 to 27/100) to avoid a complication, 2/100 to avoid renal impairment (from 8/100 to 6/100), 5/100 to avoid respiratory failure (from 10/100 to 5/100), and 4/100 to avoid postoperative wound infection (from 10/100 to 6/100), with no effect on other types of morbidity (myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, congestive cardiac failure or pulmonary oedema, venous thrombosis, and the number of patients with infections). These results were unchanged following sensitivity analyses that excluded studies where the control group care was managed using a protocol that included explicit goals that were less than the intervention group (in contrast to 'usual care'). When studies using intervention groups that were less well controlled (control groups not matched to intervention groups) were excluded only the number of patients with complications was reduced, by 12/100 (from 36/100 to 24/10).</P>
<P>The hospital length of stay was reduced by about one day, from 12.4 to 11.2 days, and was not sensitive to exclusion of studies where the control group care was managed using a protocol that included explicit goals that were less than the intervention group (in contrast to 'usual care') or studies using intervention groups that were less well controlled. There was no difference in critical care stay in the intervention group. This was sensitive to exclusion of studies using intervention groups that were less well controlled and the reduction was less than a day (from 4 to 3.3 days). There were insufficient data to conduct a meta-analysis of cost and no data available describing quality of life.</P>
<P>A stratified meta-analysis to address secondary hypotheses, determined a priori, suggested that mortality was reduced in the intervention group when study participants underwent elective surgery.</P>
<P>The predefined analysis plan, using mortality from the longest available follow-up, increased the weight attributed to the two largest studies that both reported one-year follow-up. Only one other study reported follow-up beyond 60 days. In this group of studies a proportion of the operations were for cancer resection, therefore introducing a possible competing cause of mortality.</P>

The pooled studies included adults (age &gt; 16 years) undergoing several types of surgery, including abdominal, urology, gynaecology, orthopaedic, cardiac, thoracic and vascular. Therefore, the included studies represent the population for whom the intervention might be considered.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-10-03 07:05:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of outcome data reporting in the included studies was variable. Mortality was reported over a variety of time frames and other outcomes were either limited or inconsistent between studies, precluding meaningful analyses in many cases. Diverse criteria and descriptions for morbidities, along with infrequent use of validated metrics, limited the precision of treatment effect estimates and the confidence that can be attached to them. Furthermore, pooling of different types of morbidity was inconsistent, limiting assessment of the overall 'morbidity load'. </P>
<P>Most studies tested a complex package of care (for example fluids, inotropes, monitor, goals, critical care environment) rather than a single clearly-defined intervention.  Heterogeneity in the components of such a complex intervention may contribute to study heterogeneity within a systematic review. Study heterogeneity may reduce the precision of treatment effect estimates and reduce the generalizability of the results of meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Louis-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Louis 1991</LINK>). By definition, it is not easy to define precisely the 'active ingredients' of a complex intervention (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 2000</LINK>). However, hypothesis-generating subgroup analyses indicated that there were insufficient data to distinguish statistically between many of the prespecified subgroups, and highlighted the limited quantity of data in some areas for example emergency surgery.</P>
<P>Several possible sources of bias arose in this meta-analysis. The primary analysis was sensitive to the analytical methods used, the exclusion of larger studies, and the exclusion of studies that inadequately controlled for the intervention. Larger studies are less likely to be affected by bias (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>) and the inclusion of lower quality studies can alter the interpretation of the benefit of interventions in meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>).  </P>
<P>Statistical heterogeneity was generally absent (I<SUP>2</SUP> less than 40%). Except for some analyses such as hospital length of stay, there was evidence of significant statistical heterogeneity. We used random-effects models in all cases where I<SUP>2</SUP> exceeded 40%. In all analyses of mortality, the point estimate of effect was less than 0.90, suggesting that the intervention was probably not harmful.</P>
<P>The sensitivity of our results to the methods of analysis indicates that the results of this study are far from clear-cut. Further research is essential in this area both to address the overall objective of this review and to focus on specific questions.</P>
<P>The studies included in this review are typical of studies in critical care research in general in that the majority of studies are underpowered and from single centres (<LINK REF="REF-Langham-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langham 2002</LINK>) and about half the studies are small (&lt; 100 participants). Future studies in this area should test an explicitly framed hypothesis, be adequately powered, methodologically rigorously and blinded (where possible). Reporting of outcomes should be standardized (to allow comparison between studies and to facilitate the conduct of future meta-analyses) and inclusive (morbidity, health status, resource usage).<BR/>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-10-03 07:08:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The possibility of publication bias cannot be excluded. We found no evidence of this from contact with experts and industry but some of the identified published abstracts have yet to be published as full peer-reviewed papers. Harbord's regression test was significant at P = 0.03, suggesting small study effects. Language bias is possible because of the electronic databases and conferences we searched. Flaws in the original study designs are a significant potential source of bias. The meta-analysis includes 5292 participants but the unit of analysis is the study (or study subgroup) and the sample size (31 studies) is relatively small. The results of the subgroup analyses should be considered as hypothesis-generating only and are largely influenced by inclusion or exclusion of a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Sandham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandham 2003</LINK>).</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-10-11 08:53:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review represents the best up-to-date summary of the literature. We framed a tightly defined question and used explicit inclusion criteria for studies and a predefined analysis plan. Our primary result does not agree with previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Boyd-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyd 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brienza-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brienza 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Giglio-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giglio 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heyland-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyland 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ivanov-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ivanov 1997</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Kern-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kern 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poeze-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poeze 2005</LINK>), which have been uniformly supportive of this intervention. This may be explained by the precision of the question we addressed (for example other reviews included trauma patients not having surgery) and the analytical methods used. The results of our systematic review do, however, agree with the results of the largest study in this area (<LINK REF="STD-Sandham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sandham 2003</LINK>). However, it is of concern that the Sandham study dominates the review primary analysis both in terms of number of patients (1994/5292) and weight (67%), and that the Sandham study was one of the studies where the intervention group was less well controlled (control groups not matched to intervention groups).</P>
<P>Research should focus on answering these questions. Sandham et al showed that a large multicentre study can be conducted in this area and several such studies are currently ongoing, in particular a large multicentre study anticipated to recruit about 700 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Pearse-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pearse 2009</LINK>). Future research will hopefully disentangle the complex package of care that forms the intervention (for example fluids, inotropes or vasoactive agents, monitor, goals, critical care environment) and thereby identify which components are effective in different clinical contexts.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-10-03 07:12:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinicians should base their decision whether to manipulate perioperative global blood flow on the magnitude of reductions in postoperative morbidities and length of hospital stay rather than upon the assumption that mortality will be reduced. For every 100 patients exposed to the intervention one can expect 13/100 to avoid having complications (from 40 to 27 per 100); 2/100 to avoid renal impairment (from 8 to 6 per 100); 5/100 to avoid respiratory failure (from 10 to 5 per 100); and 4/100 to avoid postoperative wound infection (from 10 to 6 per 100). Patients remain in hospital about one day less and there is no increase in harm. This intervention should be considered where the relevant resources are available and implementation will not otherwise harm the patient (for example delay in definitive care).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-10-03 07:13:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A specific limitation of this review is the large number of studies that were published more than 10 years and the limited amount of data that represent current practice and outcomes. A specific group that particularly merits further study, in view of the high incidence of mortality and morbidity and limited available data, is patients undergoing emergency surgery.</P>
<P>Future studies in this area should test an explicitly framed hypothesis, be adequately powered (and preferably multicentre), methodologically rigorous, and include blinded interventions where possible. Reporting of outcomes should be standardized (to allow comparison between studies and to facilitate the conduct of future meta-analyses) and inclusive (morbidity, health status, resource usage).</P>
