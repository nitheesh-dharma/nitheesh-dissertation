<TITLE>Interventions for replacing missing teeth: different types of dental implants</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-07-14 12:02:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>To compare the effects of different dental implants. These are implanted into bone and vary primarily in their shape, material and type of surface.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Missing teeth can sometimes be replaced with dental implants into the jaw, as bone can grow around the implant. A crown, bridge or denture can then be attached to the implant. Many implant modifications have been developed trying to improve the long-term success rates of implants, and different types have been heavily marketed. More than 1300 types of dental implants are available, in different materials, shapes, sizes, lengths and with different surface characteristics or coatings.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This review of existing studies was carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group and the evidence is current up to 17 January 2014. We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing different types of dental implants in people who were followed up for at least one year.</P>
<P>We found 27 trials based in a wide range of countries - six in Italy; five in New Zealand, five in Sweden, three in the Netherlands, two in Korea, one in Turkey, one in Germany, one in Switzerland and three multicentre European trials. Most took place at university dental clinics or hospitals, four were run in private practice and, in the multicentre European trials, a few were also in private practice.</P>
<P>There were comparisons made of 38 implant types with different surface characteristics, shapes, degree of titanium (metal) purity and titanium alloys (mixtures of metal). The main outcome of the trials was failure of the implant to work.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The review found there was not enough evidence from trials to demonstrate superiority of any particular type of implant characteristic or implant system over another.</P>
<P>There was no evidence showing that any particular type of dental implant had greater long-term success. There was limited evidence showing that implants with relatively smooth surfaces were less prone to lose bone due to chronic infection (peri-implantitis) than implants with much rougher surfaces. However, the evidence suggests they may fail earlier than implants with roughened surfaces.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Two trials were at low risk of bias, 10 were at unclear risk of bias and 15 were at high risk of bias.</P>
<P>Most of the trials were underpowered, which means that there were not enough participants in the studies to be able to draw firm conclusions. Caution should be exercised when generalising the results of the included trials to ordinary clinical conditions.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-07-14 16:11:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>Dental implants are available in different materials, shapes and with different surface characteristics. In particular, numerous implant designs and surface modifications have been developed for improving clinical outcome. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2002, and previously updated in 2003, 2005 and 2007.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-07-10 16:56:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Primary: to compare the clinical effects of different root-formed osseointegrated dental implant types for replacing missing teeth for the following specific comparisons: implants with <U>different surface preparations</U>, but having similar shape and material; implants with <U>different shapes</U>, but having similar surface preparation and material; implants made of <U>different materials</U>, but having similar surface preparation and shape; <U>different implant types</U> differing in surface preparation, shape, material or a combination of these.</P>
<P>Secondary: to compare turned and roughened dental implants for occurrence of early implant failure (before prosthetic loading) and occurrence of peri-implantitis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-07-10 15:11:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 17 January 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2013, Issue 12), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 17 January 2014) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 17 January 2014). We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-07-10 15:11:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>We included any randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing osseointegrated dental implants of different materials, shapes and surface properties having a follow-up in function of at least one year. Outcome measures were success of the implants, radiographic peri-implant marginal bone levels changes and incidence of peri-implantitis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-07-10 15:12:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>At least two review authors independently conducted screening, risk of bias assessment and data extraction of eligible trials in duplicate. We expressed results using fixed-effect models (if up to three studies were present in a meta-analysis) or random-effects models (when there were more than three studies) using mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We reported the following endpoints: one, three, five and 10 years after functional loading.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-14 12:02:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>We identified 81<B> </B>different RCTs. We included 27 of these RCTs, reporting results from 1512 participants and 3230 implants in the review. We compared 38 different implant types with a follow-up ranging from one to 10 years. All implants were made of commercially pure titanium or its alloys, and had different shapes and surface preparations. We judged two trials to be at low risk of bias, 10 to be at unclear risk of bias and 15 to be at high risk of bias. On a 'per participant' rather than 'per implant' basis, we found no significant differences between various implant types for implant failures. The only observed statistically significant difference for the primary objective regarded more peri-implant bone loss at Nobel Speedy Groovy implants when compared with NobelActive implants (MD -0.59 mm; 95% CI -0.74 to -0.44, different implant shapes). The only observed statistically significant difference for the secondary objective was that implants with turned (smoother) surfaces had a 20% reduction in risk to be affected by peri-implantitis than implants with rough surfaces three years after loading (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.96). There was a tendency for implants with turned surfaces to fail early more often than implants with roughened surfaces.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-07-10 15:12:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Based on the results of the included RCTs, we found no evidence showing that any particular type of dental implant had superior long-term success. There was limited evidence showing that implants with relatively smooth (turned) surfaces were less prone to lose bone due to chronic infection (peri-implantitis) than implants with much rougher surfaces (titanium-plasma-sprayed). These findings were based on several RCTs, often at high risk of bias, with few participants and relatively short follow-up periods.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-07-10 15:56:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-07-10 15:55:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Missing teeth may result in a functional and aesthetic deficit and have traditionally been replaced with dentures or bridges. Dental implants offer an alternative; they are inserted into the jawbones and used to support dental prostheses. Dental implants rely on the maintenance of a direct structural and functional connection between living bone and the implant surface; this is termed osseointegration and was first described by Brånemark (<LINK REF="REF-Br_x00e5_nemark-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brånemark 1977</LINK>). Osseointegration has undoubtedly been one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs in dentistry over since the early 1960s.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-07-10 15:55:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Osseointegrated dental implants are available in different materials, body shapes, diameters, lengths, platforms, surface properties and coatings. In particular, the area of implant surface modifications and coatings has been subjected to aggressive marketing aimed at establishing the superiority of a given surface over the others. In implant dentistry, the word 'machined' has frequently been used as a description of a turned, milled or polished surface. However, a machined surface can be anything produced by a machine and surfaces produced with electro discharge, polish, ground, honed and sand blasting are all examples of machined surfaces (<LINK REF="REF-Stout-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stout 1990</LINK>). Numerous surface modifications including turned, blasted, acid-etched, porous-sintered, oxidised, plasma-sprayed, laser modified, hydroxyapatite-coated surfaces, highly hydrophilic or a combination of these procedures have been developed and are currently used with the aim of enhancing clinical performance. In addition, different materials are used to manufacture dental implants including: titanium with various degree of purity, titanium alloys (e.g. Ti6Al4V) and ceramics (e.g. zirconia). It has been estimated that dentists have to choose from more than 1300 types of implants that vary in form, material, dimension, surface properties and interface geometry (<LINK REF="REF-Binon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binon 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Originally, Brånemark implants had machined (turned) surfaces. Turned surfaces are those originally formed by the milling (machining) procedure of the titanium bar and are considered to be smooth surfaces. It was believed that rougher surfaces could improve the osseointegration process by allowing more bone to be in contact with the implant surface determining also an increased mechanical retention. Following this concept, many procedures were developed to roughen implant surfaces; however, one potential drawback was empirically observed: a suspected increased incidence of peri-implantitis when compared with implants with turned surfaces (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 1997</LINK>). Peri-implantitis can be defined as "a site specific, plaque-induced infection with progressive loss of the bone supporting a functioning implant" (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 1999</LINK>). This chronic infection affects at least 16% of people rehabilitated with implants having turned surfaces after nine to 14 years in function in one retrospective evaluation (<LINK REF="REF-Roos_x002d_Jans_x00e5_ker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roos-Jansåker 2006</LINK>). Turned implant surfaces are those considered to be less susceptible to peri-implantitis, and there is the potential risk that implants with roughened surfaces could be at higher risk for peri-implantitis.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-07-10 15:56:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>In addition, because of the aggressive marketing, it is unclear whether there are implant surface modifications, implant shapes or particular materials that can actually improve clinical results. If this is the case, then clinicians and patients could choose which dental implant system to use, if not, it would still be useful to know that many modifications do not substantially alter the clinical outcomes. It would be also very useful to understand to which degree the roughening of implant surfaces could be advantageous in the long term.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>At least two review authors independently scanned the titles and abstracts (when available) of all reports identified through the electronic searches. For studies appearing to meet the inclusion criteria, or for which there were insufficient data in the title and abstract to make a clear decision, we obtained the full report. At least two review authors independently assessed the full reports to establish whether they met the inclusion criteria or not. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Where resolution was not possible, we consulted a third review author. We assessed risk of bias and extracted data of all studies meeting the inclusion criteria. We recorded studies rejected at this or subsequent stages in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table, and gave reasons for exclusion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>At least two review authors independently extracted data using specially designed data extraction forms. We had piloted the data extraction forms on several papers and modified them as required before use. We resolved any disagreements by discussion and consulted a third review author where necessary. We contacted authors for clarification or missing information.</P>
<P>For each trial, we recorded the following data:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>year of publication, country of origin and source of study funding;</LI>
<LI>details of the participants including demographic characteristics, source of recruitment and criteria for inclusion;</LI>
<LI>details of the type of intervention;</LI>
<LI>details of the outcomes reported, including method of assessment, and time intervals.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently undertook the risk of bias assessment of the included trials in duplicate as part of the data extraction process. In the case that the paper to be assessed had one or more review authors in the authors list, only those review authors not involved in the trial evaluated it.</P>
<P>We used the recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). It is a two-part tool, addressing the six specific domains (namely, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of the outcome assessor, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other bias). Each domain includes one specific entry in a 'Risk of bias' table. Within each entry, the first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry. This is achieved by answering pre-specified questions about the adequacy of the study in relation to the entry.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summarising risk of bias for a study</HEADING>
<P>After taking into account the additional information provided by the authors of the trials, we grouped studies into the following categories. We assumed that the risk of bias was the same for all outcomes and each study was assessed as follows.</P>

</TR>
</TABLE>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measure of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we expressed the estimate of effect of an intervention as risk ratios (RR) together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we used mean differences (MD) and standard deviations to summarise the data for each group and express it as MD and 95% CIs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>The statistical unit was the participant and not the implant unless the clustering of the implants within the participants had been taken into account in the analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>We contacted trial authors to retrieve missing data where necessary. If we could not reach agreement, we excluded data until further clarification was available. We would have used methods for estimating missing standard deviations in Section 7.7.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>if required (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We would have assessed the significance of any discrepancies in the estimates of the treatment effects from the different trials by means of Cochran's test for heterogeneity and heterogeneity would have been considered significant if P value &lt; 0.1. We would have used the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which describes the percentage total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance, to quantify heterogeneity with an I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic over 50% being considered substantial heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>If there had been sufficient numbers of trials (more than 10) in any meta-analysis, we would have assessed publication bias according to the recommendations on testing for funnel plot asymmetry (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>), as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If we had identified asymmetry, we would have examined possible causes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We only performed a meta-analysis if there were studies of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures. We combined RRs for dichotomous data, and MDs for continuous data, using fixed-effect models. We used random-effects models when there were more than three studies in a meta-analysis. We combined data from split-mouth studies with data from parallel group trials using the method outlined by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>), using the generic inverse variance method in Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We used the techniques described by Follmann to estimate the standard error of the difference for split-mouth studies, where the appropriate data were not presented and could not be obtained (<LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>). We would have calculated numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for people affected by implant failures. We followed the recommendations of the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> <I>for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> for RCTs with parallel design with zero-cell counts (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We added the fixed value of 0.5 to all cells with zero-cell counts and calculated RRs using Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). If there were no events in both arms, we undertook no calculations, because in this situation the study does not provide any indication of the direction or magnitude of the relative treatment effect. We presented data that could not be meta-analysed in an additional table.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We would have assessed clinical heterogeneity by examining the types of participants and interventions for all outcomes in each study. We planned the following subgroup analyses only for trials included to answer the primary hypothesis; however, we found insufficient studies in the meta-analysis to undertake this.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Whether implants were placed in mandibles or maxillae.</LI>
<LI>Whether implants were placed in partially or fully edentulous jaws.</LI>
<LI>Different number of placed implants (for instance overdentures supported by two versus overdentures supported by four implants).</LI>
<LI>Whether the implants were immediately placed in tooth extraction sockets or not.</LI>
<LI>Whether the implants were placed in anterior or posterior areas of the jaw.</LI>
<LI>Whether the implants were placed in augmented (grafted or regenerated) bone or not.</LI>
<LI>Whether the implants were placed with a submerged or non-submerged technique.</LI>
<LI>Whether the implants were loaded at different times: immediate loading (up to one week) and conventional loading (three months or more for mandibles and six months or more for maxillae).</LI>
<LI>Different prosthetic designs (for instance overdentures versus screw-retained dentures or implant-supported bridges versus bridges supported by both implants and teeth).</LI>
<LI>Whether the trial was supported by implant manufacturer(s) or not.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>We planned to undertake sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of the risk of bias on the overall estimates of effect. In addition, we planned to examine the effect of including unpublished literature on the review's findings. However, we found too few trials in the meta-analyses to undertake these analyses to investigate to what extent the risk of bias might have influenced the results. We will do this in future updates as soon as a sufficient number of trials having different risk of bias are available.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Presentation of main results</HEADING>
<P>We produced 'Summary of findings' tables for the main outcomes of this review using GRADEpro software. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence by considering the overall risk of bias of the included studies, the directness of the evidence, the inconsistency of the results, the precision of the estimates, the risk of publication bias and the magnitude of the effect. We categorised the quality of the body of evidence for each of the primary outcomes as high, moderate, low or very low.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Characteristics of outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcome (biological and mechanical failures) was recorded in all trials with one exception (<LINK REF="STD-Wennstr_x00f6_m-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wennström 2004</LINK>), for which the author did no reply whether they removed or not the screw-retained partial fixed prostheses to evaluate implant stability.</P>
<P>Occurrence of peri-implantitis was mentioned in only four trials comparing implants with turned surfaced with implants with roughened surfaces (<LINK REF="STD-Astrand-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Astrand 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Astrand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Astrand 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schincaglia-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schincaglia 2007</LINK>). Another trial reported the number of people who had lost implants for peri-implantitis at 10 years, but not on the occurrence of peri-implantitis and when it occurred (<LINK REF="STD-Batenburg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Batenburg 1998</LINK>). No reply to our request of clarification was provided.</P>
<P>The secondary outcomes (bone level measurements) were recorded in all trials. However, in four trials, peri-implant bone level measurements were fully or partially performed on panoramic radiographs (<LINK REF="STD-Moberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gatti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gatti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heberer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Heberer 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Nawas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Nawas 2012</LINK>), in 10 trials, baseline radiographs were taken at implant loading (<LINK REF="STD-Batenburg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Batenburg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Astrand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Astrand 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wennstr_x00f6_m-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wennström 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Song-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akoglu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Akoglu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alsabeeha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Alsabeeha 2011</LINK>), and in one trial, they were not presented as mean values but as frequencies (<LINK REF="STD-Prosper-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Prosper 2009</LINK>). Such bone level measurements were considered to be inaccurate either for the quality of the radiographs or for not using the proper baseline and were not included in the present analyses. In one trial, the measurements of 78 implant surfaces out of 178 were missing, therefore the radiographic data were not used (<LINK REF="STD-Fr_x00f6_berg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fröberg 2006</LINK>). In two trials, bone level assessment was calculated on a site basis (only for three year data <LINK REF="STD-Kielbassa-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kielbassa 2009</LINK>) and the authors were not able to supply the required data (participant basis) (<LINK REF="STD-Heydenrijk-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heydenrijk 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kielbassa-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kielbassa 2009</LINK>). The five-year data of another trial were not used since the authors published separate data for maxillae and mandibles (<LINK REF="STD-Astrand-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Astrand 1999</LINK>), while we requested combined data, which were not supplied. The three-year data of a split-mouth study could not be used since we did not have the standard deviation of the difference (<LINK REF="STD-Astrand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Astrand 2002</LINK>). Bone level changes data were not yet available for one ongoing study (<LINK REF="STD-Lang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>Fifteen (56%) trials described an adequate method of sequence generation and we assessed them as being at low risk of bias for this domain (<LINK REF="STD-Batenburg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Batenburg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Astrand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Astrand 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fr_x00f6_berg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fröberg 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kielbassa-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kielbassa 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prosper-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Prosper 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alsabeeha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Alsabeeha 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-den-Hartog-2011" TYPE="STUDY">den Hartog 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Nawas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Nawas 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pozzi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Pozzi 2014</LINK>). It was unclear from the trial report and communication with authors whether sequence generation for 11 studies (41%) had an adequate method and we assessed these studies as being at unclear risk of bias for this domain (<LINK REF="STD-Astrand-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Astrand 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gatti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gatti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heydenrijk-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heydenrijk 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schincaglia-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schincaglia 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crespi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Crespi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Song-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akoglu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Akoglu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heberer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Heberer 2011</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Allocation concealment was reported as having being done adequately in eight (30%) of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Wennstr_x00f6_m-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wennström 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akoglu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Akoglu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alsabeeha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Alsabeeha 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-den-Hartog-2011" TYPE="STUDY">den Hartog 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pozzi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Pozzi 2014</LINK>). It was unclear from the trial report and communication with authors whether allocation for 16 (59%) studies had been adequately concealed, and we assessed these studies as being at unclear risk of bias for this domain (<LINK REF="STD-Batenburg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Batenburg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Astrand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Astrand 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gatti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gatti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heydenrijk-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heydenrijk 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fr_x00f6_berg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fröberg 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crespi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Crespi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prosper-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Prosper 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Song-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heberer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Heberer 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Nawas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Nawas 2012</LINK>).

<P>For four trials (15%), outcome assessors were blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Lang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heberer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Heberer 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2013a</LINK>), whereas for 15 trials (55%) (<LINK REF="STD-Batenburg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Batenburg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Astrand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Astrand 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heydenrijk-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heydenrijk 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wennstr_x00f6_m-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wennström 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fr_x00f6_berg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fröberg 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schincaglia-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schincaglia 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crespi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Crespi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akoglu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Akoglu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-den-Hartog-2011" TYPE="STUDY">den Hartog 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pozzi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Pozzi 2014</LINK>), it was unclear whether outcome assessors were blinded and we considered these studies at unclear risk of detection bias. In eight trials (30%) (<LINK REF="STD-Astrand-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Astrand 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gatti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gatti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kielbassa-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kielbassa 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prosper-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Prosper 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Song-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alsabeeha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Alsabeeha 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Nawas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Nawas 2012</LINK>), outcome assessors were not blinded and we considered these studies at high risk of detection bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>There were low numbers of drop-outs in all but four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fr_x00f6_berg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fröberg 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kielbassa-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kielbassa 2009</LINK>), which were assessed as at high risk of bias. All outcome data were reported in 21 trials (78%) (<LINK REF="STD-Batenburg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Batenburg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Astrand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Astrand 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gatti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gatti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schincaglia-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schincaglia 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crespi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Crespi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kielbassa-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kielbassa 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prosper-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Prosper 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Song-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akoglu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Akoglu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-den-Hartog-2011" TYPE="STUDY">den Hartog 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heberer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Heberer 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pozzi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Pozzi 2014</LINK>). In two trials, the radiographic data of one participant were missing (<LINK REF="STD-Alsabeeha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Alsabeeha 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Astrand-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Astrand 1999</LINK>), and in two trials,<B> </B>radiographs were missing for two participants (<LINK REF="STD-Heydenrijk-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heydenrijk 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Nawas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Nawas 2012</LINK>), but we assessed these as at low risk of bias. In another trial, not all the radiographic data were presented, which confirmed the high risk of bias assessment for this study for this domain (<LINK REF="STD-Fr_x00f6_berg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fröberg 2006</LINK>). In one trial, it was unclear whether prostheses were removed to assess implant mobility and, for this reason, the study could be used only to answer the first part of the secondary objective, and we assessed the incomplete outcome data as at unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Wennstr_x00f6_m-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wennström 2004</LINK>). Therefore, we assessed four trials as at high risk of bias, one at unclear risk of bias and the remaining 22 (81%) at low risk of bias for this domain.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selective reporting</HEADING>
<P>We assessed all but four of the trials (85%) included in this review as being at low risk of selective reporting bias because they all reported most of the main outcomes of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Moberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wennstr_x00f6_m-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wennström 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prosper-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Prosper 2009</LINK>). In one trial, not all evaluated outcomes were presented (<LINK REF="STD-Lang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 2007</LINK>), in one trial, data were not given for participants in which implants failed (<LINK REF="STD-Prosper-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Prosper 2009</LINK>), and one trial comparing Astra implants with a turned versus a TiO<SUB>2</SUB>-blasted surface did not disclose how many implants of each type were placed and presented the various outcomes data of the two different surfaces combined, rendering the comparison useless (<LINK REF="STD-Wennstr_x00f6_m-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wennström 2004</LINK>). Therefore, we assessed these trials as being at high risk of bias for this domain. We judged one trial at unclear risk of bias because at the three-year examination, two ITI implants were treated for peri-implantitis but their fate was reported (<LINK REF="STD-Moberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other potential sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>In 21 of the trials (78%), we identified no other potential source of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Batenburg-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Batenburg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payne-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Payne 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wennstr_x00f6_m-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wennström 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fr_x00f6_berg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fröberg 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lang 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schincaglia-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schincaglia 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crespi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Crespi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kielbassa-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kielbassa 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prosper-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Prosper 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Song-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alsabeeha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Alsabeeha 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-den-Hartog-2011" TYPE="STUDY">den Hartog 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heberer-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Heberer 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Nawas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Nawas 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pozzi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Pozzi 2014</LINK>). We scored two trials (7%) at high risk of bias: the planned publication at five years was cancelled by the authors and the authors justified this as the sponsored implants were no longer commercially available (<LINK REF="STD-Astrand-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Astrand 2002</LINK>). However, this publication would have contained crucial information on the occurrence or outcome of peri-implantitis. In one trial, most of the failed Steri-Oss implants were placed by a surgeon who placed only Steri-Oss implants and who was judged, afterwards, to have insufficient clinical experience; therefore, the effect of the different implant systems is confounded by the different degree of surgical experience of different operators (<LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2002</LINK>). We scored four trials (15%) at unclear risk of bias, because in one trial, eight participants treated with Brånemark implants were scored as having type IV bone quality (very soft bone) according to the Lekholm and Zarb classification (<LINK REF="REF-Lekholm-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lekholm 1985</LINK>) versus one participant in the Astra group (<LINK REF="STD-Astrand-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Astrand 1999</LINK>). For two trials, the amount of information presented was insufficient to judge on the comparability of controls and test groups at entry (<LINK REF="STD-Heydenrijk-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Heydenrijk 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Akoglu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Akoglu 2011</LINK>), and in one trial, we judged the sample size of five participants per group to be insufficient (<LINK REF="STD-Gatti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gatti 2002</LINK>).</P>

All these trials, with one exception in which there were no failures (<LINK REF="STD-Fr_x00f6_berg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fröberg 2006</LINK>), showed at least one early failure of implants with a turned surface versus no or few failures for implants with roughened surfaces.

<P>In order to evaluate the possible effects of different implant characteristics, a trial should be designed in a way that only the characteristic of interest (i.e. surface roughness or implant shape or implant material) is different and all the other parameters are identical. Trials evaluated the following comparisons.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Different implant surfaces</HEADING>
<P>Six trials evaluated the potential effect of different implant surfaces, with only two trials comparing the same surfaces. There was no evidence to suggest that one implant surface had a lower failure rate or led to lower marginal bone changes than another.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Different implant shapes</HEADING>
<P>Seven trials evaluated the potential effect of 13 different implant shapes, with no trials comparing the same shapes. After one year, no significant differences for implant failures between the tested different implant designs were observed. The only statistical significant difference observed regarded one trial comparing peri-implant marginal bone loss at Nobel Speedy Groovy implants with NobelActive implants, which showed that Nobel Speedy Groovy implants lost 0.59 mm more bone than NobelActive implants one year after loading (<LINK REF="STD-Pozzi-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Pozzi 2014</LINK>),</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Different implant materials</HEADING>
<P>Only one trial compared implants made of two different materials: titanium grade 4 versus a titanium-13zirconium alloy (Roxolid), but there was no difference in failure rate or bone loss (<LINK REF="STD-Al_x002d_Nawas-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Al-Nawas 2012</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Different implant systems</HEADING>
<P>Thirteen trials compared different implant systems with a combination of different surface characteristics, shapes, dimensions, purity of titanium, surgical protocols (submerged versus non-submerged etc.). There was no evidence to suggest that one implant system led to fewer implant failures or less bone loss than another implant system.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Early failures between implants with turned and roughened surfaces</HEADING>
<P>Seven trials compared early implant failures between implants with turned and roughened surfaces. Although not statistically significant, the limits of the confidence interval from the meta-analysis went from the turned surfaces being 10% worse than the roughened surfaces to being nine times better.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Occurrence of peri-implantitis between implants with turned and roughened surfaces</HEADING>
<P>Four trials presented data on the occurrence of peri-implantitis between implants with turned and roughened surfaces at three years after loading, one at five years, and one trial provided the information of how many implants failed for peri-implantitis up to 10 years after loading. At three years, the meta-analysis showed that implants with turned surfaces had a 20% reduction in risk of being affected by peri-implantitis; however, the five-year and 10-year data did not show any evidence of a difference.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-07-14 14:49:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>There was insufficient evidence to draw any useful conclusions, as most of the trials were underpowered. The generalisation of the results of the included trials to ordinary clinical conditions should be considered with caution. In general, treatments were administered by experienced clinicians and the follow-up regimens were strict. It is unlikely that dentists with non-comparable experience could match similar positive results. The observation that the inclusion of a less trained surgeon might have influenced the result of one trial support this suggestion (<LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2002</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-07-21 14:42:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>The most striking aspect is that only 27 out of 81 identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) could be included in the present review. This was due to several problems, the most common being: studies were not RCTs or were quasi-random trials, data were presented in a way we could not use or insufficient data were presented, too short follow-up (less than one year after loading), lack of proper assessment of the primary outcome measure (stability of individual implants), study discontinuation or evaluating implants for other application (orthodontics). In addition, peri-implant bone level change data of many included trials could not be used because they were not recorded from the proper baseline (implant placement) but at later stages (loading) when a substantial portion of bone loss already occurred or because they were presented at implant level and not participant level. In a previous investigation, it was found that the design, analysis and reporting of RCTs on oral implants was generally poor (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2001a</LINK>), which may explain why so many trials had to be excluded from the present review.</P>
<P>The quality assessment of the included trials is summarised in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> represents a summary of the overall judgement of the risk of bias, which tries to quantify the potential risk of bias of the included trials, whereas <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> describes our judgement about each of the six risk of bias domains for each included study. We assessed only two trials as being at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2013a</LINK>), assessed 15 as at high risk of bias.</P>
<P>The source of study funding, in particular when trials were sponsored by implant manufacturers, is a potential source of bias. Fifteen (58%) out of 27 included trials reported that they were commercially funded. It is possible that there could be bias in this area. However, these studies would probably not have taken place unless there was commercial funding and is difficult to evaluate this aspect objectively. Ideally, independent studies should be conducted. We did not classify trials sponsored by manufacturers as unclear risk of bias when they compared their own different implant types, even though there might be a tendency of overestimating the outcome of the new implants type.</P>
<P>The primary outcome measure in this review was the success of the implants, both from a biological (successful osseointegration and lack of infection) and a biomechanical (no fracture or deformation rendering the implant useless) point of view. In order to ascertain in a reliable way if an implant is clinically osseointegrated, its stability ought to be evaluated with the prosthesis removed (with the exception of single implants) otherwise implant failures can be underestimated (<LINK REF="REF-Gr_x00f6_ndahl-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gröndahl 1997</LINK>). Here the decision was to exclude those trials in which individual implant stability was not tested after removing the prostheses.</P>
<P>The assessment of radiographic bone level changes around implants is a secondary or surrogate or predictive outcome measure that is commonly used. A predictive outcome can be defined as a measure of the disease process. Predictive outcome measures cannot be recommended as primary parameters to evaluate effectiveness of dental implants; however, they may be useful diagnostic tools for the early detection of potential problems, allowing early treatment to preserve healthy conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2001b</LINK>). Primary or true outcomes such as implant failures are often rare and distant events, whereas, surrogate endpoints are in general sensitive predictors for the true outcomes. The problem of using mean marginal bone level assessments is that a severe marginal bone loss affecting few implants is diluted by the averaging process. In addition, once an implant has failed, its values are removed from the calculations, suddenly improving the bone level measurements. These limitations of the mean marginal bone level measurements may delay an early detection of a statistically significant difference. One possible way to overcome this problem is to dichotomise the bone level measurements, establishing an arbitrary threshold level of severe bone loss (for instance 5 mm), and to count how many participants had at least one implant affected by such severe bone loss. Implants that failed because of progressive bone loss should remain in the bone change calculations, even though it is rarely performed in practice.</P>
<P>In this review update, we decided to include only those radiographic assessments that presented radiographs taken at implant placement as baseline data in order to evaluate more appropriately the bone level changes at different implant types, since most of the bone resorption occurs just after implant placement/loading.</P>
<P>We excluded one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tymstra-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tymstra 2011</LINK>), and only partially included another (<LINK REF="STD-den-Hartog-2011" TYPE="STUDY">den Hartog 2011</LINK>), because similar implants with different shapes were systematically placed at different levels with respect to the bone crest. In addition, bone levels measurements were taken using different reference points when the same reference point could have been used. While authors followed the manufacturer guidelines for placing the implants, the different implant positions are likely to effect marginal bone level changes. The aim of this review was to evaluate the possible effect of different implant characteristics. To achieve this it is imperative that, whenever possible, implants are placed in a similar position to exclude all other possible confounding factors. The excluded trials reported statistically more bone loss one year after loading at NobelPerfect Groovy implants of 0.8 mm (<LINK REF="STD-den-Hartog-2011" TYPE="STUDY">den Hartog 2011</LINK>) and 1.8 mm (<LINK REF="STD-Tymstra-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tymstra 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Investigators should design studies carefully deciding on either a parallel group or a split-mouth design on outset, not combining the two different study designs in the same study. Split-mouth studies should ideally have equal numbers of implants in each group placed per participant. The analysis of these studies should be a 'paired' analysis, taking the pairing of the implants within participants into account. Another commonly encountered problem is that both split-mouth and parallel group studies are analysed at the level of the implant, not taking the clustering of the implants within a participant into account. Finally, the data of the two different groups should be reported separately and compared, and the data should not be combined in a single group. The design and analysis of these studies is frequently complex and it is recommended that statisticians are involved in the initial planning stages and protocol writing for these studies.</P>
<P>None of the trial authors characterised the implant surfaces themselves. This is understandable since they relied on the information provided by the manufacturers or published in other studies. However, after having analysed the surface of some implants, we realised that the surface description of the Steri-Oss implants reported in two trials did not correspond to what we actually found (<LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tawse_x002d_Smith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tawse-Smith 2002</LINK>). In fact, the surface was acid-etched and not turned as described in the articles. Such a finding was indeed unexpected. In experimental research, it is recommended that authors characterise in detail the surface properties of their implants. We feel that the same recommendation could be given for clinical trials where the implant characteristics could be described in detail and possibly independently verified.</P>

<P>Based on the results of the included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), there was no evidence showing that any particular type of dental implant has superior long-term success over another type of implant. There was limited evidence showing that implants with relatively smooth (turned) surfaces are less prone to lose bone due to chronic infection (peri-implantitis) than implants with much rougher surfaces (titanium-plasma-sprayed). These findings were based on several RCTs, often at high risk of bias, with few participants and relatively short follow-up periods.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-07-14 14:54:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>More well-designed, long-term RCTs are required to understand if there is any design, surface modification or material able to improve the effectiveness of oral implants significantly. It is recommended that such trials include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>test and control implants placed in the same way when possible;</LI>

<P>Such trials should be reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">www.consort-statement.org</A>).
