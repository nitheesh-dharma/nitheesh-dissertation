<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-04-10 16:47:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Acute illness and injury are the most common causes of death and disability worldwide in people aged under 50 years. The highest priority in an emergency is to enable a patient to breathe by securing their airway (passage from the nose and mouth into the lungs). Endotracheal intubation is one of various ways to secure the airway. This review found no difference between endotracheal intubation and other airway securing strategies for reducing deaths after acute illness or injury; however, better studies are needed.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Emergency intubation has been widely advocated as a life saving procedure in severe acute illness and injury associated with real or potential compromises to the patient's airway and ventilation. However, some initial data have suggested a lack of observed benefit. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine in acutely ill and injured patients who have real or anticipated problems in maintaining an adequate airway whether emergency endotracheal intubation, as opposed to other airway management techniques, improves the outcome in terms of survival, degree of disability at discharge or length of stay and complications occurring in hospital. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register (December 2006), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2006, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2006), EMBASE (1980 to week 50, December 2006), National Research Register (Issue 4, 2006), CINAHL (1980 to December 2006), BIDS (to December 2006) and ICNARC (to December 2006). We also examined reference lists of articles for relevant material and contacted experts in the field. Non-English language publications were searched for and examined.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials involving the emergency use of endotracheal intubation in the injured or acutely ill patient were examined. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The full texts of 452 studies were reviewed independently by two authors using a standard form. Where the review authors felt a study may be relevant for inclusion in the final review or disagreed, the authors examined the study and a collective decision was made regarding its inclusion or exclusion from the review. The results were not combined in a meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity of patients, practitioners and alternatives to intubation that were used. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We identified three eligible RCTs carried out in urban environments. Two trials involved adults with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. One of these trials found a non-significant survival disadvantage in patients randomised to receive a physician-operated intubation versus a combi-tube (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.99). The second trial detected a non-significant survival disadvantage in patients randomised to paramedic intubation versus an oesophageal gastric airway (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.90). The third included study was a trial of children requiring airway intervention in the prehospital environment. The results indicated no difference in survival (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.11) or neurologic outcome (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.22) between paramedic intubation versus bag-valve-mask ventilation and later hospital intubation by emergency physicians; however, only 42% of the children randomised to paramedic endotracheal intubation actually received it. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The efficacy of emergency intubation as currently practised has not been rigorously studied. The skill level of the operator may be key in determining efficacy. <BR/>In non-traumatic cardiac arrest, it is unlikely that intubation carries the same life saving benefit as early defibrillation and bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). <BR/>In trauma and paediatric patients, the current evidence base provides no imperative to extend the practice of prehospital intubation in urban systems. <BR/>It would be ethical and pertinent to initiate a large, high quality randomised trial comparing the efficacy of competently practised emergency intubation with basic bag-valve-mask manoeuvres (BVM) in urban adult out-of-hospital non-traumatic cardiac arrest. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-14 13:15:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-04-10 16:48:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Airway control and adequate respiration is a priority in the management of any seriously ill or injured person (<LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rotondo-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rotondo 1993</LINK>). If either is impaired, then emergency endotracheal intubation may be performed in order to secure the airway or assist with ventilation. There are a large number of reports which suggest that airway obstruction is present in many trauma patients and contributes to both morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Gentleman-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gentleman 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hussain-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hussain 1994</LINK>). Endotracheal intubation has, therefore, increased in both the prehospital and early emergency room phases of any resuscitation attempt (<LINK REF="REF-Regel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regel 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of early intubation is a practice that has resulted in a reduction in morbidity for some groups of patients, most notably those with moderate to severe head injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Gildenberg-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gildenberg 1985</LINK>). In this group of patients the wider use of endotracheal intubation and control of ventilation can reduce the incidence of secondary cerebral insults that contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Gentleman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gentleman 1992</LINK>). Intubation of the trachea is a procedure that is associated with significant risks, including the dangers of aspiration of gastric contents and blood, unrecognised oesophageal intubation and aggravation of existing traumatic injuries such as cervical spine damage. It also usually requires the administration of drugs, which may have a detrimental effect on other organs, for example the heart. Despite these risks the use of endotracheal intubation in the resuscitation of a severely injured patient has been said to have a low morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Rotondo-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rotondo 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recent data collected from both Europe and the USA, however, suggest that endotracheal intubation may not be universally beneficial in all seriously ill and injured patients. Unadjusted data from Belgium, examining 953 out-of-hospital emergencies, including trauma cases, where individuals received cardiopulmonary resuscitation at the scene, suggests that survival to reach hospital was higher in those who were not intubated before arrival than those who were (89.5% versus 67.6%) (<LINK REF="REF-Stamatakis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamatakis 1995</LINK>). Evidence from data collected by the United Kingdom Trauma Audit Research Network (<LINK REF="REF-UK-TARN-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK TARN 1996</LINK>), when adjusted for Injury Severity Score (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1974</LINK>) and Revised Trauma Score (<LINK REF="REF-Champion-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Champion 1990</LINK>), also suggests an association between outcome and emergency intubation. Seriously injured patients with an initial Glasgow Coma Score of eight or less who were intubated prior to arrival at hospital or on arrival to the emergency department had a lower 30-day survival than those who were not intubated (46.6% versus 69.3%).</P>
<P>Much of this data is uncontrolled and may reflect other unconsidered variables, for example the practice of individuals who are not expert in airway management to intubate only certain selected groups of patients. However, there is enough evidence to suggest that a review of the practice of emergency endotracheal intubation in the early phase of a resuscitation attempt is warranted.</P>

Seventy-one per cent of the children had suffered a non-traumatic out-of-hospital (OOH) cardiac arrest, 13% a respiratory arrest, 8% status epilepticus and the remainder had mainly a traumatic coma aetiology.

<LINK REF="STD-Gausche-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gausche 2000</LINK> <BR/>This trial allocated paediatric patients to receive either paramedic ETI or BVM and later ED physician ETI by calendar day (odd or even). Age, gender, aetiologies for airway intervention and the proportion of children not further resuscitated at the ED were equivalent between the two randomised groups. However, within each aetiology there was no further breakdown of confounders (presenting rhythm for cardiac arrest, Glasgow Coma Score in other groups) other than that the proportion of children in cardiac arrest receiving bystander cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was equivalent between the allocated trial groups. ETI was not attempted in 27% of patients randomised to receive it and, where attempted, the success rate was 57% (resulting in successful ETI in 42% of children allocated to receive it). The results were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis and an actual airway-received basis. It is possible that a percentage of those receiving BVM did not receive ED ETI as 5% of this group went from the ED to a hospital ward or home. Follow up was continued until discharge for survival and neurologic outcomes; there were 10 (1%) losses to follow up. Children were blinded to trial allocation, those performing airway care were not. The outcome assessors were not blinded to allocation but independently reviewed each outcome. The two assessors weighted kappa outcomes had very good agreement (k = 0.978 (0.93 to 1.0)). Allocation concealment was graded D.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Goldenberg-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Goldenberg 1986</LINK> <BR/>This trial randomised consecutive adult OOH cardiac arrest patients to two interventions (ETI or EGTA) by means of random number generated cards. It was unclear whether or not the groups were equivalent in terms of numbers of shocks for ventricular fibrillation (VF) patients but equivalence for other confounders was demonstrated. A significant proportion (17%) of patients received the opposite airway intervention from that to which they had been randomised, due to technical difficulties; but an intention-to-treat analysis was presented. It was unclear what proportion of EGTA patients subsequently received ETI in the ED. Patients were followed up to hospital discharge in order to determine survival, which was the main outcome measure; there appeared to have been no losses to follow up. Patients were blinded to trial allocation, those performing airway interventions were not. It was unclear whether or not the outcome assessors were blinded (Grade B allocation concealment). </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Gausche-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gausche 2000</LINK> <BR/>This trial compared paramedic ETI versus paramedic BVM and ED physician ETI in paediatric patients requiring prehospital airway intervention from a variety of aetiologies. The results indicated that there was no survival (26% versus 30%; OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.11) or good neurologic outcome (23% versus 20%; OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.22) advantage in children randomised to receive ETI versus BVM and later ED ETI should resuscitation be continued. This was an intention-to-treat analysis where only 42% of the group randomised actually received paramedic ETI. There was no difference in the hospital length of stay between survivors in the two groups.</P>

<BR/>This trial compared paramedic-operated ETI versus EGTA in adults with out-of-hospital non-traumatic cardiac arrest. The results indicated a small non-significant difference in survival to hospital discharge in an intention-to-treat analysis of 175 patients (11.1% ETI versus 12.9% EGTA). Relative risk of survival with ETI was 0.86 (98% CI 0.39 to 1.90). Seventeen per cent of patients had different airway interventions from those for which they were randomised. When adjusted for, this widened the outcome difference (10.9 versus 15.4%) but the study was not powered to show this difference as significant. The reported insertion success and adequacy of ventilation rates were similar (90% versus 90% for insertion, 90% ETI versus 70 to 90% EGTA for ventilation). <BR/> <BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Rabitsch-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rabitsch 2003</LINK>
<BR/>This randomised trial compared physician-operated ETI versus a combi-tube in adults with out-of-hospital non-traumatic cardiac arrest. A doubling of survival to hospital discharge was demonstrated in the combi-tube group (ETI 3% versus combi-tube 6%) with similar insertion success rates (94% versus 98%). The sample number of 172 patients was insufficient to show this difference as significant; relative risk of survival with ETI was 0.43 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.99). The pulmonary aspiration rate was 2% in the combi-tube group, 0% with ETI.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-13 16:26:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>This review identified three trials that examined the efficacy of ETI compared to alternative airway management techniques in the prehospital setting. No single study showed a statistically significant difference in outcome between the treatment groups. Two trials were conducted in adult out-of-hospital non-traumatic cardiac arrest patients (<LINK REF="STD-Goldenberg-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Goldenberg 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabitsch-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rabitsch 2003</LINK>) and one in paediatric patients with traumatic and medical reasons for airway control (<LINK REF="STD-Gausche-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gausche 2000</LINK>). Each trial employed different alternatives to ETI (EGTA, combi-tube, BVM). Paramedics managed the airway in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gausche-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gausche 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldenberg-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Goldenberg 1986</LINK>), physicians in the third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rabitsch-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rabitsch 2003</LINK>). We did not combine the results of these studies due to the heterogeneity of patient groups, airway operators and alternatives to ETI.</P>
<P>In considering the implications of this finding it must be acknowledged that these trials do not constitute definitive evidence. Two trials were carried out in adult OOH cardiac arrest victims, however, neither was of sufficient power to show the differences found to be significant. The third trial in paediatric out-of-hospital emergencies was sufficiently powered however ETI was not carried out in the majority of the children randomised to receive it, raising questions about inclusion criteria in relation to operator (paramedic) training and perceptions. The success rates when ETI was attempted by paramedics were much lower than desirable, 57% (<LINK REF="STD-Gausche-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gausche 2000</LINK>) and 90% (<LINK REF="STD-Goldenberg-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Goldenberg 1986</LINK>) compared to 94% with physicians (<LINK REF="STD-Rabitsch-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rabitsch 2003</LINK>), suggesting that the skill of the operator and operating conditions may be key in determining the efficacy of ETI. The relevant secondary outcomes identified (complications, rates of multiorgan failure) are not comprehensively addressed by the trials. There are some questions relating to confounding in each trial. Finally, the design of all three trials relates only to prehospital care in an urban setting.</P>
<P>Research in the emergency setting has particular difficulties in terms of the pressure of time and ethical issues pertaining to consent. This perhaps explains the paucity of trials compared to the large amount of observational data published in relation to the efficacy of emergency ETI. The review may be criticised for excluding these studies, however each observational study found was considered carefully by the review authors. Nine observational studies were identified that contained data, five of which were prospective (<LINK REF="STD-Callaham-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Callaham 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Geehr-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Geehr 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hillis-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hillis 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rainer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rainer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shea-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Shea 1985</LINK>) and examined the efficacy of paramedic ETI in adult non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest when compared to a range of airway alternatives (EGTA, BVM). Two prospective studies contained data relating to the efficacy of ETI in an adult in-hospital non-traumatic cardiac arrest population (<LINK REF="STD-King-1994" TYPE="STUDY">King 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marwick-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Marwick 1991</LINK>). Some of these studies are much larger than the trials considered in the review and show results that are significant. However, the review group felt each had particular flaws in terms of failure to adjust for important confounders or missing data that made the results less reliable than the included trials.</P>
<P>Similarly in adult trauma patients, 18 observational studies with four prospective (<LINK REF="STD-Bochicchio-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bochicchio 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trupka-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Trupka 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westhoff-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Westhoff 2002</LINK>) were found comparing ETI usually to BVM. The majority (13) of these studies related to the timing of ETI (prehospital 'early' (paramedic in some cases) versus 'late' with prehospital paramedic BVM and physician ED ETI) in heterogeneous groups of trauma patients. The remainder examined practice purely in the emergency department or the prehospital environment. One retrospective study examined ETI in adult hypothermia patients. The results of these studies were often significant but different studies with similar conduct and inclusion criteria reached contradictory findings. Once again the review group found issues with missing data and confounding that impacted on the reliability of results; this was often in line with the authors' own discussions. Hence each study was excluded but is described fully in the excluded studies table.</P>
<P>At this time, having considered the included trials and other evidence, the review group suggest that currently there is insufficient high quality data available to comment on the efficacy of emergency ETI, an intervention often advocated as life saving.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Clinicians need to establish a safe airway and adequate ventilation for patients in emergency situations bearing in mind that the efficacy of emergency endotracheal intubation, as currently practised, has not been rigorously studied. </P>
<P>The skill of the operator may be a key determinant of efficacy in all patient groups. Success rates are not reported in most studies and in paramedic studies to date those quoted are often less than desirable (&lt; 95% after three attempts), which may reflect skill retention and operating conditions. <BR/>In non-traumatic cardiac arrest it is unlikely that intubation carries the same life saving benefit as early defibrillation and bystander CPR. </P>
<P>In paediatric and trauma patients the current evidence base provides no imperative to extend the practice of prehospital intubation in urban and short transit time systems. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given the review findings and the large investment in paramedic intubation training, it would seem ethical to initiate a large, high quality randomised trial comparing ETI efficacy (involving competent practitioners) to basic manoeuvres (BVM) in urban out-of-hospital adult cardiac arrest. The findings of this trial would then determine the nature of future studies in trauma patients and other groups. </P>
