<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Timed voiding for the management of urinary incontinence in adults</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>This review examined the use of a fixed interval of voiding for the management of urinary incontinence in adults. This approach to urinary incontinence is thought to be common in aged care homes for people who require assistance from other people for toileting and continence care. The reviewers found two trials that had evaluated timed voiding. They included 298 elderly women who were living in aged care homes and had reduced cognition and impaired mobility. Reductions in the number of incontinence episodes were reported in each trial. The reviewers found insufficient data for these findings to be combined. Hence, at this point in time, there is not enough evidence on the effects of timed voiding for the management of urinary incontinence. </P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2009-09-07 10:01:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Timed voiding is a fixed time interval toileting assistance program that has been promoted for the management of people with urinary incontinence who cannot participate in independent toileting. For this reason, it is commonly assumed to represent current practice in residential aged care settings. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of timed voiding for the management of urinary incontinence in adults who cannot participate in independent toileting.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-09-07 10:01:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register (searched 2 April 2009), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to Week 18 2002), CINAHL (January 1982 to February 2001), PsycINFO (January 1972 to August 2002), Biological Abstracts (January 1980 to December 2000), Current Contents (January 1993 to December 2001) and the reference lists of relevant articles. We also contacted experts in the field, searched relevant websites and hand searched journals and conference proceedings.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We selected all randomised and quasi-randomised trials that addressed timed voiding in an adult population and that had an alteration in continence status as a primary outcome. We included those trials that had assessed timed voiding delivered either alone or in combination with another intervention and compared it with either usual care, or no timed voiding, or another intervention.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken by at least two people working independently of each other. Any differences were resolved by discussion until agreement was reached. The relative risk for dichotomous data were calculated with 95% confidence intervals. Where data were insufficient to support a quantitative analysis, a narrative overview was undertaken.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two trials with a total of 298 participants met the inclusion criteria. Both compared timed voiding plus additional intervention with usual care. In one of these timed voiding was combined with continence products, placement of a bedside commode for each participant, education to staff on transfer techniques, feedback and encouragement to staff, praise to participants for "successful responses" and administration of oxybutynin in small doses. The mean percentage who were incontinent when checked daily was 20% in the intervention group compared with 80% in the control group. No further between group analysis was possible from the data reported. The other trial combined timed voiding with a medical assessment and individualised medical management that was based on clinical data. Reduction in the number of participants with daytime and night-time incontinence was greater in the intervention group but this difference was statistically significant only for night-time wetting. There was no difference in the volume of urine lost as determined by pad weighing. </P>
<P>The methodological quality of these trials was not high based on the quality appraisal criteria of the Cochrane Incontinence Group. In particular, there was a lack of clarity regarding levels of blinding. It was not possible to combine data from trials. In both trials, the fixed schedule of toileting was combined with other interventions. The extent to which the results reflect the contribution of timed voiding is unknown because the trials' design did not allow assessment of the effects of the fixed schedule of toileting separately from other components of the interventions. <BR/> </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The data were too few and of insufficient quality to provide empirical support for or against the intervention of timed voiding.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-09-07 10:35:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Urinary incontinence commonly affects frail, elderly people. Amongst elderly residents of long-term care facilities, estimates of the prevalence range between 39% (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1991</LINK>) and 50% (<LINK REF="STD-Fantl-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Fantl 1991</LINK>). Cost estimates also vary. Based on a 1994 US study, direct care costs associated with urinary incontinence are thought to be in the range of $11.2 billion annually in the community and $5.2 billion in nursing homes in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Hu-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hu 1994</LINK>). Urinary incontinence is associated with psychological stress and social isolation (<LINK REF="REF-Mitteness-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitteness 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norton-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wyman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yu-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu 1987</LINK>), urinary tract infection (<LINK REF="REF-Richardson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 1995</LINK>) and pressure sores (<LINK REF="REF-Spector-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spector 1994</LINK>). In addition, caregivers of community-dwelling dementia patients with urinary incontinence report that incontinence management is burdensome (<LINK REF="REF-Cassells-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cassells 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flaherty-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flaherty 1992</LINK>;) and cite it as an important reason for relinquishing care (<LINK REF="REF-Ouslander-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouslander 1990</LINK>). Methods of toileting assistance are commonly used in the management of urinary incontinence in the elderly. These include the interventions of prompted voiding, habit retraining and timed voiding (<LINK REF="STD-Fantl-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Fantl 1991</LINK>). This review concentrates on timed voiding. Other Cochrane reviews are available, including those covering prompted voiding (<LINK REF="REF-Eustice-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eustice 2000</LINK>), habit retraining (<LINK REF="REF-Ostaszkiewicz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostaszkiewicz 2004</LINK>), pelvic-floor muscle training (<LINK REF="REF-Hay_x002d_Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay-Smith 2006</LINK>), bladder training (<LINK REF="REF-Wallace-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 2004</LINK>) and absorbent products (<LINK REF="REF-Fader-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fader 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fader-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fader 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Timed voiding is sometimes referred to as scheduled, routine or regular toileting. It is characterised by a fixed interval between toileting. It is generally considered a passive toileting assistance program that is initiated and maintained by a caregiver or caregivers and is generally considered appropriate for patients who cannot participate in independent toileting (<LINK REF="STD-Fantl-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Fantl 1991</LINK>). It has been commonly promoted for use in long-term residential care settings for patients whose incontinence may be associated with cognitive and/or motor deficits (<LINK REF="REF-Ouslander-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouslander 1985</LINK>). The underlying goal is the avoidance of incontinence episodes rather than restoration of bladder function. The aim is to achieve continence by anticipating involuntary bladder emptying and by providing regular opportunities for elimination to occur.</P>
<P>Whilst acknowledging variability in the definition of timed voiding, this review of timed voiding applied the definitions proposed by Hadley (1986) and by The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ, formerly known as the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, AHCPR) (<LINK REF="STD-Fantl-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Fantl 1991</LINK>). In this context, timed voiding is distinguished from bladder training, prompted voiding and habit training.</P>
<P>There is significant overlap between toileting assistance interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Cheater-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheater 1991</LINK>). A fixed interval between voids may also be employed in other continence training programs such as bladder training, prompted voiding and habit retraining. The theoretical difference between timed voiding and these other interventions however, lies in the fact that the intervoiding interval in timed voiding remains fixed for the duration of the intervention, whilst the interval may be modified in the other interventions (either lengthening or shortening it). Other differences relate to the absence of patient participation, positive reinforcement, and/or patient education in timed voiding. "Timed voiding does not aim to motivate the patient to delay voiding and resist urge, unlike in bladder training" (<LINK REF="STD-Fantl-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Fantl 1991</LINK>). Furthermore, timed voiding does not attempt to mimic the patient's own individualised toileting pattern, unlike habit retraining.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of timed voiding for the management of urinary incontinence in adults.</P>
<P>The following hypotheses were addressed.</P>
<P>1. Timed voiding is better than no timed voiding.</P>
<P>2. Timed voiding is better than other interventions. </P>
<P>3. Timed voiding in combination with another intervention is better than that other intervention alone.</P>
<P>4. Timed voiding in combination with another intervention is better than timed voiding alone.</P>
<P>5. Timed voiding in combination with another intervention is better than usual care.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>All abstracts and references identified from the search strategy were checked by two reviewers. All randomised and quasi randomised studies which met the inclusion criteria were selected. These were appraised for methodological quality using the Cochrane Incontinence Review Group's criteria. These criteria are based on the assumption that the avoidance of bias is best achieved by secure concealment of random allocation prior to formal entry; few and identifiable withdrawals and dropouts; and analysis based on an intention to treat. Data from trials that met these inclusion criteria were extracted by two reviewers working independently. Discrepancies were discussed until agreement was reached. Extracted raw data were analysed using the statistical analysis package, Review Manager, developed by The Cochrane Collaboration. The plan was that the relative risk for dichotomous data and weighted mean differences for continuous data would be calculated with 95% confidence intervals, using a fixed effect model, and that where quantitative analysis was impossible or inappropriate, a narrative overview would be undertaken.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The search identified four potential studies that had employed timed voiding for the management of urinary incontinence in adults. One of these trials was excluded however because participants were not randomly allocated (<LINK REF="STD-Carpenter-1960" TYPE="STUDY">Carpenter 1960</LINK>). Another study was excluded because it used a group cross-over design without randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Ouslander-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Ouslander 1988</LINK>) (see Table of Characteristics of Excluded Studies). This left two trials that together had 298 participants. One of these involved 20 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>) and the other 278 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Tobin-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tobin 1986</LINK>) (see Table of Characteristics of Included Studies). </P>
<P>Most of the participants from the two selected trials were cognitively impaired elderly women (mean age 86.7 years) and all resided in facilities that provided nursing care. Based on a 10-point mental status questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 1960</LINK>), 78.4% of the intervention group and 81.1% of the control group from the trial conducted by Tobin and Brocklehurst (1986) scored lower than 7. Using the Folstein Mini Mental Status Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>), the average score for participants involved in the other trial was 7.0 for the intervention group and 8.5 for the control group (maximum total score - 30) (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>). Both trials reported functional status on the basis of observations of the level of support required for mobility. Fifty-five percent of the participants in one trial were able to mobilize easily with or without an aid; 25% mobilized with difficulty and 17% were chairfast (<LINK REF="STD-Tobin-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tobin 1986</LINK>). Six of the 10 intervention group participants and 5 of the 10 control group participants in the other trial, required the support of one person for assistance (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>). Data were also collected in both trials on the baseline incidence of incontinence and in one trial the volume of incontinence was additionally estimated (<LINK REF="STD-Tobin-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tobin 1986</LINK>). This involved the collection and weighing of pads. </P>
<P>Both trials reported a baseline assessment which involved a clinical examination and a diagnosis of the type of incontinence. The clinical examination included a rectal examination to exclude faecal impaction, collection of a clean specimen of urine to exclude urinary tract infection, and estimation of post-void residual volume. One trial additionally included assessment procedures to identify women with vaginal atrophy (<LINK REF="STD-Tobin-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tobin 1986</LINK>) and found that 21% of 95 female participants had vaginal atrophy. Urodynamic investigations were undertaken in two of the participants in the trial conducted by Tobin and Brocklehurst (1986), whilst bedside cystometry was performed on each participant in the trial conducted by Smith and colleagues (1992). On the basis of these procedures, nearly all participants were diagnosed with detrusor overactivity. <BR/> <BR/>In both trials timed voiding was combined with other modalities and was compared with usual care. The approach taken in one trial involved 2 hourly toileting for participants who were assessed as having an unstable bladder. Timed voiding was combined with a medical assessment and an individualised medical intervention. Medical interventions included propantheline and flavoxate for participants with an "unstable bladder" and/or ethinyloestradiol for women with urodynamic stress incontinence combined with pelvic floor muscle training and/or antibiotic therapy for participants with a urinary tract infection. The intervention was delivered by nursing home staff. Participants were reviewed after two months (<LINK REF="STD-Tobin-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tobin 1986</LINK>). In the other trial, a schedule of set times to provide toileting assistance was developed in consultation with nursing staff, who were also involved in the delivery of the intervention. Participants were toileted five times per day at times that were consistent with other occasions of staff patient interactions. This was combined with the stepped use of continence products, placement of bedside commodes, education to staff on transfer techniques, feedback and encouragement to staff, praise to participants for "successful responses" and administration of oxybutynin in small doses (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>). This last phase was abandoned after only one week due to side effects and hence, there were no outcome data reported for that time period. The duration of the trial was three and a half months. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Potential for bias at trial entry, at time of treatment or outcome assessment</HEADING>
<P>A partially randomised approach to allocation of participants was used in one trial. Whilst some of the participants were randomly allocated, others were purposively selected on the basis of available numbers (<LINK REF="STD-Tobin-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tobin 1986</LINK>). Data were insufficient to assess the degree of concealment associated with the allocation. Blinding of the intervention was not possible and it was not clear whether or not outcome assessment had been 'blind'.</P>
<P>Smith and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>) described a purposive selection process and group matching based on levels of incontinence. Further consultation with the main investigator of the study however suggested that participants were assigned numbers and that these were picked out of a hat. Whilst the extent to which participants and/or caregivers were blinded to allocation is not reported, education and performance feedback to caregivers were integral components of the intervention. As has been noted in the systematic reviews on bladder training and prompted voiding (<LINK REF="REF-Eustice-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eustice 2000</LINK>) blinding of participants and/or those involved in the delivery and/or assessment of interventions of this nature is not always possible.</P>

<P>One trial with a very small sample size provided no data on attrition and the number of participants at outcome was not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>). The other trial was characterised by a high attrition rate, missing data and a complete case analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Tobin-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tobin 1986</LINK>). The results therefore reflect a subset of the data, but whether this was because it was impossible to measure the others, is not made explicit. In the absence of an intention to treat analysis, the potential for underestimating or overestimating the effects of the intervention must be considered.</P>

Comprising a total of 20 participants, between group outcome data reported by Smith and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>) was based on a mean group percentage with a reduction in incontinence calculated from observation of each resident's continence status once a day. The intervention was reportedly associated with fewer wet checks at outcome (20% wet vs 80% wet). Further analysis of these data were limited by the absence of reporting of the standard deviation. Although fewer incontinence episodes were observed between baseline and outcome in the intervention group. These data were not collected for the control group, and hence no between group analysis was possible.</P>
<P>Tobin and Brocklehurst (<LINK REF="STD-Tobin-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tobin 1986</LINK>) reported a reduction in the number of participants with daytime incontinence in both the intervention and control group. Although this reduction was larger in the intervention group the difference between the groups was not statistically significant (RR 1.34; 95% CI 0.90 to 2.01) A similar pattern of results was seen in respect of night-time wetting and for this outcome the between group difference was statistically significant (RR 1.80; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.89).

<P>Monitoring the capacity of staff to adhere to the research protocol was an integral component of the trial conducted by Smith and colleagues (1992). All personnel involved in the intervention received training and feedback throughout the course of the study. The method by which adherence was calculated was by reference to a form which served the concurrent purpose of recording each participant's continence rate. It is of clinical interest that adherence to research recommendations was reported to be high after staff received training on the technique of transferring participants from bed to commode. This assumes that staff had been previously unaware or unskilled in this technique and suggests that pre-intervention rates of toileting assistance may have been low. This may have affected the efficacy of the intervention.</P>
<P>Tobin and Brocklehurst (1986) reported a 72% adherence to the research protocol by those participants in the intervention group who were available at outcome. The method by which this was calculated was not reported. It is unclear if the researchers were reporting the adherence of staff to the delivery of the intervention or to the assessment procedures or if they were describing the levels of adherence demonstrated by the participants. Lower levels of adherence by the participants is suggested by the observation that a pad test had to be abandoned in 51 of 161 participants and that one of the reasons cited was the removal of pads by confused residents. Other reasons included faecal incontinence and death or admission to hospital.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-30 14:34:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No trials were identified that addressed the effect of timed voiding alone. It should be noted, however, that there is considerable confusion in the literature over the terms "timed voiding", "habit retraining', "prompted voiding" and "bladder training". The review was based on an a priori definition of timed voiding which was developed after an extensive review of the literature, nevertheless we struggled to categorize the interventions used from the descriptions given. Overlap between interventions was found with some interventions having features of more than one approach. The trial by Smith (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>) for example, described a fixed schedule of toileting that was combined with the features of staff education and feedback as well as contingent feedback (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>). The addition of contingent feedback to the fixed schedule raised questions about whether the intervention was therefore consistent with prompted voiding or whether it represented a protocol of timed voiding combined with other features. As the predominant feature was the fixed interval of toileting, we chose the latter interpretation. Conceptual dilemmas such as these highlight the need for a review of current definitions for toileting assistance programs.</P>
<P>Assuming the integrity of current definitions and the differentiation of timed voiding from toileting assistance approaches and/or from bladder training, two trials were identified that met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of these trials was not high. In interpreting the results, several issues need to be borne in mind. These include the fact that the sample size was small in one trial (n = 20) (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>), that both trials were characterised by ambiguity regarding the randomisation process, that blinding associated with allocation, intervention and outcome assessment was unclear and that there were missing data and an absence of intention to treat analyses. These issues raise the possibility that the findings were an overestimation or underestimation.</P>
<P>Timed voiding was identified as just one of a number of strategies in the intervention groups described in the selected trials. It was not possible to conduct sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effect of each of these strategies, hence the extent to which the results reflect the contribution of timed voiding is unknown. It is possible for example that the results obtained in the trial conducted by Smith and colleagues (1992), could reflect the education provided to staff on the technique of transferring participants from bed to bedside commode. Similarly, as participants of the trial conducted by Tobin and Brocklehurst (<LINK REF="STD-Tobin-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tobin 1986</LINK>) were exposed to a medical assessment and to variable forms of medical treatment in addition to a two-hourly toileting regimen, the extent to which the two-hourly toileting contributed to the outcomes is unknown.</P>
<P>In interpreting the results of this review, a number of further limitations should be considered. Cognizant of a previous systematic review having been undertaken on prompted voiding (<LINK REF="REF-Eustice-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eustice 2000</LINK>), this review applied a narrow interpretation to the concept of timed voiding. Hence, the retrieval and selection of trials reflected this interpretation. Furthermore, as with any review, the quality of the data is determined by the quality of the trials that contribute to it. As noted in the critique of the quality of included trials, the reports were characterised by missing or incomplete data and efforts to contact authors to obtain clarification or further data were only partially successful. This review was primarily drawn from publications in English-speaking language journals although one major database of non-English speaking language journals was searched. This yielded one potentially relevant publication (<LINK REF="STD-Kunikata-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kunikata 1993</LINK>). This was subsequently translated, reviewed and relegated to the Table of Excluded Studies. Whilst the search was designed to be as comprehensive and inclusive as possible, nevertheless the potential exists for studies to have been overlooked by virtue of publication bias.</P>
<P>Bearing in mind these limitations, data were insufficient to enable a quantitative estimate of treatment effect and the number of trials was insufficient to examine the effect of differing levels of quality on outcomes. The data were too few and of insufficient quality to provide empirical support for the intervention of timed voiding.<BR/>
</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend timed voiding for the management of urinary incontinence in an adult population.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review makes explicit the gaps in research on toileting assistance programs and confirms observations of a high level of confusion over definitions. The point of differentiation between timed voiding and prompted voiding in particular is ambiguous. There is a critical need for a review of current definitions and of the theoretical assumptions that underpin toileting assistance programs. </P>
<P>Assuming that timed voiding and other toileting assistance programs are mutually exclusive however, there is a need for more comparative studies which use explicit methods of reporting, which recruit larger sample sizes and which aim to minimize bias. These should address the intervention as it applies to variable populations and settings and with variable types of incontinence. Predictors of response need to be identified as does a set of criteria that enables discrimination between those individuals who would best respond to timed voiding from those whose incontinence is best addressed with other approaches, including checking and changing procedures. Finally, further research on toileting assistance programs such as timed voiding should identify the optimal method of delivery and include the range of outcomes sought in this review. </P>
