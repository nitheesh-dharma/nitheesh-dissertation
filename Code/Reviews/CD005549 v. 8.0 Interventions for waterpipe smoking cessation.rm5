<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Waterpipe smoking is a traditional method of tobacco use, especially in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, but its use is now spreading worldwide. It is smoked socially and often shared between friends or family at home, or in bars and cafes that provide waterpipes to patrons. In the absence of relevant data, many waterpipe tobacco smokers believe this form of tobacco use is less lethal and addictive than other methods of tobacco smoking, because the smoke passes through water on its way to the user. At least in some cultures, women and girls are more likely to use a waterpipe than other forms of tobacco, and it is popular among younger smokers. Current evidence suggests that waterpipe smoking may be as addictive as other forms of tobacco use, that some users have difficulty quitting on their own and that they may experience similar risks to health as cigarette smokers.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for controlled trials in the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group specialized register, in June 2015. We also searched a number of electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL, using a variety of names and spellings for waterpipe use ('waterpipe' or 'narghile' or 'arghile' or 'shisha' or 'goza' or 'narkeela' or 'hookah' or 'hubble bubble'). We searched for published and unpublished trials in any language, and especially in areas where waterpipe use is widespread. We identified three studies that tested behavioural methods to help waterpipe smokers to quit. Two were waterpipe-specific interventions and one was a non-specific tobacco intervention.One small, pilot study was set in the USA, and delivered a Powerpoint presentation online to 91 college students who were using waterpipe. One study was a secondary analysis of data from 264 waterpipe smokers who were part of a trial that enrolled people suspected of having tuberculosis from 33 healthcare clinics in Pakistan. Clinics were randomly assigned to deliver a behavioural intervention versus control (usual care), or a behavioural intervention plus medication (bupropion) versus control (usual care). The third study, set in Egypt, targeted both cigarette and waterpipe smokers, and was a community-based programme. </P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>In all three trials, the percentage of participants who stopped smoking waterpipe was higher in the intervention groups than in the control groups, although this was a statistically significant finding in only two of the trials. People who received either behavioural treatment or behavioural treatment plus buproprion were more likely to quit waterpipe smoking at six months follow-up than those who received usual care. Men smoking waterpipe in the Egyptian study were more likely to have quit at one year follow-up in the intervention villages than in the control villages. These studies provide support to suggest that cessation interventions may help waterpipe smokers to quit. However, further larger studies are needed to build on this.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The trials were all rated at very low quality of evidence, as they were relatively small studies, with at least one high risk of bias.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-07-07 08:46:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Waterpipe tobacco smoking is a traditional method of tobacco use, especially in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), but its use is now spreading worldwide. Recent epidemiological data, for example, show that waterpipe smoking has become the most prevalent tobacco use method among adolescents in the EMR, and the second most prevalent in the US. Waterpipes are used socially, often being shared between friends or family at home, or in dedicated bars and cafes that provide waterpipes to patrons. Because the smoke passes through a reservoir of water, waterpipe tobacco smoking is perceived as being less harmful than other methods of tobacco use. At least in some cultures, women and girls are more likely to use a waterpipe than to use other forms of tobacco, and it is popular among younger smokers. Accumulating evidence suggests that some waterpipe smokers become addicted, have difficulty quitting, and experience similar health risks as cigarette smokers.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-07-07 08:48:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group specialized register in June 2015. We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL , using variant terms and spellings ('waterpipe' or 'narghile' or 'arghile' or 'shisha' or 'goza' or 'narkeela' or 'hookah' or 'hubble bubble'). We searched for trials, published or unpublished, in any language, and especially in regions where waterpipe use is widespread.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-07-07 08:48:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We sought randomized, quasi-randomized or cluster-randomized controlled trials of smoking cessation interventions for waterpipe smokers of any age or gender. The primary outcome of interest was abstinence from tobacco use, measured at six months post-cessation or longer, regardless of whether abstinence was biochemically verified. We included interventions that were pharmacological (for example, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion) or behavioural, or both, and could be directed at individual waterpipe users or at groups of users. We only included tobacco cessation interventions, and did not consider trials of prevention of uptake.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-07-07 08:53:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors assessed abstracts of the studies retrieved by the search strategy, for possible inclusion in the review. We retrieved full-text articles for all abstracts that any of the authors believed might be suitable. Two review authors then extracted data and assessed trial quality independently in accordance with standard Cochrane Collaboration methodologies. We aimed to pool groups of studies that we considered to be sufficiently similar, provided there was no evidence of substantial statistical heterogeneity, and aimed to estimate a pooled risk ratio (RR) using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method. Where meta-analysis was not possible, we presented summary and descriptive statistics.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-14 10:22:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our search retrieved 1311 unique citations, of which 1289 were excluded after title and abstract screening. Of the remaining 22, we excluded 19 because they were empirical studies that were not randomized, quasi-randomized or cluster-randomized controlled trials (n = 12), because they were review articles (n = 3), because they described protocols only (n = 2), they were conducted among cigarette smokers only (n = 1), or they had only a three-month follow-up (n = 1).</P>
<P>We identified three controlled trials which tested cessation interventions for waterpipe smokers. Studies were carried out in Egypt (Mohlman 2013), Pakistan (Dogar 2014), and the US (Lipkus 2011). One was a randomized controlled trial and two were cluster-randomized trials. Two studies tested individual-level interventions, and one tested a community-level intervention. Two studies included only behavioural interventions, and one study (Dogar 2014) included two intervention groups: one behavioural, and the other behavioural with bupropion. The Lipkus and Mohlman studies delivered waterpipe-specific interventions, and the Dogar study delivered a non-specific tobacco intervention. Due to study variation we did not pool results, and intervention effects are reported descriptively. Compared to control groups, waterpipe smoking cessation rates were higher in the intervention groups in all three studies, with a significant difference in two studies. For the Dogar study, the RRs for waterpipe smoking abstinence at 25 weeks among waterpipe-only smokers were 2.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 3.8; 180 participants) in the behavioural group, and 2.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 4.7; 84 participants) in the behavioural plus bupropion group. In our analysis we have combined both groups, to give a RR of 2.28 (95% CI 1.36 to 3.83; 200 participants). The Mohlman study delivered a RR in male waterpipe-smokers at one year in favour of the intervention of 3.25 (95% CI 1.19 to 8.89).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-07-14 10:23:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the literature on waterpipe cessation interventions remains sparse, the reviewed studies provide a basis for developing interventions in this area. The lack of statistically significant effects in one of the three studies is not unexpected, given the small and pilot nature of the studies. The studies highlight important design and content issues that need to be considered for future cessation trials in waterpipe smokers. These include building on the vast experience developed in the study of smoking cessation interventions in cigarette smokers, whilst including components and assessment tools that address the specific aspects of waterpipe smoking, such as its social dimension, unique experiences, and cues.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2015-07-22 13:47:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-07-07 10:22:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Estimates suggest that by 2030 there will be more than 10 million tobacco-related deaths a year worldwide, with 70% of them occurring in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Peto-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peto 2001</LINK>). Patterns of tobacco usage and uptake are of increasing concern, as the tobacco industry concentrates its marketing in developing countries, paying particular attention to women and girls and to a wide range of tobacco products (<LINK REF="REF-GYTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">GYTS 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>One traditional method of smoking tobacco, especially in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), is the waterpipe, in which smoke passes through a reservoir of water before inhalation by the smoker. The waterpipe, known as narjeela in formal Arabic, goes by various local names such as <I>shisha</I>, <I>narghile</I>, <I>arghile, and hookah</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Maziak-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maziak 2004</LINK>). Although waterpipe use was uncommon in most of the world before the 1990s, it has enjoyed a recent resurgence, and is now spreading into areas where there was no previous tradition of use (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2015</LINK>). In most countries of the EMR, waterpipe smoking has become the most common tobacco use method among youth, and the trend is spreading to other world regions such as the US, where waterpipe smoking became the second most popular tobacco use method among college, high-, and middle-school students (<LINK REF="REF-Arrazola-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrazola 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maziak-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maziak 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Primack-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Primack 2009</LINK>). While solitary waterpipe use is quite common, waterpipe use is predominantly a social phenomenon, occurring among friends or family, and often in dedicated cafés and bars (<LINK REF="REF-Akl-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akl 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martinasek-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinasek 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is hard to establish all of the potential factors responsible for the global spread of an addictive behaviour such as waterpipe smoking. An addictive behaviour will tend to spread gradually unless it is countered by effective policies and regulations. It is believed that the resurgence in the popularity of waterpipe was sparked by the introduction of flavoured, sweetened tobacco called Maassel in the Middle East during the early 1990s, whilst the global economy, advancements in communication and social media, emigration and tourism have helped to spread the practice globally (<LINK REF="REF-Maziak-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maziak 2015</LINK>). The lack of effective policies to deal with this relatively new trend is certainly contributing to the vacuum within which this tobacco use method is allowed to thrive (<LINK REF="REF-Jawad-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jawad 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many waterpipe smokers believe that waterpipe smoking is a safer alternative to cigarettes; an apparent misperception given the available evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Akl-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akl 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Asfar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asfar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Zaatari-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Zaatari 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martinasek-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinasek 2011</LINK>). This evidence demonstrates the wide-ranging potential harm of waterpipe smoking, as well as its addictive nature (<LINK REF="REF-Aboaziza-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aboaziza 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Zaatari-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Zaatari 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shihadeh-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shihadeh 2015</LINK>). Many waterpipe users become dependent, evidenced by urges to smoke waterpipe and other withdrawal symptoms when they abstain, relief of these symptoms when they smoke waterpipe, and difficulty in quitting (<LINK REF="REF-Aboaziza-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aboaziza 2015</LINK>). Several studies have reported that between 25% and 64% of waterpipe users want to quit (<LINK REF="REF-Akl-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akl 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anjum-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anjum 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2005</LINK>) and that at least 25% make a quit attempt in any given year (<LINK REF="REF-Anjum-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anjum 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2006</LINK>). Quit rates, however, are very low (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most identified behavioural association with waterpipe smoking is cigarette smoking. Many studies from around the world have documented the salience of cigarette smoking among waterpipe smokers, and cigarette smoking has been shown to be a major predictor of waterpipe smoking among youth. In the US Monitoring the Future survey, waterpipe use among high-school seniors was associated with current and former cigarette smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Maziak-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maziak 2015</LINK>). Dual smoking, however, tends to decrease with age, as older smokers are usually more loyal to a single tobacco use method. For example, in a study alluded to earlier, comparing novice with established waterpipe smokers in Syria, the prevalence of dual smoking was 47.7% for novice smokers compared to 26.5% for established ones (<LINK REF="REF-Maziak-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maziak 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the global increase in waterpipe smoking, and evidence that many users become dependent and have difficulty quitting on their own, waterpipe-specific tobacco cessation interventions are required. This review aims to summarize the evidence available regarding smoking cessation interventions for waterpipe smokers.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group specialized register for trials, using the terms 'waterpipe' or 'narghile' or 'arghile' or 'shisha' or 'goza' or 'narkeela' or 'hookah' or 'hubble bubble', plus variant spellings of these terms, and 'smoking' in the title or abstract, or as keywords. This register was developed from electronic searching of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO, together with handsearching of specialist journals, conference proceedings and reference lists of previous trials and overviews. We also searched MEDLINE (1946 to present), EMBASE (1980 to present), CINAHL (1981 to present) and PsycINFO (1806 to present), using the above free-text terms combined with MeSH or free-text smoking-related terms (smok* or tobacco or cigar* or nicotine). We searched for trials, published or unpublished, in any language, and especially in regions where waterpipe use is widespread. We also used our existing bibliography, compiled from earlier exhaustive reviews of the literature on waterpipe smoking (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Aboaziza-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aboaziza 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Zaatari-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Zaatari 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jawad-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jawad 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maziak-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maziak 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maziak-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maziak 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shihadeh-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shihadeh 2015</LINK>).

<BR/>We aimed to pool groups of studies that we considered to be sufficiently similar in their interventions, comparison groups, setting and participants, provided that there was no evidence of substantial statistical heterogeneity as assessed by the I² statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). We aimed to estimate a pooled risk ratio (RR) using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method, based on the quit rates at longest follow-up for trials with at least six months follow-up from the start of the intervention. Where meta-analysis was not possible, we present a descriptive summary and descriptive statistics.</P>

<P>Our search retrieved 1311 unique citations, of which 1289 were excluded after title and abstract screening. Of the remaining 22, we excluded 19 for the following reasons: they were non-randomized studies (n = 12), review articles (n = 3), a protocol only (n = 2), conducted among cigarette smokers only (n = 1), or had only a three-month follow-up (n = 1). The flow of studies is illustrated in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>We identified three eligible studies which tested cessation interventions for waterpipe smokers. One was a randomized controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK>) and two were cluster-randomized trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohlman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mohlman 2013</LINK>). Two were individual-level interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK>) and one was a community-level intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Mohlman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mohlman 2013</LINK>). Interventions were carried out in Egypt (<LINK REF="STD-Mohlman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mohlman 2013</LINK>), Pakistan (<LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>), and the US (<LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK>). All interventions were behavioural interventions, although one study included two intervention groups: one behavioural, and the other behavioural with bupropion (<LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>). One study was based on a theoretical framework (<LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>). Further characteristics of included studies can be found in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>The first study took place in Pakistan between 2010 and 2011 and was a three-arm, cluster-randomized non-inferiority trial among a mix of cigarette-only smokers (n = 1181), waterpipe-only smokers (n = 200) and mixed smokers (n = 460) (<LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>). The three arms were standard care (control group), a brief behavioural intervention (BSS) and a brief behavioural intervention plus bupropion for seven weeks (BSS+). The behavioural intervention was adapted from evidence-based treatments used for cigarette smokers and involved two structured sessions (the first 30 minutes long, the second 10 minutes long) one week apart. It was delivered by tuberculosis DOTS (directly observed treatment, short course) paramedics. The bupropion regimen was 75 mg/day for the first week and 150 mg/day for the next six weeks. The control group received a leaflet with standard health messages about the harms of tobacco. The clusters were primary and secondary healthcare centres registered as diagnostic centres by a tuberculosis programme. The study authors adjusted for the effect of clustering by conducting a multi-level analysis. The study was funded by the International Development Research Centre, Canada.</P>
<P>The second study took place in the US between 2009 and 2010, and was a randomized controlled web-based intervention among waterpipe smoking college/university students (<LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK>). Ninety-one students were randomized to non-health-related information about waterpipe (control group) or to both non-health-related and health-related information about waterpipe (intervention group). The study was funded by grants from the US National Cancer Institute and National Institute on Drug Abuse.</P>
<P>The final study took place in Egypt between 2004 and 2005, and was a cluster-randomized controlled community-level intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Mohlman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mohlman 2013</LINK>). The clusters were villages in the Qalyubia governorate. Villages, with a total of 7657 participants, were randomised to receive a behavioural intervention through a variety of activities engaging school students, places of worship, and adult women, and delivered by teachers, religious leaders and female social-change agents respectively. Primary school students partook in activities to prevent the initiation of tobacco use through its deglamorisation and teaching of health effects. Preparatory and secondary school students were taught social skills to handle peer pressure to smoke. Religious communities were informed of the health effects of tobacco use/secondhand smoke, and the sinful nature of smoking. Adult women at home were taught about the health effects of tobacco use/secondhand smoke and how to protect themselves and their children from it in a culture-specific way. Control villages received no intervention but had access to Egypt's National Tobacco Control Program during the study. The study authors adjusted for the effect of clustering in the analysis. The study was funded by The Fogarty International Center of the US National Institutes of Health.</P>
<P>Studies were not comparable in terms of participants' smoking status, intervention type, and outcome measures. For example, participants in <LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK> smoked a local form of unflavoured waterpipe tobacco a median of 10 times per day, participants in <LINK REF="STD-Mohlman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mohlman 2013</LINK> smoked two to three times per day, and participants in <LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK> smoked flavoured Maassel monthly. With regards to the delivery method of interventions, one study provided a web-based intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK>), one provided group intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Mohlman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mohlman 2013</LINK>), and one provided interventions aimed at individuals (<LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>). With regards to outcomes, only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>) biochemically validated abstinence by expired carbon monoxide (CO <U>&lt; </U>9 ppm), while the remaining two trials relied on only self report of smoking status (<LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohlman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mohlman 2013</LINK>). Follow-up length ranged from six months to one year post-intervention.</P>

<P>We considered two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK>) to be at low risk of bias for random sequence generation as they adequately described a simple randomization process. <LINK REF="STD-Mohlman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mohlman 2013</LINK> used a randomized design but the details were not reported. We deemed only one study to be at low risk of bias for adequate allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>) as it was concealed by a researcher blinded to centre identity. The remaining two studies did not provide information on allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohlman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mohlman 2013</LINK>). We rated none of the studies at low risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel; <LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK> was an open-label trial, while in <LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mohlman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mohlman 2013</LINK> blinding was not mentioned. Although none of the studies reported the presence of blinding, we considered one study (<LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>) to be at low risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessment, as it was biochemically verified with a carbon monoxide measurement of 9 ppm or less. We rated all three at low risk of bias for completeness of data, as missing data ranged from 7% (<LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>) to 23% (<LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mohlman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mohlman 2013</LINK> excluded women from the dataset because smoking prevalence was very low in this group. No studies were at low risk of bias for selective reporting. In <LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK> outcomes at five weeks were not reported, whereas in <LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mohlman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mohlman 2013</LINK> cessation data were not reported using appropriate effect estimates.

<P>Due to the variation in studies outlined above, we did not pool the results of studies using meta-analysis or conduct statistical tests for heterogeneity. We report the intervention effects descriptively and present abstinence data for individual trials in <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK> we considered the data provided by waterpipe smokers only (n = 200). Compared to the control group, the risk ratio (RR) of smoking abstinence at 25 weeks was 2.2 (95% CI 1.3 to 3.8) for the BSS group and 2.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 4.7) for the BSS+ group. In <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> we have combined the BSS and BSS+ groups to create a single intervention group.</P>
<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK>, when comparing the intervention to the control group, the RR for waterpipe cessation at six months was 1.46 (95% CI 0.81 to 2.62; n = 70).</P>
<P>For the third study (<LINK REF="STD-Mohlman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mohlman 2013</LINK>), the RR of waterpipe cessation at one year was 3.25 (95% CI 1.19 to 8.89; n = 540) for the intervention group compared to the control group.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-07-22 13:47:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Waterpipe use is a growing phenomenon associated with substantial toxicant exposure, numerous health risks, and development of dependence in a sizeable proportion of users (<LINK REF="REF-Aboaziza-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aboaziza 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Zaatari-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Zaatari 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maziak-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maziak 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shihadeh-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shihadeh 2015</LINK>). Despite these adverse consequences, development and evaluation of cessation interventions for the waterpipe are scarce. In our review, we found only three studies which met our inclusion criteria, covering 831 participants, that have examined interventions to help waterpipe users quit smoking. All three studies tested behavioural interventions, and one study also included a combined behavioural/pharmacological (bupropion) intervention group (<LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>). Due to lack of comparability across the three studies in terms of participants&#8217; smoking status, intervention type, and outcome assessment, we did not conduct statistical tests for heterogeneity and meta-analysis, but present intervention effects descriptively. Two trials were conducted among adults in the Middle East (<LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohlman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mohlman 2013</LINK>), and one study was conducted among young adults in the US (<LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK>). This should be considered for the generalizability of findings from these studies. Compared to control groups, smoking cessation rates were higher in the intervention groups in all three studies; however, the difference was not statistically significant in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK>). These findings suggest that waterpipe smokers may be more likely to stop smoking successfully when using a community or a tailored smoking cessation intervention than usual care; however they should be treated with caution due to the paucity and limitations of the available data.</P>
<P>The lack of a statistically significant effect in the American trial is not unexpected, given the small, pilot nature of the study. A Cochrane review of individual behavioural interventions for cigarette smoking cessation demonstrated an RR of 1.39 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.57) (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2005</LINK>). At least two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK>) were unlikely to have the power to detect a comparable RR. Suboptimal length of follow-up (less than one year) was another limitation for two of the three included studies, as well as a reliance on self-reported data in all but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>). Abstinence verification methods should also be suitable for waterpipe smoking. Expired breath CO, which is good for the detection of smoking in the past 24 hours only, may not accurately verify abstinence in intermittent waterpipe smokers, but can be used as a 'bogus pipeline' (<LINK REF="STD-Asfar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Asfar 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patrick-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrick 1994</LINK>) to encourage truthful reporting of abstinence violations among intermittent users. The absence of standard definitions for waterpipe smoking status for inclusion in the trials was also an issue that affected comparability of the reviewed studies. For example, two of the reviewed studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohlman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mohlman 2013</LINK>) recruited current waterpipe smokers who smoked waterpipe in the past month, and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>) recruited regular waterpipe smokers who &#8220;smoke &gt;= 1 waterpipe per day.&#8221; Cigarette cessation trials typically enrol daily smokers and outcome evaluation is often focused on whether participants have returned to daily smoking. We noted the same inconsistency for the definition and verification of abstinence in the three studies. In <LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>, the primary outcome was continuous abstinence at six-month follow-up, while in <LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK> abstinence was defined as reporting no longer using waterpipe at the six-month follow-up, and finally, in <LINK REF="STD-Mohlman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mohlman 2013</LINK> abstinence was defined as not smoking waterpipe in the last month before the 12-month follow-up. Not only are these outcomes hard to compare, they are not consistent with the relevant scientific recommendations for cessation trials and with common patterns of waterpipe smoking. Because many waterpipe smokers are cigarette smokers as well, cessation outcomes should be standardised to allow comparison with the cigarette literature as well as to accommodate waterpipe smokers&#8217; usage patterns. For example, the definition of <I>prolonged abstinence</I> defined as; no smoking, not even a puff, after a grace period of two weeks after quit date, and relapse as smoking at least once a week on two consecutive weeks (<LINK REF="REF-SRNT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">SRNT 2002</LINK>), are standard cigarette-based definitions that would seem to be suitable for waterpipe.</P>
<P>Out of the three included studies, only one evaluated a combined intervention (behavioural plus bupropion), and did not show any apparent additional benefit of adding bupropion to behavioural support in achieving cessation (<LINK REF="STD-Dogar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dogar 2014</LINK>), although these two conditions were not directly tested against one another. The efficacy of other pharmacological cessation modalities such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or varenicline, which have been shown to be useful in dependent cigarette smokers, have not yet been tested in waterpipe smokers. Given that some waterpipe smokers exhibit signs and symptoms of dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Aboaziza-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aboaziza 2015</LINK>), pharmacotherapy may be useful during cessation. This can be particularly relevant to highly quit-motivated dual waterpipe/cigarette users (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2014</LINK>). However, individuals who are less dependent, have smoked for shorter periods of times, and who cite social stigma (e.g. family disapproval) as a reason to stop smoking make up the majority of waterpipe smokers interested in quitting (<LINK REF="REF-Borgan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borgan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2005</LINK>). These individuals may be less likely to benefit from pharmacological treatments. Such considerations require having some standard, waterpipe-specific measure of dependence that allows for the variability in both individual smoking habits and nicotine content of different waterpipe tobacco brands to be captured in a standardized manner. A recently developed scale (Lebanon Waterpipe Dependence Scale-11) to characterize waterpipe dependence has shown that self-reported dependence level correlates with measurements of nicotine metabolites in flavoured waterpipe tobacco users (<LINK REF="REF-Salameh-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salameh 2008</LINK>). This measure was developed based on cigarette smoking instruments and without input from waterpipe smokers, but could be the first step in accurately measuring dependence among waterpipe smokers.</P>
<P>Offering behavioural support adapted from a validated cigarette-smoking cessation programme could be a useful starting point for waterpipe smokers who are interested in quitting. Of the three studies reviewed, two offered behavioural interventions utilizing similar strategies to those shown to be effective for cigarette smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohlman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mohlman 2013</LINK>). Process evaluation data from one of our excluded studies (<LINK REF="STD-Asfar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Asfar 2014</LINK>) indicates that the methods they used, which were adapted from traditional smoking cessation methods, were acceptable to waterpipe smokers. However, such approaches will miss dealing with the strong social dimension of waterpipe use, as it shapes use patterns, cues for smoking, and the attitudes and preferences of waterpipe smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Aboaziza-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aboaziza 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jawad-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jawad 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maziak-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maziak 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Risks associated with the social use of waterpipe, such as the potential to contract infectious diseases through sharing the same waterpipe and using it repeatedly without proper sanitation in café settings, can also provide powerful drives for cessation. Future cessation efforts should consider introducing and examining new methods of cessation intervention, such as group smoking cessation. Results from the process evaluation in <LINK REF="STD-Asfar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Asfar 2014</LINK> indicate that one-third of waterpipe smokers were interested in participating in a group counselling intervention. As the social context of waterpipe smoking frequently involves family members (<LINK REF="REF-Akl-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akl 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maziak-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maziak 2015</LINK>), family-based cessation interventions could also be a promising avenue to pursue (<LINK REF="STD-Asfar-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Asfar 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the fact that the waterpipe epidemic is most pronounced among youth and young adults (such as college students), only one of the three reviewed studies was conducted among college students. The study provided preliminary evidence that minimally intensive interventions delivered online to educate college waterpipe smokers of the harm, addiction, and toxicant exposure associated with waterpipe smoking can increase understanding of the harms of waterpipe use, perceptions of risk, desire to quit, and eventually cessation (<LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 2011</LINK>). Utilizing youth-oriented technology such as smart phones, text messaging, social networks, or multimedia may provide promising cessation approaches for this at-risk population.</P>
<P>Although the small number and methodological limitations of waterpipe cessation trials to date do not allow firm recommendations to be made on the comparative efficacy of various cessation methods, they do provide a new evidence base on which to build further. They highlight important design and content issues that need to be considered for future cessation trials in waterpipe smokers. These include building on the vast experience of cigarette smoking cessation interventions whilst introducing intervention components and assessment tools that address the specific aspects of waterpipe smoking. It also highlights some of the challenges of future waterpipe cessation trials that relate to their specific set-up, usage patterns and context, and adaptability of cigarette-based definitions and measures to the waterpipe.</P>

<LI>Waterpipe smoking is spreading globally, and carries considerable health risks. Due to its addictive nature, waterpipe users who want to quit find it difficult to do so. This review suggests that waterpipe smokers may be more likely to stop smoking successfully when using a smoking cessation intervention than usual care, but this needs to be treated with caution due to the paucity and limitations of the data. Relying on behavioural cessation approaches from the cigarette literature seems to be a good starting point, but these should be adapted to the specific nature of waterpipe smoking as a predominantly social and intermittent behaviour with prolonged sessions. Adding a pharmacological agent (bupropion) did not seem to have an additional benefit to behavioural support in achieving cessation, again based on the limited data available. </LI>

<UL>
<LI>Standard definitions and assessments of waterpipe use, dependence and cessation need to be adopted. For example, including smokers with &#8220;regular&#8221; waterpipe use, defined as smoking three or more waterpipes a week, in smoking cessation trials, will allow smoking cessation efforts to focus on those most in need (most dependent), and at the same time allow the use of standard cigarette-based definitions and verification of abstinence (e.g. prolonged abstinence; saliva cotinine). Since cotinine offers a window of four to five days for detection of nicotine exposure, less frequent waterpipe smoking/abstinence can be hard to verify biochemically. Most of these definitions are already developed and need to be adopted by waterpipe cessation research (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Jarvis-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvis 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SRNT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">SRNT 2002</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>As waterpipe cessation trials are still in their infancy, it will be helpful to develop and adopt consistent standards for reporting outcomes to facilitate comparing study results (e.g. standard definition of regular smoker, definition of abstinence including duration, self report, and cut-off point of various biochemical verification procedures).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Since many waterpipe smokers are cigarette smokers as well, such measures need to be consistent with the cigarette literature and at the same time accommodate waterpipe smokers&#8217; intermittent usage patterns.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Waterpipe dependence measures need to be developed and adopted that can capture the common as well as unique (e.g. social dimension) aspects of tobacco dependence in waterpipe smokers.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Efforts to develop and test behavioural strategies that fit the unique features of waterpipe smoking (e.g. the social cues, and intermittent usage patterns) and address waterpipe-specific facilitators and barriers to quitting are much needed (<LINK REF="REF-Maziak-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maziak 2015</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Given how little is currently known about who will use cessation treatment, which treatments they will use, and what specific methods work, it is imperative that large-scale, randomized controlled trials be conducted to rigorously test behavioural, pharmacological and combined cessation approaches.</LI>
