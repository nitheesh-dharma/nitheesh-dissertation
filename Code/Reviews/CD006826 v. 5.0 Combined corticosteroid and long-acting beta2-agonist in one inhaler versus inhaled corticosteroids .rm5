Looks like it's had a total revamp. So going from the top, there are a few minor things I have changed - some left in tracked changes - so have a look and double check they are correct and accept unless unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Outcomes - it is OK to say &amp;quot;bad days&amp;quot;? I think we normally have number of days (or nights) experiencing symptoms Done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Table 1 - to save us the headache of the reader working out what version, I added 'present version'. I think this is clear and can be changed if/when the review is updated Agree&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;more and more we realise how fab tables are. I suggest you make a table to summarise the characteristic of the studies with the headings - number participants; duration; intervention; and anything you consider to be relevant (don't go over about 7 headings otherwise the tables come out poorly when published) Done &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incomplete outcome data bias - can you say why some trials you gave high and some unclear? Did you dichotomise based on the percentage of withdrawals? Was there a difference between the short and long term (over 6 month) studies? Done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Figure 1 is a result and should not be presented among the methods. Move it to the results (as you are not supposed to put stuff in the discussion that wasn't covered in the results) and mention in &amp;quot;overall completeness and applicability of the evidence&amp;quot; Done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can you delete all the notes you made to each other some time before publication please (but leave this note!!) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Table 3 - check my definition of NNT in the footnotes Agree. Done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;can you add the abbreviations to the footnotes under characteristics of included studies Done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ratio of exacerbations. The paragraph states that 1.1 is exacerbations requiring OCS - if that is the case can you change the label on the data and analyses to indicate this. Can you carefully go through the labels on the forest plots and double-check they are accurate and the same as those in the text.Done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mistake on one of the analyses - please check - it's highlighted Agree&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm not that keen on the word 'superiority' used to describe FEV1. Can you keep it simple and say there was a significant difference in change from baseline scores favouring FPS? Agree. Done. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;adverse events - you fell into the trap of reporting only the significant difference for the BDP comparison!! needs correction! Done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data and analyses &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;delete the subgroups without data e.g. 1.1.3 Done for 2,3&amp;amp;4, although SM and CC advise leaving all the subgroups in the Primary outcome to make it clear that there was no data for some of the outcomes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are quite a few forest plots for adverse events and Chris and I are not sure that the subgroups are particularly helpful. What I recommend that you do is dismantle the subgroups, then (keeping your 'serious adverse events' one its own forest plot) group the specific adverse events (2.21-2.31, 3.22-3.37, 4.12-4.28) on one forest plot, with 'any adverse event' at the top, but subgrouped by adverse event. This will give the reader a quick overview of all the adverse events on one plot. Done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The total in 2.2 and subgroup total in 1.2.1 should match? unless the titles of the graphs are wrong? can you investigate and make it clearer in the text Done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am a little worried about repetition of data in places. I know that the reason it's laid out like this is because of how it was done in the original review, but do wonder whether the additional forest plots to get the partially reversible/poorly reversible or unclear is worth it. Make sure that somewhere in the text you explain how you grouped - and what is the difference between partially and poorly reversible? Explanation is in the Methods section under subheading 'Subgroup analysis and Investigation of heterogeneity'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder whether you would be better off grouping withdrawals on the same forest plot (e.g. setting up a 1.6). Or even reporting in a table as you have more information about some studies than others? Just a thought, might not be worth it if you don't have time. Leave as is as d/w SM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the first bit of the discussion should be the summary of main results - I think what you have is fine for that, so I copied it down. you might want to integrate the highlighted paragraph below into the text though! Agree, done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You might want to reconsider the paragraph under agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews. The review you cite is the vs placebo one, but that is not that clear in the text. That review is the one being updated by Becky and Becca, so we are going to have to think strategy about making sure that the correct data is cited in this review before publication. Done by LN&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a single inhaler does not guarantee that people get both medications - it may make it more likely. Especially if they feel the benefit of taking the LABA - but they are also getting ICS whereas this ICS in a separate inhaler might not be taken as regularly if it doesn't give an immediate benefit &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary of findings table&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would delete the 'moderate' group unless this has a specific meaning for the review (if it does have a specific meaning, please explin in the comments/footnotes) Done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would only have the one SOF table and write anything striking about subgroups in the comments box for the relevant outcome. I;ve discussed this with Chris and he's happy to talk this through with you Done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suggest adding QoL and adverse event so the table - even if they are described narratively &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 8th 2013. CJC added section on NNT calculation to methodology and citations to Visual Rx and Thorax editorial (online).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Chris or Steve how should be calculated pneumonia risk per patient per year for the last paragraph in Discussion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2013 Jan 2LJNannini. Steve: The total pneumonia events in arm combined therapy in TORCH was 303 and not 207; and ICS arm total pneumonia events 185 instead of 3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve I need the final results to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Aug 22nd&lt;br&gt;Thanks Toby. This has been spell checked and can now be submitted. I have added the Tristan NNT to contrast to the TORCH NNT for balance. I also spotted some text relating to SAL and PLA which I have removed.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;CJC Edit 21 Aug 2007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby I have used track changes, please check and accept unless unhappy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have reordered the outcomes to put the primary outcomes for both inhaler types first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IS table 2 meant to be there? please change this to mortality. Can you add NNT to the results (3yr for TORCH)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DoH funding needs to be acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to Toby for NNT tables. This might then get on the module as Peer Review of combined review covers the important issues here.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2014-06-04 13:52:54 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="CCB2-COP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.2.7 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="5.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-28 16:07:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Combinations of two classes of medication (long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (LABAs) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)) in one inhaler have been developed to treat people with COPD, as this may make it easier to take the medication. Three brands of combined inhaler are currently available: budesonide/formoterol (BDF&#65293;'Symbicort'), fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FPS&#65293;'Advair' or 'Seretide') and mometasone furoate/formoterol (MF/F&#65293;'Dulera'). Both the ICS part and the LABA component of each inhaler are aimed at reducing flare-ups of COPD, which can be debilitating and costly. In addition, the LABA component may improve day-to-day symptoms such as breathlessness and exercise tolerance.</P>
<P>Our review found 15 studies that compared a combination of ICS/LABA with ICS alone. We found that on the whole, combination inhalers reduced the frequency of flare-ups (not including hospitalisations) compared with ICS alone. The studies showed that on average, the number of exacerbations per participant was reduced, as was the probability of death, during treatment. Quality of life and lung function showed improvement with combination treatment compared with ICS, but no difference between them was noted in terms of adverse effects, or the likelihood of having no flare-ups at all. Future research should assess the efficacy of BDF and MF/F because most evidence gathered to date, including for mortality, has been drawn from FPS studies.<B>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-28 16:07:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luis J Nannini">
<P>Both long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids have been recommended in guidelines for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Their co-administration in a combined inhaler is intended to facilitate adherence to medication regimens and to improve efficacy. Three preparations are currently available: fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FPS). budesonide/formoterol (BDF) and mometasone furoate/formoterol (MF/F).</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-08-28 16:07:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the efficacy and safety of combined long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid (LABA/ICS) preparations, as measured by clinical endpoints and pulmonary function testing, compared with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) alone, in the treatment of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-08-02 12:10:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, which is compiled from systematic searches of multiple literature databases. The search was conducted in June 2013. In addition, we checked the reference lists of included studies and contacted the relevant manufacturers.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-08-28 13:37:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies were included if they were randomised and double-blind. Compared studies combined LABA/ICS with the ICS component.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-08-28 16:07:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcomes were exacerbations, mortality and pneumonia. Health-related quality of life (as measured by validated scales), lung function and side effects were secondary outcomes. Dichotomous data were analysed as fixed-effect odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and continuous data as mean differences or rate ratios and 95% CIs.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-29 12:12:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 15 studies of good methodological quality met the inclusion criteria by randomly assigning 7814 participants with predominantly poorly reversible, severe COPD. Data were most plentiful for the FPS combination. Exacerbation rates were significantly reduced with combination therapies (rate ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.94, 6 studies, N = 5601) compared with ICS alone. The mean exacerbation rate in the control (ICS) arms of the six included studies was 1.21 exacerbations per participant per year (range 0.88 to 1.60), and we would expect this to be reduced to a rate of 1.05<B> </B>(95% CI 0.97 to 1.14) among those given combination therapy. Mortality was also lower with the combination (odds ratio (OR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.94, 12 studies, N = 7518) than with ICS alone, but this was heavily weighted by a three-year study of FPS. When this study was removed, no significant mortality difference was noted. The reduction in exacerbations did not translate into significantly reduced rates of hospitalisation due to COPD exacerbation (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07, 10 studies, N = 7060). Lung function data favoured combination treatment in the FPS, BDF and MF/F trials, but the improvement was small. Small improvements in health-related quality of life were measured on the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) with FPS or BDF compared with ICS, but this was well below the minimum clinically important difference. Adverse event profiles were similar between the two treatments arms, and rates of pneumonia when it was diagnosed by chest x-ray (CXR) were lower than those reported in earlier trials.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-08-28 16:07:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Combination ICS and LABA offer some clinical benefits in COPD compared with ICS alone, especially for reduction in exacerbations. This review does not support the use of ICS alone when LABAs are available. Adverse events were not significantly different between treatments. Further long-term assessments using practical outcomes of current and new 24-hour LABAs will help determine their efficacy and safety. For robust comparisons as to their relative effects, long-term head-to-head comparisons are needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-28 16:07:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-08-28 16:07:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently the fourth leading cause of death in most industrialised countries but is projected to be the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020 (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2011</LINK>). An estimated three million people are affected by COPD in the UK alone (<LINK REF="REF-NCGC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCGC 2010</LINK>). In the most recent global guidelines, COPD is defined as "a common preventable and treatable disease, characterised by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lung to noxious particles or gases. Exacerbations and co-morbidities contribute to the overall severity in individual patients" (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The disease is caused predominantly by smoking. Smoke and other irritants trigger airway inflammation (i.e. bronchial infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes and mast cells and increasing evidence of autoimmunity) (<LINK REF="REF-Cosio-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cosio 2009</LINK>). As a result, patients generally show progressive loss of lung function, accompanied by worsening respiratory symptoms, more frequent exacerbations and deterioration in health status (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2011</LINK>]. In addition to these effects on patients, exacerbations are costly to the healthcare system.</P>
<P>All cases of COPD are characterised by airway obstruction, which is defined as a reduced post-bronchodilator lung function ratio (forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>)/forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt; 0.7), but in reality, COPD is a heterogeneous syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2011</LINK>). It has been suggested that some phenotypes of COPD involved more chronic systemic inflammation, which has an impact on co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Aymerich-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Aymerich 2011</LINK>). Some patients deteriorate more quickly than others, and variability in the degree of airways reversibility exhibited to bronchodilators has been noted. Previously, COPD severity was defined solely by FEV<SUB>1</SUB> % predicted compared with normal. The most recent definition grades severity of COPD using a combination of symptoms, lung function and number of exacerbations per year (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>All patients with COPD should be considered for smoking cessation interventions, pulmonary rehabilitation, annual influenza vaccination and five-yearly pneumococcal vaccination (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2011</LINK>). Smoking cessation is the only intervention that slows the decline in lung function (<LINK REF="REF-Kohansal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kohansal 2009</LINK>). In the absence of a significant disease-modifying effect, use of medication in COPD is largely guided by patient symptoms and exacerbation frequency. An increasing array of medicines are used in COPD, both alone and in combination. Some of these medicines are relatively expensive, so it is important to assess their relative benefits, so as to guide rational usage. It should be noted that in the decades to come, a disproportionate burden of the costs of COPD will be borne by developing countries, where smoking rates, and thus COPD prevalence, remain high.</P>
<P>Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (LABAs) and long-acting anti-muscarinic agents (LAMAs) have been shown to be effective for some clinical outcomes in COPD, such as symptoms, exercise tolerance, quality of life and exacerbations.</P>
<P>Use of ICS may be associated with short-term increases in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and significant reduction in exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2012</LINK>). On the other hand, use of ICS has been associated with an increase in the number of cases of pneumonia (<LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2011</LINK>) and of other adverse outcomes such as hoarseness and oral candidiasis. <LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2011</LINK> recommended that ICS should be used in patients with an FEV<SUB>1</SUB> &lt; 50% predicted (GOLD stages 3 and 4 or quadrant C and D) and a history of &#8805; 2 exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2011</LINK>). National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines have recommended adding a LABA (or LAMA) to an ICS in a combination inhaler, if FEV<SUB>1</SUB> is &lt; 50% predicted. NICE has also recommended use of a combined LABA/ICS inhaler in people with stable COPD with an FEV<SUB>1</SUB> &#8805; 50% who remain breathless or have exacerbations despite maintenance therapy with a LABA (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2011</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-08-28 13:42:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The two medicines of interest in this review are LABAs and ICS, with a particular focus on the comparison between use of a combination inhaler of LABA and ICS versus ICS alone. These medicines are taken by inhaler twice a day.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-08-28 13:42:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both ICS and LABA components have been shown to prevent some COPD exacerbations and to improve health-related quality of life. LABAs also improve symptoms and exercise tolerance (<LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2006</LINK>). Inhaled corticosteroids reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2012</LINK>) but have not yet been shown to slow disease progression or improve mortality rates (<LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK>). It is postulated that ICS work by reducing airways inflammation, but the dose response is not the same as that seen in asthma (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2011</LINK>). Other possibilities include the effects on chronic systemic inflammation and on autoimmunity. Finally, some evidence of a synergistic action has been reported when ICS and LABAs are jointly administered. LABAs and ICS may interact in a beneficial way, with corticosteroids preventing loss of function of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists with long-term use, whereas beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists may potentiate the local anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2002</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-08-28 13:43:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this series of reviews is to document available evidence for the relative effectiveness of two commonly used treatments in COPD (ICS and LABAs) when given in combination. The convenience and complementary effects of anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator when combined in a single inhaler is appealing but needs to be borne out in trials. The possibility of harmful effects needs to be explored, especially in the light of concerns over pneumonia associated with ICS.</P>

<P>For continuous variables, a fixed-effect mean difference (MD) was used for outcomes measured on the same metric. Standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for outcomes for which data were combined from studies using different metrics. All similar studies were to be pooled using fixed-effect MD/SMD and 95% CIs. When mean treatment differences were reported, data were entered as generic inverse variance (GIV), provided a standard error for the difference could be extracted or imputed. When this method was used, the effect size was reported from the original papers, for example, as rate ratio. This method (GIV) was not available when the protocol was written for the review, so it was not prespecified.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-28 16:07:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We reviewed data from 15 randomised controlled trials (7814 participants; <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>) assessing the effectiveness and safety of combined inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) versus ICS alone for the clinically important primary outcomes of exacerbations, mortality, hospitalisation and pneumonia. Overall, available evidence suggests that combination therapy with ICS and LABA shows an advantage over ICS alone in reducing exacerbations and mortality throughout the study period, with no significant effect on hospitalisation or pneumonia. The greatest quantity of evidence comes from populations of poorly reversible participants who have more severe COPD. It should be noted that most of the evidence for a reduction in mortality (weighting of 90%) comes from the TORCH study, which compared FPS and FP in participants with an FEV<SUB>1</SUB> &lt; 60% predicted. Furthermore, the mortality benefit is confined to the FPS combination only and is not seen in the others. If we remove the TORCH study, mortality rates are not significantly different between combination treatment and ICS alone. Furthermore, the TORCH study did not show any statistically significant mortality benefit at 2 years, only at 3 years, so we can only be sure that benefit would accrue over the longer period. Finally, about 14% of those in the TORCH study died, whereas mortality rates in the other studies reporting this outcome were in the order of 3%, and all were less than 12 months in duration. The TORCH study was the only study in this review that showed significantly fewer withdrawals in the combination group than in the ICS group, but it was also the only study that ascertained the vital status of all participants, including those who withdrew from the study.</P>
<P>If the mortality benefit seen in this review in association with the combined inhaler is confirmed in other three-year studies, the mechanism needs elucidation, and this is likely to be important. The TORCH investigators did find a significant difference between LABA/ICS and ICS alone, but not between LABA/ICS and placebo, although the P value for this comparison was 0.052. To date, the only approaches used in COPD to reduce mortality rates are smoking cessation and long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in hypoxic patients. On the basis of our findings, at best, 33 people with moderate to severe COPD need to be treated with a combination FPS inhaler for three years to prevent one excess death, compared with those treated with ICS alone. This reduction appears to involve COPD-related deaths. On the other hand, no evidence of a mortality benefit has been obtained for the other combination inhalers over their component ICS. From this review, we can conclude that combination treatment is related to fewer exacerbations, and probably to fewer severe exacerbations, than ICS alone, as is discussed later. Exacerbations are risky times for death; therefore this is a plausible explanation, but to be sure, we would need to use individual participant data to gather additional details on the causes and timing of death and modelling of the amount of variance in mortality that is explained by the reduced exacerbations. In contrast, the small change in lung function seems insufficient to account for a mortality benefit, but this needs to be tested in other, longer-term trials. It is interesting to contrast the finding of a possible mortality benefit of LABA/ICS combinations in COPD with the situation in asthma. In that disease, use of a LABA alone is associated with an increased death rate, but when combined with ICS, this is no longer the case (<LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Greater consistency was seen with the interventions for exacerbations, and the number of exacerbations was reduced by both FPS and BDF as was the proportion of participants with an exacerbation that was reduced by MF/F, compared with the component ICS alone. It is interesting to note that for the FPS studies, the reduction in the proportion of participants with an exacerbation was not significant, but those who experienced exacerbations had fewer of them, and fewer of these participants needed treatment with oral steroids. Yet, the differences in exacerbations with combination therapy did not translate to fewer hospitalisations for COPD, and this is difficult to explain. Hospitalisations are among the most costly aspects of COPD management, causing a negative impact on expectancy and quality of life. It is plausible that the hospital stays were shorter. Most studies clearly defined hospitalisation as a stay of at least 24 hours. Moreover, hospitalisations are relatively rare events that can be quantified only by larger and longer studies. To exemplify this point, on average about 7% of patients per year were hospitalised for COPD in the TORCH study, in part because of the lack of the inclusion criterion of a moderate to severe exacerbation 52 weeks before enrolment, as was required in more recent trials.</P>
<P>This review was unable to shed light on the debate as to whether or not ICS increase pneumonia in COPD, as it was administered in both intervention arms. This can be tested only when the comparator does not contain ICS. We found no significant difference, with one interpretation being that LABAs do not reduce the risk of pneumonia with ICS. However, we also found that pneumonia was not a frequent adverse event when it was defined by chest x-ray. The shorter studies in <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK> identified only 60 cases of pneumonia among 4222 participants (1.4%), in contrast to the three-year <LINK REF="STD-TORCH" TYPE="STUDY">TORCH</LINK> study, which reported 587 episodes of pneumonia from a sample of 3098 participants who received ICS treatment (19%). The results of <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK> were the same, whether or not the TORCH study was included.</P>
<P>An internal consistency of the findings for primary outcomes and secondary outcomes was evident. All combination inhalers were associated with better lung function at the end of the study than was their ICS component, but this difference was relatively small. Two combinations (BDF and FPS) were associated with better quality of life, decreased use of rescue medication and withdrawals due to adverse events, but not with withdrawals due to lack of efficacy. The causes for withdrawals and for adverse events were coded slightly differently among the trials and thus were not combined, although this will be considered for future reviews. Improvement in quality of life was seen only when measured with the SGRQ, not with the CDRQ. The differences were small and were much less than a minimum clinically important difference (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2002</LINK>). This suggests that the clinical effects may be imperceptible to patients, or that any benefits may be offset by other harms. Fewer exacerbations may result in lower healthcare costs; although this review does not show a reduction in costly hospitalisations, bed days could still be reduced.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-08-28 16:07:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the review are fifteen studies, with a total of 7814 participants. All eligible studies addressed at least one of the primary outcomes. The participants and outcomes were typical of COPD patients. The most plentiful data are available for the FPS combination, which was the only one to show a mortality benefit. Fewer data are available for the MF/F combination, but no evidence suggests that it behaves differently from the other inhalers. A sufficient number of trials in the analysis provided the opportunity to include funnel plots for the primary analyses; they are presented in <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>.</P>
<P>We did not compare the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with the same treatment delivered in two separate inhalers, so we cannot comment on the relative effectiveness of a combination inhaler in comparison with the individual components delivered separately. Whilst we recognise that inhaled corticosteroids are rarely likely to be used as monotherapy in COPD, the trials in this review provide the best evidence for assessing the additional benefit of adding LABA to ICS.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Airways Group provides an excellent level of support in the identification of potentially relevant trials. However, concern with respect to study selection bias or publication bias in this process is inevitable. A matter of concern is that failure to identify unpublished trials may lead to an incomplete estimation of the effects of combined therapy versus ICS alone. However, an exhaustive search of the published literature, without language restrictions, for potentially relevant clinical trials was underpinned by a systematic search strategy to minimise the likelihood of bias. Of the 15 included studies, 13 were identified through the Cochrane Airways Group Register, an additional study (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00358358" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00358358</LINK>) was identified by the group from www.clinicaltrials.gov and <LINK REF="STD-SFCT01" TYPE="STUDY">SFCT01</LINK> was obtained via the GlaxoSmithKline Clinical Trials Register. Trial selection and data extraction followed a prespecified protocol, and the process was independently conducted by two investigators. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that additional unidentified trials may exist.</P>

Another systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Drummond-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drummond 2008</LINK>) found in subgroup analyses that the highest risks of pneumonia were seen in those treated with the highest ICS dose (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.92), a shorter duration of ICS use (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.05) and combined ICS and bronchodilator therapy (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.82), which does not disagree with our findings. We found a lower rate of pneumonia than was found by other studies when diagnosis was obtained by chest x-ray.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-08-28 16:07:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In participants with moderate and severe COPD, clinical benefit is evident when LABA and ICS are co-administered rather than ICS alone. Even though patients do not all perceive a better quality of life, they may live longer and have fewer exacerbations with combination therapy versus ICS alone. However, the evidence does not support the likelihood of being exacerbation-free or having fewer hospitalisations during the treatment period. The reduction in exacerbations varies, depending on the frequency of these events in individual patients. The mortality benefit will take at least two years to be evident and has been shown only for the FPS combination. Available evidence is most plentiful for the FPS combination and is heavily weighted by the three-year TORCH trial.</P>
<P>What is unclear is whether combination LABA/ICS therapy is better than LABA or ICS administered separately, or 4 times daily use of short-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists with ICS. All of the combination inhalers in this review were given twice a day. In addition to potential adherence benefits associated with the combination inhaler, its use guarantees that a patient receives both medicines simultaneously, which may not be the case if they are administered via separate inhalers. Further, evidence that LABAs and ICS have complementary and synergistic effects when delivered as combination therapy from a single inhaler is increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Hanania-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanania 2008</LINK>). Although we conclude that unopposed ICS with no LABA co-administration is an inferior strategy in COPD, the minimum effective dose of inhaled steroids remains unclear. The three combination inhalers showed similar effects on review outcomes, including adverse effects, but should ideally be subjected to simple head-to-head comparisons over long periods of time. We have not been able to identify differences between the combination inhalers on the basis of currently available evidence.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-08-28 16:07:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of the TORCH study need to be confirmed, as it is the only trial to show a decrease in mortality over the study period. We suggest that the circumstances surrounding any death should be fully documented and categorised as to likely clinical mechanism, and that all patients should have their vital status ascertained (whether they complete the study or drop out). If confirmed, a multipartite programme of clinical and basic science research should be enlisted to elucidate the mechanism of reduction in mortality, given that this is the only pharmaceutical yet shown to reduce mortality in COPD.</P>
<P>Future studies might address the impact of any reduction in exacerbations on health care utilisation (e.g. bed days, unscheduled general practitioner or emergency room visits). This could help inform a cost-benefit analysis.</P>
<P>Which combination and which dose and duration of ICS should be selected in COPD have not yet been explored adequately. We also do not know whether use of a combination is superior to separate administration of the two inhalers. Obviously the best way to test these relative benefits and adverse effects for each of the combinations is to perform a simple and direct long-term comparison among, for example, FPS, BDF and MF/F treatments. This might best be done in well-categorised, stable COPD patients receiving primary care.</P>
<P>New combinations of ICS with 24-hour LABAs such as indacaterol, vilanterol or olodaterol are emerging. Are these just "me too" medicines, or do they offer an advantage? Updating this review within a short space of time will be imperative.</P>

<P>We have now included estimates of mortality from all included studies.</P>
<P>Since the time that the protocol of this Cochrane Review was published, several aspects of review methodology have changed in light of recent recommendations regarding the methodology of Cochrane Reviews.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Risk of bias assessment (<I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>, Chapter 8). This has now displaced the Jadad scores that we generated previously in determining study quality.</LI>
<LI>Generic inverse variance (<I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>, Chapters 7 and 9). This method of meta-analysing adjusted effect estimates from clinical trials has enabled us to measure exacerbation outcomes as rate ratios.</LI>
<LI>Summary of findings tables. We have adopted the GRADE methodology for assessing strength evidence and determining effect size in absolute terms for key outcomes in this review (<A HREF="http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/">GRADE working group</A>).</LI>
<LI>In 2012 the inclusion criteria were clarified as <I>randomised, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trials of at least 4 weeks' duration.</I> This was done to bring consistency to the inclusion criteria of the three Cochrane reviews considering combined corticosteroid and long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist in one inhaler for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</LI>
<LI>In 2012 we added the comparison of mometasone furoate/formoterol versus mometasone furoate.</LI>
<LI>Studies in which the ICS dose in the ICS/LABA condition was &lt; 80% of the ICS dose in the ICS-only condition were excluded.</LI>
