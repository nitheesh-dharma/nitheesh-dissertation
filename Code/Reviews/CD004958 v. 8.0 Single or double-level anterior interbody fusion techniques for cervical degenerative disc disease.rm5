<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-14 12:18:12 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Degenerative disc disease is part of the natural aging process of the human spine and can cause complications stemming from the nerve root or spinal cord. Degenerative disc disease of the spine can result in significant pain, instability, disturbances with the nerve roots or spinal cord, or a combination of symptoms. The cause of these symptoms comes from compression of the nerves.</P>
<P>When symptoms do not respond to conservative treatment, surgical treatment is considered. The goals of surgical treatment should be to remove pressure from the nerves, restore the alignment of the vertebrae and stabilize the spine. The common surgical technique to treat cervical disc disease is removal of the damaged disc with or without fusing the two adjacent vertebral bodies. Bone grafts (harvesting bone from other sites of the body) are usually used to stimulate the fusion process.</P>
<P>This review of 33 small studies (2267 participants) evaluated fusion techniques used to treat degenerative disc disease. The major treatments were discectomy (removal of the damaged disc) alone, addition of a fusion procedure (bone transplanted from another part of the body, cement, or cage), and addition of a plate.</P>
<P>None of the evidence from this systematic review indicates that one technique is better than another for clinically significant pain relief for patients with chronic cervical degenerative disc disease or disc herniation. The choice for a specific technique cannot be made on the most important aspect, pain relief, which was the primary outcome parameter in our review. There is moderate quality evidence that there was little or no difference in Odom&#8217;s criteria (a tool that measures the success of the surgery at relieving the symptoms that were troublesome prior to the surgery) between those who received a bone transplant from the hip and a metal cage to help with fusion.</P>
<P>There is moderate quality evidence that the use of a bone graft (bone transplanted from another part of the body) is more effective than discectomy alone in achieving fusion. There is low quality evidence that transplanting bone from the iliac crest is more effective in achieving fusion than using a cage, while cages are more effective in preventing complications.</P>
<P>Further research is very likely to have an important impact on the results and our confidence in them.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-12-08 16:59:36 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty-three small studies ( 2267 patients) compared different fusion techniques. The major treatments were discectomy alone, addition of an interbody fusion procedure (autograft, allograft, cement, or cage), and addition of anterior plates. Eight studies had a low risk of bias. Few studies reported on pain, therefore, at best, there was very low quality evidence of little or no difference in pain relief between the different techniques. We found moderate quality evidence for these secondary outcomes: no statistically significant difference in Odom's criteria between iliac crest autograft and a metal cage (6 studies, RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.99 to1.24)); bone graft produced more effective fusion than discectomy alone (5 studies, RR 0.22 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.48)); no statistically significant difference in complication rates between discectomy alone and iliac crest autograft (7 studies, RR 1.56 (95% CI 0.71 to 3.43)); and low quality evidence that iliac crest autograft results in better fusion than a cage (5 studies, RR 1.87 (95% CI 1.10 to 3.17)); but more complications (7 studies, RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.92)).</P>

<P>When the working mechanism for pain relief and functional improvement is fusion of the motion segment, there is low quality evidence that iliac crest autograft appears to be the better technique. When ignoring fusion rates and looking at complication rates, a cage has a weak evidence base over iliac crest autograft, but not over discectomy alone. Future research should compare additional instrumentation such as screws, plates, and cages against discectomy with or without autograft.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-12-08 15:09:09 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Degenerative disc disease is part of the natural aging process of the human spine and can cause complaints stemming from the nerve root (radiculopathy) or spinal cord (myelopathy). Radiculopathy affects, on average, 83 in 100,000 patients each year (<LINK REF="REF-Radhakrishnan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radhakrishnan 1994</LINK>) with a prevalence of 35 per 100 patients (<LINK REF="REF-Salemi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salemi 1996</LINK>). Degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine can result in significant pain, instability, radiculopathy, myelopathy or a combination of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Grob-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grob 1998</LINK>). The cause of these symptoms can be loss of disc space height, loss of foraminal area, disc bulging or protruding osteophytes causing neural compression. See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for definitions.</P>
<P>When symptoms are refractory to conservative treatment, surgical treatment is considered. The goals of surgical treatment should be decompression, restoration of alignment, and stability. Decompression involves removal of the soft disc or osteolytic structures from the compressed neural elements so they no longer impinge on the nerves. Restoration of alignment involves restoration of the disc space height and neural foraminal height as well as the normal angle between the vertebrae. Stability involves elimination of motion of the motion segment. Therefore, a fusion technique can be used, provided it incorporates a structural support to replace the disc, and that a stable fusion of the vertebrae is acquired. The treatment of degenerative disc disease can be divided into posterior procedures (entering through the back of the neck and spine), anterior procedures (entering through the front of the neck and spine) or a combination of these. The popularity of the anterior approach for discectomy and fusion has increased because this approach avoids exposure of the spinal canal (<LINK REF="REF-Fraser-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 1995</LINK>) and results in less soft tissue damage. Structural support is provided by using an autograft or allograft bone with a cage filled with autologous bone graft or artificial bone and/or an anterior plate.</P>
<P>The common surgical technique to treat cervical degenerative disc disease is discectomy (removal of damaged disc) with or without fusing the two adjacent vertebral bodies. Discectomy without fusion will lead to a spontaneous fusion in 70% to 80% of the cases. Bone grafts are usually used for stimulating the fusion of the two vertebrae. These bone grafts are harvested from other sites in the body during surgery, usually from the iliac crest. The bone graft stimulates the bones in the spine to generate new bone, results in reliable rates of fusion, and generally maintains its structural integrity. The most frequently cited technique for anterior discectomy and fusion is the one described by Smith and Robinson (<LINK REF="REF-Emery-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emery 1994</LINK>). This technique uses a left anterior approach, with a longitudinal incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. By dissecting the superficial cervical fascia and passing medially from the carotid sheath and laterally from the oesophagus and trachea, the anterior aspect of the cervical spine can be reached. After identification of the correct level, preferably on fluoroscopy, the anterior longitudinal ligament is explored and cut, then the disc is excised, leaving the anterior bony aspects in place. The endplate is removed from the cartilage to induce union (fusion) with the bone graft. The tricortical bone graft is harvested from the iliac crest and inserted into the disc space. The Smith and Robinson technique, as cited in the literature, can refer to either the discectomy procedure alone, or the additional fusion using an iliac crest autograft. Some modifications have been made to the original technique (<LINK REF="REF-Emery-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emery 1994</LINK>). The Cloward technique (<LINK REF="REF-Cloward-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cloward 1956</LINK>) is used for discectomy and fusion with a round bone dowel taken from the iliac crest. In contrast to the Smith and Robinson technique, the anterior vertebral bone structure is drilled into the shape of the bone dowel. See <LINK REF="REF-Espine-Website-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Espine Website 2010</LINK> for a description of the procedure.</P>
<P>The harvesting from the iliac crest can be associated with short- and long-term morbidity in up to 22% of the cases (<LINK REF="STD-McConnel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McConnel 2003</LINK>). Most frequently reported problems include postoperative pain, wound hematoma, infection, pelvic fracture, nerve palsy, and chronic donor site pain that is reported by an average of 2.4% of the patients in studies that report this complication (<LINK REF="STD-McConnel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McConnel 2003</LINK>). In a study that specifically looked at donor site pain, no less than 90% of patients complained of donor site pain (<LINK REF="REF-Heneghan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heneghan 2009</LINK>). This donor site morbidity has fuelled the search for various forms of allograft materials as alternatives for cervical interbody fusion (<LINK REF="REF-Vaccaro-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaccaro 2003</LINK>). Interbody cages provide initial stability, and by filling the disc space, require less structural bone graft. Despite its potential to yield outcomes similar to those of autograft bone, allograft is expensive to produce, incorporates more slowly, carries the potential risk of disease transmission and is not universally available. In addition, it is only osteo-conductive and does not contain the same osteo-inductive elements as autologous grafts. Examples are fibular allograft (<LINK REF="REF-Young-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1993</LINK>) and Surgibone® (<LINK REF="REF-Savolainen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savolainen 1994</LINK>). Anterior cervical plating can provide immediate stability to the segment of the spine to which it is applied, maintain spinal alignment, prevent graft dislodgement and collapse, enhance fusion rates, and eliminate the need for external immobilisation.</P>
<P>The choice of technique to be used should ideally be based on the best evidence available in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Blettner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blettner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenhalgh-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenhalgh 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Offringa-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Offringa 1999</LINK>). Apart from the last version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2004</LINK>) and a few in-depth narrative reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Floyd-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Floyd 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Theodore-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Theodore 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitecloud-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitecloud 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wigfield-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wigfield 2001</LINK>), we could not identify any systematic reviews on the anterior approach for cervical interbody fusion. The goal of this systematic review is to determine which technique of interbody fusion, using the anterior approach, gives the best clinical and radiological outcomes for patients with single or double-level degenerative disc diseases of the cervical spine.</P>
<P>This review updates and expands the original review (<LINK REF="REF-van-Limbeek-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Limbeek 2000</LINK>) and subsequent Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2004</LINK>) comparing anterior cervical fusion options. This expansion of the review from the first publication reflects the availability of new trials comparing treatments for cervical degenerative disc disease.</P>

<P>Two review authors (WJ, PW) independently selected the trials from the list of titles and abstracts of identified references and met to reach consensus. For the last version of this review, the search and selection was performed by the two reviewers. For this update, the CBRG Trials Search Co-ordinator (RC) performed a pre-screening of the references and the final selection was performed by the two review authors. If relevance could not be ascertained on the basis of the abstract, the complete article was retrieved. When consensus could not be reached, a third reviewer (PA) was consulted to resolve the disagreement.</P>
<P>Articles were selected in two steps. In the first step, articles were excluded when it was apparent from either the title or abstract that the study did not meet the criteria mentioned in <LINK TAG="SELECTION_CRITERIA" TYPE="SECTION">Criteria for considering studies for this review</LINK>. In the second step, articles were excluded when it was apparent from a quick scan of the full text of the article that it failed to meet the same inclusion criteria. When the same population was described in more than one study, all studies were used, but the studies were grouped and analysed as one population. The reason for exclusion was documented for each reference.</P>

<P>Details of randomisation, blinding and exclusions from the analyses were recorded onto separate, pre-developed forms. From each study, basic information was gathered concerning authors (affiliation, sponsoring), methods (study design, sample size), patients (selection criteria and diagnoses, age, sex), treatments (instrumentation, bone and bone substitutes), and outcome variables with results. Data were extracted and entered into RevMan 5.0.22 by one author (WJ) and checked by another author (PW). Publications were managed with the aid of Reference Manager®. In addition, relevant information was recorded pertaining to database source, reason for exclusion and consensus of authors.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-12-08 15:20:04 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Risk of bias of RCTs was assessed with the 12 criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2009</LINK>). Criteria and operationalisation are given in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>. The items were scored with &#8216;yes&#8217;, &#8216;no&#8217;, or &#8216;unsure&#8217;. Studies were categorized as having a "low risk of bias" when at least six of the 12 criteria were met and the study had no serious methodological flaws (randomisation and allocation concealment techniques were valid).</P>
<P>The risk of bias was assessed independently by two review authors (WJ, PW), who again met to reach consensus. As before, if consensus could not be reached, a third review author (PA) was consulted to resolve the disagreement.</P>
<P>The potential to pool results was dependent on the comparability of the individual studies, i.e. identical treatments and outcome measures were used, sufficient detail was given to describe the selection criteria and other external validity criteria.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2010-12-06 15:34:45 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RR). For continuous outcomes, we calculated a mean difference (MD). For each outcome, a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was computed. We used a random-effects model in all our comparisons as differences between studies will always be present. Clinical relevance was assessed by the five questions recommended by <LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2009</LINK> (see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). Clinically important change was evaluated against the guideline given by <LINK REF="REF-Ostelo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostelo 2008</LINK>, where a minimal important change of 30% for Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Quebec Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (QBPQ) was proposed in consensus.</P>

<P>We pooled the results from individual studies when the studies were judged to be sufficiently homogeneous (Clinical and statistical).</P>
<P>The quality of evidence for all primary outcome parameters, regardless of quantitative analysis, was evaluated using the GRADE approach (GRADE Working Group 2004 - <LINK REF="REF-Atkins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 2004</LINK>) and GRADE Profiler software, version 3.2.2, 2004-2007).

<P>Electronic searches of the databases identified 2129 references, minus duplicates: 225 from CENTRAL, 660 from MEDLINE, 1400 from EMBASE, 244 from Current Contents (till May 2009) and 293 from BIOSIS (2004 to May 2009). The Trials Search Co-ordinator excluded 1999 references because the topic was not related to the topic of this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection</HEADING>
<P>A total of 130 references appeared to be relevant and were further screened by the review authors (WJ, PW). After screening the titles and abstracts, we excluded 92 references. We excluded a further 21 references after screening the full text of the article, including fifteen randomised studies on disc arthroplasty initially included by one reviewer, but then excluded after consensus since disc arthroplasty was not included in this review. Neglecting the disc arthroplasty studies, the inter-rater kappa was 0.75. See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> for further details. Screening the reference lists of the new studies yielded 36 new references, one of which could be included. Citation tracing yielded 213 new references, and also resulted in one new inclusion. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Lofgren-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lofgren 2010</LINK>) was encountered and included alongside the search through a journal issue alert, this study referenced several included studies, but apparently this article was not (yet) indexed in Web of Science citation tracking.</P>
<P>Finally, 20 articles were included describing 19 new studies. One article presented further results for <LINK REF="STD-Vavruch-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vavruch 2002</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Wigfield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wigfield 2003</LINK> was in the S<I>tudies awaiting classification</I> section and has now been excluded. Together with the 20 articles describing 14 studies from the previous review, a total of 40 articles describing 33 studies were included in this review.</P>
<P>Ten articles described three studies: four articles for <LINK REF="STD-Zoega-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zoega 2000</LINK>, two articles for <LINK REF="STD-Hacker-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hacker 2000</LINK> and four articles for <LINK REF="STD-Vavruch-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vavruch 2002</LINK>. Only one article was identified as the primary data source, although additional data were extracted from the other studies as indicated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparisons</HEADING>
<P>The comparisons made in the trials evaluated a range of anterior fusion techniques. Because of clinical heterogeneity, we grouped these comparisons into:</P>
<P>1. Discectomy alone versus human bone graft<BR/>2. Discectomy alone versus cages or cement<BR/>3. Discectomy alone versus iliac crest autograft with plates<BR/>4. Iliac crest autograft versus human allograft or bone substitute<BR/>5. Iliac crest autograft versus cages<BR/>6. Iliac crest autograft versus iliac crest autograft with plates<BR/>7. Different types of autograft<BR/>8. Allograft versus cages<BR/>9. Comparisons between different types of instrumentation</P>
<P>Although there are still some variations between treatments within these comparisons, we felt that these categories were based on basic differences between treatment options. This decision was made after selection of the studies.</P>

<P>The risk of bias in the studies was variable, but often high, especially concerning randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding. This might have been the result of either poor methodology or poor reporting. Blinding is rarely used in orthopedic surgical trials, as is confirmed by the studies found in this review. No study used surgeon blinding. Two studies used patient blinding and four studies used outcome assessor blinding. The randomisation technique was mentioned in 13 of the 33 trials and valid allocation concealment in 11 of the 33 studies.

<P>In summary, between those who received discectomy and those who received iliac crest autograft, there is low quality evidence that there was no significant difference in short-term pain relief (1 RCT, 84 participants, RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.20 to 3.46) and very low quality evidence that there was no significant difference in Odom's criteria (2 RCTs, 149 participants, RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10); short-term return-to-work (2 RCTs, 144 participants, RR 1.26; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.54); or intermediate-term return-to-work (2 RCTs, 70 participants, RR 1.44; 95% CI 0.77 to 2.69). There is moderate quality evidence that bone graft was more effective than discectomy alone in achieving fusion (5 RCTs, 303 participants, RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.48) and very low quality evidence that there was no significant difference in alignment (2 RCTs, 75 participants, RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.07 to 1.56). There is moderate quality evidence that there was no significant difference in complication rates (7 RCTs, 487 participants, OR 1.56; 95% CI 0.71 to 3.43).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Update</HEADING>
<P>This update included 19 new studies. Remarkably, all new studies evaluated the use of instrumentation such as anterior plates for fusion. In this update, we adapted the Cochrane Back Review group recommendations for risk of bias in a trial, which is based on a trial meeting a minimal of 50% of the risk of bias items. This differs from our previous criteria for a study with high internal validity, when only valid randomisation and allocation concealment techniques were required. In this update, we combined the two criteria, so studies had to meet 50% of the criteria, including a positive score on the items for randomisation and allocation concealment. With the new criteria, fewer studies have a low risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Clinical</HEADING>
<P>None of the evidence from this systematic review indicates that any technique results in (clinically relevant) better pain relief for patients with chronic cervical degenerative disc disease or disc herniation compared to another technique. The choice for a specific technique cannot be made on the most important aspect, pain relief, which was the primary outcome parameter in our review. This is in agreement with <LINK REF="REF-Carragee-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carragee 2008</LINK>, who could not find scientific support for invasive interventions in patients with isolated neck pain. For patients with radiculopathy, they found no treatment to be superior. Other important considerations in the choice for surgical technique are complication rate, other clinical outcomes and fusion rate.</P>
<P>When looking at complications, cages perform better than iliac crest graphs. The difference is clinically significant. Other comparisons between complication rates did not show statistically significant differences. However, we must be aware that these trials are not powered to identify a difference in the occurrence of complication rates, which have a low incidence. Also, the aggregate of studies might still fall short of adequate power.</P>
<P>When looking at other clinical outcomes, discectomy was more effective than human bone graft in improving return-to-work at five weeks, but the effect was small and unstable and at 10 weeks the difference was not statistically significant. For all other analyses of clinical parameters, none of the evidence from this review indicates that there is a statistical difference between any of the techniques.</P>
<P>Fusion rate is important because it is the key in the working mechanism of many of the surgical techniques. When looking at fusion rates, iliac crest autograft is the best treatment for preventing non-fusion, as it performs better (clinically and statistically) than discectomy alone and cages. As for the other surgical techniques, we could not find any differences of fusion rates between discectomy plus cages or PMMA, discectomy alone, iliac crest autograft plus an anterior plate or iliac crest autograft. This is in contradiction to the meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Fraser-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 2007</LINK>, who found better fusion rates for anterior plates. The meta-analysis included retrospective, non-controlled, studies, which may be prone to bias. As for discectomy, the intended working mechanism does not involve fusion of the motion segment, so lower fusion rates compared to iliac crest autograft may have no clinical implications.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methodology</HEADING>
<P>The small sample sizes of the studies make it hard to draw conclusions about the absence of differences, especially when only one study is found or when combined studies have a wide range of uncertainty.</P>
<P>To be regarded as a randomised controlled trial, the randomisation technique should be valid, applied just before the treatment is given and have an unpredictable allocation. There are several techniques to keep the allocation unpredictable, such as sealed envelopes or a telephone call to the research centre. Invalid randomisation procedures will produce unbalanced groups by confounding by indication. We excluded studies based only on randomisation technique when it was apparent that the technique used was not valid and could introduce confounding by indication. When in doubt, we kept the trial in the review, which was the case in seven of the 17 trials. These trials might have used an invalid method of randomisation that could have distorted our results. A sensitivity analysis was not possible because of the limited number of comparable outcome parameters.</P>
<P>Blinding is hard to achieve in orthopedic surgical trials, especially for the surgeon. However, for the outcome assessor, it is possible to use independent observers who have no knowledge of the applied treatment. Blinding of the outcome assessor was only used in three studies.</P>
<P>There appears to be a range of outcome scores considered relevant in the assessment of the results of cervical interbody fusion. In essence, this may be true for each separate trial, but comparison among trials is not possible if each trial uses a different score. Therefore, in the setup of a trial it is essential to go beyond the question at hand and also look at the wider picture. There appears to be little consensus on the use of specific outcome parameters in orthopedic surgery. If inferences are wanted from separate studies published in the literature, guidelines for the use of standard scales have to be developed by the orthopedic community (<LINK REF="REF-Pietrobon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pietrobon 2002</LINK>). Therefore, the use of standard scales has been promoted (<LINK REF="REF-Pietrobon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pietrobon 2002</LINK>) and includes patient disability and impairment scores such as the SF-36 and Neck Disability Index. In our opinion, study-specific outcome parameters should be accompanied by general global patient parameters in each dimension of outcome, i.e. pain (VAS neck and VAS arm), functional (WOMAC, NDI), societal (satisfaction/Odom's criteria, working capacities, SF-36), radiological (fusion), and complications. Outcomes should also be reported at standard outcome intervals.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Reporting</HEADING>
<P>An in-depth and systematic review of the published literature requires this literature to be complete and consistent with the presentation of its data. This is certainly not the case in the studies found for this review. For the primary outcome parameter, pain, results were reported either as mean, mean improvement or percentage of the patients that showed a specific improvement. Further, the description of the methodology could be improved. A mention of allocation concealment in the randomisation technique is essential.</P>
<P>A second issue is the formation of homogeneous groups. In this review, it was very difficult to find comparable patient groups across studies. Many groups differed in diagnosis because of different selection criteria. Another essential element when identifying specific subgroups, is to also provide separate data and analyses for each group. This can be applied to different diagnostic groups, such as, patients with radiculopathy, myelopathy, etc and also for different treatment groups such as single- or double-level surgery. From that aspect, we should mention that the goal of this review was changed from single-level to single- and double-level procedures, because of the limited number of studies that included only single-level procedures.</P>

<P>For reduction of pain in patients with cervical degenerative disc disease or disc herniation, we found no superior treatment. The literature is hampered by few studies, small studies, and generally poor research design. Consequently, it is unclear what patients, if any, benefit from cervical fusion as opposed to discectomy alone. In most studies and for most outcomes, discectomy was not statistically different from fusion by any technique, and there are no clear differences among fusion techniques. This review showed that the only evidence-based choice is between iliac crest autograft and cages for chronic cervical degenerative disc disease. This choice depends on balancing the importance of improved fusion rates with autograft versus improved complication rate with cages. As the relationship between clinical parameters and fusion rates remains weak, cages are a valid alternative for iliac crest autograft, although the working mechanism of fusion might not apply for isolated nerve root compression. The results are likely to be influenced by future research.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-12-06 19:29:11 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More methodologically rigorous studies are needed In the field of surgical treatment of cervical degenerative disc disease before evidence-based recommendations on this topic can be made. The methodological quality of the design of the studies would be improved by standardizing the outcome parameters and follow-up time-points. Also, more long-term outcome data (i.e. 10 years) are needed. Presentation of the data could be improved by describing the randomisation technique, the selection criteria, the population and study participants. Results should be given for every identifiable subgroup, with appropriate identification of variation. These implications have improved slightly since our previous version of this review, but still need attention. Additional instrumentation such as screws, plates, and cages should be compared against discectomy with or without autograft before any other comparisons are undertaken.</P>

<P>This updated review has some changes from the initial protocol and review.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The methodological quality evaluation was simplified and adheres to The Cochrane Collaboration and Cochrane Back Review Group's new recommendations to use Risk of Bias tables. Tables with in- and external quality have been replaced by these tables. This standard of including text for Risk of Bias assessment was new, and only added for the newly included trials. This was also the case with the first question of the clinical relevance assessment.</LI>
<LI>We adopted the GRADE approach to grade the quality of the evidence.</LI>
<LI>Definition of complications were added after selection of studies, but before data extraction.</LI>

<P>With great interest we've read the excellent review of Jacobs et al.(5). Although we agree with the conclusions, we want to address some points:</P>
<P>1) the results of a study by Barlocher were excluded, because they were presented in a Conference Proceeding. However, in 2002 they were also published in Neurosurgical Focus(2), an official peer - reviewed journal. Therefore, it is not correct to exclude the study from this review.</P>
<P>2) Neither is the study by de la Torre et al.(3) mentioned. Although only an abstract of a presentation at a meeting is provided, the reviewers should have attempted to contact the authors to get the original data. This procedure is also advocated in the Cochrane Handbook 4.1.</P>
<P>3) Most articles comparing cervical discectomy with and without fusion used Odom's criteria for assessing outcome. Some authors did not explicitly mention that they used Odom's criteria, whereas it is perfectly clear from the description. A common estimated outcome can be calculated using a larger number of studies. In this way, the articles from Bärlocher et al., van de Bent et al., Abd-Alrahman et al., Martins, Rosenørn et al., and Savolainen et al.(1;2;6-9), could be used to estimate a common odds ratio. If good (including excellent) is used for clinical outcome versus the rest (fair, poor), the estimated common odds ratio (Mantel-Haenszel) is 0,89 with a 95% CL of 0.60 to 1.32 comparing non - fusion with fusion. The data of the study of Dowd(4) were not included, since follow - up was only 1 day! However, this calculation does confirm, that there does not exist any difference in clinical outcome between patients treated by cervical anterior discectomy with or without fusion.</P>
<P>4) The conclusion of the reviewers is correct. However, it could be formulated more explicit. Since the complication rate is higher with fusion with autologous material or more expensive in case of the use of alternatives to autologous bone, fusion should offer at least minimal advantages on the long term. These are only theoretical. Therefore, we would suggest that based on the results of this review hard evidence to perform a fusion after cervical discectomy does not exist. This has great impact since many studies are ongoing comparing arthroplasty and fusion (as the golden (?) standard).</P>
<P>Finally, we want to congratulate the authors with their major effort and results.<BR/>Sincerely,<BR/>R.H.M.A. Bartels, M.D., Ph.D.(1)<BR/>Gert Jan van der Wilt, M.D., Ph.D.(2)<BR/>University Medical Center St. Radboud<BR/>R.

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2008-06-18 12:11:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many thanks for your interest in our review and well thought criticism.</P>
<P>The study results by Barlocher et al were not included in the review because it was not found in our search in the databases as a peer reviewed article. It was also not referenced by the other trials published after 2002; Baskin et al and McConnel et al. We are grateful for pointing to this additional study and it will of course be included in the future update. The search strategy remains a potential source of bias in any systematic review, which needs careful attention. Possible solutions could be to contact authors of conference proceedings to ask for (pending) publications and to hand search more journal contents not included in Medline and other databases.</P>
<P>The study by de la Torre et al was not included because including conference proceedings and contacting authors for original data was not in the protocol for the review. The authors are right in pointing to the need to contact authors for original data, but this requires additional effort, which we hope we can address in the next update.</P>
<P>Regarding the third point: we feel that the studies mentioned cannot be combined in a meta-analysis on the outcome parameter suggested because the definition of the score differs among the studies. Savolainen only uses three categories where the others use four. Rosenorn relies heavily on occupation where others do less. The difference between the definition between fair and good (the critical definition when good is the threshold) is not uniquely defined. We present the definitions used by the studies below. We therefore suggest strongly to the orthopedic society to come to more agreement on the outcome parameters to be used in clinical evaluations. An example could be taken from the OMERACT initiative used for rheumatoid arthritis research.</P>
<P>Finally, our approach was to present the evidence and draw conclusions to the extent of explicitness we feel funded by the studies found. We feel that we have not yet enough power to show equivalence, certainly as we did not perform meta-analysis on the selected studies with regard to complications. None of the studies aimed at identifying non-inferiority of discectomy. We agree with the authors that there is no established gold standard for cervical degenerative disc disease and this is supported by our results.</P>
<P>We hope continuously to improve our review methodology and appreciate very much these constructive remarks.</P>

<P>
<B>1. Was the method of randomisation adequate? </B>A random (unpredictable) assignment sequence. Examples of adequate methods are coin toss (for studies with two groups), rolling a dice (for studies with two or more groups), drawing of balls of different colours, drawing of ballots with the study group labels from a dark bag, computer-generated random sequence, pre-ordered sealed envelops, sequentially-ordered vials, telephone call to a central office, and pre-ordered list of treatment assignments</P>
<P>Examples of inadequate methods are: alternation, birth date, social insurance/security number, date in which they are invited to participate in the study, and hospital registration number</P>
<P>
<B>2. Was the treatment allocation concealed? </B>Assignment generated by an independent person not responsible for determining the eligibility of the patients. This person has no information about the persons included in the trial and has no influence on the assignment sequence or on the decision about eligibility of the patient.</P>
<P>
<B>Was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study? </B>
<BR/>
<B>3. Was the patient blinded to the intervention?</B>
<BR/>This item should be scored &#8220;yes&#8221; if the index and control groups are indistinguishable for the patients or if the success of blinding was tested among the patients and it was successful. </P>
<P>
<B>4. Was the care provider blinded to the intervention? </B>This item should be scored &#8220;yes&#8221; if the index and control groups are indistinguishable for the care providers or if the success of blinding was tested among the care providers and it was successful </P>
<P>
<B>5. Was the outcome assessor blinded to the intervention? </B>Adequacy of blinding should be assessed for the primary outcomes.  This item should be scored  &#8220;yes&#8221; if the success of blinding was tested among the outcome assessors and it was successful or:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>for patient-reported outcomes </B>in which the patient is the outcome assessor (e.g., pain, disability): the blinding procedure is adequate for outcome assessors if participant blinding is scored &#8220;yes&#8221;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>for outcome criteria assessed during scheduled visit and that supposes a contact between participants and outcome assessors </B>(e.g., clinical examination): the blinding procedure is adequate if patients are blinded, and the treatment or adverse effects of the treatment cannot be noticed during clinical examination</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>for outcome criteria that do not suppose a contact with participants </B>(e.g., radiography, magnetic resonance imaging): the blinding procedure is adequate if the treatment or adverse effects of the treatment cannot be noticed when assessing the main outcome</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>for outcome criteria that are clinical or therapeutic events </B>that will be determined by the interaction between patients and care providers (e.g., co-interventions, hospitalisation length, treatment failure), in which the care provider is the outcome assessor: the blinding procedure is adequate for outcome assessors if the item for 'caregivers' is scored &#8220;yes&#8221;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>for outcome criteria that are assessed from data of the medical forms</B>: the blinding procedure is adequate if the treatment or adverse effects of the treatment cannot be noticed on the extracted data</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?<BR/>6. Was the drop-out rate described and acceptable? </B>The number of participants who were included in the study but did not complete the observation period or were not included in the analysis must be described and reasons given. If the percentage of withdrawals and drop-outs does not exceed 20% for short-term follow-up and 30% for long-term follow-up and does not lead to substantial bias a 'yes' is scored. (N.B. these percentages are arbitrary, not supported by literature).</P>
<P>
<B>7. Were all randomised participants analysed in the group to which they were allocated? </B>All randomised patients are reported/analysed in the group they were allocated to by randomisation for the most important moments of effect measurement (minus missing values) irrespective of non-compliance and co-interventions.  <I> </I>
</P>
<P>
<B>8. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? </B>In order to receive a &#8216;yes&#8217;, the review author determines if all the results from all pre-specified outcomes have been adequately reported in the published report of the trial.  This information is either obtained by comparing the protocol and the report, or in the absence of the protocol, assessing that the published report includes enough information to make this judgment.</P>
<P>
<B>Other sources of potential bias:<BR/>9.  Were the groups similar at baseline regarding the most important prognostic indicators? </B>In order to receive a &#8220;yes&#8221;, groups have to be similar at baseline regarding demographic factors, duration and severity of complaints, percentage of patients with neurological symptoms, and value of main outcome measure(s).</P>
<P>
<B>10. Were co-interventions avoided or similar? </B>This item should be scored &#8220;yes&#8221; if there were no co-interventions or they were similar between the index and control groups.</P>
<P>
<B>11. Was the compliance acceptable in all groups? </B>The reviewer determines if the compliance with the interventions is acceptable, based on the reported intensity, duration, number and frequency of sessions for both the index intervention and control intervention(s). For example, physiotherapy treatment is usually administered over several sessions; therefore it is necessary to assess how many sessions each patient attended. For single-session interventions (for ex: surgery), this item is irrelevant.</P>
<P>
<B>12. Was the timing of the outcome assessment similar in all groups? </B>Timing of outcome assessment should be identical for all intervention groups and for all important outcome assessments.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Search methods for identification of studies</HEADING>
<P>We electronically searched the most common databases:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004)</LI>
<LI>MEDLINE (Through PubMed; 1966 to February 2004)</LI>
<LI>EMBASE (Ovid online; 1980 to 2004 week 11)</LI>

</UL>
<P>The search strings are given in Table 2. The strings in the second column are used and connected with OR within the cells, and with AND between the cells. The search strategy was adapted for the different databases. We made no restrictions on language or date of publication. We screened the references of the included studies, and with citation tracking, we screened references from the articles that cited the included articles.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection and analysis</HEADING>
<P>One author (WJ) conducted the literature search and retrieved the references to be evaluated. Two authors (WJ, PW) independently selected the trials to be included in the review and met to reach consensus. When consensus could not be reached, a third author (PA) was consulted to resolve the disagreement. The methodological quality of the trials was assessed independently by two authors (WJ, PW), with the van Tulder checklist (van Tulder 2003), who again met to reach consensus. As before, if consensus could not be reached, a third author (PA) was consulted to resolve the disagreement. Details of randomisation, blinding and exclusions from the analyses were recorded. Data were extracted and entered into RevMan 4.2.3 by one author (WJ) and checked by another author (PW).</P>
<P>Statistical analyses were conducted using Review Manager (RevMan) software 4.2.3. Publications were managed with the aid of Reference Manager<SUP>®</SUP>. In addition, relevant information was recorded pertaining to database source, reason for exclusion and consensus of authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection</HEADING>
<P>Articles were selected in two steps. In the first step, articles were excluded when it was apparent from either the title or abstract that the study did not meet the following criteria:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The study was a randomised controlled trial.</LI>
<LI>The interventions evaluated in the trials were comparisons of different techniques for anterior cervical interbody fusion</LI>
<LI>The indication for the patients to receive the intervention was chronic (longer than 12 weeks) degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine</LI>
</UL>
<P>The outcome parameters in the studies were clinical, functional, or radiological measures. The minimal length of follow-up was six months.<BR/>
</P>
<P>In the second step, articles were excluded when it was apparent from a quick scan of the full text of the article that it failed to meet the same inclusion criteria. When the same population was described in more than one study, all studies were used, but only the most informative was used as the primary reference. The reason for exclusion was documented for each reference.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>With the aid of a checklist, articles that met all the inclusion criteria were evaluated on meeting methodological requirements and objectives. We used the criteria recommended by the Back Group (van Tulder 2003) and. We regrouped these criteria into risk of bias (Table 3), external validity, and data presentation and statistical analysis (Table 4). Each item was scored good (+), questionable (+/-), poor (-), unsure (?), or 'not applicable'. We added a question on group and subgroup homogeneity, because heterogeneity is often encountered and accounts for the lack of power seen in orthopedic surgical trials. We also added a question on the description and validity of the statistical analyses used.</P>
<P>Risk of bias was assessed by considering randomisation, blinding, proper assessments and appropriateness of outcome measures, and comparability of groups. Randomisation with envelopes was allowed, but not date of admission, birth date, alternating schemes, or other comparable techniques. When studies used these techniques, it was regarded as a concurrently controlled trial and analysed as such. If in doubt, the decision was made on the information provided by the authors. Blinding of surgeon cannot usually be achieved in orthopedic surgery, so this is generally not met. Prognostic factors considered were: one or two-level surgery, clinical diagnosis (radiculopathy, radiculomyelopathy, herniated disc), and treatments applied. Loss to follow-up was graded as 'good' if it was less than 10%, 'questionable' if less than 20% and 'poor' if greater than 20%.</P>
<P>External validity was assessed by considering the completeness of the description of selection criteria, the treatment methods used, and the timing of follow-up. Short-term follow-up was considered to be follow-up that was shorter than five years.</P>
<P>Data presentation and statistical analyses were rated according to the availability of data describing the sizes of the groups and/or subgroups, means, proportions, or other relevant point estimates and their precision. When heterogeneity of the intervention groups was observed, data (point estimates and precision) were required for the subgroups identified. In addition, the description and appropriateness of the statistical methods were rated.</P>
<P>The final judgement on the quality of the studies was based on a pre-set cut-off point. We decided that internal validity was the primary indicator for the quality of a study. When the evaluation of internal validity suggested a low potential for bias, the study was considered a high quality study. Minimal requirements were a concealed allocation procedure, drop out of less than 20%, and homogeneous (sub) groups.</P>
<P>The final judgement on the strength of the evidence on each comparison was based on the Back Group's recommendations on Levels of Evidence (van Tulder 2003):<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Strong - consistent findings among multiple high quality RCTs</LI>
<LI>Moderate - consistent findings among multiple low quality RCTs and/or one high quality RCT</LI>
<LI>Limited - one low quality RCT</LI>
<LI>Conflicting - inconsistent findings among multiple RCTs</LI>
<LI>No evidence from trials - no RCTs</LI>
</UL>
<P>The potential to pool results was dependent on the comparability of the individual studies, i.e. identical treatments and outcome measures were used, sufficient detail was given to describe the selection criteria and other external validity criteria.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated relative risks (RR). For continuous outcomes, we calculated a weighted mean difference (WMD). If sufficient data were available, subgroup analyses were planned to assess the effects of age, gender, disease severity, one or two-level procedures, and length of follow-up time on the outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were planned to assess the effect of methodological quality (high or low) on outcomes. The use of a funnel plot was planned to identify publication bias. Heterogeneity was tested with a Q-test. When heterogeneity existed, post-hoc subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were planned to explore the reason for heterogeneity.</P>
