<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Minor update. This updated review includes the long term (4 to 8 years) follow-up results of a previously included trial, comparing laparoscopic colposuspension and TVT. Overall four studies were identified from the search. Two trials were excluded due to not being randomised and a further study, which was in abstract form, had already been included in the previous updated review in 2007. So only one study has been added in this update. This is the long term (4 to 8 years) follow-up results of a previously included trial, comparing laparoscopic colposuspension and TVT. Overall the conclusions of the review remain the same, with now emerging evidence that laparoscopic colposuspension has similar long-term subjective cure rates as TVT.</P>

<P>Substantive amendment This update of the review (Jan 2008) includes additional results from a three-armed trial comparing two techniques of laparoscopic colposuspension with open colposuspension. Many of the trials in the previously updated review were in abstract form only and now have been published in full and on one occassion the authorship has changed. One trial has also published additional outcomes of cost effectiveness. The overall conclusions of the review remain unchanged for the comparisons of laparoscopic colposuspension with open and newer sling techniques. However, the addition of the three armed trial has lead to both subjective and objective outcomes favouring the use of sutures rather than mesh for the laparoscopic colposuspension procedures.<BR/>

<TITLE>Keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery through the abdomen for treating urinary incontinence in women</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-07-18 20:57:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Urinary incontinence is a common and often debilitating problem for many women. Around a third of women of child-bearing age are incontinent during physical exertion or when they cough, laugh or sneeze. When such 'stress' incontinence persists despite non-surgical treatment, surgery is often recommended. A significant amount of a woman's and their family's income can be spent on management of stress urinary incontinence.</P>
<P>Laparoscopic colposuspension is an operation carried out through a small incision in the abdomen to hold and support the tissues around the neck of the bladder. Women recover more quickly from laparoscopic colposuspension for urinary incontinence than from traditional, open surgery, with similar initial improvement. Longer-term success rates may be lower but this is uncertain. However, when laparoscopic colposuspension is compared with newer 'self-fixing' sling procedures, it appears that in the short term the sling procedures offer the greater benefits of minimal access techniques with similar, if not better cure rates.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>The review of trials found that both traditional colposuspension and newer 'self-fixing' slings had technically better results in the short term when compared with laparoscopic colposuspension. However, women's experience of improvement, both in the short and long term was similar for each type of operation. Using two stitches in laparoscopic colposuspensions was better than both one suture or the use of mesh. A trend was shown towards better outcomes for the laparoscopic operation when compared to open surgery, such as less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay, quicker time to return to normal activities and shorter duration of catheterisation. When the laparoscopic technique was compared to the newer vaginal sling procedures, all the aforementioned trends were in favour of the sling procedure.</P>
<P>In terms of costs, a non-systematic review of economic studies suggested that tension-free vaginal tape and open colposuspension would be cheaper than laparoscopic colposuspension.</P>
<P>The value of the review is limited by the size and quality of the trials and the few data about long-term results.</P>

<P>The review authors evaluated trials for methodological quality and their appropriateness for inclusion in the review. Two review authors extracted data and another cross checked them. Where appropriate, we calculated a summary statistic.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-18 20:49:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 22 eligible trials. Ten involved the comparison of laparoscopic with open colposuspension. Whilst the women's subjective impression of cure seemed similar for both procedures, in the short- and medium-term follow-up, there was some evidence of poorer results of laparoscopic colposuspension on objective outcomes. The results showed trends towards fewer perioperative complications, less postoperative pain and shorter hospital stay for laparoscopic compared with open colposuspension, however, laparoscopic colposuspension was more costly.</P>
<P>Eight studies compared laparoscopic colposuspension with newer 'self-fixing' vaginal slings. There were no significant differences in the reported short- and long-term subjective cure rates of the two procedures but objective cure rates at 18 months favoured slings. We observed no significant differences for postoperative voiding dysfunction and perioperative complications. Laparoscopic colposuspension had a significantly longer operation time and hospital stay.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>We found significantly higher subjective and objective one-year cure rates for women randomised to two paravaginal sutures compared with one suture in a single trial. Three studies compared sutures with mesh and staples for laparoscopic colposuspension and showed a trend towards favouring the use of sutures.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-18 20:54:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Currently available evidence suggests that laparoscopic colposuspension may be as good as open colposuspension at two years post surgery. However, the newer vaginal sling procedures appear to offer even greater benefits, better objective outcomes in the short term and similar subjective outcomes in the longer term. If laparoscopic colposuspension is performed, the use of two paravaginal sutures appears to be the most effective method. The place of laparoscopic colposuspension in clinical practice should become clearer when there are more data available describing long-term results. A brief economic commentary (BEC) identified three studies suggesting that tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) may be more cost-effective compared with laparoscopic colposuspension but laparoscopic colposuspension may be slightly more cost-effective when compared with open colposuspension after 24 months follow-up.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-18 20:59:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Urinary incontinence is a common and often debilitating problem for many adult women. Some degree of stress incontinence affects around a third of women of child-bearing age (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1996</LINK>). Continence is achieved by a combination of normal anatomical and physiological properties of the bladder, urethra and sphincter, the pelvic floor, and also the nervous system co-ordinating these organs. Disruption to any of these components may lead to incontinence.</P>
<P>There are different types of urinary incontinence. 'Stress urinary incontinence' (SUI) is defined by the symptom of involuntary loss of urine associated with physical exertion and activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure. The International Continence Society defines 'urodynamic stress incontinence' (USI) as the involuntary leakage of urine during increased abdominal pressure in the absence of a detrusor contraction, noted during filling cystometry (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 2002</LINK>). Therefore, diagnosis based on this definition requires urodynamic investigation. 'Urge urinary incontinence' is defined as involuntary loss of urine accompanied by or immediately preceded by urgency. Detrusor overactivity (DO) is a diagnosis of involuntary detrusor muscle contractions that are not due to neurological disorders; and the diagnosis must be made using urodynamic investigations (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 2002</LINK>). Mixed urinary incontinence is the complaint of involuntary leakage associated with urgency and also with exertion, effort, sneezing or coughing (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 2002</LINK>). This review includes women with SUI, proven urodynamic stress incontinence, women with symptoms of stress plus urge incontinence or other urinary symptoms diagnosed clinically or urodynamic stress incontinence plus detrusor overactivity diagnosed using urodynamics.</P>
<P>Stress urinary incontinence constitutes a huge financial economic burden to society. In the USA, the annual total direct costs of urinary incontinence in both men and women is over USD 16 billion (1995 USD) (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2011</LINK>) with societal costs of USD 26.2billion (1995 USD) (<LINK REF="REF-Wagner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 1998</LINK>). Approximately, USD 13.12 billion (1995 USD) of the total direct costs of urinary incontinence is spent on SUI (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kunkle-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunkle 2015</LINK>). About 70% of this USD 13.12 billion is borne by people with SUI, mainly through routine care (purchasing pads and disposable underwear (diapers), laundry and dry cleaning). This constitutes a significant individual financial burden. Of the remaining 30% of costs, 14% is spent on nursing home admission, 9% on treatment, 6% on addressing complications and 1% on diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>A study in the USA reported that about 1% of the median annual household income (USD 50,000 to USD 59,999 in 2006) was spent by women on incontinence management. This study estimated that women spent an annual mean amount of USD 751 to USD 1277 (2006 USD) on incontinence. This cost increases with the severity of the symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Subak-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subak 2008</LINK>). The indirect cost associated with SUI exerts a social and psychological burden that is unquantifiable (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilonzo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilonzo 2004</LINK>), nevertheless, <LINK REF="REF-Birnbaum-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birnbaum 2004</LINK> estimated that the annual average direct medical costs of SUI for one year (1998 USD) was USD 5642 and USD 4208 for indirect workplace costs. The cost of management and treatment of SUI appears to have increased over time due to increasing prevalence and increased desire for improved quality of life. This, in turn, has resulted from improved recognition of the condition, as well as increased use of surgical and non-surgical managements.</P>
<P>
Non-surgical treatments for SUI include conservative (<LINK REF="REF-Hay_x002d_Smith-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay-Smith 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hay_x002d_Smith-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay-Smith 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herbison-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbison 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wallace-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 2004</LINK>) and pharmacological therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Hay_x002d_Smith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay-Smith 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nabi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabi 2006</LINK>). These interventions are the subject of separate Cochrane Reviews. This review is one of a series of interrelated Cochrane Reviews of surgical approaches to the management of urinary incontinence. We refer the reader to another review in the series (<LINK REF="REF-Lapitan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lapitan 2009</LINK>) for further background information about the mechanisms of urinary incontinence in women, the principal categories of incontinence and the broad approaches to management.<BR/>
<BR/>Surgical procedures to remedy SUI generally aim to lift and support the urethro-vesical junction between the urethra and the bladder and increase bladder outlet resistance. There is disagreement, however, regarding the precise mechanism by which continence is achieved after surgery. The choice of procedures is often influenced by co-existent problems, a surgeon's specialty or preference and the physical features of the person affected. Numerous surgical methods have been described but essentially they fall into seven categories:</P>
<OL>
<LI>open abdominal retropubic urethropexy (e.g. colposuspension (Burch), Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz) (<LINK REF="REF-Lapitan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lapitan 2009</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>laparoscopic retropubic colposuspension (this review);</LI>
<LI>anterior vaginal repair (anterior colporrhaphy) (e.g. Kelly, Pacey) (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2001</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>suburethral slings (traditional and newer 'self-fixing') (<LINK REF="REF-Bezerra-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bezerra 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogah-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogah 2009</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>needle suspensions (e.g. Pereyra, Stamey) (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>periurethral injections (<LINK REF="REF-Keegan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keegan 2007</LINK>); and</LI>
<LI>artificial sphincters.</LI>
</OL>
<P>This review concentrates on laparoscopic retropubic colposuspension; other Cochrane Reviews address six of the other categories.</P>
<P>Laparoscopic incontinence procedures were first introduced in the early 1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Vancaillie-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vancaillie 1991</LINK>) with the advantage to women that they avoided the major incisions of conventional open surgery. It was claimed that this would result in shorter lengths of hospital stay and shorten the time to return to normal activities.</P>
<P>The most popular laparoscopic procedure for urinary incontinence is laparoscopic colposuspension. As in open colposuspension, sutures are inserted into the paravaginal tissues on either side of the bladder neck and then attached to the ileopectineal ligaments on the same side. There are, however, technical variations in surgery in respect of the laparoscopic approach (transperitoneal into the abdominal cavity or extraperitoneal) and in the number and types of sutures, the site of anchor and the use of mesh and staples (<LINK REF="REF-Jarvis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvis 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>We identified randomised and quasi-randomised trials using the above search strategy. We excluded studies from the review if they were not randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials for incontinent people or if they made comparisons other than those prespecified. Excluded studies are listed with reasons for their exclusion.</P>
<P>The review authors evaluated the reports of all possibly eligible studies for methodological quality and appropriateness for inclusion, without prior consideration of the results. Each review author assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane Incontinence assessment criteria, which include quality of random allocation and concealment, description of dropouts and withdrawals, analysis by intention to treat and blinding during treatment and at outcome assessment. We resolved any differences of opinion by discussion with a third party.</P>
<P>At least two review authors independently undertook data extraction of individual studies. Where data may have been collected but not reported, we sought clarification from the trialists. We planned to group trial data by type of incontinence, either urodynamic stress incontinence, based on a urodynamic diagnosis or stress or mixed incontinence, based upon a symptom classification. In the event, however, all included trials were limited to women with urodynamic stress incontinence.</P>
<P>Included trial data were processed as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). When appropriate, we carried out meta-analysis. For categorical outcomes, we derived a risk ratio (RR) by relating the number reporting an outcome to the number at risk in each group. For continuous variables we used means and standard deviations to derive a mean difference and combined studies to get a weighted mean difference (WMD). Where appropriate, we used a fixed-effect model to calculate the combined estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). We examined heterogeneity between trial results using visual inspection of the forest plot and taking into account the results of Chi<SUP>2</SUP> tests for heterogeneity and I<SUP>2 </SUP>tests (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Due to the small number of studies, we could not carry out sensitivity analyses for methodological quality.<BR/>
<BR/>We subgrouped trial data by type of material used for the laparoscopic colposuspension and the technique used for the self-fixing sling: either mesh or sutures and tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) or suprapubic arc (SPARC).<BR/>

<P>We identified 22 randomised trials of surgery for urinary incontinence, with laparoscopic colposuspension in at least one arm, to be included in this review.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sample characteristics</HEADING>
<P>Sample sizes ranged from 20 to 300, with the majority of the trials having fewer than 50 women in each arm. Judged on the study reports, all participants had prior urodynamic investigation although this was not always explicitly stated. All studies, therefore, appeared to have been undertaken on women with urodynamic stress incontinence. The inclusion and exclusion criteria varied in other respects. All but two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Morris-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ustun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ustun 2003</LINK>) stated their exclusion criteria.

In one study a random sequence of group allocation had initially been achieved by computer-generated random numbers in sealed, opaque envelopes; then four participants, who were not willing to undergo laparoscopic colposuspension, were enrolled to the open colposuspension group, the respective next participant was assigned to the laparoscopic procedure and the following participants went back to the sequence of random numbers (<LINK REF="STD-Su-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Su 1997</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data-dependent stopping</HEADING>
<P>Three trials were stopped earlier than intended. <LINK REF="STD-Persson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Persson 2000</LINK> set out to enrol 280 participants but the trialists became convinced during follow-up that one trial arm had a higher cure rate. For ethical reasons they therefore performed an interim analysis on the objective one-year cure rate on 108 participants, which confirmed a significantly higher cure rate in one group. Thereafter, further enrolment was stopped and only the 161 participants who had already been recruited were followed up and the analysis was adjusted for the early stopping. <LINK REF="STD-Su-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Su 1997</LINK> employed early stopping rules with evaluation points, which were determined before the beginning of the trial. The trial was stopped at the second evaluation point but no further explanation was given; 92 of 152 intended participants were recruited. In <LINK REF="STD-Valpas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Valpas 2004</LINK> the number of women recruited fell short of the target owing to limitations of time and recruiting problems and for these reasons this study was also stopped prematurely. However, in this study the groups were still considered to be comparable and the data were analysed without adjustment after stopping the study.</P>

All had different lengths of follow-up: Carey et al (<LINK REF="STD-Carey-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carey 2000</LINK>) for six months; Su et al (<LINK REF="STD-Su-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Su 1997</LINK>), Ankardal et al studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2005</LINK>), Cheon et al (<LINK REF="STD-Cheon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheon 2003</LINK>) and Summitt et al (<LINK REF="STD-Summitt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Summitt 2000</LINK>) for one year; Fatthy et al (<LINK REF="STD-Fatthy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fatthy 2001</LINK>) for six and 18 months; Smith et al (<LINK REF="STD-Kitchener-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kitchener 2006</LINK>) for six, 12 and 24 months; and Burton et al (<LINK REF="STD-Burton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 1997</LINK>) for six months, one year, three years and five years. Outcome data for 'six months to 18 months' were therefore available for eight studies. Longer-term data, over five years, were only available for two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Burton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2001</LINK>) and the study by Morris et al had only five to seven year follow-up data with no earlier follow-up results reported. The ability to synthesise data was also limited by the variable tests and definitions used to measure subjective and objective outcomes across the trials and failure to report standard deviations. For these reasons some data are reported in the 'Additional tables' (Tables 1-9).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Women's observations</HEADING>
<P>Subjective cure rates ranged from 58% to 96% in the open and 62% to 100% in the laparoscopic group within the 18 months follow-up, with a non-significant 5% lower relative subjective cure rate for laparoscopic colposuspension (Comparison 01.01.01; RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.00). Because of concerns about the effects of problems with randomisation and an inconsistent use of sutures for the different operations in the study <LINK REF="STD-Su-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Su 1997</LINK>, we re-ran the analysis after excluding this study and this did not change the results. The statistically significant heterogeneity mostly reflected the results of one Ankardal trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2004</LINK>), for which there were concerns that post randomisation withdrawals may have introduced bias. We could not include the results of the <LINK REF="STD-Burton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 1997</LINK> trial in these analyses because of the way they had presented the data. In this trial (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), based on visual analogue scales of 'cure', the open group had better results; increasingly so at three and five years. The <LINK REF="STD-Kitchener-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kitchener 2006</LINK> trial reported subjective cure rates at two years and there were no differences between the laparoscopic and open groups (Comparison 01.01.02; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.25). The study <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2001</LINK> reported data from five to seven years of follow-up, however, this differed from the results reported in <LINK REF="STD-Burton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 1997</LINK> as they showed that the laparoscopic colposuspension group had a significantly higher subjective cure rate than the open colposuspension group (Comparison 01.01.03; RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.35).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quantification of symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Two studies used urinary diaries and pad tests to quantify symptoms at follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Burton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fatthy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fatthy 2001</LINK>). The results for the <LINK REF="STD-Burton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 1997</LINK> are shown in the Additional tables (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Although both groups improved significantly after surgery this was less in the laparoscopic group. Furthermore, there was marked deterioration over time in this group such that by five years the mean number of incontinent episodes in the laparoscopic group was approaching the preoperative level. In contrast, there was no apparent difference between the groups in incontinent episodes at 18 months in Fatthy's study (<LINK REF="STD-Fatthy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fatthy 2001</LINK>) (Comparison 01.02; MD -0.12 episodes, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.92).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clinicians' measures</HEADING>
<P>All 10 studies assessed leakage on a clinical stress test and they reported the data as objective cure rates. Six studies used negative urodynamic testing as their definition of cure and four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kitchener-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kitchener 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2001</LINK>) used a negative pad test as their definition of objective cure. Overall, objective cure rate within 18 months showed a statistically significant reduction of RR in laparoscopic colposuspension, thus favouring open colposuspension (Comparison 01.03.01; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.96). The analysis for objective cure rates between 18 months and five years showed no significant differences between laparoscopic and open colposuspensions (Comparison 01.03.02; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.16). There was, however, evidence of heterogeneity with the smaller Burton (<LINK REF="STD-Burton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 1997</LINK>) trial greatly favouring open colposuspension. Similar results were seen with the analysis of objective cure rates after five years' follow-up as <LINK REF="STD-Burton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 1997</LINK> reported objective cure rates favouring the open technique, which was opposite to the findings from <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2001</LINK> (Comparison 01.03.03; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.27).</P>
<P>There were no statistically significant differences in de novo detrusor overactivity within 18 months (Comparison 01.04.01; RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.30). Longer-term follow-up data (between 18 months and five years and after five years) also showed no statistically significant difference (Comparisons 01.04.02 and 01.04.03; RR 1.00 and 1.22, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.12 and 0.40 to 3.75).</P>
<P>Similarly, there were no statistically significant differences in voiding dysfunction (Comparison 01.05; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.35). <LINK REF="STD-Burton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 1997</LINK> recorded higher residual urinary volumes at follow up in the laparoscopic group whereas in <LINK REF="STD-Fatthy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fatthy 2001</LINK> the residual volumes were similar in the two groups (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Six studies used urodynamic investigations to assess cure objectively. Overall, there was a significantly higher success rate following open colposuspension (Comparison 01.06; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.99). After exclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Su-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Su 1997</LINK> data the results still favoured open colposuspension (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.00).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Five studies measured quality of life using a variety of questionnaires (<LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carey-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carey 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cheon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheon 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kitchener-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kitchener 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Carey-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carey 2000</LINK> used the SF36 (Short Form 36), SUDI (Short Urogenital Distress Inventory) and IIQ questionnaires; both the SUDI and IIQ scores equally improved postoperatively in the two groups but no further details were available. <LINK REF="STD-Cheon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheon 2003</LINK> assessed quality of life but details of the instrument used and further results were lacking in the study report. In both their studies, Ankardal and colleagues used a visual analogue score (VAS) to assess the bother symptoms caused and their impact on different quality-of-life domains (<LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2005</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2004</LINK>, the scores had improved in all domains following surgery, in both groups; however, the improvement was greater in the open colposuspension group with regard to physical activity one year following surgery (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). The study by Smith and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Kitchener-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kitchener 2006</LINK>) used a number of validated questionnaires; these included SF-36, the Bristol Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptom Questionnaire (BFLUTS), Symptom Severity and Symptom Impact Index and the EQ-5D. Results for the SF-36 and EQ-5D were reported and showed that both treatment arms had improved scores after two years with no suggestion of any group differences (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Surgical outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>There were significantly fewer perioperative complications in the laparoscopic colposuspension group (Comparison 01.07; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.96). However, 21 bladder injuries were reported amongst 521 laparoscopic procedures compared with 10 amongst 507 open operations (Comparison 01.08; RR 1.88, 95% CI 0.93 to 3.83). Two studies reported cases of laceration to the obturator vein during laparoscopic colposuspension (<LINK REF="STD-Carey-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carey 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summitt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Summitt 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Women who underwent a laparoscopic colposuspension appeared to have significantly less pain and needed less postoperative analgesia but data from the studies were not presented in a form suitable for quantitative synthesis (<LINK REF="STD-Burton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carey-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carey 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cheon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheon 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fatthy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fatthy 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kitchener-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kitchener 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Su 1997</LINK>). All studies with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2001</LINK> reported the length of hospital stay to be longer for open colposuspension. Six studies reported data in such a way that could be analysed (Comparison 01.09; WMD 0.86 days, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.06) so favouring laparoscopic colposuspension due to a shorter hospital stay. There was, however, significant heterogeneity between the trials in this respect. The time to return to normal activities, where reported, was longer for open colposuspension (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>). Three women (10%) in the laparoscopic group in <LINK REF="STD-Burton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 1997</LINK> had repeat incontinence surgery compared with none in the open group; none of the other studies reported this outcome.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Laparoscopic surgery took significantly longer than open colposuspension in the majority of the studies (Comparison 01.11; MD 14.06 minutes, 95% CI 11.39 to 16.73). Although there was significant statistical heterogeneity the results of the three largest trials (contributing 85% of the weight) were consistent in suggesting a 14 to 17 minute difference. The estimated blood loss was higher in the open groups in all studies that reported these data (<LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>).

<P>Eight studies compared laparoscopic colposuspension with newer 'self-fixing' sling procedures (<LINK REF="STD-Adile-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Adile 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foote-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Foote 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mirosh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mirosh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Maher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paraiso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Paraiso 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Persson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Persson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ustun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ustun 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valpas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Valpas 2004</LINK>). Within these eight studies there were variations in the techniques (TVT or SPARC slings) and type of material (sutures or mesh) used for both of the procedures; for this reason we have displayed subgroups within the comparison graphs. All studies reported data within 18 months and the majority of the studies had follow-up at one year postoperatively (<LINK REF="STD-Foote-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Foote 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paraiso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Paraiso 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Persson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Persson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mirosh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mirosh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valpas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Valpas 2004</LINK>). The ability to synthesise data was limited in some areas by the variable tests and definitions used for subjective and objective outcomes and for this reason some data were reported in the Additional tables.

<P>Subjective cure rates were near equal in all studies that compared laparoscopy using sutures with vaginal slings, but <LINK REF="STD-Valpas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Valpas 2004</LINK> used a mesh for the laparoscopic colposuspension and the subjective cure rate favoured the sling procedure. Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in the reported subjective cure rates between laparoscopic colposuspension and vaginal sling procedures within 18 months (Comparison 02.01; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.02). This appeared to remain the case in the longer-term follow-up (four to eight years), as TVT was reported to have similar subjective cure rates as laparoscopic colposuspension (<LINK REF="STD-Paraiso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Paraiso 2004</LINK>) (Comparison 02.10; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.81).</P>

The objective cure rate was higher for TVT when compared with laparoscopy using sutures (Comparison 02.03.01; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.99) and also in <LINK REF="STD-Valpas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Valpas 2004</LINK>, when TVT was compared with laparoscopy using mesh (Comparison 02.03.02; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.86).

In <LINK REF="STD-Foote-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Foote 2004</LINK> there was no statistically significant difference between the groups for the objective cure rates within 18 months when laparoscopy (67% objective cure) was compared with SPARC sling (65% objective cure) (Comparison 02.03.03; RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.52).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-07-19 17:42:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The 22 eligible trials that were identified addressed only three of the pre-stated hypotheses. In particular, there were no comparisons with non-surgical management. Nevertheless, the three hypotheses that were addressed were the most obvious areas of clinical uncertainty. These were whether colposuspension should be performed laparoscopically rather than by open surgery; how laparoscopic colposuspension compares with other, newer minimal access procedures (self-fixing slings); and what laparoscopic techniques should be used.</P>
<P>To supplement the main systematic review of effects, we sought to identify economic evaluations that have compared laparoscopic colposuspension with any of the other main categories of surgical procedures listed in the background section. A supplementary search in NHS EED, MEDLINE and Embase identified two such economic evaluations.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Hypothesis 3: laparoscopic colposuspension versus open colposuspension</HEADING>
<P>Eight of the 10 trials comparing laparoscopic with open colposuspension were of good quality (<LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carey-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Carey 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cheon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheon 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fatthy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fatthy 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kitchener-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kitchener 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Summitt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Summitt 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Burton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 1997</LINK> had the potentially confounding factors of using absorbable sutures and the surgeon only having carried out a relatively small number of laparoscopic colposuspensions (fewer than 20) before commencing the trial. <LINK REF="STD-Cheon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cheon 2003</LINK> also involved surgeons with relatively little experience, only 15 previous laparoscopic colposuspensions. These factors may have influenced the results, in particular since there is believed to be a definite, albeit relatively steep, learning curve associated with laparoscopic colposuspension. The first of Ankardal's studies in 2004 (<LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2004</LINK>) differed from the other studies, as they used a polypropylene mesh and staples for the laparoscopic procedure rather than sutures; this may explain why this study has cure rates in favour of the open technique. However, if this study is removed from the analysis, the overall results do not change. <LINK REF="STD-Su-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Su 1997</LINK> had methodological problems with corrupted randomisation, confounding factors of performance of additional surgery in some participants, and the use of a different number of sutures for laparoscopic colposuspension (one suture) and open colposuspension (three sutures). As shown elsewhere in the review, the number of sutures used appears to have a significant influence on the cure rate, with more sutures resulting in a significantly higher success rate (<LINK REF="STD-Persson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Persson 2000</LINK>) (see below). For these reasons, we have repeated some meta-analyses in this review after excluding data from <LINK REF="STD-Su-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Su 1997</LINK>. This, again, did not have an effect on the meta-analysis results.</P>
<P>Three trials currently have data beyond 18 months' follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Burton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kitchener-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kitchener 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Burton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 1997</LINK> suggested poorer long-term results after laparoscopic surgery. This finding should be interpreted cautiously, however, as there are concerns that the surgeon's laparoscopic performance may have been suboptimal, as he had performed few laparoscopic colposuspensions when the trial started. The <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2001</LINK> results disagree and suggest poorer long-term cure rates for open colposuspension. However this trial has a very limited study report, in abstract form, and only reports five to seven years' follow up, with no earlier data. The data from <LINK REF="STD-Kitchener-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kitchener 2006</LINK> is more reliable, as it was a larger trial with multiple operators and the follow-up at two years showed no significant differences between the cure rates of the two procedures.</P>
<P>The data that are available up to a maximum of 18 months showed some inconsistencies. Outcomes assessed by the women participating (arguably the most important outcome) appear equally good in the two groups, whereas objectively and urodynamically-assessed cure rates were lower in the laparoscopic group.</P>
<P>No significant differences between the two groups were observed for postoperative urgency, voiding dysfunction or de novo detrusor overactivity. Other short-term outcomes have shown lower perioperative complication rates, longer operation times, less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay and a quicker overall recovery with laparoscopic colposuspension. All of these are consistent with reviews of other laparoscopic operations (<LINK REF="REF-McCormack-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormack 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is noteworthy that this rigorous systematic review has shown significant differences, in comparison with a published conventional review in the British Medical Journal. Thakar and Stanton (<LINK REF="REF-Thakar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thakar 2000</LINK>) quoted laparoscopic colposuspension to be 20% less successful than open colposuspension, which is not consistent with our findings. They quoted two references of which one was to a trial of poor methodological quality.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Economic evidence</HEADING>
<P>A cost-effectiveness analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Dumville-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumville 2006</LINK>, alongside a randomised controlled trial, compared open colposuspension with laparoscopic colposuspension in women with SUI in the UK. The cost analysis was conducted from the perspective of the UK NHS and healthcare resource use (2002 to 2003, GBP) relating to the surgery, associated hospital stay and first six months after hospital discharge were collected prospectively for each participant. The data required for the calculation of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were collected prospectively using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months.</P>
<P>The economic evaluation was for both a six-month and up-to-24-month time horizon. Healthcare resource use over six-month follow-up resulted in costs of GBP 1805 for the laparoscopic arm and GBP 1433 for the open arm (differential mean cost GBP 372, 95% credibility interval (CrI) 274 to 471). At six months, QALYs were slightly higher on average in the laparoscopic arm relative to the open arm (0.005, 95% CrI &#8211;0.012 to 0.023). On average the incremental cost per extra QALY provided by the laparoscopic approach was GBP 74,400 at six months. At 24 months, the laparoscopic arm again had higher mean QALYs compared to the open-surgery group (0.04, 95% CrI -0.009 to 0.086). If the laparoscopic colposuspension did not incur any significant additional costs after six months compared with open colposuspension, then the incremental cost per extra QALY reduced to GBP 9300 at 24 months. The probability that laparoscopic colposuspension is cost effective was 86% when the decision maker was willing to pay up to GBP 30,000 for an additional QALY. <LINK REF="REF-Dumville-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumville 2006</LINK> concluded that laparoscopic colposuspension is not cost effective when compared with open colposuspension during the first six months but the additional QALYs might be judged to be worth the additional cost after 24-months' follow-up.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Hypothesis 6: laparoscopic colposuspension versus newer 'self-fixing' sling procedures</HEADING>
<P>The eight trials that we included in this review comparing laparoscopic colposuspension with sling procedures involved only newer, 'self-fixing' slings. They were generally of good quality, with the exception of two (<LINK REF="STD-Adile-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Adile 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mirosh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mirosh 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Adile-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Adile 2001</LINK> gave no details of the randomisation process and the exact timing of the follow-up was unclear, being anywhere between 6 to 36 months. <LINK REF="STD-Mirosh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mirosh 2005</LINK> had no description of the randomisation or allocation process and had only a very small number of participants in each group (14 women in the laparoscopic group and 16 women in the TVT group). For these reasons, the data from these two trials must be interpreted with caution. <LINK REF="STD-Maher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Maher 2004</LINK> only recruited women with recurrent urinary stress incontinence and this different inclusion criterion may have influenced the results from this trial.</P>
<P>As the 'self-fixing' vaginal slings are relatively new procedures, long-term follow-up studies are lacking. Only one study reported long-term follow-up of four to eight years (<LINK REF="STD-Paraiso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Paraiso 2004</LINK>). Overall, this review has shown that the subjective cure rates are equally good for both of these minimal access techniques, both in the short and long term. However, the objective cure rate within 18 months appears to favour the vaginal sling technique, especially TVT, when compared to laparoscopy using a mesh or sutures. However, three studies assessed the urodynamic cure rate (<LINK REF="STD-Maher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Maher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paraiso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Paraiso 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ustun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ustun 2003</LINK>), all comparing laparoscopic sutures with TVT, and there was no significant difference in the outcome rates. There were no significant differences between the two procedures for the rates of postoperative voiding dysfunction, de novo detrusor overactivity and perioperative complications.</P>
<P>Laparoscopy has a longer operation time, longer hospital stay and slower return to normal activities. The re-operation rates at one year were reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Persson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Persson 2002</LINK>) and TVT had a higher re-operation rate. Longer-term data are now emerging with regard to laparoscopic colposuspension and there is a need for more long-term follow-up of 'self-fixing' sling procedures. One study in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Paraiso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Paraiso 2004</LINK>) reported long-term follow-up and concluded that TVT has similar long-term satisfaction rates to laparoscopic colposuspension. However, the study also reported that a substantial proportion of subjects had some degree of urinary incontinence at four to eight years following surgery, but the majority was not bothersome. Like laparoscopic surgery, the newer vaginal slings have all the advantages of minimal access techniques, and this review has shown that they are as, if not more, clinically effective than laparoscopic colposuspension. As the skill needed to perform laparoscopic colposuspension is greater than that needed for the 'self-fixing' slings, many surgeons training in the techniques of surgery for urinary stress incontinence are more likely to become efficient in the sling procedures. While there is still a trend in favour of the sling procedures, more studies reporting longer-term data are needed as unanticipated and even anticipated complications may arise from these newer procedures.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Valpas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valpas 2006</LINK> reported a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial that compared laparoscopic mesh colposuspension with TVT as a primary surgical treatment in women with SUI over a follow-up period of one year in Finland. The primary outcome was negative stress test and 48-hour pad test (&lt;8g/48h) and secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life. These were collected prospectively during the main period of hospitalisation, six weeks after surgery, and after one year of follow-up. Cost items included costs of the treatments in each treatment arm, other hospital costs, and productivity costs.</P>
<P>Primary and secondary outcomes in the TVT group were significantly better than laparoscopic mesh colposuspension as measured by the negative stress test (60 versus 29; 95% CI for change between the groups 12.7 to 43.9), visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 = no inconvenience at all; 10 = maximal inconvenience) (0.8 versus 2.4; 95% CI for change between the groups 0.65 to 2.07), and Urinary Incontinence Severity Score (UISS) (1.1 versus 2.8; 95% CI for change between the groups 0.27 to 2.94). The between-group difference in the 48-hour pad test did not reach statistical significance (3 versus 12.4; 95% CI for change between the groups -2.8 to 30.4; P = 0.105). The total costs per participant at one year of follow-up for laparoscopic mesh colposuspension was EUR 3262 while TVT cost EUR 2081 (2000 EUR). <LINK REF="REF-Valpas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valpas 2006</LINK> concluded that when the VAS or UISS are used as the outcome measure, TVT is more cost-effective than laparoscopic mesh colposuspension over a follow-up period of one year (P &lt; 0.0001).</P>
<P>Another cost-effectiveness analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Cody-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cody 2003</LINK>) compared TVT with Burch colposuspension, laparoscopic colposuspension, traditional suburethral retropubic sling procedure and injectables. The study utilised clinical data from a systematic review of RCTs conducted up to mid-2002 and the results modelled for a time horizon of up to 10 years. The analysis of costs and resources used was based on the UK payer&#8217;s perspective (UK National Health Service). Based on clinical evidence, this study assumed that traditional sling effectiveness was equivalent to open colposuspension, that the effectiveness of laparoscopic colposuspension was equivalent to or possibly worse than open colposuspension, and that use of injectables was the least effective procedure. This study reported the cost (2001 GBP) to be GBP 1058 per woman with an average of 2.9 days hospital stay for TVT, GBP 1317 per woman and average hospital stay of 4.6 days for laparoscopic colposuspension, GBP 1301 per woman and average hospital stay of 7.1 days for open colposuspension, GBP 1340 per woman and average hospital stay of 7.2 days for traditional sling and GBP 1305 per woman with an average hospital stay of 2 days for injectables. The study concluded that TVT was more likely to be considered cost-effective compared with the other surgical procedures based on the assumptions that traditional slings have the same effectiveness as open colposuspension and are also more costly; that laparoscopic colposuspension has the same or lower effectiveness as open colposuspension and similar costs; and that injectable agents are less effective than TVT but of greater cost.</P>
<P>We did not subject these two identified economic evaluations to critical appraisal and we do not attempt to draw any firm or general conclusions regarding the relative costs or efficiency of laparoscopic colposuspension in treatment of SUI<I>. </I>However, the economic evidence available suggests that laparoscopic colposuspension is not cost-effective when compared with TVT in the treatment of SUI in women.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">i) One suture versus two sutures</HEADING>
<P>A single study (<LINK REF="STD-Persson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Persson 2000</LINK>) comparing different numbers of paravaginal sutures found a significantly higher objective one year cure rate (dry on 'ultrashort' pad test) for women randomised to two sutures compared with one suture, with a 83% cure rate for two sutures and a 58% cure rate for one suture. These findings were supported by a significantly higher subjective impression of cure in the two-sutures group compared to the one-suture group, with subjective cure rates of 89% and 65% respectively.</P>
<P>This study was of good quality, with adequate group allocation. However, the trial was stopped early as it became apparent at an interim analysis that two sutures were superior to one suture. Such data-dependent stopping may lead to an exaggeration of the true effect size. Another concern is the potential confounding from one third of the women having additional surgery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">ii) Sutures versus mesh and staples</HEADING>
<P>Sutures appeared to be more effective than mesh and staples. Two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ross-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zullo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zullo 2001</LINK>) were small and the confidence intervals were wide. Cure was not clearly defined and it was unclear how the women were randomised in <LINK REF="STD-Ross-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 1995</LINK>; we assumed that they used a negative cough stress test as a proof of cure, which was found to be similar for both groups. They did not report subjective measures. The trialists set out to prove equivalence between the two techniques as they found the technique of mesh and staples much easier to apply than sutures. However, the methodological problems mean that this question was not addressed reliably by this study. <LINK REF="STD-Zullo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zullo 2001</LINK> was of a similar size with clearly stated definitions of both objective and subjective cure, and adequate randomisation and concealment of allocation. This study reported outcomes in favour of sutures. The analysis with the addition of <LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2005</LINK>, which is a larger study and of good quality, showed significant subjective and objective outcomes favouring the use of sutures over mesh. However, <LINK REF="STD-Ankardal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ankardal 2005</LINK> had fewer perioperative complications (mainly bladder perforations) with the mesh and staples technique, making the overall analysis results favour the use of mesh for perioperative complications.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Wallwiener-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wallwiener 1995</LINK>, comparing transperitoneal with extraperitoneal laparoscopic colposuspension, was of poor quality and had very small numbers of participants.

Their cure rate was expressed as an overall 'subjective and objective' cure. Women's evaluation of cure was part of the outcome measures but it is unclear how it contributed. The cure rate was not given separately for the two groups. All the above make valid conclusions from this study impossible.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-07-19 17:28:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Like other laparoscopic operations, laparoscopic colposuspension appears to have short-term benefits over open surgery, such as quicker recovery, less pain and fewer perioperative complications; but it appears to be more costly and takes longer to perform. A single trial raises concerns about the long-term performance but this may reflect a learning effect and is not reliable data on its own. The recent addition of medium-term results from a large, multicentre trial is encouraging for the effectiveness of laparoscopic colposuspension. Newer sling procedures appear to offer even greater benefits of minimal access surgery, have better objective outcomes in the short term, and similar subjective outcomes in the longer term. If laparoscopic colposuspension is performed, two paravaginal sutures appear to be more effective than one suture or the use of mesh and staples. It is unclear whether an extraperitoneal approach has advantages over a transperitoneal method. The place of laparoscopic colposuspension in clinical practice should become clearer when ongoing trials with longer-term data are reported.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-07-19 17:28:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To provide further information there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes to assess the effectiveness of laparoscopic colposuspension in comparison with other surgical and non-surgical management options. Further recruitment to ongoing trials should be strongly encouraged and good reporting is needed to make these and completed trials worthwhile.</P>
<P>Future research in incontinence treatments should incorporate standardised, validated and simple outcome measures that are relevant to women who have incontinence in order to allow comparison across studies, particularly with regard to quality of life and economic health measures.</P>
<P>Surgical trials related to urinary incontinence should systematically address surgical morbidity outcomes such as adverse perioperative events, pain scores, length of hospital stay, time to return to normal activities, development of urge symptoms or detrusor overactivity and, especially, the need for repeat surgery or alternative interventions.</P>
<P>Long-term follow-up is essential for the proper evaluation of incontinence treatments, and this should be included in all trials of laparoscopic colposuspension.</P>

<P>We performed additional searches for the brief economic commentary (BEC). These were conducted in NHS EED (1st Quarter 2016), MEDLINE (1 January 1946 to March 2017) and Embase (1 January 1980 to 2017 Week 12). All searches were conducted on 6 April 2017. We used one search strategy on NHS EED (OVID) and two different search strategies on MEDLINE and Embase (OvidSP). Details of the searches run and the search terms used can be found below. </P>
