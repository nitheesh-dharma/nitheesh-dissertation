<P>Children with cancer are prone to developing infection. One of the viral infections is influenza (flu). This can run an innocent course in these children, but some can develop severe complications. This review therefore focused on the efficacy of influenza vaccination in children with cancer. We identified no studies that assessed the clinical efficacy of influenza vaccination; however, we identified one additional controlled clinical trial in our update, which brings the total to nine studies that assessed immune responses after vaccination in children with cancer. It was shown that children receiving chemotherapy mount poorer immune responses than healthy children, but that the vaccine can be safely administered. On the basis of this updated review, it is not possible to recommend or discourage influenza vaccination in children with cancer who are treated with chemotherapy. A future trial should address the clinical benefits of influenza vaccination in children with cancer who are treated with chemotherapy.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-07-15 14:02:07 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 to 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to 2012) up to August 2012. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings of the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) and the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP).</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-07-15 14:02:07 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) in which the serological response to influenza vaccination of children with cancer was compared with that of control groups.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-16 11:23:26 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 1 RCT and 9 CCTs (total number of participants = 770). None of the included studies reported clinical outcomes. All included studies reported on influenza immunity and adverse reactions to vaccination. In five studies, immune responses to influenza vaccine were compared in 272 children receiving chemotherapy and 166 children not receiving chemotherapy. In four studies, responses to influenza vaccine were assessed in 236 children receiving chemotherapy compared with responses in 142 healthy children. Measures used to assess immune responses included a four-fold rise in antibody titre after vaccination, development of a haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre &gt; 32 and pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean titres (GMTs). Immune responses in children receiving chemotherapy were consistently weaker (four-fold rise of 38% to 65%) than those in children who had completed chemotherapy (50% to 86%) and in healthy children (53% to 89%). In terms of adverse effects, 391 paediatric oncology patients received influenza vaccine, and the adverse effects described included mild local reactions and low-grade fever. No life-threatening or persistent adverse effects were reported.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-15 15:38:57 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Paediatric oncology patients receiving chemotherapy are able to generate an immune response to the influenza vaccine, but it remains unclear whether this immune response protects them from influenza infection or its complications. We are awaiting results from well-designed RCTs addressing the clinical benefit of influenza vaccination in these patients.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-16 11:31:26 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic viral infections have led to the discovery that common community-acquired respiratory viruses are major pathogens associated with significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised or chronically ill patient populations (<LINK REF="STD-Hicks-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hicks 2003</LINK>). In oncology patients, the main risk factor associated with viral infection is disruption of the cellular immune response. The duration and severity of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia are of lesser importance (<LINK REF="REF-Sandherr-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandherr 2006</LINK>). It has been shown that in 30% to 60% of immunocompromised patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic pneumonia (clinical or radiological findings in accordance with pneumonia), the condition is caused by viruses among which influenza is a major contributor (<LINK REF="STD-Hicks-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hicks 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Influenza virus infection occurs in yearly epidemics. An influenza epidemic may last five to six weeks and can be associated with attack rates as high as 20% in the general population, and possibly higher in the immunocompromised population. In patients who are hospitalised (mainly elderly and immunocompromised patients), nosocomial transmission rates reach 55% to 83% (<LINK REF="REF-Dykewicz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dykewicz 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raad-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raad 1997</LINK>). Paediatric oncology patients are highly susceptible to influenza infection (<LINK REF="STD-Chisholm-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chisholm 2001</LINK>), have an increased rate of influenza infection compared with healthy controls and may have prolonged influenza infections compared with healthy controls (<LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kempe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kempe 1989</LINK>). Although the illness usually runs a mild course in children with cancer, it may result in hospitalisation, interruption of chemotherapy and administration of antibiotics. Severe and fatal complications involving mainly secondary infections and haemophagocytic syndromes have been reported in paediatric oncology patients with influenza infection (<LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kempe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kempe 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Potter-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mainstay of influenza prophylaxis in the general population is vaccination. It is safe and immunogenic and shows 70% to 90% efficacy in preventing influenza when a good antigenic match exists between the vaccine and the epidemic virus (<LINK REF="STD-Hicks-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hicks 2003</LINK>). According to the 2010 guidelines of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (<LINK REF="REF-Fiore-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiore 2010</LINK>) used in the USA, vaccination with the inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended for the following groups, who are at increased risk of complications from influenza: (1) all children aged 6 months to 5 years (59 months); (2) all persons aged &gt; 50 years; (3) adults and children who have chronic pulmonary (including asthma) or cardiovascular (except isolated hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurological, hematological, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus); (4) persons who have immunosuppression (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)); (5) women who are or will be pregnant during the influenza season; (6) children and adolescents (aged 6 months to 18 years) who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection; (7) residents of nursing homes and other long-term-care facilities; (8) American Indians/Alaskan Natives; (9) persons who are morbidly obese (body mass index (BMI) &gt; 40); (10) health care professionals (HCPs); (11) household contacts and caregivers of children aged &lt; 5 years and adults aged &gt; 50 years, with particular emphasis on vaccinating contacts of children aged &lt; 6 months; and (12) household contacts and caregivers of persons with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza (<LINK REF="REF-Fiore-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiore 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The inactivated vaccine involves no risk of introducing active infection, and it is regarded as safe in immunocompromised individuals, even in paediatric oncology patients. Defects involving both cell-mediated and humoral immunity frequently accompany malignancies, and chemotherapy induces myelosuppression, so that suboptimal responses to vaccination might be expected in patients with malignant disease. Immunological responses are generally less than expected in healthy persons and may depend on the timing of vaccination relative to chemotherapy. However, a paucity of data is available for paediatric oncology patients, and the patient groups are heterogeneous with regard to underlying malignancy, chemotherapeutic regimens and the type, dose, timing and route of administration of influenza vaccines. Antibody levels considered protective in healthy individuals may not prevent clinical infection in those with malignant disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ring-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ring 2002</LINK>). This is an update of the first systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Goossen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goossen 2009</LINK>) undertaken to evaluate the state of evidence on the efficacy of influenza vaccination in paediatric oncology patients treated with chemotherapy. We systematically reviewed all data - not only clinical consequences (including adverse effects), but also immunological responses.</P>

<P>After performing searches of the electronic databases the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE/Ovid (in February 2007), we identified 3172 titles of reports of potentially relevant studies, which we screened for retrieval. We excluded 3136 reports by screening titles and abstracts. We then retrieved 36 reports for detailed assessment; a further 28 were then excluded. After searching the conference proceedings and reference lists of relevant studies and reviews, we identified nine additional reports for detailed assessment. None of these were included. A complete list with reasons for exclusion is presented in the table of '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' (n = 36).

In five of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chisholm-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chisholm 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lange-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lange 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matsuzaki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Matsuzaki 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1980</LINK>), responses to different strains of influenza vaccine, in a total of 272 children with cancer receiving chemotherapy, were compared with those of 166 children with cancer not receiving chemotherapy during the four weeks before vaccination. In four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lange-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lange 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Porter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Porter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shahgholi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shahgholi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1980</LINK>), responses to different strains of influenza vaccine in a total of 236 children with cancer receiving chemotherapy were compared with those in 142 healthy children.

<P>Data on quality assessment of the eight included CCTs are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. The CCTs were of almost equal quality scoring. Each scored between seven and nine stars, when the maximum possible was nine.</P>
<P>Six of the included studies did not have a complete follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Chisholm-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chisholm 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chisholm-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chisholm 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lange-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lange 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Porter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Porter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shahgholi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shahgholi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1980</LINK>). In two of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chisholm-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chisholm 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Porter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Porter 2004</LINK>), the number of participants lost to follow-up was small and was unlikely to introduce bias. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Shahgholi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shahgholi 2010</LINK>), data on adverse reactions were available for only 56% of participants. No loss to follow-up was reported for other outcomes. In the remaining studies, a large percentage of participants was lost to follow-up, respectively, 36% of non-immunised participants in <LINK REF="STD-Chisholm-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chisholm 2001</LINK>, 29% of participants receiving chemotherapy in <LINK REF="STD-Lange-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lange 1979</LINK> and 52% of participants receiving chemotherapy in <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1980</LINK>. These three studies are susceptible to attrition bias because loss to follow-up is greater than 20%. Reasons for loss to follow-up were stated in <LINK REF="STD-Chisholm-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chisholm 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1980</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Lange-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lange 1979</LINK>, reasons for loss to follow-up were not stated. However, the high percentage of loss to follow-up is noted at 12 months after the first vaccination, althoughoutcomes relevant to this review are assessed one month after the last vaccination. Loss to follow-up one month after the last vaccination was less than 20%.</P>
<P>Ages of children in the different groups (i.e. children receiving chemotherapy, children not receiving chemotherapy and healthy children) were comparable, except in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chisholm-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chisholm 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chisholm-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chisholm 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1980</LINK>). In two of these (<LINK REF="STD-Chisholm-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chisholm 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chisholm-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chisholm 2005</LINK>), the mean age or range of age of the children is not stated. In the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1980</LINK>), children receiving chemotherapy were about three years younger than those off chemotherapy.

<P>In the one included RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2002a</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>), the method of randomisation was not stated, allocation concealment and blinding of care providers was unclear and no blinding of participants was performed.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse reactions related to influenza vaccination (such as arm soreness, fever, myalgias, fatigue, malaise, headache)</HEADING>
<P>In the included studies, a total of 391 paediatric oncology participants who were being treated with chemotherapy received influenza vaccine. In all of the included studies, a statement was made concerning adverse effects after vaccination. Eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chisholm-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chisholm 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gross-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lange-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lange 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Porter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Porter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shahgholi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shahgholi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1980</LINK>) described the procedure that was used for assessment of adverse effects. Assessment of outcomes in these studies was performed most often by parents.</P>
<P>No reports described life-threatening or persistent adverse effects. The studies reported "occasional" mild local reactions and low-grade fever (<LINK REF="STD-Lange-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lange 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shahgholi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shahgholi 2010</LINK> (last study not complete data for adverse events)). The number and severity of adverse reactions after vaccination in the children receiving chemotherapy and in the healthy controls did not differ significantly (<LINK REF="STD-Porter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Porter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shahgholi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shahgholi 2010</LINK> (last study not complete data for adverse events)).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-07-15 14:02:08 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of the first systematic review on the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in children being treated for cancer. We have identified a total of nine CCTs and one RCT that were extracted from nine studies fulfilling our inclusion criteria. Unfortunately, no available study compares influenza vaccine with placebo in children being treated for cancer. Furthermore, none of the included studies have reported on clinical outcome measures, such as confirmed influenza during the influenza season, hospitalisation, delay in chemotherapy and mortality. All included studies reported on the outcome measures of influenza immunity and adverse reactions to vaccination.</P>
<P>The included studies demonstrated that paediatric oncology participants receiving chemotherapy were able to generate an immune response to influenza vaccine. However, they had weaker immune responses compared with healthy children, children with asthma or paediatric oncology participants who had completed chemotherapy more than one month before vaccination. Immune responses of the latter were comparable with those of healthy children. The differences in immune response between these groups were noted, irrespective of the method used to assess the immune response (i.e. four-fold rise in antibody titre, seroprotection or pre- and post-vaccination GMT) and irrespective of the type of malignancy. The difference in response between these groups is most likely explained by immunosuppression, as much from chemotherapeutic agents as from the malignancy as such. Only one study found comparable immune responses in participants with solid tumours receiving chemotherapy compared with participants off chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Chisholm-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chisholm 2005</LINK>). The differences might be that solid tumours, not haematological malignancies, were studied, and that the control group was very small compared with the experimental group.</P>
<P>In reports of influenza vaccination in paediatric oncology participants, it is often stated that data are conflicting regarding the immune response to influenza vaccination, as some studies reveal a sufficient immune response but others fail to do so (<LINK REF="STD-Gross-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lange-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Lange 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matsuzaki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Matsuzaki 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Porter-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Porter 2004</LINK>). This can be explained by a difference in participant populations in these studies. A more sufficient immune response is generally found in studies in which most of the children had completed chemotherapy longer than one month ago. Because the objective of this review was to evaluate response in children receiving chemotherapy, the aforementioned studies were excluded.</P>
<P>Influenza vaccine was safely administered to paediatric oncology participants in the included studies. Adverse effect outcomes were most often assessed by parents; therefore the studies were susceptible to detection bias. No reports described life-threatening or persistent adverse reactions in any of the included studies. However, it should be noted that children can develop fever in response to vaccination, and in such a case administration of antibiotics may be required in children with cancer. Participants receiving chemotherapy had a higher incidence of malaise and poor appetite after vaccination than did those with asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2002b</LINK>). However, patients receiving chemotherapy are known to experience these symptoms frequently as a consequence of their treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The immune response generated by influenza vaccination in children with cancer may reduce the risk of influenza infection in these children. However, as has been mentioned, none of the studies included in this review reported on clinical outcome measures. It is not known whether the antibody titres achieved after vaccination are effective in protecting these children from influenza infection and its complications during the following influenza season or in decreasing the severity of such infection. Therefore, the question of whether influenza vaccination is clinically beneficial for paediatric oncology patients receiving chemotherapy remains unanswered.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>The included studies used different immunisation schedules (according to guidelines from Japan, UK and USA), routes of administration (subcutaneous and intramuscular) and dosages. The results of the studies using different vaccinations were comparable. However, this could not be verified by statistical analysis, as no meta-analysis could be carried out because of the lack of included RCTs.</P>
<P>All children in the different studies were younger than 18 years of age. Ages of children in the different groups (i.e. children receiving chemotherapy, children not receiving chemotherapy and healthy children) were comparable, except in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chisholm-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chisholm 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chisholm-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chisholm 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1980</LINK>). In two of these (<LINK REF="STD-Chisholm-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chisholm 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chisholm-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chisholm 2005</LINK>), the mean age or the range of age of the children is not stated. In the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Steinherz-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Steinherz 1980</LINK>), children receiving chemotherapy were about three years younger than those off chemotherapy. Age is a possible confounder for immune response.</P>
<P>The included studies had relatively small sample sizes. The results described are all based on separate small studies. Larger trials are needed to verify the results of these studies.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-15 14:02:08 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-07-15 14:02:08 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In national guidelines, it is recommended that children who are being treated for cancer should be vaccinated against influenza. Clinical evidence from randomised controlled studies to support this recommendation is lacking. It has been shown in the trials included in this review that these patients are able to generate an immune response to influenza vaccine, but it remains unclear whether this immune response protects them from influenza infection or its complications. Influenza vaccination appears to be safe in these children. Clinicians must consider the benefits and risks of influenza vaccination in children with cancer, while awaiting results from randomised controlled trials addressing the clinical benefit of influenza vaccination in these patients.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-07-15 14:02:08 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate clinical outcome, a well-designed prospective, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial of influenza vaccination in children being treated for cancer is necessary. This trial should have a minimal risk of bias and should carefully define and measure clinically relevant outcomes, including laboratory-confirmed influenza infection, pneumonia, hospitalisation and mortality. It should be realised that many practical difficulties are involved in conducting such a trial. Many participants would have to be included as the incidence of influenza is fairly low, particularly in non-epidemic years. The effectiveness of the vaccine is best determined during epidemic years in which a good match between the vaccine and circulating strains exists. However, the degree of matching is not known until the influenza season starts, and by this time the trial should already have begun. Also, a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed influenza may be difficult to achieve as paediatric oncology patients may receive supportive care in centres other than their primary oncology centre. Only when such a trial has been conducted can evidence-based judgements on the value of influenza vaccine in these children be made. We welcome suggestions on all aspects of such a multi-centre trial, as well as potential participating centres.</P>
