<P>Not enough evidence for the use of diuretics for preventing pre-eclampsia.</P>
<P>Pre-eclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy occurring in about 10% of women. It is identified by increased blood pressure and protein in the urine. Initially, women may not experience any symptoms. Constriction of blood vessels in the placenta, a feature of the disease, interferes with food and oxygen passing to the baby, thus slowing the baby's growth and sometimes it causes the baby to be born prematurely. Some women are affected by generalised swelling and, rarely, may have fits. Diuretic drugs cause people to excrete more urine and relax the blood vessels thus reducing the blood pressure. Because of these effects, it has been suggested that these drugs might prevent women from getting pre-eclampsia. On this basis, these drugs began to be used in pregnancy; however, it was thought that they might interfere with the normal expansion in the blood volume during pregnancy and thus increase the risk of pre-eclampsia. This review of five randomised controlled trials, involving 1836 women, sought to examine the evidence for diuretics for preventing pre-eclampsia. All trials compared diuretics with either placebo or no treatment. However, only four trials (1391 women) reported on pre-eclampsia. There were no significant differences in the outcomes except that diuretics were associated with more nausea and vomiting.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Diuretics are used to reduce blood pressure and oedema in non-pregnant individuals. Formerly, they were used in pregnancy with the aim of preventing or delaying the development of pre-eclampsia. This practice became controversial when concerns were raised that diuretics may further reduce plasma volume in women with pre-eclampsia, thereby increasing the risk of adverse effects on the mother and baby, particularly fetal growth. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-06-10 14:17:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Five studies (1836 women) were included. All were of uncertain quality. The studies compared thiazide diuretics with either placebo or no intervention. There were no clear differences between the diuretic and control groups for any reported pregnancy outcomes including pre-eclampsia (four trials, 1391 women; risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.03), perinatal death (five trials,1836 women; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.27), and preterm birth (two trials, 465 women; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.41). There were no small-for-gestational-age babies in the one trial that reported this outcome, and there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate any clear differences between the two groups for birthweight (one trial, 20 women; mean difference 139 grams, 95% CI -484.40 to 762.40).</P>
<P>Thiazide diuretics were associated with an increased risk of nausea and vomiting (two trials, 1217 women; RR 5.81, 95% CI 1.04 to 32.46), and women allocated diuretics were more likely to stop treatment due to side effects compared to those allocated placebo (two trials, 1217 women; RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.81 to 4.22).<BR/>

<P>There is insufficient evidence to draw reliable conclusions about the effects of diuretics on prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications. However, from this review, no clear benefits have been found from the use of diuretics to prevent pre-eclampsia.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-10 13:46:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Pre-eclampsia is diagnosed on the basis of hypertension (raised blood pressure) with proteinuria (protein in the urine) after 20 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Gifford-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gifford 2000</LINK>). This multi-system disorder complicates between 2% and 8% of all pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1988</LINK>). It is an important cause of maternal and perinatal death worldwide; 10% to 15% of maternal deaths in low- and middle-income countries are associated with the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 1992</LINK>). In the United Kingdom, hypertensive disease of pregnancy remains the second cause of direct maternal deaths (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2001</LINK>). Even when death is avoided, there is the risk of serious morbidity associated with the disease. Mothers can suffer from eclampsia (seizures), renal failure (kidney damage), disseminated intravascular coagulation (blood clotting disorders), myocardial infarction (heart attacks), cerebro-vascular accident (stroke), retinal detachment (blindness) and the HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets). The baby can have intrauterine growth restriction (fail to grow properly within the uterus) or be born prematurely resulting in complications such as hyaline membrane disease (immaturity of the lungs), intraventricular haemorrhages (brain haemorrhages), and necrotising enterocolitis (bleeding in the bowel). Although many women with pre-eclampsia have no long-term problems and give birth to healthy babies, any treatment that can prevent or ameliorate pre-eclampsia will be of great benefit to pregnant women and their babies. Currently, the only cure for the disease is delivery of the baby and the placenta, but this leads to many babies being born prematurely and vulnerable to the problems described above. Further information on pre-eclampsia can be found in the generic protocol on interventions for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences (<LINK REF="REF-Generic-Protocol-05" TYPE="REFERENCE">Generic Protocol 05</LINK>). This protocol, 'Interventions for preventing pre-eclampsia and its consequences: generic protocol', was designed as an Health Technology Assessment proposal to assess several interventions for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in a similar manner.</P>
<P>Several interventions have been suggested for prevention of pre-eclampsia. Other Cochrane reviews cover calcium supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2006</LINK>), magnesium supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Makrides-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makrides 2001</LINK>), energy and protein intake (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2003</LINK>), salt intake (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2005</LINK>), antiplatelet agents (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2003</LINK>), and antioxidants (<LINK REF="REF-Rumbold-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rumbold 2005</LINK>). Antiplatelet agents were found to have small to moderate benefits, and calcium supplementation appears to be beneficial for women at high risk of gestational hypertension and in communities with low dietary calcium intake. Supplementing women with antioxidants during pregnancy was not associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia.</P>
<P>Diuretics are commonly used to treat hypertension in non-pregnant individuals. They were also formerly used in pregnancy to treat high blood pressure, and delay or prevent the onset of pre-eclampsia. Historically, the rationale for their use in preventing pre-eclampsia was based on the incorrect supposition that excess sodium (as salt) intake and retention caused the disease. As diuretics promote excretion of sodium and decrease oedema and blood pressure in non-pregnant people, it was assumed that they would be beneficial in preventing pre-eclampsia. In the 1960s, the prophylactic use of thiazide diuretics in pregnancy was advocated to protect the mother from pre-eclampsia and reduce perinatal mortality and prematurity (<LINK REF="STD-Finnerty-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Finnerty 1966</LINK>). This practice became widespread, with up to 40% of pregnant women being given continuous diuretic therapy in pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Gray-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Gray 1968</LINK>). Women with essential hypertension are at increased risk of superimposed pre-eclampsia, presenting as de novo proteinuria after 20 weeks' gestation. These women in particular were thought likely to benefit from diuretic therapy.</P>
<P>The use of diuretics in pregnancy became controversial with increasing evidence of the reduction of plasma volume (the non-cellular part of the blood) in pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Hays-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hays 1985</LINK>). Women who use diuretics from early pregnancy do not increase their plasma volume to the degree usual in normal pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Sibai-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sibai 1984</LINK>). There were theoretical concerns that diuretics might worsen the existing hypovolaemia (low blood plasma volume) in women with pre-eclampsia, with adverse effects on the mother and fetus, particularly fetal growth (<LINK REF="REF-Gifford-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gifford 2000</LINK>). However, there is no firm clinical evidence that diuretics cause harm in pregnancy. Indeed, although the acute blood pressure lowering effect of thiazide diuretics is due to plasma volume contraction, over several weeks renal (kidney) compensatory mechanisms return plasma volume towards normal levels. Cardiac output returns to pretreatment levels, but total peripheral vascular (blood vessel) resistance remains low. The sustained blood pressure lowering effect of thiazide diuretics is thought to involve mobilisation of excess sodium from the arteriolar (blood vessel) wall, with widening of the vessel lumen (<LINK REF="REF-Mabie-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mabie 1986</LINK>). This might theoretically be of benefit in the pathological vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels), which is an important characteristic of pre-eclampsia.</P>
<P>There have also been case reports of maternal side effects of diuretics in pregnancy including hypokalaemia (low potassium levels), hyponatraemia (low sodium levels), decreased carbohydrate tolerance (increased tendency to diabetes), and pancreatitis. Jaundice and thrombocytopaenia (low platelet levels) have been reported in newborn babies exposed to diuretics in the uterus. It has been suggested that risks of serious side effects may have been overstated due to selected case reporting (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>A non-systematic review of randomised trials of diuretics in pregnancy in nearly 7000 women appeared to show evidence of prevention of pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1985</LINK>). This significant effect persisted when trials using oedema (which would be decreased by diuretics) as a diagnostic criteria for pre-eclampsia were excluded. This might suggest a true decrease in the incidence of pre-eclampsia with diuretics. However, the authors were concerned that the definitions of pre-eclampsia used depended heavily on an increase in blood pressure. The apparent prevention of pre-eclampsia might thus be due solely to diuretics lowering the blood pressure, and not be a true effect. The overall perinatal mortality was not reduced. This early example of a review with pooled analysis stated that many thousands of women would need to be included to assess effects of treatment on rare outcomes such as perinatal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1985</LINK>). Our review is primarily interested in the prevention of pre-eclampsia using diuretics as some confusion remains over this question. A systematic review of the data is needed to address this.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-06-10 13:47:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>The objective of this review was to ascertain if the use of diuretics in pregnancy prevents the onset of pre-eclampsia. This included both pre-eclampsia arising in previously normotensive women (with normal blood pressure) and superimposed pre-eclampsia arising in a woman with chronic hypertension (pre-existing high blood pressure). The secondary objective of the review was to assess the level of complications and side effects associated with the use of diuretics.</P>

<P>Details for each included trial can be found in the table of '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'.</P>
<P>This review includes five studies involving 1836 women. All were single centre trials, conducted in the USA.</P>
<P>Participants were both primiparous and multiparous women, randomised at gestations ranging from the first to the third trimester. In two studies, almost all women were black (<LINK REF="STD-Fallis-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Fallis 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraus-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 1966</LINK>). Two trials included women with normal blood pressure only (<LINK REF="STD-Fallis-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Fallis 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weseley-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Weseley 1962</LINK>); one trial included women with chronic hypertension only (<LINK REF="STD-Sibai-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sibai 1984</LINK>); and two trials did not report on blood pressure at trial entry, but it is likely that they included both women with normal and high blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Flowers-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Flowers 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraus-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 1966</LINK>). Two trials excluded women with proteinuria (<LINK REF="STD-Fallis-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Fallis 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weseley-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Weseley 1962</LINK>) while the remaining trials did not report on proteinuria at trial entry. One trial included women based on presence of excessive weight gain or oedema (<LINK REF="STD-Weseley-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Weseley 1962</LINK>).</P>
<P>Interventions were thiazide diuretics in all studies. Chlorothiazide was used in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Flowers-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Flowers 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraus-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weseley-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Weseley 1962</LINK>) (dose 50 mg to 750 mg daily), hydrochlorothiazide in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fallis-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Fallis 1964</LINK>) and unspecified thiazide diuretics in the remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Sibai-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sibai 1984</LINK>). Diuretics were compared with placebo in four studies, and against no treatment in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sibai-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sibai 1984</LINK>). Treatment continued until delivery for most. Compliance rates were good for two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fallis-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Fallis 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flowers-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Flowers 1962</LINK>) but were not reported for the remaining studies. Restricted salt intake was advised in all five studies, although there was a wide range (salt intake of 1.8 g per day up to 5 g per day).</P>
<P>All included trials reported on pre-eclampsia. Three of the five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fallis-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Fallis 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraus-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weseley-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Weseley 1962</LINK>) defined pre-eclampsia as a systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg or a rise by more than 30 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg or a rise by more than 15 mm Hg, with or without proteinuria, or oedema after 24 weeks' gestation. As the definition of pre-eclampsia no longer includes oedema or a change in blood pressure from the baseline, the number of women reported to have developed pre-eclampsia is likely to be an overestimate. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Flowers-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Flowers 1962</LINK>) defined pre-eclampsia as a systolic blood pressure at least 140 mm Hg or diastolic at least 90 mm Hg in previously normotensive women or an appreciable change in blood pressure in women with chronic hypertension. We have reported the data for this outcome in the study by Flowers, as hypertension and not pre-eclampsia. For the remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Sibai-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sibai 1984</LINK>), superimposed pre-eclampsia was not defined. Perinatal death, for most trials, included stillbirths and neonatal deaths.</P>
<P>Twenty-eight studies were excluded for various reasons. Details of each excluded study can be found in the table of <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The quality of all five studies was unclear because there was inadequate reporting of methods used for randomisation and allocation concealment. Four studies were double blinded while one was not blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Sibai-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sibai 1984</LINK>). Follow up for two studies was complete (<LINK REF="STD-Sibai-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sibai 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weseley-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Weseley 1962</LINK>) but the remaining three studies had losses to follow up ranging from 8% to 14%.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pre-eclampsia</HEADING>
<P>After excluding the study by <LINK REF="STD-Flowers-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Flowers 1962</LINK>, where the outcome measured was not considered to be pre-eclampsia, four trials (1391 women) reported on pre-eclampsia. There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate any clear differences between the two groups in the risk ratio of pre-eclampsia (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.03). While the summary statistic implies a trend towards a reduction in pre-eclampsia, the trials showed a high level of heterogeneity at 43% and it was the small study by <LINK REF="STD-Fallis-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Fallis 1964</LINK> that contributed most to the summary statistic.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Caesarean section</HEADING>
<P>There was no clear difference between the diuretic and control groups in the risk of caesarean section (one trial, 20 women; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.81).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse drug related outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Diuretics were associated with an increased risk of maternal side effects compared to placebo (one trial, 519 women; RR 8.70, 95% CI 1.19 to 63.60).</P>
<P>Women allocated diuretics were more likely to stop treatment due to side effects compared to those allocated placebo (two trials, 1217 women; RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.81 to 4.22). This was due to unacceptable nausea and vomiting in the diuretics group (two trials, 1217 women; RR 5.81, 95% CI 1.04 to 32.46). Other reasons for stopping treatment included pruritis and rash, weakness or dizziness, and diuresis but there was no clear difference between the groups in the risk of stopping treatment due to these side effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Death in child</HEADING>
<P>There was no clear difference between the diuretic and control groups in the risk ratio of perinatal death (five trials, 1836 women, 22 versus 26 deaths; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.27). The findings were the same when the perinatal deaths were split into stillbirths (five trials, 1836 women; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.34) and neonatal death (four trials, 1816 women; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.97).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Premature birth and gestation at delivery</HEADING>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate any clear differences between the two groups in the risk of preterm birth (two trials, 465 women; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.41) or gestation at delivery (one trial, 20 women; mean difference (MD) 0.70 week, 95% CI -0.71 to 2.11).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Small-for-gestational age and birthweight</HEADING>
<P>There were no small-for-gestational-age babies in the one trial that reported this outcome, and there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate any clear differences between the two groups in birthweight (one trial, 20 women; MD 139 grams, 95% CI -484.40 to 762.40).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other outcomes (not prespecified)</HEADING>
<P>There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups for any other outcomes including hypertension (two trials, 1475 women; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.08); severe pre-eclampsia (two trials, 1297 women; RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.26 to 9.17); use of antihypertensive drugs (one trial, 20 women; RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 18.69); postmaturity (one trial, 20 women; RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.41 to 120.16) and low Apgar scores (one trial, 20 women; RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 65.90). There were no reported cases of eclampsia (one trial, 1030 women), or neonatal thrombocytopenia (one trial, 1030 women).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-06-10 14:06:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Diuretics have been widely used in the past to prevent or delay development of pre-eclampsia. Despite this, few well-controlled trials have evaluated the potential effects of this intervention. Indeed, the most recent randomised controlled trial we found was reported 22 years ago. Five trials were included in this review. All trials compared diuretics with either placebo or no treatment. At present, there is insufficient evidence to provide reliable conclusions about the effects of diuretics on prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications. The use of diuretics was associated with an increased risk of nausea and vomiting, and this was sufficiently severe to lead to the stopping of treatment in some women. However, there is little information on other side-effects.</P>
<P>The sample size in the trials was small and, even when taken together, the numbers were insufficient to provide any reliable information on clinically important maternal and perinatal outcomes. The quality of all five trials was unclear because of inadequate reporting of methods used for randomisation and allocation concealment, so any results must be interpreted with caution. A number of trials included in a previous review on this topic (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1985</LINK>) have been excluded from this review because they were quasi-randomised trials and had a high potential for bias (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cuadros-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Cuadros 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menzies-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Menzies 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tervila-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Tervila 1971</LINK>). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity among the trials for any of the reported outcomes.</P>
<P>It was not possible to accurately classify one particular study (<LINK REF="STD-Landesman-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Landesman 1965</LINK>). Indications from within the paper are that it was a controlled clinical trial with two comparison groups, but it could not be ascertained with absolute certainty whether it was a randomised trial. Attempts were made to contact the authors but to date these have not been successful. Because of its size, this study has the potential to significantly alter the results and, therefore, the conclusions of the review. We have left this reference in the studies awaiting assessment category and would welcome any information about this study that would tell us if it was a true randomised controlled trial.</P>
<P>The effects of diuretics on pre-eclampsia remain unclear not only because of small numbers, but also because of confusion in terminology. The definition of pre-eclampsia for most trials included hypertension and oedema or proteinuria. Hypertension was defined either as an absolute rise or a relative rise from baseline values. As oedema is no longer considered an important indicator of pre-eclampsia, and a relative rise in blood pressure is not used to define hypertension, it is likely that the number of women diagnosed with pre-eclampsia in the trials is an over-estimation. Data on development of proteinuria were not available from trials. Even if a surrogate outcome such as severe pre-eclampsia was used, the effects of diuretics remain unclear.</P>
<P>The use of thiazide diuretics was associated with an increased risk of nausea and vomiting and, in two trials, more women in the diuretics group stopped medication due to side effects compared to placebo. Serious maternal side effects, such as pancreatitis, were not reported in any of the trials. Although more women on diuretics developed hypokalemia (serum potassium less than 3.5 mEq/L) in the one trial that reported this outcome for all women (<LINK REF="STD-Kraus-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 1966</LINK>), the potassium level did not fall below 3 mEq/L. Neonatal jaundice was reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Flowers-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Flowers 1962</LINK>), but these data have not been included in the review as 60% of participants were excluded from the analysis, and so there is a high potential for bias. No cases of neonatal thrombocytopenia occurred in the one trial that reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Kraus-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 1966</LINK>). The effects of diuretics on other potential risks such as fetal growth restriction are unclear as there are insufficient data for any reliable conclusions.</P>
<P>As no clear benefits of diuretics have been demonstrated, and the possibility of adverse effects remains, currently available evidence does not support the use of diuretics for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-06-10 14:07:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>There is insufficient evidence to draw reliable conclusions about the effects of diuretics for prevention of pre-eclampsia. In addition, the incidence of side effects, particularly vomiting, was higher in the group receiving the diuretics. Therefore, at present, diuretics should not be recommended for this purpose in clinical practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-02-24 20:29:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As pre-eclampsia is associated with reduced plasma volume, the use of diuretics for prevention of pre-eclampsia, based on their ability to reduce oedema and increase sodium excretion, does not appear to be justified. The conclusions of this review presently suggest that further randomised trials to evaluate the effects of diuretics are justified only if it is thought that other effects of diuretics, such as lowering of blood pressure, and inducing vasodilatation provide reasonable theoretical grounds for preventing pre-eclampsia. Further trials may also be helpful for women with essential hypertension who are receiving diuretics prior to pregnancy, to provide them with reliable advice about the effects of continuing diuretic therapy during pregnancy. Such randomised trials should be well controlled, with adequate sample size. In view of the apparent increase in risk of nausea and vomiting with thiazide diuretics, if further trials are carried out, strategies to reduce this risk such as using a lower dose or alternative agents should be explored.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-10 11:24:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>The following methods were used to assess <LINK REF="STD-Fallis-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Fallis 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flowers-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Flowers 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraus-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sibai-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sibai 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weseley-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Weseley 1962</LINK>.</P>
<P>We conducted the review following the procedures outlined in <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently and unblinded performed the assessment of trials for inclusion in the review. We resolved any differences of opinion regarding trials for inclusion by discussion. We consulted a third review author if differences could not be resolved.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of study quality</HEADING>
<P>We assessed all trials for methodological quality using the criteria listed in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>), with a grade allocated to each trial on the basis of allocation concealment. We scored allocation concealment as (A) adequate concealment of allocation: such as telephone randomisation and the use of consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes; or (B) unclear whether adequate concealment of allocation: such as list or table used, sealed envelopes, or study does not report any concealment approach; or (C) inadequate concealment of allocation: such as open list of random number tables, use of case record numbers, dates of birth or days of the week. We excluded quasi-randomised trials. If there were unexplained imbalances between groups, we excluded these outcomes (or the trial).</P>
<P>In addition, we assigned quality scores to each trial for blinding of outcome assessment and completeness of follow up as follows.</P>
<P>For blinding of assessment of outcome:<BR/>(A) double-blind, neither investigator nor participant knew or were likely to guess the allocated treatment;<BR/>(B) single-blind, either the investigator or the participant knew the allocation. Or, the trial is described as double-blind but side-effects of one or other treatment mean that it is likely that for a significant proportion (at least 20%) of participants the allocation could be correctly identified;<BR/>(C) no blinding, both investigator and participant knew (or were likely to guess) the allocated treatment;<BR/>(D) unclear.</P>
<P>Attrition bias:<BR/>(A) less than 5% of participants excluded;<BR/>(B) 5.1% to 9.9% of participants excluded;<BR/>(C) 10% to 19.9% of participants excluded.<BR/>If 20% or more of participants were excluded, we excluded the data for that outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and data entry</HEADING>
<P>Two authors independently extracted data and cross checked these data with the third author. We resolved any discrepancies by discussion. We extracted the data onto 'hard-copy' data sheets, entered the data into the Review Manager computer software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2002</LINK>), and checked them for accuracy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analyses</HEADING>
<P>We carried out statistical analyses using <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2002</LINK>. We presented results as summary relative risk for dichotomous data, and as weighted mean difference for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals. We used the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to assess heterogeneity between trials. In the absence of significant heterogeneity, results were pooled using a fixed-effect model. If substantial heterogeneity is detected in future updates (I<SUP>2</SUP> more than 50%), possible causes will be explored and subgroup analyses may be performed. Heterogeneity that was not explained by subgroup analyses was modelled using random-effects analysis, where appropriate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>We will carry out subgroup analyses based on parity, ethnicity and presence of essential hypertension once more data are available.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection and analysis</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>
<I></I>At least two review authors will independently assess for inclusion all the potential studies we identify as a result of the search strategy. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>We will design a form to extract data. For eligible studies, at least two review authors will extract the data using the agreed form. We will resolve discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person. We will enter data into Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>) and check for accuracy.</P>
<P>When information regarding any of the above is unclear, we will attempt to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors will independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We will resolve any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We will assess the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator),</LI>
<LI>inadequate (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number) or,</LI>
<LI>unclear. </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence and determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear. </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will consider that studies are at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judge that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants;</LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel;</LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We will state whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information is reported, or can be supplied by the trial authors, we will re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertake. We will assess methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate;</LI>
<LI>inadequate;</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(5) Selective reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(6) Other sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study any important concerns we have about other possible sources of bias.</P>
<P>We will assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>
<UL>
<LI>yes;</LI>
<LI>no;</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We will make explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we will assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings. We will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see '</I>Sensitivity analysis'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we will present results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals.<I></I>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data, we will use the mean difference if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials. We will use the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measure the same outcome, but use different methods. <B></B>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>For included studies, we will note levels of attrition. We will explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we will carry out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we will attempt to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants will be analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial will be the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be missing.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We will assess statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the T, I<SUP> </SUP>and Chi statistics. We will regard heterogeneity as substantial if T is greater than zero and either I is greater than 30% or there is a low P-value (&lt; 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity.<B></B> <I></I>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>If there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually, and use formal tests for funnel plot asymmetry. For continuous outcomes we will use the test proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>, and for dichotomous outcomes we will use the test proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Harbord-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harbord 2006</LINK>. If asymmetry is detected in any of these tests or is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.<I>
<BR/>
</I>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We will carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We will use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it is reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials are examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods are judged sufficiently similar. If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary will be treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful we will not combine trials.</P>
<P>If we use random-effects analyses, the results will be presented as the average treatment effect with its 95% confidence interval, and the estimates of T and I.<I></I>
</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>If we identify substantial heterogeneity, we will investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We will consider whether an overall summary is meaningful and, if it is, use random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>
