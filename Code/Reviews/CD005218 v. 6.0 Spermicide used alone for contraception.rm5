<TITLE>Spermicide used alone for birth control</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-05 16:03:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Spermicides have been used as birth control for thousands of years. Studies have recently looked at how well they work to prevent pregnancy and whether women like them. Spermicides contain an active ingredient (usually nonoxynol-9) and something to disperse the product, such as foam or vaginal suppository (pessary). This review compared how well different spermicides worked for birth control when used alone.</P>
<P>In August 2013, we did computer searches for randomized trials of spermicides used for birth control. We have not found any new trials since the initial review. For the initial review, we also wrote to researchers to find other trials. </P>
<P>Trials had to focus on a spermicide used alone for birth control. The product could be compared to a different spermicide, the same spermicide used with a barrier method, another dose of the same spermicide, a different base for the same product, or another type of birth control. Each study must have had data on pregnancy.</P>
<P>We located reports from 14 trials for the initial review. We have not found any new trials since then. The largest trial compared five different spermicides. The gel with the smallest amount of nonoxynol-9 did not prevent pregnancy as well as products with more of the same ingredient. Women liked the gel better than the film or suppository. Few differences were found in the other studies. These trials had problems recruiting women into the studies and then keeping them until the trial ended. Large losses to follow up can bias the results.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Spermicides have been used as contraceptives for thousands of years. Despite this long use, only recently have studies examined the comparative efficacy and acceptability of these vaginal medications. Spermicides contain an active ingredient (most commonly nonoxynol-9) and a formulation used to disperse the product, such as foam or vaginal suppository.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>This review examined all known randomized controlled trials of a spermicide used alone for contraception.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-08-01 18:49:20 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>In August 2013, we searched the following computerized databases for randomized controlled trials of spermicides for contraception: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, POPLINE, LILACS, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. For the initial review, we examined the reference lists of trials found as well as those of review articles and textbook chapters.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-09-29 15:18:33 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included any trial of a commercial product used alone for contraception. Each included trial must have provided sufficient information to determine pregnancy rates. </P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-08-01 18:49:45 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently extracted information from the trials identified. We did not conduct a meta-analysis, since most trials had large losses to follow up. We entered the data into tables and presented the results descriptively.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-01 18:50:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We located reports from 14 trials for the initial review, but have not identified any new trials since then. In the largest trial to date, the gel (Advantage S) containing the lowest dose of nonoxynol-9 (52.5 mg) was significantly less effective in preventing pregnancy than were gels with higher doses of the same agent (100 mg and 150 mg). Probabilities of pregnancy by six months were 22% for the 52.5 mg gel, 16% for the 100 mg dose, and 14% for the 150 mg dose. In the same trial, the three different vehicles with 100 mg of nonoxynol-9 had similar efficacy. Interpretation of these figures is limited, since 39% of participants discontinued the method or were lost from the trial. Few important differences in efficacy emerged in other trials.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The probability of pregnancy varied widely in reported trials. A gel containing nonoxynol-9 52.5 mg was inferior to two other products tested in the largest trial. Aside from this finding, personal characteristics and behavior of users may be more important than characteristics of the spermicide products in determining the probability of pregnancy. Gel was liked more than the film or vaginal suppository in the largest trial. Spermicide trials have the dual challenges of difficult recruitment and high discontinuation rates; the latter threatens trial validity.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-05 16:29:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Although vaginal spermicides have been used as contraceptives for millennia, only recently have these methods received scientific scrutiny. Spermicides are designed to prevent fertilization by killing or inactivating sperm as they ascend through the female genital tract. All spermicide products have two components: a chemical toxic to sperm and a formulation (also called a carrier or base) for its delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2011</LINK>). The chemicals used in currently available spermicides are usually surfactants, the most common being nonoxynol-9. 'Nonoxinol' is also a recognized spelling for this chemical. Other agents include octoxynol, menfegol, and benzalkonium chloride (<LINK REF="REF-Connell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Speroff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speroff 2001</LINK>). These agents dissolve the lipid components in the cell membrane of spermatozoa, resulting in their death or inactivation. Nonoxynol-9 spermicides contain 52.5 to 230 mg (<LINK REF="REF-Embil-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Embil 2005</LINK>) of the active agent per application. The vehicles used to deliver the spermicide include foam, jelly, cream, melting suppository, foaming suppository, foaming tablet, and soluble film (<LINK REF="REF-Sherris-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherris 1984</LINK>). A vaginal suppository may also be called a pessary. Unlike the melting suppository, the foaming suppository uses a chemical base that, when moistened, releases carbon dioxide bubbles to help distribute the spermicide. Instructions for use vary by product; tablets, suppositories, and film need time to melt to allow dispersal of the spermicide in the vagina. Users are advised to insert spermicides from 0 to 30 minutes before coitus. While some jellies, creams, and foams may protect for as long as eight hours, tablets and suppositories may be effective for only one hour (<LINK REF="REF-Speroff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speroff 2001</LINK>). The scientific basis for these statements about duration of contraceptive activity is elusive.</P>
<P>Current spermicides have important advantages and disadvantages. These products are widely available 'over-the-counter' and generally cost less than hormonal contraceptives. No systemic absorption occurs (<LINK REF="REF-Sherris-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherris 1984</LINK>). These products are simple to use and are under the control of the woman. Some women report that the lubrication provided by spermicide improved intercourse for them (<LINK REF="REF-Vandebosch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandebosch 2004</LINK>). Although protection against some sexually-transmitted infections had been reported in the past, primarily with in vitro studies, more recent clinical trials have not confirmed this benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roddy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roddy 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roddy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roddy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Damme-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Damme 2002</LINK>). Spermicides with nonoxynol-9 are not effective as microbicides, and may increase susceptibility to HIV if used more than twice a day (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>A central challenge for all spermicides is maintaining the balance between contraceptive protection and disturbing the vaginal environment (<LINK REF="REF-Zaneveld-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaneveld 1996</LINK>). Spermicides act as cytotoxins and can injure vaginal and cervical epithelium. Frequent use may alter the vaginal flora, possibly leading to an increased risk of urinary tract infection (<LINK REF="REF-Scholes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholes 2000</LINK>). It can also damage the epithelium, possibly facilitating infection with HIV among female sex workers (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). The World Health Organization considers spermicides a category 4 method (contraindicated) for women at high risk of HIV infection and category 3 for those already infected (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). The probability of pregnancy with spermicide alone varies widely. In the first year of use, unintended pregnancies occur in 18% of women with perfect use and 28% of those with typical use (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2011</LINK>). Allergy or sensitivity to the spermicide has been reported in 1% to 5% of users. Other users note irritation of genital tissues or a sensation of heat. Some couples find this method messy (<LINK REF="REF-Zaneveld-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaneveld 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review examined spermicides used alone for contraception, although spermicides are commonly used with barrier contraceptives, such as the condom, diaphragm, sponge, and cervical cap.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the probability of pregnancy among women using a spermicide alone versus any other contraceptive, including another spermicide.</P>

<P>We assessed for inclusion all titles and abstracts that we found. We evaluated the methodological quality of the trials for potential biases by qualitatively assessing the study design, randomization method, allocation concealment, blinding, and rates for premature discontinuation and loss to follow up. One potentially relevant trial was published in Chinese (<LINK REF="STD-Xu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2003</LINK>); we had this article translated into English. Correspondence with the author later revealed that it was not a randomized trial.</P>
<P>Two authors independently abstracted data from the studies identified to improve accuracy. Most studies had problems with recruitment and large losses to follow up. Therefore, we did not conduct a meta-analysis. Most studies reported the 6-month or 12-month life-table rates per 100 women or the probabilities. We entered those data into tables in RevMan. The results are presented descriptively. Information on statistical significance came from the individual trial reports.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Kazi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kazi 1992</LINK> compared the Neo Sampoon tablet versus the Ortho Conceptrol tablet containing nonoxynol-9 100 mg. The trial took place at nine sites in Pakistan and enrolled 172 women for 12 months of observation.</P>
<P>Based at a teaching hospital in Ghana, <LINK REF="STD-Klufio-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Klufio 1988</LINK> compared the Ortho vaginal tablets containing either nonoxynol-9 100 mg or menfegol 60 mg in 150 women.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lamptey-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Lamptey 1985</LINK> compared the Neo Sampoon vaginal tablet (containing menfegol 60 mg) with two different brands of vaginal tablets (each containing nonoxynol-9 100 mg). The trial included two sites in Ghana; one was a teaching hospital and the other was a polyclinic. Three hundred women were recruited; the observation period lasted 12 months.</P>
<P>In Texas, <LINK REF="STD-Poindexter-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Poindexter 1984</LINK> randomized 110 women to either the Ortho vaginal tablet (nonoxynol-9 100 mg) or the Emko vaginal tablet (nonoxynol-9 100 mg). Recruitment took place at a university medical center and three family planning clinics. Follow up was 12 months.</P>
<P>A multicenter trial evaluated whether the vaginal contraceptive film should be distributed in commodities programs of the U.S. Agency for International Development (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1999</LINK>). The spermicidal tablet was already being distributed, and evaluation was requested to inform a decision about whether to include the film. The VCF vaginal contraceptive film contains nonoxynol-9 72 mg; the comparison was a foaming vaginal tablet containing 100 mg of the same active agent. The trial was conducted at eight sites in Mexico, Ecuador, Guatemala, Ghana, and the U.S. A total of 765 women were enrolled; observation lasted 28 weeks.</P>
<P>Another trial at 14 sites in the U.S. evaluated different doses of, and vehicles for, nonoxynol-9 (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2004</LINK>). By using five different treatments, the investigators were able to compare three different doses of nonoxynol-9 (52.5 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg) in gels and three different formulations (gel, film, and suppository) with the same dose of spermicide (100 mg). A total of 1536 women were enrolled; the observation period lasted 30 weeks.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ruoff-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Ruoff 1988</LINK> compared the Ortho foaming tablet containing either nonoxynol-9 100 mg or menfegol 60 mg. The trial took place at clinics in three different U.S. states. Only 60 of the planned 150 participants were enrolled, and the trial was stopped prematurely because of recruitment difficulties.</P>
<P>At a university hospital in Egypt, <LINK REF="STD-Younis-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Younis 1985</LINK> randomized 140 women to either the Ortho or Emko vaginal tablets (each containing nonoxynol-9 100 mg) and followed them for 12 months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Youssef-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Youssef 1987</LINK> compared the Neo Sampoon vaginal tablet with Emko vaginal foam.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chi-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Chi 1987</LINK> featured high losses from the analysis by six months. Of 1299 participants enrolled at four sites, only 816 (63%) provided information at six months. The problem was most acute at the Bangladesh site, where only 39% returned at six months including just 12% of those randomized to the sponge. The study researchers did not present pregnancy rates for that site. Large losses of participants after randomization make the trial results suspect.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chompootaweep-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chompootaweep 1990</LINK> had acceptable randomization and blinding of participants and clinicians as to treatment. Four participants were inappropriately dropped from analysis after randomization for non-compliance. Losses from analysis were high; only 47% of participants (48 of 102) provided information at the final scheduled visit at 12 months. These losses undermine the interpretation of the results.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lamptey-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Lamptey 1985</LINK> also had an appropriate method of randomization, but there was no blinding of participants or researchers. The total losses of participants after randomization cannot be determined from the published report. Discontinuations were frequent; those who stopped use of the spermicide by 12 months included 33 of 99 assigned to Neo Sampoon, 47 of 101 assigned to the Ortho vaginal tablet, and 57 of 100 assigned to the Emko vaginal tablet.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1999</LINK> featured excellent methods. A computer-generated sequence was used to develop random-permuted blocks of varying size. Allocation concealment was accomplished by sequentially-numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes with method-indicator cards. A formal sample size analysis was provided. Analysts were blinded as to treatment, although participants and investigators were not. When one planned interim analysis yielded higher failure rates than anticipated, all participants were advised and asked to sign a supplementary informed consent document. About 24% of participants discontinued the method early or were lost to follow up.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2004</LINK> used similar rigorous methods. Computer-generated random-permuted blocks of randomly varied sizes were used for treatment assignment. Allocation concealment was assured by telephone calls to a central randomization center. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board oversaw the trial and performed one planned interim analysis, which did not influence the conduct of the trial. Blinding of participants and investigators was not done. The primary analysis included all participants who provided any follow-up information until they no longer used the spermicide as their primary contraceptive method. In the intention-to-treat analysis, participants were kept in the analysis for the full seven months or until they were lost to follow up. After considering sample size and power issues and financial and time limitations, the investigators aimed for a total enrollment of 1800 women. Because recruitment proved difficult, enrollment was stopped at 1536. Fifty-one women had no follow-up information after admission, so the primary analysis included 1485 participants. Losses of participants after randomization were common. Approximately 39% of participants either discontinued the trial early or were deemed lost to follow up. No important disparities in these losses were seen among the five treatment groups, however. Overall, participants who dropped out had characteristics that suggested a higher risk of pregnancy than those who were retained.</P>
<P>The trials conducted by Family Health International in the 1980s had common methods. These trials included published (<LINK REF="STD-Youssef-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Youssef 1987</LINK>) and unpublished reports (<LINK REF="STD-Abdelsalaam-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Abdelsalaam 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Andolsek-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Andolsek 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghunney-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ghunney 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kazi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kazi 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klufio-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Klufio 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poindexter-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Poindexter 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruoff-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Ruoff 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Younis-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Younis 1985</LINK>). Randomization was done centrally by random-permuted blocks with a computer-generated sequence of numbers. Allocation concealment was achieved by using method-indicator cards in sealed, opaque, sequentially-numbered envelopes distributed to the research sites. Data were transmitted to Family Health International, where the analyses were done. Exclusion of participants because of protocol violations occurred in several reports, and losses to follow up ranged widely. In addition, recruitment problems were serious at some sites (<LINK REF="STD-Ghunney-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ghunney 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruoff-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Ruoff 1988</LINK>), leading to premature closure of the trials.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2010-09-21 19:12:19 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Where available, the 12-month life-table rates per 100 women are presented for pregnancy and for discontinuation due to discomfort. Studies with shorter follow-up periods reported the six-month rates or probabilities. Some studies grouped discomfort with other personal reasons, so the outcome categories are described along with the results. A few trials reported the Pearl index, which represents the number of unintended pregnancies per 100 woman-years of use. In these studies, the Pearl index was usually calculated with 12-month data, but trials of shorter length used 6-month data. The time frames are given with the specific results.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chi-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Chi 1987</LINK> compared the Collatex sponge (nonoxynol-9 1.15 g) and Neo Sampoon tablet (menfegol 60 mg). Pregnancy rates varied widely by site, with rates five times higher in Taiwan than in Belgrade. Bangladesh was excluded from the pregnancy rates due to losses. Life-table pregnancy rates at 12 months ranged from 3.8 to 18.2 per 100 women with the sponge and from 6.2 to 29.9 with the Neo Sampoon tablet. Results for the two methods were not significantly different. At all study sites, participants found the insertion of the sponge to be more difficult than insertion of the tablet. However, complaints of burning or stinging vaginal discharge were more common with the Neo Sampoon tablet than with the sponge; all four sites concurred. The study reported personal reasons for discontinuation, which included product-related reasons, discomfort, and other reasons such as no confidence in the method. At six months, the discontinuation rates for these personal reasons were slightly higher for the sponge. At 12 months, two sites had slightly higher rates for the sponge than the tablet. These differences were not significant, however.</P>
<P>Four trials performed a blinded comparison of vaginal foaming tablets with either nonoxynol-9 100 mg or menfegol 60 mg as the active agent (<LINK REF="STD-Chompootaweep-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chompootaweep 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ghunney-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ghunney 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klufio-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Klufio 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruoff-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Ruoff 1988</LINK>). Pregnancy rates among users of the two products were comparable over 6 and 12 months of use. Some trials had small numbers, e.g., 27 participants in a Ghana trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ghunney-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ghunney 1987</LINK>), so pregnancy rates may be imprecise for single studies. Estimates for the Pearl index were also comparable for the two methods. Life-table discontinuation rates for discomfort were available from the two larger trials in Thailand (<LINK REF="STD-Chompootaweep-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chompootaweep 1990</LINK>) and Ghana (<LINK REF="STD-Klufio-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Klufio 1988</LINK>). The rates ranged from 5.8 to 13.5 for nonoxynol-9 and from 1.5 to 16.2 for menfegol, but they were not significantly different. In <LINK REF="STD-Klufio-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Klufio 1988</LINK>, the 12-month discontinuation rates for medical reasons were 9.0 for the menfegol and zero for the nonoxynol-9. The difference was significant.</P>
<P>Three trials compared the Neo Sampoon tablet with either the Ortho vaginal tablet (<LINK REF="STD-Kazi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kazi 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lamptey-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Lamptey 1985</LINK>) or the Emko vaginal tablet (<LINK REF="STD-Abdelsalaam-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Abdelsalaam 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lamptey-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Lamptey 1985</LINK>). The Neo Sampoon tablet contained menfegol 60 mg and the Ortho and Emko tablets each had 100 mg of nonoxynol-9. In Ghana (<LINK REF="STD-Lamptey-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Lamptey 1985</LINK>), the 12-month life-table pregnancy rates were similar for the Neo Sampoon, Ortho vaginal, and Emko tablets. In Pakistan (<LINK REF="STD-Kazi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kazi 1992</LINK>), the 12-month rates were 15.2 for menfegol and 22.5 for the Ortho tablet, but the study did not have the power to detect a significant difference. In Egypt (<LINK REF="STD-Abdelsalaam-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Abdelsalaam 1984</LINK>), the six-month pregnancy rates were also similar for menfegol and the Emko nonoxynol-9. Only <LINK REF="STD-Lamptey-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Lamptey 1985</LINK> provided the Pearl index, and the figures were 10.6 for menfegol, 13.8 for Ortho nonoxynol-9, and 17.9 for Emko nonoxynol-9.</P>
<P>The discontinuation rates for discomfort or medical reasons varied across these three studies. In <LINK REF="STD-Abdelsalaam-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Abdelsalaam 1984</LINK>, the six-month discontinuation rates for discomfort were similar for menfegol and the Emko tablet. Discontinuation rates were also similar for medical and product-related reasons. In <LINK REF="STD-Kazi-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kazi 1992</LINK>, the 12-month discontinuation rates for medical reasons (including discomfort) were similar for the two groups but somewhat higher overall. <LINK REF="STD-Lamptey-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Lamptey 1985</LINK> noted significant differences in the 12-month discontinuation rates for discomfort. The rates were zero for menfegol, 2.7 for the Ortho nonoxynol-9, and 12.8 for the Emko tablet.</P>
<P>Three trials compared the Ortho vaginal tablet with the Emko vaginal tablet, each of which contained nonoxynol-9 100 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Lamptey-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Lamptey 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poindexter-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Poindexter 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Younis-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Younis 1985</LINK>). The 12-month life-table pregnancy rates were nearly identical in <LINK REF="STD-Lamptey-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Lamptey 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Younis-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Younis 1985</LINK>. The Pearl index results from <LINK REF="STD-Lamptey-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Lamptey 1985</LINK> were given earlier. Discontinuations because of discomfort by 12 months were divergent, however. In Ghana (<LINK REF="STD-Lamptey-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Lamptey 1985</LINK>), Emko tablets had a discontinuation rate of 12.8 versus 2.7 for the Ortho tablet, and the difference was significant. In Egypt (<LINK REF="STD-Younis-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Younis 1985</LINK>), the rate was nearly twice as high for the Ortho tablet (11.6) as for the Emko (5.6), but the difference was not significant. The third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Poindexter-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Poindexter 1984</LINK>) compared the same two tablets, although the observation period was 6 months rather than 12. In this small U.S. study, discontinuation rates for pregnancy or discomfort were similar.</P>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Youssef-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Youssef 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Andolsek-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Andolsek 1988</LINK>) compared the Neo Sampoon tablet (menfegol 60 mg) with Emko foam (nonoxynol-9 8%) over 12 months of use. Life-table pregnancy rates were similar for the two methods in both trials. Discontinuation rates due to discomfort were also similar. Overall, rates were higher in <LINK REF="STD-Andolsek-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Andolsek 1988</LINK> than in <LINK REF="STD-Youssef-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Youssef 1987</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1999</LINK> found similar results with the vaginal contraceptive film and vaginal tablet, which contained nonoxynol-9 72 mg and 100 mg, respectively. Conducted at eight international sites, the trial found the six-month probabilities of pregnancy to be 28% for the tablet and 25% for the film. The Pearl index was calculated with the six-month data, and the figures were 67.4 for the tablet and 59.8 for the film. Acceptability was addressed in a separate report; it revealed mixed results. Slightly more women assigned to the film liked their method "very much" (55%) as compared with those randomized to the tablet (50%). On the other hand, somewhat fewer participants assigned to the film reported having had no problems with the method (30%) compared with those assigned to the tablet (37%). The differences were not significant. Acceptability varied considerably by study site. In general, the film was more likely to stick to fingers and the tablet was easier to insert, although more women considered the tablet messy.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2004</LINK>, the gel containing the lowest dose of nonoxynol-9 (52.5 mg) was significantly less effective in preventing pregnancy than were the higher doses (100 mg and 150 mg). Probabilities of pregnancy by six months were 22% for the 52.5 mg gel, 16% for the 100 mg dose, and 14% for the 150 mg dose. The three different formulations (gel, film, and vaginal suppository) with 100 mg of nonoxynol-9 had similar efficacy. The probabilities of pregnancy were 12% with the 100 mg film and 10% with the 100 mg suppository.</P>
<P>All the spermicide products were safe (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2004</LINK>). Thirty-four serious adverse events occurred during the trial, none of which was judged related to the spermicide. The seven-month probability did not differ among the groups for vaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, irritation without infection, and urinary tract infection.</P>
<P>Gel was more acceptable to women than the Encare suppository (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2004</LINK>). Significantly more women who used the 100 mg gel liked it "very much" compared to those who used the 100 mg film or the 100 mg suppository. The percentages were 49% for the gel, 41% for the film, and 34% for the suppository.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-11-06 16:01:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A striking range of contraceptive efficacy with vaginal spermicides has been reported to date. Percentages for unintended pregnancy in the first year of use are 18% for perfect use and 28% for typical use (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2011</LINK>). In the international trial of <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1999</LINK>, approximately a fifth of all participants became pregnant within six months with either the VCF film or the Conceptrol tablet. In contrast, in Egypt, the 12-month life-table rates of pregnancy were 2.8 for users of the Neo Sampoon tablet and 2.1 for Emko foam users (<LINK REF="STD-Youssef-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Youssef 1987</LINK>). These wide variations presumably reflect important differences in fecundability as well as compliance and continuation with the assigned product. In addition, some studies reported more meticulous methods than others for follow up, which can affect the ascertainment of pregnancy data. However, poor trial quality was a generic problem.</P>
<P>The efficacy of spermicides may be dose-related. The gel containing only 52.5 mg of nonoxynol-9 was associated with a higher pregnancy risk than were gels containing higher doses of the same agent in <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2004</LINK>.</P>
<P>Several differences emerged in discontinuation rates due to discomfort or medical problems. For example, women using the Collatex sponge were slightly more likely to discontinue because of problems and personal reasons than were those using the Neo Sampoon tablet (<LINK REF="STD-Chi-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Chi 1987</LINK>). In another trial, those using the Neo Sampoon tablet were less likely to discontinue due to discomfort than were women using Emko tablets (<LINK REF="STD-Lamptey-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Lamptey 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the five-arm trial of <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2004</LINK>, clear differences emerged in the acceptability of different vehicles. A gel was more acceptable than the vaginal suppository. A higher proportion of women liked the gel "very much" compared with the Encare suppository and the Ortho Contraceptive film.</P>
<P>Losses of participants after randomization threaten trial validity (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002</LINK>). These trials were all hampered by retention problems. In some studies, many participants discontinued their method prematurely, and the investigators made no further attempts to track these women. Other participants were lost to follow-up despite efforts to locate them and determine outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2004</LINK> examined characteristics of those who withdrew before the planned end of the observation period in the large U.S. trial of five products (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2004</LINK>). About 40% of women did not complete the study for reasons other than pregnancy. Those more likely to discontinue early were younger, unmarried women with intercourse at least eight times per month and were enrolled at a university site or a site that had slow enrollment. However, many participants without these features also quit early. Hence, targeting retention efforts in future trials will be difficult. A '5-and-20' rule of thumb suggests that losses after randomization of 5% or less are unlikely to influence trial validity. In contrast, losses of 20% or more make results suspect (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2005</LINK>).</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-09-21 19:13:13 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Most trials to date were so poorly done that drawing conclusions about the comparative efficacy of spermicides is not possible. The pregnancy probabilities varied widely in reported trials, but have been as high as 28% over six months of use (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 1999</LINK>). Few important differences emerged between products, although a gel containing nonoxynol-9 52.5 mg was inferior to two other products tested in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2004</LINK>). Aside from this one product, personal characteristics and behavior of users may be more important than characteristics of the spermicide products themselves in determining the likelihood of pregnancy. Gel may be a more acceptable spermicide formulation than film or vaginal suppository (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2004</LINK>). In general use outside of research settings, spermicides fall into the bottom tier of contraceptive effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Steiner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 2003</LINK>). On the other hand, advantages of spermicides for women at low risk of HIV infection include easy availability, moderate cost, absence of systemic effects, and control by the woman.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-09-21 19:13:13 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Randomized controlled trials of spermicides pose daunting challenges for investigators. Because of the limited appeal and effectiveness of spermicides, recruitment to recent trials has been difficult. In addition, many women discontinued their assigned method before the end of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2004</LINK>). Women who discontinue their assigned method should be followed until the end of the trial; this often did not happen in published trials. In several studies, losses to follow up after randomization were high as well. As a result, many reports are difficult to interpret. Future trials need to address the dual challenges of recruitment and retention of participants. Shorter observation periods may enhance compliance with the assigned treatments. Innovative approaches may be needed to achieve high rates of follow up (<LINK REF="REF-Roddy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roddy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raymond-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Raymond 2004</LINK>).</P>
