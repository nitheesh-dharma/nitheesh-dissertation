<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Are antibiotics effective for the treatment of Lyme disease affecting the nervous system?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>In humans, a bacterium called <I>Borrelia burgdorferi</I> causes Lyme disease. People become infected when bitten by ticks carrying the bacterium. The person may experience symptoms in the joints, skin, muscles, and nervous system (peripheral nerves (nerves outside the brain and spinal cord), the brain, and the spinal cord). Without antibiotic treatment, neurological Lyme disease either may resolve or cause long-term problems. Neurological Lyme disease differs between Europe and the United States, probably because of differences in <I>B. burgdorferi</I>. Limited information exists about which antibiotics are better for the treatment of neurological Lyme disease.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found seven trials studying antibiotic treatments for neurological Lyme disease. All but one trial compared different antibiotics. The other trial compared the treatment effects of oral amoxicillin to placebo following initial ceftriaxone treatment. The trials included 450 Europeans. The antibiotics tested were penicillin G, doxycycline, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime. One of the trials involved children only, while the others included mostly adults. We only selected studies in which treatment allocation was determined by chance (randomly), as such studies provide the best information for comparing the effects of different treatments. Most studies were not blinded (meaning that those taking part and the study staff knew the treatment being given). We could not find any studies of antibiotic treatments for neurological Lyme disease from the United States. No studies assessed the effects of delaying the start of treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results and quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The seven studies were too different for their results to be combined, so we analyzed them individually.</P>
<P>None of the studies provided clear evidence that one antibiotic was better than another. One study failed to find evidence that a second and longer treatment with an oral antibiotic (amoxicillin) offered any extra benefit following initial intravenous treatment with ceftriaxone. As none of the other studies used a dummy treatment (placebo), the extra benefit offered by antibiotic treatment over recovery that occurs naturally is unknown. In general, the treatment was tolerated well, although the quality of adverse event reporting in most studies appeared to be low.</P>
<P>The results indicate that treatment with any of the four antibiotics produced similarly good outcomes for treatment of neurological Lyme disease in Europe. A second treatment with amoxicillin does not appear to provide added benefit to ceftriaxone. We found no trials of antibiotics for treatment of neurological Lyme disease in the United States.</P>
<P>The evidence is current to October 2016.</P>

<P>Various central nervous system-penetrant antibiotics are bactericidal in vitro and in vivo against the causative agent of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), <I>Borrelia burgdorferi.</I> These antibiotics are routinely used clinically to treat LNB, but their relative efficacy is not clear.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-12-04 16:58:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>On 25 October 2016 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase. We searched clinical trial registers on 26 October 2016. We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomized trials identified and contacted the authors and known experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished data. There were no language restrictions when searching for studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-10-26 11:59:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Randomized clinical trials of antibiotic treatment of LNB in adults and children that compared any antibiotic treatment, including combinations of treatments, versus any other treatment, placebo, or no treatment. We excluded studies of entities considered as post-Lyme syndrome.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-04-17 18:19:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diego Cadavid">
<P>We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-04 17:30:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We identified seven randomized studies involving 450 European participants with LNB for inclusion in this systematic review. We found no trials conducted in the United States. Marked heterogeneity among these studies prevented meta-analysis. None of the studies included a placebo control on the initial antibiotic treatment, and only one was blinded. None were delayed-start studies. All were active comparator studies, and most were not adequately powered for non-inferiority comparison. The trials investigated four antibiotics: penicillin G and ceftriaxone in four studies, doxycycline in three studies, and cefotaxime in two studies. One study tested a three-month course of oral amoxicillin versus placebo following initial treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone. One study was limited to children. The trials measured efficacy using heterogeneous physician- or patient-reported outcomes, or both. In some cases cerebrospinal fluid analysis was included as an indirect biomarker of disease and outcome. None of the studies reported on our proposed primary outcome, 'Improvement in a measure of overall disability in the long term (three or more months).' None of the trials revealed any between-group differences in symptom resolution in response to active treatment. In general, treatment was tolerated well. The quality of adverse event reporting, however, was low.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-12-04 17:30:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>There is mostly low- to very low-quality clinical evidence from a limited number of mostly small, heterogeneous trials with diverse outcome measures, comparing the relative efficacy of central nervous system-penetrant antibiotics for the treatment of LNB. The few existing randomized studies have limited power and lack consistent and well-defined entry criteria and efficacy endpoints. It is not possible to draw firm conclusions on the relative efficacy of accepted antibiotic drug regimens for the treatment of LNB. The majority of people are reported to have good outcomes, and symptoms resolve by 12 months regardless of the antibiotic used. A minority of participants did not improve sufficiently, and some were retreated. These randomized studies provide some evidence that doxycycline, penicillin G, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime are efficacious in the treatment of European LNB. No evidence of additional efficacy was observed when, in one study, an initial antibiotic treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone was followed by additional longer treatment with oral amoxicillin. There is a lack of evidence identified through our high-quality search strategy on the efficacy of antibiotics for treatment of LNB in the United States.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-04 17:30:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-12-04 17:30:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is a group of diseases that can affect the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), or both, as a result of infection with or the postinfectious consequences of different species of the spirochete bacterium <I>Borrelia burgdorferi. </I>These organisms are transmitted by ixodid ticks in endemic areas in the United States and Europe. Although a multitude of clinical manifestations of LNB have been reported, the most common are radicular pains, facial paralysis, and meningitis, referred to as Bannwarth's syndrome in Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Bannwarth-1941" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bannwarth 1941</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bannwarth-1944" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bannwarth 1944</LINK>). It was not until 1981 that entomologist Willy Burgdorfer and colleagues in the United States suspected that the cause of Lyme disease was a tick-borne spirochete (<LINK REF="REF-Burgdorfer-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgdorfer 1982</LINK>). In the decades since the identification of <I>B. burgdorferi</I>, it has become clear that LNB is one of the most common and important complications of Lyme disease. The diagnosis of LNB requires confirmation of infection with <I>B. burgdorferi</I> plus evidence of involvement of the CNS, the PNS, or both. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from the 154,405 cases of Lyme disease reported during 2001 to 2010 in the United States, 14% were identified with facial palsy, radiculoneuropathy, meningitis, or encephalitis (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2011a</LINK>). Looking at Lyme disease occurring in Europe, others have estimated that up to 12% of cases have neurological manifestations (<LINK REF="REF-Koedel-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koedel 2015</LINK>), and that approximately 5% of individuals with an untreated erythema migrans will develop LNB (<LINK REF="REF-Hansen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Knowledge of the natural course and prognosis of untreated LNB is limited, and both increases in severity of disease and spontaneous remissions may occur. A random review of medical records from the original Lyme disease investigation among people from Connecticut, United States, who were not treated with antibiotics because they were diagnosed before the infectious cause of the disease was known, revealed that when left untreated, LNB can result in long-term sequelae (<LINK REF="REF-Kalish-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalish 2001</LINK>). In this report, 31 people who had presented with facial palsy and meningism frequently went on to develop more disseminated manifestations of LNB, with two-thirds being formally diagnosed with lymphocytic meningitis, radiculoneuritis, or both, and 1 in 5 developing atrioventricular block. In a German retrospective study of 72 people with untreated LNB, only 59 went into full remission, whereas 13 developed mild-to-moderate sequelae during 5 to 27 years of follow-up. Importantly, all those participants were eventually judged as &#8220;having been cured without antibiotics&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Kruger-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruger 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of LNB varies widely among European countries, with the highest incidences in central European and Scandinavian countries. Population-based annual incidence rates of LNB in central Europe are 30 to 50 per million for acute LNB and less than 0.4 per million for chronic LNB (<LINK REF="REF-Hansen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 2013</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-12-04 17:30:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>People with the characteristic skin lesion of Lyme disease, erythema migrans, followed by manifestations of infection of the nervous system, referred to as LNB, were successfully treated with antibiotics (penicillin) as early as 1948 (<LINK REF="REF-Hollstrom-1951" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollstrom 1951</LINK>). Treatment with antibiotics capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier is now the standard of care for people diagnosed with LNB. However, no placebo-controlled trials have ever been performed, and the antibiotic of choice, route of administration, dose, and length of treatment for LNB remain controversial.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-12-04 17:30:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>At the time that the protocol for this review was conceived, there had been several attempts at producing treatment guidelines for Lyme disease and no high-quality systematic evidence reviews to synthesize the available evidence to feed those reviews. Guidelines have now been produced by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) (Practice Parameter) (<LINK REF="REF-Halperin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halperin 2007</LINK>), the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) (<LINK REF="REF-Mygland-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mygland 2010</LINK>), the German Neurological Society (<LINK REF="REF-Rauer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rauer 2012</LINK>), and the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 2014</LINK>). American Academy of Neurology/American College of Rheumatology/Infectious Diseases Society of America as well as the German Neurological Society are currently working on updated guidelines. This review will continue to synthesize the evidence for the antibiotic treatment of LNB.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2016-12-04 17:30:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The review authors only considered quasi-randomized and randomized, prospective, controlled trials of antibiotic treatment for Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) for inclusion in this review. We excluded non-randomized and uncontrolled studies. We also excluded single-case reports and case series.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2016-12-04 17:30:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We considered trials that evaluated individuals with clinically diagnosed LNB. The clinical syndrome of LNB included one or more of the following: meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, radiculitis, cranial neuropathies (including facial nerve palsy or ocular motor palsy, or both), optic neuritis, peripheral neuropathies, and myopathies. We excluded studies of people with post-Lyme disease syndrome, defined as people with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease in the absence of ongoing infection following prior antibiotic treatment. We also excluded trials of LNB prevention through treatment of erythema migrans.</P>
<P>Diagnoses of LNB are supported by a number of approaches, including positive serologic testing (<LINK REF="REF-Stiernstedt-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiernstedt 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dressler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dressler 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Engstrom-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engstrom 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilske-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilske 2000</LINK>). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture of <I>B. burgdorferi </I>was also acceptable as supportive evidence of LNB, as well as a positive CSF Lyme polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the presence of CSF anti-<I>B. burgdorferi</I> antibodies, <LINK REF="REF-Steere-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steere 1990</LINK>, or CSF pleocytosis, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Halperin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halperin 1996</LINK>).

<P>Two review authors independently assessed all of the included studies for risk of bias. In the event of disagreement, all of the review authors achieved consensus through discussion. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess risk of bias of the included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool applies the following criteria: random sequence generation; concealment of allocation; blinding of participants and personnel; blinding of outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data (numbers of participants lost to follow-up and use of intention-to-treat analysis); selective reporting; and other sources of bias, such as baseline differences in study populations (other than imbalances caused by inadequate randomization, lack of allocation concealment, or exclusion of participants, which we considered under other criteria). We assessed all included studies under each criterion as at high, low, or unclear risk of bias (we used 'unclear' when there was insufficient information to permit judgement or when what occurred in the study was known but the implications in terms of bias were unclear). To assist the review authors, two systematic review specialists provided by Cochrane conducted an independent 'Risk of bias' assessment, and the review authors addressed any discrepancies in assessments.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-12-04 17:30:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We used Review Manager 5 to calculate risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes.

Missing standard deviations were calculated from confidence interval using the Review Manager 5 calculator tool during data entry.</P>
<P>The review authors originally planned to divide the analysis according to whether the LNB studies were North American or European, since infecting strains of Borrelia species as well as clinical manifestations of LNB may differ between the two regions. If the division between European and North American studies did not reveal important differences, we planned to pool all studies. However, we did not identify any eligible study from North America; the review analyses are therefore based only on available European studies until studies from other world areas become available.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Physician-reported measures of efficacy</HEADING>
<P>In all but one of the included trials, investigators reported neurologic findings on clinical examination, allowing for objective clinical evaluation of efficacy. Physician tools for quantifying efficacy as primary or secondary outcome varied between trials. In the two largest trials, final grading by the treating physician combined objective clinical examination and patient report of subjective symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Oksi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Oksi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ljostad-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ljostad 2008</LINK>).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Patient-reported measures of efficacy</HEADING>
<P>Studies largely used clinical evaluations, which often depended on unspecified symptoms to judge cure, improvement, or failure. These symptoms were typically not systematically tracked. Some studies included people with LNB who were only a subset of participants with disseminated Lyme disease. Subjective patient outcome measures were not usually outlined rigorously but were included within global clinical assessments, or at least inferred. One study, <LINK REF="STD-Karlsson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Karlsson 1994</LINK>, did track specific individual complaints, such as fatigue, during follow-up time points. <LINK REF="STD-Ljostad-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ljostad 2008</LINK> incorporated subjective symptoms into a clinical composite score, but with a minority weighting compared to objective findings. <LINK REF="STD-Oksi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Oksi 2007</LINK> directly incorporated subjective assessments by participants and independent assessments by physicians in a visual analogue scale to assess the success or failure of antibiotic therapy. <LINK REF="STD-Pfister-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pfister 1989</LINK> individually tracked radicular pain in all participants.</P>

The CSF parameter initially prespecified as an outcome measure for this review was resolution of CSF pleocytosis at three or more months following treatment.

<LINK REF="STD-Oksi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Oksi 2007</LINK> investigated whether 100 days of oral antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin provided any additional benefit after previous treatment with 21 days of ceftriaxone for disseminated Lyme disease. Investigators enrolled 152 participants with definite (74%) or possible (26%) Lyme disease, of whom five were withdrawn due to discontinuation of the study drug and two due to diagnosis other than disseminated Lyme disease. Sixty-two of those enrolled had LNB (Jarmo Oksi, supplementary information). Trialists measured objective efficacy using an investigator-rated visual analogue scale (VAS) that ranged from 0 to 100, administered at baseline (prior to randomization), after completion of ceftriaxone treatment, and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months thereafter. A value of 50 was attributed to average baseline severity, 0 for full remission of symptoms, and 100 for a certain poor outcome. A similar VAS completed by participants was used for assessment of efficacy. Only in the largest center were participants rated by the same physician throughout the whole study. The degree to which subjective symptoms influenced the investigator VAS judgement was not documented. Also, non-neurologists judged severity of symptoms at some sites. Furthermore, participants with definite and possible LNB were combined. Participants in the definite LNB group had objective signs, making remission of objective neurological signs a more relevant criterion for efficacy assessment in this subgroup. For the disease severity rating, the outcome was categorized as &#8220;excellent or good,&#8221; &#8220;controversial,&#8221; or &#8220;poor,&#8221; using VAS values plus information obtained from participant medical records, but without any standardization.</P>
<P>In participants with definite Lyme disease, the outcome was excellent or good in 49 (92.5%) amoxicillin-treated participants and 47 (87%) placebo-treated participants; the outcome was poor in 3 (5.7%) amoxicillin-treated and 6 (11.1%) placebo-treated participants. In participants with possible Lyme disease treated with amoxicillin, the outcome was excellent or good in 11 (55%) participants and poor in 4 participants (20%); in the placebo group with possible Lyme disease, the outcome was excellent or good in 8 participants (44.4%) and poor in 4 participants (22.2%). In the whole group of 145 participants, the mean differences (MDs) in patient-reported VAS at 3, 6, and 12 months for amoxicillin versus placebo were 4.20 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.39 to 5.01), -0.50 (95% CI -1.38 to 0.38), and 0.60 (95% CI -0.21 to 1.41). The corresponding MDs for investigator-rated VAS at 3, 6, and 12 months were 0.50 (95% CI -0.28 to 1.28), -2.40 (95% CI -3.18 to -1.62), and -0.40 (95% CI -1.13 to 0.33) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Comparison of all VAS values did not differ significantly between participant and investigator assessments, including the subset of participants with definite LNB (62 of the total 145 participants). The results showed no clinically important differences between amoxicillin and placebo groups on the participant or investigator VAS scores in either the whole group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), or the definite Lyme disease subgroup. The report does not provide separate results for the possible LNB subgroup. The trialists reported that there were no statistically significant differences in the definite LNB subgroup between amoxicillin and placebo groups in mean patient or investigator VAS scores at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. We did not obtain numerical data for analysis.</P>
<P>The risk ratio (RR) for improvement of symptoms (excellent or good according to investigator VAS) at 12 months with amoxicillin versus placebo was 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21 in the 107 participants with definite Lyme disease (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Investigators concluded that additional amoxicillin therapy was not beneficial, with most participants (59/62) in the LNB subgroup having an excellent or good response regardless of treatment arm. Data from participants with LNB were not reported for amoxicillin and placebo groups separately. Less than 5% of the LNB subgroup ended up with a controversial or poor response on the investigator ratings. The investigators did not find any correlation between the clinical outcomes and persistence without decline of <I>B. burgdorferi</I>-specific antibodies in the serum.</P>
<P>A comparison of the overall response to the additional treatment between the definite and possible LNB subgroups showed that the response was better for amoxicillin in the subgroup with definite LNB than in the subgroup with possible LNB, but this was not the case for placebo.</P>

Three participants discontinued ceftriaxone treatment due to adverse events: one with cholecystitis, one with stomatitis and proctitis, and one with allergy. There were no other serious adverse events. There was one serious adverse event but no withdrawals in the doxycycline group.

Diarrhea, nausea, and urticaria were reported for 19, 15, and 3 participants, respectively; all were generally mild. Emergence of new symptoms compatible with LNB or intensification of symptoms during treatment was not reported.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Karlsson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Karlsson 1994</LINK> compared a 14-day treatment with penicillin G to 14 days of oral doxycycline in 54 participants with LNB. The study included only participants with objective findings and a positive serology or evidence of abnormal CSF. Investigators used a rating of subjective and objective findings on a Likert scale from 0 to 3 (no symptoms, mild symptoms, moderate or severe symptoms) for primary efficacy. The RRs for improvement and resolution with penicillin G versus oral doxycycline at 12 months were 1.0 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.08) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.18), respectively (N = 51; low-quality evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). Participants were followed for 12 months, with no difference found between the two treatment arms except for the fact that more participants treated with doxycycline reported vertigo at the end of treatment but not at one month. One participant in each treatment group was retreated because of residual symptoms. Subjective symptoms were completely absent at 12 months except for 1 penicillin G participant with neuromuscular pain and hypoesthesia and 1 doxycycline participant with arthralgia. Selection bias is a concern in this study due to a considerable imbalance in the number of participants randomized to each treatment arm. The report provided few statistics and did not allow a distinction to be made between participant- and physician-based judgements. Objective judgement of findings at the end of follow-up was implied but not well documented, thus this study did not use a well-characterized objective measure of efficacy by a physician.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Kohlhepp-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kohlhepp 1989</LINK> randomized a clinically well-defined cohort of 75 participants with predominantly acute (n = 67) but also chronic (n = 8) LNB to a 10-day course of intravenous doxycycline or intravenous penicillin G. Follow-up was 12 months, but for cases with residual symptoms the follow-up was three years. The primary outcome was the treating physicians&#8217; categorical grading of the clinical status as &#8220;no remission,&#8221; &#8220;partial remission,&#8221; or &#8220;full remission,&#8221; based on objective and subjective signs and symptoms with no specification given. At the end of treatment, over 80% of participants had responded to some degree in both groups. Early responders were usually asymptomatic after six months. Pain, meningitic symptoms, and acute cranial neuritis began to remit within days. A slower improvement was observed in symptoms of radiculitis, myelitis, encephalitis, and peripheral neuropathy. According to data in Figure 2 of the study report, at six months the RR for "partial remission" (improvement) showed no clear difference between interventions (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.28), whereas the RR for "full remission" (resolution) favored doxycycline, but with the possibility of no effect (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.42; low-quality evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). At 12 months, the RRs for "partial remission" and "full remission" were 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.21 and 0.96, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.31, respectively (low-quality evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). Of the 22 participants with only partial remission after 6 months, 10 chose to receive retreatment with penicillin G, 6 from the penicillin arm and 4 from the doxycycline arm. Three years after randomization, the recovery rate was 94% in the doxycycline and 91% in the penicillin G group if the retreatment group was excluded. In the &#8220;partial remission" group, 7/10 participants who chose retreatment recovered completely, compared to 7/12 of those who did not choose retreatment (no significant difference). Participants with partial remission had central nervous system involvement, a disseminated clinical picture, and/or a longer disease duration. The authors concluded that there was no clinically relevant difference between doxycycline and penicillin G. The number of participants with chronic LNB was too low for any subgroup analysis. In addition, the majority of these chronic LNB cases were also treated with immunosuppressants.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-12-07 15:50:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>In clinical practice, almost all people with identified symptomatic bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics. This is also true of people diagnosed with Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) (<LINK REF="REF-Halperin-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halperin 2015</LINK>). However, uncertainty exists about the absolute and relative efficacy of the available antibiotic regimens for LNB. This review did not address the prevention of LNB following initial antibiotic treatment of erythema migrans, the optimal duration of treatment with the various antibiotics, or the efficacy of antibiotics for treatment of late neurological manifestations of Lyme disease, sometimes referred to as late- or third-stage LNB. Also, this review did not address the efficacy of antibiotics for treatment of post-Lyme disease syndrome. We included only randomized comparative trials for quality reasons. The majority of the 450 participants from the 7 randomized treatment trials included in this review had typical manifestations of early disseminated (acute or stage II) LNB. Only a minority had objective, defined central nervous system parenchymal involvement consistent with late disseminated (chronic or stage III) LNB (4/145 participants in <LINK REF="STD-Oksi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Oksi 2007</LINK> and 6/75 participants in <LINK REF="STD-Kohlhepp-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kohlhepp 1989</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Oksi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Oksi 2007</LINK>, three participants had a disease duration of one year or longer.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-07 15:50:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We found no high-quality evidence on the absolute or relative efficacy of antibiotics for the treatment of LNB. Although there was some evidence on the relative efficacy of antibiotic treatment for LNB, it was mostly of low or very low quality. Although we selected only randomized studies for inclusion in this review, most lacked consistent, standardized, and well-defined efficacy outcomes. The heterogeneity of eligibility criteria, interventions, and assessment of outcomes meant that we could not perform a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>None of the studies reported on our proposed primary outcome, 'Improvement in a measure of overall disability in the long term (three or more months).' None of the trials reported a significant difference between antibiotic treatments by physician- or patient-reported measures of efficacy. In the studies that reported lack of efficacy or partial response separately, there were no differences between randomized treatment regimens. However, differences in eligibility, the assessments used, and the duration of follow-up among trials made any assessment of differences in outcomes difficult. In all seven trials, the majority of participants were reported as having recovered completely. The lack of a placebo group for the initial antibiotic treatment prevented assessment of the efficacy of antibiotic treatment versus natural recovery.</P>
<P>The majority of participants enrolled in these seven studies presumably had European LNB, predominantly acute LNB, and appear to have had good clinical outcomes (resolution of presenting signs and symptoms) regardless of whether the initial antibiotic treatment was ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, penicillin G, or oral or intravenous doxycycline. In a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Kohlhepp-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kohlhepp 1989</LINK>), the need for retreatment (as determined by the incomplete resolution of symptoms) was 29%, but this was not addressed in most studies. Retreatment with antibiotics usually occurred in people with chronic or stage III LNB, supporting the need for antibiotic treatment as early as possible to prevent disease progression to stage III LNB. A single trial that examined the question of prolonged treatment with a second antibiotic found no evidence of additional efficacy when extending ceftriaxone treatment with amoxicillin, where improvement occurred with antibiotic and placebo at the same rate (small numbers) (<LINK REF="STD-Oksi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Oksi 2007</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Oksi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Oksi 2007</LINK>, participants with "probable" Lyme disease did not respond to antibiotic treatment as well, in general, as participants with definite LNB, with the implication that some "probable" participants may have had alternative causation for their symptoms.</P>
<P>In summary:</P>
<OL>
<LI>We found no clinical trials to evaluate the absolute efficacy of initial treatment with antibiotics for LNB. The lack of placebo-controlled studies prevented us from assessing the extent to which antibiotics improve spontaneous recovery from LNB or prevent further complications.</LI>
<LI>Seven randomized studies mostly at high risk of bias and of marked heterogeneity provided some relative efficacy data for antibiotic treatment of LNB, only one of which was blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Ljostad-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ljostad 2008</LINK>). All studies were from Europe.</LI>
<LI>Marked heterogeneity among the eligible studies in terms of differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria, supportive laboratory diagnostic criteria, primary and secondary outcome measures, treatment regimens, prior antibiotic treatment, and duration of disease and follow-up prevented incorporation of results into a systematic meta-analysis. The quality of the evidence was mostly low to very low; we have formally presented this in 'Summary of findings' tables.</LI>
<LI>All studies reported improvement in the majority of participants following antibiotic treatment, and the majority had complete resolution of their symptoms in long-term follow-up, irrespective of the antibiotic regimen received and in the case of doxycycline regardless of whether it was given orally or intravenously.</LI>
<LI>Only three studies provided information on the need for retreatment (<LINK REF="STD-Kohlhepp-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kohlhepp 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlsson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Karlsson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ljostad-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ljostad 2008</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Where measured, objective biomarkers of response (CSF pleocytosis) recovered in almost all participants examined at follow-up.</LI>
<LI>Incomplete or poor treatment responses for the efficacy outcomes used in the trials were reported in only a minority of participants, regardless of the antibiotic used. Where no or partial response was recorded, there were no obvious differences in the rates of partial or lack of response between treatments.</LI>
<LI>All of the antibiotics studied appear to have been generally well tolerated as judged by all adverse event reporting. Only four studies provided information on discontinuation due to adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Pfister-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pfister 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mullegger-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mullegger 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pfister-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pfister 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ljostad-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ljostad 2008</LINK>), which can have a major impact on the outcome of the treatment.</LI>
<LI>The single study conducted in children treated very early in their disease reported full remission in all children. This study had a high risk of bias, with qualitative outcomes and incomplete follow-up data.</LI>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-12-07 15:50:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>As placebo-controlled studies have never been performed, the extent to which antibiotic treatment contributes to the natural recovery (absolute efficacy) of LNB is not known. Our review was therefore only able to summarize outcome data for the comparative effectiveness of antibiotics (relative efficacy) when used for the initial treatment of LNB. This review did not address the prevention of LNB following initial antibiotic treatment of erythema migrans, and we identified only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) that investigated the efficacy of retreatment following initial antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone.</P>
<P>The participants in the seven trials included in the review are likely to all have been representative of LNB from Europe. We did not find any randomized studies that included participants with LNB from the United States. LNB is caused by a number of different <I>Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato</I> species. In Europe it is caused by <I>B. garinii</I> and <I>B. afzelii</I> and only infrequently by <I>B. burgdorferi</I> <I>sensu stricto, </I>while in the United States all cases are caused by <I>B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. </I>Possible differences in clinical presentation and disease course between Europe and the United States are grounds for caution in applying the findings of this review to the development of guidance for treatment of LNB in the United States. For this reason, a straightforward extrapolation of conclusions from this review to people with LNB from the United States has limitations.</P>
<P>All studies used diagnostic criteria for LNB consistent with currently accepted case definitions (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2011b</LINK>). Owing to the paucity of data from late disseminated LNB, the evidence applies mostly to early disseminated (acute or stage II) LNB rather than to late disseminated (chronic or stage III) LNB.</P>
<P>One challenging aspect of LNB therapy concerns the definition of initial antibiotic treatment failure. Lyme immunoglobulin G antibodies postinfection may persist for many years despite complete clinical response, and on its own is not a diagnostic test of active infection with <I>B. burgdorferi</I> or a reliable criterion for treatment failure. A prospective Danish study of 187 consecutive LNB participants with intrathecal <I>B. burgdorferi</I>-specific antibody synthesis who were treated with penicillin G between 1985 and 1990 could not find a single case of treatment failure based on the clinical outcome and normalization of CSF (<LINK REF="REF-Hansen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 1992</LINK>). In contrast, in the studies included in this review, there were reported instances of treatment failure or only partial response, mostly for late disseminated (chronic or stage III) LNB. A second course of treatment with a different antibiotic in a single study was associated with a response in no more participants than placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Oksi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Oksi 2007</LINK>). Objective quantitative measures of treatment 'failure' are few. The resolution of CSF pleocytosis in 99/106 participants in whom measurements were available provide biomarker evidence of a treatment response in most cases. Qualitative symptom reports and measures of cognitive impairments are non-specific and error prone. Proper assessment of the response to antibiotic treatment in LNB requires a uniform definition of diagnostic criteria, a better understanding of the natural and treated history of the disease, and an understanding of what constitutes a treatment failure from both the patient and physician. Inclusion of subjective symptomatology is patient focused but makes it difficult to distinguish symptoms from other origins. All but one of the seven trials included in this review included both objective and subjective assessments of efficacy, and these correlated relatively well on the improvement from baseline. Further research is needed to prove the link between infection, ongoing versus pre-existing damage, presenting versus residual symptoms, signs, and other comorbid conditions.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-12-04 17:30:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We identified limitations in the design of all the included studies, in particular the lack of blinding in the majority of studies. We found a lack of standardization of entry criteria and of efficacy assessments across trials. All studies had a small sample size, with variable duration of follow-up. The confidence in our estimates on the efficacy of the studied antibiotics for LNB is limited, and the true effects may well be substantially different. We thus graded the quality of the evidence as mostly low to very low, with the GRADE definition of 'low' being "further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate" (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-Working-Group-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE Working Group 2004</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-12-07 15:50:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The review process extended over eight years from initial protocol to completion of the systematic review. The review team included specialists in neurology and infectious diseases and experts in the diagnosis, treatment, and pathogenesis of LNB from both the United States and Europe, who worked as unpaid volunteers. To minimize the risk of publication bias, we performed a comprehensive search for studies and also solicited information from investigators of included trials for unpublished data. We also extended requests for unpublished RCT data to known specialists in the field and to leaders of patient organizations to allow their membership to respond (International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society). Outcome measures differed in the trials, and recording of adverse drug reactions was limited, therefore it was difficult for the review authors to interpret the effect of antibiotic intervention positively or negatively except in general terms. The limited number of participants studied in individual trials also meant that this review could not detect less common or rare adverse events.</P>
<P>We revised the scope of the review to focus on antibiotic treatment for LNB, the usual treatment for Lyme disease, which resulted in the exclusion of one RCT that assessed the effect of steroids (<LINK REF="STD-Pfister-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Pfister 1988</LINK>). We revised our methods section to include current Cochrane methodology, including 'Summary of findings' tables, implemented since publication of our protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Cadavid-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cadavid 2008</LINK>),</P>
<P>We attempted to reduce potential biases in the review process and analytical biases by reselecting studies and extracting data with an independent team.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-12-04 17:30:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>In their recent systematic review, Dersch and colleagues considered both randomized and non-randomized trials investigating all pharmacological treatments and focused on adults with acute LNB (<LINK REF="REF-Dersch-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dersch 2015</LINK>). We identified one RCT of non-antibiotic treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Pfister-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Pfister 1988</LINK>), which they listed as a reference but did not include. We agree with their conclusion that the heterogeneity among the selected RCTs and the overall bias precludes conclusion on the preference of any antibiotic regimen investigated. However, unlike Dersch and colleagues, we considered the studies to be heterogeneous to a degree that prevented pooling of data from different studies into a meta-analysis. Differing from the study selection of Dersch and colleagues, we excluded two studies, mainly due to the lack of objective evidence of neurological disease (<LINK REF="STD-Hassler-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hassler 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oksi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Oksi 1998</LINK>). We did, however, include two studies not included by Dersch and colleagues, one in adults, <LINK REF="STD-Oksi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Oksi 2007</LINK>, and one in children (<LINK REF="STD-Mullegger-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mullegger 1991</LINK>). We were able to include <LINK REF="STD-Oksi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Oksi 2007</LINK> because the trial authors provided separate information on the LNB participants.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-12-07 15:50:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>For early disseminated (acute or stage II) Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), low- to very low-quality evidence suggests that the majority of people with LNB respond to antibiotics with known brain penetration and appropriate activity spectra, namely penicillin G, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and doxycycline, either oral or intravenous. There is no accurate estimate of the absolute efficacy of these antibiotics, as there were no appropriate studies from which to infer this. None of the included trials had a placebo control for initial antibiotic treatment, and most had limited power and lacked consistent and well-defined efficacy endpoints, study duration, and entry criteria. Also, the studies employed a range of treatment duration, from 10 to 21 days. All studies were conducted in Europe and none in the United States, thus no direct conclusion can be drawn on the effect of antibiotic treatment for LNB in the United States. The number of participants with late disseminated (chronic or stage III) LNB in the included trials was very low, and no useful separate conclusions can be drawn about its treatment with antibiotics. We observed no evidence of additional efficacy in a trial extending initial ceftriaxone treatment with amoxicillin. No firm conclusions can be drawn on the relative efficacy of the four antibiotics we reviewed. In the majority of cases reported in the seven included studies, European LNB was treatable with antibiotic regimens recommended in national guidelines, with marked improvement from baseline impairment. A minority of people do not improve after initial treatment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-04 17:30:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Clinical research on the treatment of LNB lacks standardization of diagnostic, entry, and efficacy outcome criteria. There is a need for randomized and blinded controlled trials of adequate size and power and with proper study design to compare relative efficacy of antibiotics, in terms of route of administration, treatment duration, safety and tolerability, and the need for retreatment. A multiple-treatments meta-analysis may be possible in the future if adequate data are generated. It is unlikely that a standard placebo arm can be ethically included in any future trial designs, and novel trial designs with delayed start or add-on therapy designs will be required. Future research would benefit greatly from standardization of diagnostic and outcome criteria and treatment failure criteria. Diagnostic research criteria should be sensitive enough to include an acceptable range of patients with different presentations, but also be specific enough to include only patients with Lyme disease&#8212;in clinical practice the findings of a trial can be broadened. The assessment of trial outcomes is equally important, as trial-based diagnosis and these outcomes should have both internal and external validity. Assessment of subjective complaints and cognitive impairment is feasible and should be included. It is important to address not only impairment and derivative biomarkers, but also to measure patient-reported disabilities and activity and participation measures. Rasch-built outcome measures should be preferred over those based on classical test theory.</P>
<P>There is an absence of trials in some important areas. Controlled trials of antibiotic treatment of chronic LNB and also including participants with non-European LNB are required, as current epidemiological and clinical studies suggest different disease courses and etiologic agents of LNB in Europe and the United States. More studies in children are also needed.</P>

<P>The review has a published protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Cadavid-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cadavid 2008</LINK>). A change in authors occurred: Dr J Aucott withdrew, and Dr H Gelderblom joined the review team. Subsequent to the publication of the protocol, we updated the methodology for the 'Risk of bias' assessment according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Early in 2014 we decided that a meta-analysis was not feasible and changed the focus of the review to a systematic narrative review.</P>
<P>The original protocol listed any treatment, including antibiotics and steroids. However, we changed the title of the review from 'Treatment for the neurological complications of Lyme disease' to 'Antibiotics for the neurological complications of Lyme disease' to focus the review on the usual treatment for this condition. This resulted in exclusion of a single randomized study of oral corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Pfister-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Pfister 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>The original plan was to discuss non-randomized, open, and uncontrolled studies and case series with more than 10 participants as appropriate, but not to include them in a meta-analysis. We did not assess non-randomised studies in the full review. We were unable to perform meta-analysis; therefore, our focus changed to a narrative review of randomized studies, which mostly provided low or very-low quality evidence. We considered that non-randomized studies were unlikely to provide additional valuable safety and efficacy data of sufficient quality for conclusions to be drawn.</P>
<P>The original protocol proposed to study neuropathy and myopathy. This was not possible in the current review, as the included studies did not provide distinct information on peripheral LNB.</P>
<P>The original protocol described a minimum set of diagnostic criteria for inclusion. We followed this to a large degree, however due to the heterogeneity of the seven studies included in the review, we opted for listing the detailed inclusion criteria in a separate table (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The original protocol proposed as primary endpoints for the meta-analysis 'improvement in a measure of overall disability or resolution of the presenting neurological deficits at three or more months following treatment'. This was not possible due to the heterogeneity in efficacy assessments. The same problem occurred with the secondary efficacy endpoints proposed in the protocol. For the review we listed the efficacy assessments as performed in each of the seven included trials and added <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, which summarizes efficacy assessments in each trial.</P>
<P>The original protocol proposed to scale appropriately the study duration to a standardized follow-up period before pooling data in a meta-analysis. This was not done. For the review we listed the duration of follow-up for each study and summarized the results in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.<BR/>
</P>
<P>None of the proposed meta-analyses specified in the original protocol were possible.</P>
<P>We transferred methods reported in the protocol relating to meta-analysis to <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>.</P>

<LI>The manuscript did not allow for the separation of LNB from other cases of disseminated LB, although the trial authors claim that most participants had neurological symptoms.</LI>
<LI>Antibiotic pretreatment in a subgroup (the trial author mentions 6 cases in each arm) prevents determination of efficacy of the initial intervention.</LI>
<LI>The lack of intrathecal production of Ab in the majority of participants is surprising for European LNB (the first author himself found intrathecal antibody production in about 50% of LNB participants in a later study). Pleocytosis of the CSF is not mentioned. Being a mixture of different manifestations of stage II and III Lyme disease, the LNB cases were not sufficiently characterized for judgement of antibiotic efficacy. Most participants had CSF PCR performed, but only 1 or 2 in each group were found to be positive, suggesting that many participants may not have had active LNB, but sequelae from previously treated disease. This is consistent with the observed low response rate to antibiotic therapy in both arms, as the participants were likely selected for failure to respond to earlier treatment and by persisting symptoms (fibromyalgia, &#8220;arthritis&#8221; not otherwise defined).</LI>

<TITLE MODIFIED="2016-04-22 20:10:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diego Cadavid">Additional methods</TITLE>
<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2016-12-07 12:18:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>If data are available for meta-analysis in the future, we will follow methods outlined in our protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Cadavid-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cadavid 2008</LINK>), updated to meet current Cochrane guidelines.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>If studies use different follow-up periods, we will scale results to a standardized follow-up period before we pool them in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>If cost and cost-effectiveness information is available, we will include it as part of the effects of the intervention analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>If published trials exclude any randomized participants from analyses, we will contact trial authors and incorporate any available additional data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>We will use the Cochrane Review Manager 5 software to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. We will use odds ratios (OR) for logistic regression analysis. For continuous data, we will examine the mean difference (MD) and report corresponding 95% CI when studies use the same measurement tool. Where studies assess an outcome using different measurement scales, we will calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI.</P>
<P>If studies with different scales are combined, we will ensure that higher scores for continuous outcomes all have the same meaning for any particular outcome. We will explain the direction of interpretation and report when directions are reversed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We will investigate statistical heterogeneity among studies using I<SUP>2</SUP> methodology (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). If significant heterogeneity exists (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 50%) for primary outcome measures, we will scrutinize reasons such as disease manifestation and severity, or treatment selection and duration. However, we will bear in mind uncertainty in interpretation when there are few studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We will perform a fixed-effect analysis and will repeat the calculations using the random-effects model, as this is more conservative than a fixed-effect model, which assumes that studies are measuring the same intervention effect.</P>
<P>We will undertake a meta-analysis only if we consider participants, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes to be sufficiently similar to ensure a result that is clinically meaningful.</P>
<P>If we include multi-arm studies, we will analyze multiple intervention groups to avoid omission of relevant groups or double-counting of participants, following guidance in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We will also consider the results of European studies in combination with and separately from results of studies performed in the United States. In Europe, diagnostic guidelines are less standardized, and the causative organisms of neuroborreliosis are different and more varied. We will want to learn what, if any, effect these geographic differences have on treatment outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We will perform sensitivity analyses by repeating the analysis excluding unpublished studies and studies at high risk of bias, and examining the effect of large, dominant studies or particular inclusion or exclusion criteria. Since the number of clinical studies of Lyme neuroborreliosis is small, we will consider the criteria used in each of the studies, assign levels of confidence to each of the definitions used, and interpret our meta-analysis in light of this information.</P>
