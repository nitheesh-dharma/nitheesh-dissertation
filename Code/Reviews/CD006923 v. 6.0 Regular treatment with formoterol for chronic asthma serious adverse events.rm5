<TITLE MODIFIED="2012-01-04 11:56:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">Does daily treatment with formoterol result in more serious adverse events compared to placebo or daily salbutamol?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-25 12:09:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Asthma is a common condition that affects the airways &#8211; the small tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs. When a person with asthma comes into contact with an irritant (an asthma trigger), the muscles around the walls of the airways tighten, the airways become narrower, and the lining of the airways becomes inflamed and starts to swell. This leads to the symptoms of asthma - wheezing, coughing and difficulty in breathing. They can lead to an asthma attack or exacerbation. People can have underlying inflammation in their lungs and sticky mucus or phlegm may build up, which can further narrow the airways. There is no cure for asthma; however there are medications that allow most people to control their asthma so they can get on with daily life.</P>
<P>Long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, such as formoterol, work by reversing the narrowing of the airways that occurs during an asthma attack. These drugs - taken by inhaler - are known to improve lung function, symptoms, quality of life and reduce the number of asthma attacks. However, there are concerns about the safety of long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, particularly in people who are not taking inhaled corticosteroids to control the underlying inflammation. We did this review to take a closer look at the safety of people taking formoterol daily compared to people on placebo or the short acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist salbutamol.</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference in the number of people who died during treatment with formoterol compared with placebo or salbutamol. Because so few people die of asthma, huge trials or observational studies are normally required to detect a difference in death rates from asthma. There were more non-fatal serious adverse events in people taking formoterol compared to those on placebo; for every 149 people treated with formoterol for 16 weeks, one extra non-fatal event occurred in comparison with placebo. There was no significant difference in serious adverse events in people on formoterol compared to regular salbutamol.</P>
<P>We conclude that regular formoterol should not be taken by people who are not taking regular inhaled steroids due to the increased risk of serious adverse events. Formoterol should not be used as a substitute for inhaled corticosteroids, and adherence with inhaled steroids should be kept under review if separate inhalers are used when formoterol is added to inhaled corticosteroids.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-04 11:48:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Epidemiological evidence has suggested a link between beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and increases in asthma mortality. There has been much debate about possible causal links for this association, and whether regular (daily) long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists are safe.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-06-30 14:02:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>The aim of this review is to assess the risk of fatal and non-fatal serious adverse events in trials that randomised patients with chronic asthma to regular formoterol versus placebo or regular short-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-01-25 12:09:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified trials using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. We checked websites of clinical trial registers for unpublished trial data and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submissions in relation to formoterol. The date of the most recent search was January 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-01-25 12:09:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>We included controlled, parallel design clinical trials on patients of any age and severity of asthma if they randomised patients to treatment with regular formoterol and were of at least 12 weeks' duration. Concomitant use of inhaled corticosteroids was allowed, as long as this was not part of the randomised treatment regimen.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-01-04 11:51:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion in the review. One author extracted outcome data and the second author checked them. We sought unpublished data on mortality and serious adverse events.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-25 12:09:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>The review includes 22 studies (8032 participants) comparing regular formoterol to placebo and salbutamol. Non-fatal serious adverse event data could be obtained for all participants from published studies comparing formoterol and placebo but only 80% of those comparing formoterol with salbutamol or terbutaline.</P>
<P>Three deaths occurred on regular formoterol and none on placebo; this difference was not statistically significant. It was not possible to assess disease-specific mortality in view of the small number of deaths. Non-fatal serious adverse events were significantly increased when regular formoterol was compared with placebo (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.57; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.31). One extra serious adverse event occurred over 16 weeks for every 149 people treated with regular formoterol (95% CI 66 to 1407 people). The increase was larger in children than in adults, but the impact of age was not statistically significant. Data submitted to the FDA indicate that the increase in asthma-related serious adverse events remained significant in patients taking regular formoterol who were also on inhaled corticosteroids.</P>
<P>No significant increase in fatal or non-fatal serious adverse events was found when regular formoterol was compared with regular salbutamol or terbutaline.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-25 12:09:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>In comparison with placebo, we have found an increased risk of serious adverse events with regular formoterol, and this does not appear to be abolished in patients taking inhaled corticosteroids. The effect on serious adverse events of regular formoterol in children was greater than the effect in adults, but the difference between age groups was not significant.</P>
<P>Data on all-cause serious adverse events should be more fully reported in journal articles, and not combined with all severities of adverse events or limited to those events that are thought by the investigator to be drug-related.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-01-25 12:09:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>There is currently no universally accepted definition of the term 'asthma'. This is in part due to an overlap of asthmatic symptoms with those of other diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but is also due to the probable existence of more than one underlying pathophysiological process. There are, for example, wide variations in the age of onset, symptoms, triggers, associations with allergic disease and the type of inflammatory cell infiltrate seen in patients diagnosed with severe asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Miranda-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miranda 2004</LINK>). Patients with all forms and severity of disease will typically have intermittent symptoms of cough, wheeze and/or breathlessness. Underlying these symptoms there is a process of variable, at least partially reversible airway obstruction, airway hyper responsiveness and, in most cases, chronic inflammation.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Airway obstruction</HEADING>
<P>Patients with a history of asthma demonstrate chronic changes within the airways including goblet cell hyperplasia, airway smooth muscle (ASM) hyperplasia and hypertrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Ebina-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebina 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ordonez-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ordonez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woodruff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodruff 2004</LINK>) and excess myofibroblasts with increased subepithelial collagen deposition (<LINK REF="REF-Brewster-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewster 1990</LINK>). In the acute setting, in patients who have died of status asthmaticus, airway obstruction is evident from air-trapping and lung hyperinflation with mucus plugging of the small and large airways (<LINK REF="REF-Dunnill-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunnill 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuyper-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuyper 2003</LINK>). There is also shedding of ciliated bronchial mucosal cells, inflammatory cell infiltrates and submucosal oedema with transudation of fluid into the bronchial lumen (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 1993</LINK>). It is more difficult to measure the degree of ASM contraction (bronchoconstriction) in post-mortem studies although evidence for a role of bronchoconstriction in airway narrowing comes from other sources.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Airway hyper responsiveness</HEADING>
<P>Patients with asthma typically display a degree of 'airway hyper responsiveness' to inhaled allergens (<LINK REF="REF-Cockcroft-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockcroft 2006</LINK>), and to a variety of chemical stimuli including histamine, serotonin, bradykinin, prostaglandins, methacholine and acetylcholine as well as other triggers such as exercise, deep inhalation and inhalation of cold air (<LINK REF="REF-Boushey-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boushey 1980</LINK>). Bronchoconstriction is implicated as the primary effector mechanism of airway narrowing in these responses. This is because of both the short time frame of the response and because many of these stimuli typically either cause bronchoconstriction directly <I>in vitro</I> or promote bronchoconstriction through interference with the autonomic control of ASM. Further evidence comes from findings that this response can be abolished or diminished by bronchodilator medications such as atropine and beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simonsson-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simonsson 1967</LINK>); although beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in particular may have additional mechanisms of action. Whether airway hyper responsiveness relates primarily to an abnormality of ASM, to increased ASM bulk (<LINK REF="REF-Wiggs-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiggs 1990</LINK>), to aberrant autonomic control or reflex pathways, or to physical damage to the airway epithelium remains to be established. Regular use of salbutamol has, however, been shown to increase airway hyper responsiveness to allergen exposure and produce tolerance to the protective effect of salbutamol against bronchoconstriction induced by both methacholine and allergens (<LINK REF="REF-Cockcroft-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockcroft 1993</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Inflammation</HEADING>
<P>It has long been thought that the histological changes described above and the phenomenon of airway hyper responsiveness are due to a combined acute and chronic inflammatory response (<LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 2000</LINK>). Patients with status asthmaticus have increased numbers of inflammatory cells including eosinophils and neutrophils, as well as a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines found in bronchial alveolar lavage (<LINK REF="REF-Tonnel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tonnel 2001</LINK>). In patients with chronic asthma there is also evidence of increased eosinophil numbers (<LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 1990</LINK>), inflammatory cell adhesion molecules (<LINK REF="REF-Vignola-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vignola 1993</LINK>) and some evidence of an association between the extent of inflammation, disease severity and hyperreactivity. This association has however been questioned on the background of a number of negative results (<LINK REF="REF-Brusasco-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brusasco 1998</LINK>), although it is made difficult to prove by the lack of a consistent marker of a sequential and variable inflammatory response (<LINK REF="REF-Haley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haley 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>Adrenaline was successfully used in the symptomatic treatment of asthma as far back as 1903 (<LINK REF="REF-Tattersfield-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tattersfield 2006</LINK>). Initially given subcutaneously, the inhaled route was tried in 1929 to reduce adverse effects but these remained a problem and in 1940 details of a new agent, isoprenaline (isoproterenol), were published in Germany (<LINK REF="REF-Konzett-1940" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konzett 1940</LINK>). Although isoprenaline was more selective for beta- as opposed to alpha-adrenoreceptors, adverse effects including palpitations were still a major problem, particularly with oral administration (<LINK REF="REF-Gay-1949" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gay 1949</LINK>) and it first became available as atomiser spray for use in the UK in 1948 (<LINK REF="REF-Pearce-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prior to the 1940s, mortality rates from asthma in a number of countries were stable and low at less than 1 asthma death per 100,000 people per year (<LINK REF="REF-Pearce-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). During the 1940s and 50s there was a slight rise in mortality rates and concerns about a possible link to inhaled adrenaline were raised at an early stage (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-1948" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 1948</LINK>). However, the rise was small and the cause unclear and sales continued to increase with the introduction of aerosol or metered-dose inhalers in the early 1960s. During this decade there was an epidemic of asthma deaths in at least six countries including England, Wales and New Zealand (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). In all six countries the epidemics coincided with the licensing of an aerosol called 'Isoprenaline Forte', which contained five times the dose of isoprenaline per administration than the standard preparation (<LINK REF="REF-Stolley-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stolley 1972</LINK>). In other countries including the Netherlands, where isoprenaline forte was introduced late and sales volumes low, and in the US, where isoprenaline forte was not licensed, no increase in asthma mortality occurred. This was despite an approximate trebling in per capita alternative bronchodilator sales between 1962 and 1968 in the US (<LINK REF="REF-Stolley-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stolley 1972</LINK>). A detailed review of the epidemic in England and Wales concluded it was not due to changes in death certification, disease classification or an increase in asthma prevalence, but instead was most likely due to new methods of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Speizer-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speizer 1968</LINK>). In England and Wales mortality rates fell following health warnings about the overuse of inhalers and banning of over the counter sales in 1968. It was around this time that more selective beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists such as terbutaline (<LINK REF="REF-Bergman-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergman 1969</LINK>) and salbutamol (albuterol) (<LINK REF="REF-Cullum-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullum 1969</LINK>) were being developed.</P>
<P>In the late 1970s a second epidemic of asthma deaths occurred in New Zealand (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). It was later shown that this epidemic coincided with the introduction and rising sales of fenoterol, a new short-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist (<LINK REF="REF-Crane-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crane 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). A significant association between mortality and fenoterol use was demonstrated in three consecutive case-control studies, the latter studies addressing criticisms of the first (<LINK REF="REF-Crane-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crane 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grainger-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grainger 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pearce-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 1990</LINK>). Furthermore the relative risk of asthma death in patients prescribed fenoterol increased markedly when analysis was restricted to subgroups defined by markers of severity, including previous hospital admission and use of oral corticosteroids. Following the publication of the first case-control study, the fenoterol market share in New Zealand fell from 30% in 1988 to 3% in 1991 and by the early 1990s the mortality epidemic appeared to be over (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). During the gradual decline in mortality in New Zealand from its peak in 1979, total sales of alternative beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, including salbutamol, gradually rose and the use of inhaled corticosteroids also increased during the latter half of the 1980s (<LINK REF="REF-Pearce-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">The introduction of long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists</HEADING>
<P>Given the relatively short action of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists such as salbutamol, in the late 1980s efforts were made to develop longer-acting compounds. Subsequently the long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (LABAs), salmeterol and formoterol were released by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Novartis, respectively. Both drugs cause bronchodilation that lasts for more than 12 hours although formoterol has a faster onset of action (<LINK REF="REF-Kemp-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kemp 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ringdal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ringdal 1998</LINK>). Given previous concerns about the safety profile of some of the short acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, salmeterol and formoterol were subject to randomised controlled trials on larger numbers of patients. Using these trials several Cochrane reviews have addressed the efficacy of LABAs in addition to inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2005</LINK>), in comparison with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2007</LINK>), short-acting beta2-agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2002</LINK>), leukotriene-receptor antagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2006</LINK>), and increased doses of inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Greenstone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenstone 2005</LINK>). The beneficial effects of LABAs on lung function, symptoms, quality of life and exacerbations requiring oral steroids have been demonstrated. However, with some studies demonstrating an associated increase in mortality concerns about the safety profile of LABAs have heightened and there has been much debate about the potential protective role of inhaled corticosteroids.</P>

<P>We have taken a different approach from <LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2006</LINK>, in that we have not assumed a class effect of long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, but we have considered trials comparing regular formoterol to placebo or regular salbutamol/terbutaline. We have chosen not to include results from trials on salmeterol in this review, as there are known differences in the pharmacological properties of salmeterol and formoterol (<LINK REF="STD-Ringdal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ringdal 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Noord-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Noord 1996</LINK>).

<P>The outcomes of this review were dichotomous and we recorded the number of participants with each outcome event, by allocated treated group. We planned to analyse mortality using risk difference, as many studies did not have any deaths in either arm. However, the recently revised <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>advises against this approach, so we only used the risk differences to estimate the absolute impact of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Although meta-analysis with Peto odds ratio has advantages when events are rare (<LINK REF="REF-Bradburn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradburn 2007</LINK>), it performs less well with unbalanced treatment arms and large effect sizes, and therefore we calculated the results for serious adverse events and mortality in RevMan 5.0 as pooled odds ratios using the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) fixed-effect model. We compared the results of this model to the Peto method and MH random-effects models (as sensitivity analysis), although <LINK REF="REF-Bradburn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradburn 2007</LINK> cautions against the random-effects model as the variance calculations are based on large sample assumptions.

<P>See <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> for the study flow diagram. We found 512 abstracts from the initial search in October 2007 (reduced to 504 after removing duplicates). We identified 128 relevant abstracts that related to formoterol alone. We included 22 studies (32 references) in the review and excluded 95 others (see <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>). Of those excluded 53 were less than 12 weeks in duration, (including 29 single-dose studies), three were not RCTs, eight were dose or device comparison studies, nine were on exercise-induced bronchospasm or acute asthma, nine used formoterol as reliever medication, eight were cross-over in design, three randomised to formoterol and budesonide and five were excluded for other reasons. One study that was included in <LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2006</LINK> was excluded from this review because formoterol was randomised with budesonide (<LINK REF="STD-Price-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2002</LINK>) and therefore did not fit the inclusion criteria for this review. Both authors reached consensus on all the included studies after inspection of the full text from papers and websites.</P>
<P>We repeated the search in July 2008, when we found 48 further abstracts. Six were relevant to this review but we excluded five as they were short-term studies, and one was on exercise-induced bronchospasm; we found no new studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Similarly a further search in January 2012 (cumulative total of 748 citations) identified three potentially relevant studies (<LINK REF="STD-Happonen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Happonen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kamenov-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kamenov 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Price-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Price 2008</LINK>).

<P>Since many of the studies randomised patients to more than two treatment arms, we have reported the overall number of patients randomised to treatment categories under investigation. Adults and adolescents are combined, as separate data for adolescents were not provided in any of the studies. In total 8032 participants were randomised (6693 adults and 1339 children); of these 2146 adults and 483 children received placebo, 2483 adults and 568 children received formoterol up to 12 µg twice daily, 921 adults and 277 children received formoterol 24 µg twice daily, and 1143 adults and 11 children received regular salbutamol or terbutaline. Although <LINK REF="STD-Molimard-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Molimard 2001</LINK> was an open study that did not use a placebo group, we included it in the placebo comparisons as on-demand salbutamol was used by patients in both the formoterol and the comparison arm.</P>
<P>Doses of formoterol ranged from 4.5 µg to 24 µg twice daily in children and 6 µg to 24 µg twice daily in adults (but different delivery devices mean that the delivered dose may not be identical between studies, even if the nominal dose is the same). We have considered high-dose formoterol to be 24 µg twice daily.</P>
<P>Concurrent use of inhaled corticosteroids varied in the included studies from zero to 100%; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> lists the inhaled steroid use by study. In almost all the studies at least half of the patients were taking inhaled corticosteroids at baseline.</P>

<P>Events were sparse in the trials and the presence or absence of mortality was not always reported in the paper publications.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Formoterol versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Data were available from 14 studies comparing formoterol (N = 3413) with placebo (N = 2050); this represents 80% of the randomised patients for this comparison. Three deaths occurred in these trials (two adults and one child), and overall there were three deaths on formoterol and none on placebo. The cause of death for one adult was not reported in <LINK REF="STD-SD_x002d_037_x002d_0344" TYPE="STUDY">SD-037-0344</LINK>, there was one adult death from asthma in <LINK REF="STD-Pleskow-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pleskow 2003</LINK>, and one child died of a subarachnoid haemorrhage in <LINK REF="STD-Von-Berg-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Von Berg 2003</LINK>. The pooled odds ratio (OR) was not statistically significant (Peto OR 4.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 49.49), see <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>. The confidence interval and point estimate are somewhat different for a Mantel-Haenszel OR 1.52 (95% CI 0.24 to 9.71) using fixed or random-effects models. This discrepancy is due to the continuity correction required for zero cells in the Mantel-Haenszel method. The point estimate of the pooled risk difference (RD) was an increase of 4 deaths per 10,000 treated with regular formoterol over 16 weeks, with a confidence interval from 20 fewer deaths to 28 more deaths per 10,000. There was no statistical heterogeneity in this outcome.</P>

<P>Data were available from six studies comparing formoterol (N = 847) to salbutamol/albuterol (N = 571), representing 49% of the randomised patients for this comparison. Only two deaths occurred, both in <LINK REF="STD-Pleskow-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pleskow 2003</LINK>; one in the formoterol arm (from asthma as reported above) and one in the salbutamol arm (from pancreatitis), and again the difference was not statistically significant.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Serious adverse events (SAEs) (non-fatal all-cause)</HEADING>
<P>An example of the definition of a serious adverse event (SAE) is given in <LINK REF="STD-Pleskow-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pleskow 2003</LINK>: &#8220;A serious adverse event was defined as any experience that was fatal or life-threatening, permanently disabling, requiring in-patient or prolonged hospitalisation, or was a congenital abnormality, cancer or drug overdose.&#8221; This is in line with the definition in <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>, and we have assumed that this definition was used in the other trials (even though this was often not made explicit). In most cases the events were defined as serious because they were associated with hospital admission.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Formoterol versus placebo</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Combined data from adults and children</HEADING>
<P>Data were available on non-fatal SAEs for 19 studies comparing regular formoterol (N = 4017) to placebo (N = 2629); this represents all of the randomised patients from published studies for this comparison. The studies were largely on adults (N = 5311), but five trials were in children (N = 1335).</P>
<P>The overall result indicated an increased risk of SAEs with formoterol (Peto OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.31) with low heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%), <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>. SAEs were rare in the studies (occurring in 1.2% of patients on placebo over a weighted mean of 16 weeks), so the pooled risk difference is small at 0.007 (95% CI 0.0012 to 0.013) and using a weighted mean of the placebo arms, over a 16-week period there would need to be 149 patients treated (95% CI 66 to 1407) for one extra serious adverse event to occur; this number needed to treat was calculated by <A HREF="http://www.nntonline.net">Visual Rx</A> using the pooled odds ratio and baseline risk of 1%. This is illustrated in <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK> which shows that for every thousand patients treated over 16 weeks with formoterol there are an extra six patients who will suffer a serious adverse event, so that in comparison to 10 per thousand in the placebo group this rises to 16 per thousand on regular formoterol.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis by applying the Mantel-Haenszel method gave a very similar result, OR 1.57 (95% CI 1.05 to 2.37). Using a random-effects model (which is not recommended for rare events due to an increased risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Bradburn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradburn 2007</LINK>)), the point estimate was similar but the confidence interval widened: OR 1.52 (95% CI 0.96 to 2.40). When we excluded the participants receiving high-dose formoterol (24 µg) arms from the analysis the confidence interval again widened (Peto OR 1.55; 95% CI 0.97 to 2.48)(<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Adults with non-fatal serious adverse events</HEADING>
<P>When the adult data comparing regular formoterol (N = 3170) with placebo (N = 2137) were considered on their own, the results showed a smaller increase in risk which did not reach statistical significance (Peto OR 1.23; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.99)(<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). The Mantel-Haenszel method gave very similar results, OR 1.22 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.96).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Children with non-fatal serious adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Although fewer children were studied, regular formoterol (N = 843) compared with placebo (N = 492), the separate results for children showed a larger increase in serious adverse events with regular formoterol (Peto OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.27 to 4.83)(<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>). Again the Mantel-Haenszel method gave a very similar result, OR 2.92 (95% CI 1.26 to 6.74). There was low heterogeneity in this outcome (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%), and the result in children remained significant when the data on high-dose formoterol were excluded (Peto OR 2.52; 95% CI 1.15 to 5.51) and Mantel-Haenszel OR 2.59 (95% CI 1.08 to 6.19)(<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>When the results in children are compared with adults using a test for interaction (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2003</LINK>), the increased risk in children relative to adults is a relative OR of 2.39 (95% CI 0.91 to 6.27) using the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio, which is not statistically significant. The results are very similar when the Peto OR is compared between adults and children (relative OR 2.02; 95% CI 0.89 to 4.59).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">High-dose formoterol versus lower doses</HEADING>
<P>When the study arms using formoterol 24 µg twice daily were compared to those using lower doses (formoterol 12 µg twice daily), no significant difference was found in adults (Peto OR 1.35; 95% CI 0.64 to 2.85)(<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>). The confidence interval for this result is too wide to rule out a difference in relation to dose, and although the three adult studies all used the same dry powder delivery device (Aerolizer), there is a high level of heterogeneity between studies (I<SUP>2 </SUP>=<SUP> </SUP>74%), which is unexplained.</P>
<P>Moreover the data from the Novartis database of published and unpublished placebo-controlled studies of at least four weeks duration has been included for comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Novartis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Novartis 2005</LINK>); the Novartis data show a significantly higher risk of asthma-related serious adverse events with formoterol 24 µg twice daily in comparison to 12 µg twice daily (Peto OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.13 to 4.11) and Mantel-Haenszel OR 2.08 (95% CI 1.11 to 3.89).</P>

<P>In contrast, the results from nine studies in adults comparing regular formoterol (N = 1119) to salbutamol (N = 920), representing 80% of the randomised patients for this comparison, showed a non-significant reduction in the risk of SAEs (Peto OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.43)(<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). However, when the results from patients using high-dose formoterol were excluded, there was a significant reduction in risk for formoterol in comparison with salbutamol or terbutaline (Peto OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.90) and Mantel-Haenszel OR 0.40 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.94) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). A test for interaction between the results comparing formoterol with placebo and salbutamol was not significant; the risk in trials against regular salbutamol compared to those against placebo using Mantel-Haenszel OR gives a relative OR of 0.46 (95% CI 0.21 to 1.01), whilst for the Peto method the relative OR is 0.59 (95% CI 0.26 to 1.36).</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">SAEs related to asthma and the cardiovascular system</HEADING>
<P>When formoterol is compared to placebo, there is a significant increase in asthma-related serious adverse events on regular formoterol (Peto OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.12 to 3.53) and Mantel-Haenszel OR 1.90 (95% CI 1.03 to 3.48)(<LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK>). This finding is also apparent from the Novartis integrated database (<LINK REF="STD-Novartis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Novartis 2005</LINK>), which is concordant with the results of the 10 Novartis studies included in the review as shown in <LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>.</P>
<P>In comparison with regular salbutamol there is a decrease in asthma-related serious adverse events on regular formoterol but this is not significant (Peto OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.29 to 1.88) and Mantel-Haenszel OR  0.72 (95% CI 0.32 to 1.76)(<LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a significant increase in hospital admissions for asthma when regular formoterol is compared to placebo: Peto OR 3.28; 95% CI 1.65 to 6.52 and Mantel-Haenszel OR 4.28; 95% CI 1.60 to 11.46 (<LINK REF="CMP-013.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.1</LINK>). For this outcome we assumed that all the patients with asthma-related SAE documented in the FDA submission were admitted to hospital; in <LINK REF="STD-Pleskow-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pleskow 2003</LINK> this is clearly stated to be the case for two patients on placebo and five on formoterol 24 µg, but is not clearly reported for the single patient on formoterol 12 µg (<LINK REF="STD-Mann-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mann 2003</LINK>). No significant difference was seen when regular formoterol is compared to regular salbutamol.</P>
<P>Very few events relating to the cardiovascular system were reported, so although the direction of effect is in favour of formoterol the confidence intervals in comparison to placebo and salbutamol are very wide (<LINK REF="CMP-014.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Impact of inhaled corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>It has not been possible to assess whether inhaled corticosteroids have an impact on SAEs with regular formoterol from the included studies, as this would require individual patient data relating inhaled corticosteroid usage to those patients who suffered the events, and these data are not available. However, data are presented in <LINK REF="STD-Novartis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Novartis 2005</LINK> in which patients on inhaled corticosteroids are compared with those who are not, for asthma-related serious adverse events. Although the increased risk is larger without inhaled corticosteroids (Peto OR 3.22; 95% CI 1.17 to 8.89) and Mantel Haenszel OR 7.31 (95% CI 0.97 to 55.06), than with inhaled corticosteroids (Peto OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.21 to 5.49) and Mantel-Haenszel OR 3.47 (95% CI 1.21 to 9.97), the confidence intervals are wide and there is no statistically significant interaction between the increased risk and use of inhaled corticosteroids. Moreover there remains a significant three-fold increase in odds for patients who were taking inhaled corticosteroids, and this is maintained when the data on formoterol 24 µg twice daily are excluded (Peto OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.06 to 7.15) and Mantel-Haenszel OR 3.11 (95% CI 1.01 to 9.55)(<LINK REF="CMP-015.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.1</LINK>).</P>

<P>Three deaths occurred on regular formoterol and none on placebo; this difference was not statistically significant. It was not possible to assess disease-specific mortality in view of the small number of deaths.</P>
<P>Non-fatal serious adverse events (SAEs) were significantly increased in comparison with placebo. These events were rare, occurring in 1.0% of patients in the placebo arms over an average of 16 weeks; in comparison 1.6% of those given regular formoterol suffered a SAE (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>). One additional participant with a SAE was found to occur for every 149 people treated with regular formoterol over 16 weeks, and the play of chance is compatible with one extra event for every 66 to 1407 given regular formoterol. The majority of these extra events appear to be asthma-related, and data from unpublished studies on the Novartis integrated database of placebo-controlled trials suggest that there may be a significant increase in the risk of asthma-related SAEs with regular formoterol even in those patients who were taking inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="CMP-015.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The increased risk is larger in children than in adults, but the difference between the results in children and adults is not statistically significant. No significant overall differences were found for all-cause mortality or non-fatal SAEs in trials comparing regular formoterol with salbutamol or terbutaline.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-02-07 11:42:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Although large numbers of participants have been treated with regular formoterol, the rarity of mortality and SAEs means that there is still considerable uncertainty in relation to the size of the effects being investigated. There is insufficient evidence to be sure whether the larger increase in SAEs found in children is significantly different from the smaller increase in adults. We have received additional information relating to eight studies from authors and manufacturers, but data have not been forthcoming for three of the included studies. The missing data represent a moderate proportion of the participants who are in trials comparing formoterol with salbutamol, but they could alter the point estimates and confidence intervals for this comparison. Whilst it has not been possible to obtain details of unpublished Novartis studies submitted to the FDA, the pooled data from the Novartis trials has been used in this review (but not combined with the included studies as there is an unknown degree of overlap).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Information from papers published in medical journals</HEADING>
<P>All-cause non-fatal SAEs were published in the paper reports of studies for 31 patients on formoterol and seven patients on placebo; this less than half of the total number of events found from all sources. Considering only the data from paper reports there is still a significant increase with regular formoterol (Peto odds ratio (OR) 2.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 4.53), see <LINK REF="CMP-016.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 16.1</LINK>.</P>

Both show small increases with regular formoterol that do not reach statistical significance, which may be because the larger number of minor adverse events are not altered by formoterol.

There are methodological concerns in relation to data from the Novartis integrated database, as these are not presented for the individual studies, but where it has been possible to compare results from the database with the Novartis studies included in the review the results are very similar (<LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>).</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-02-07 11:51:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>The findings of this review are similar to those of our review comparing regular salmeterol to placebo and regular salbutamol (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008</LINK>). Both reviews show that, in comparison with placebo, there are significant increases in all-cause SAEs with the use of regular long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists. The size of this increase is comparable for regular salmeterol (Peto OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.29) and regular formoterol (Peto OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.31). The placebo group event rates were different in the two reviews, so it would be misleading to try to compare the absolute increases in risk between salmeterol and formoterol. Similarly, although the increase in events reached statistical significance in adults (but not children) for salmeterol, and in children (but not adults) for formoterol, these age group differences may be due to the play of chance, as the test for interaction between age group and treatment effect was not significant in either case (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The number of participants is too small to assess the impact of regular formoterol on all-cause or asthma-related mortality, so it is not possible to compare these results with the increased asthma mortality found in <LINK REF="REF-SMART-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">SMART 2006</LINK>. However, data submitted by Novartis to the FDA (<LINK REF="STD-Novartis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Novartis 2005</LINK>) do indicate a significant increase in asthma-related serious adverse events, even in patients taking regular inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="CMP-015.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>A recent meta-analysis of individual patient data from trials of all FDA-approved LABAs found a higher risk of serious asthma-related events in children as compared to adults (<LINK REF="REF-McMahon-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMahon 2011</LINK>), which is in keeping with the results of this review. This increased risk in children persisted in those who were given concomitant ICS, but not in the trials in which participants were assigned to ICS as part of their randomised treatment.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2012-01-25 12:09:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>We did not use risk difference as the primary metric for analysis of rare events, due to new advice in the latest revision of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). One of the peer reviewers also pointed out that <LINK REF="REF-Bradburn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradburn 2007</LINK> cautions against the use of inverse-variance and DerSimonian and Laird methods for sparse data, so for the 2009 update we used the Peto OR for the primary analysis, as no continuity correction is required for zero cells. This brings the analysis for this review in line with the other reviews in this series.</P>
<P>Also we investigated reporting bias by comparing published and unpublished serious adverse events, and investigating the impact of using drug-related adverse events and the combined results from serious and non-serious adverse events.</P>

<P>The primary efficacy variable was morning PEF, recorded in patients' diaries</P>
<P>"Nine serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in eight patients in the formoterol groups (n=3 formoterol 4.5 mcg and n=5 in formoterol 9 mcg) and one SAE in the placebo group; none of the SAEs was considered causally related to the study drug. One death was reported in the formoterol 9 mcg group, from a subarachnoid haemorrhage, which was judged unlikely to be due to the study drug." Further information has been provided by the author to clarify that 2 patients in the formoterol 9 µg arm suffered 2 serious adverse events (asthma and haematuria in 1 patient, and abdominal pain and appendicitis in 1 patient), so 3 patients in each formoterol arm and 1 in the placebo arm had any SAE. The author also confirmed that the participant who died was not included in the 9 SAE events, but was one of the 8 patients who suffered a SAE.</P>

<P>Beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists are thought to cause bronchodilation primarily through binding beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptors on airways smooth muscle (ASM), with subsequent activation of both membrane-bound potassium channels and a signalling cascade involving enzyme activation and changes in intracellular calcium levels following a rise in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>). However, beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptors are also expressed on a wide range of cell types where beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists may have a clinically significant effect including airway epithelium (<LINK REF="REF-Morrison-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 1993</LINK>), mast cells, post capillary venules, sensory and cholinergic nerves and dendritic cells (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2006</LINK>).  Beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists will also cross-react to some extent with other beta-adrenoceptors including beta<SUB>1</SUB>-adrenoceptors on the heart. </P>
<P>The <I>in vivo </I>effect of any beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist will depend on a number of factors relating to both the drug and the patient. The degree to which a drug binds to one receptor over another is known as <I>selectivity</I>,<I> </I>which can be defined as absolute binding ratios to different receptors <I>in vitro</I>, whilst <I>functional selectivity</I> is measured from downstream effects of drugs in different tissue types <I>in vitro </I>or <I>in vivo.  </I>All of the beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists described thus far are more beta<SUB>2</SUB> selective than their predecessor isoprenaline <I>in vitro</I>. However, because attempts to differentiate selectivity between the newer agents are confounded by so many factors, it is difficult to draw conclusions about <I>in vitro </I>selectivity studies and probably best to concentrate on specific adverse side effects in human subjects at doses which cause the same degree of bronchodilatation. The <I>potency</I> of a drug refers to the concentration that achieves half the maximal receptor activation of which that drug is capable but it is not very important clinically as for each drug, manufacturers will alter the dose to try to achieve a therapeutic ratio of desired to undesired effects. In contrast <I>efficacy</I> refers to the ability of a drug to activate its receptor independent of drug concentration. Drugs that fully activate a receptor are known as full agonists and those that partially activate a receptor are known as partial agonists. Efficacy also is very much dependent on the system in which it is being tested and is affected by factors including the number of receptors available and the presence of other agonists and antagonists. Thus whilst salmeterol acts as a partial agonist <I>in vitro </I>it causes a similar degree of bronchodilation to the strong agonist formoterol in stable asthmatic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Noord-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Noord 1996</LINK>), presumably because there are an abundance of well-coupled beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptors available with few downstream antagonising signals. In contrast, with repetitive dosing formoterol is significantly better than salmeterol at preventing methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction (<LINK REF="REF-Palmqvist-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmqvist 1999</LINK>). These differences have led to attempts to define the 'intrinsic efficacy' of a drug independent of tissue conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Hanania-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanania 2002</LINK>), as shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. The clinical significance of intrinsic efficacy remains unclear.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Direct toxicity</HEADING>
<P>This hypothesis states that direct adverse effects of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists are responsible for an associated increase in mortality and most research in the area has concentrated on effects detrimental to the heart. Whilst it is often assumed that cardiac side effects of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists are due to cross-reactivity with beta<SUB>1</SUB>-adrenoceptors (i.e. poor selectivity), it is worth noting that human myocardium also contains an abundance of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptors capable of triggering positive chronotropic and inotropic responses (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1992</LINK>). Indeed, there is good evidence that cardiovascular side effects of isoprenaline (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 1985</LINK>) and other beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists including salbutamol (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1989</LINK>) are mediated predominantly via cardiac beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptors thus making the concept of <I>in vitro </I>selectivity less relevant. Generalised beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptor activation can also cause hypokalaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1983</LINK>) and it has been proposed that, through these and other actions, beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists may predispose to life-threatening dysrhythmias or cause other adverse cardiac effects.</P>
<P>During the 1960s epidemic most deaths occurred in patients with severe asthma and it was originally assumed that asthma and its sequelae, including hypoxia, were the primary cause of death. However, mucus plugging and hypoxia does not preclude a cardiac event as the final cause of death, and one might expect those with severe asthma to take more doses of a prescribed inhaler. As noted by Speizer and Doll most deaths in the 1960s were in the 10 to 19 age group and &#8220;at these ages children have begun to act independently and may be particularly prone to misuse a self-administered form of treatment&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Speizer-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speizer 1968</LINK>). If toxicity were related to increasing doses of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists one might expect most deaths to occur in hospital where high doses are typically used and this was not the case. One possible explanation for this anomaly was provided by animal experiments in which large doses of isoprenaline caused little ill effect in anaesthetised dogs with normal arterial oxygenation whereas much smaller doses caused fatal cardiac depression and asystole (although no obvious dysrhythmia) when hypoxic (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDevitt-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDevitt 1974</LINK>). It has been hypothesised therefore that such events would be less likely in hospital where supplemental oxygen is routinely given. The clinical relevance of these studies remains unclear although there is some evidence of a synergistic effect between hypoxia and salbutamol use in asthmatic patients in reducing total peripheral vascular resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Burggraaf-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burggraaf 2001</LINK>) &#8211; another beta<SUB>2</SUB>-mediated effect which could be detrimental to the heart during an acute asthma attack through a reduction in diastolic blood pressure.  Other potential mechanisms of isoprenaline toxicity include a potential increase in mucous plugging and worsening of ventilation perfusion mismatch despite bronchodilation (<LINK REF="REF-Pearce-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Further concerns about a possible toxic effect of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists were raised during the New Zealand epidemic in the 1970s. In 1981 Wilson et al, who first reported the epidemic, reviewed 22 fatal cases of asthma and noted &#8220;In 16 patients death was seen to be sudden and unexpected. Although all were experiencing respiratory distress, most were not cyanosed and the precipitate nature of their death suggested a cardiac event, such as an arrest, inappropriate to the severity of their respiratory problem&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1981</LINK>). In humans, fenoterol causes significantly greater chronotropic, inotropic and electrocardiographic side effects than salbutamol in asthmatic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 1990</LINK>). Interestingly, across the same parameters fenoterol also causes more side effects than isoprenaline (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>In patients with mild asthma and without a bronchoconstrictor challenge, salmeterol and salbutamol cause a similar degree of near maximal bronchodilation at low doses (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1994</LINK>). However, whilst as a one-off dose salbutamol is typically used at two to four times the concentration of salmeterol, the dose equivalences for salmeterol versus salbutamol in increasing heart rate and decreasing potassium concentration and diastolic blood pressure were 17.7, 7.8 and 7.6 respectively (i.e. salmeterol had a greater effect across all parameters). Given the lower intrinsic efficacy of salmeterol (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>), these results highlight the importance of <I>in vivo </I>factors; one possible explanation for the difference is the increased lipophilicity of salmeterol compared to salbutamol contributing to higher systemic absorption (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1994</LINK>).    </P>
<P>When comparing increasing actuations of standard doses of formoterol and salmeterol inhalers in stable asthmatic patients, relatively similar cardiovascular effects are seen at lower doses (<LINK REF="REF-Guhan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guhan 2000</LINK>). However, at the highest doses (above those recommended by the manufacturers) there were trends towards an increase in systolic blood pressure with formoterol; in comparison there was a trend towards a decrease in diastolic blood pressure and an increase in QTc interval with salmeterol although no statistical analysis of the difference was performed. In contrast in asthmatic patients with methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction there was no significant difference between salmeterol and formoterol in causing increased heart rate and QTc interval although formoterol caused significantly greater bronchodilation and hypokalaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Palmqvist-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmqvist 1999</LINK>). Whilst there is good evidence of cardiovascular and metabolic side effects with increasing doses of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, it is a little difficult to envisage serious adverse effects of this nature when using LABAs at manufacturer-recommended preventative doses. However, it is possible that some patients choose to use repeated doses of LABAs during exacerbations. </P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Tolerance</HEADING>
<P>In this setting, the term <I>tolerance </I>refers to an impaired response to beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in patients who have been using regular beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist treatment previously (<LINK REF="REF-Haney-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haney 2006</LINK>). Tolerance is likely to result from a combination of reduced receptor numbers secondary to receptor internalisation and reduced production and also uncoupling of receptors to downstream signalling pathways following repeated activation (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1995</LINK>). This phenomenon is likely to explain the beneficial reduction in systemic side effects seen with regular use of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists including salbutamol after one to two weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1989</LINK>). However, the same effect on beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptors in the lung might be expected to produce a diminished response to the bronchodilating activity of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists following regular use. In patients with stable asthma, whilst there is some evidence of tolerance to both salbutamol (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1977</LINK>) and terbutaline (<LINK REF="REF-Weber-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 1982</LINK>) other studies have been less conclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1989</LINK>).  However, evidence of tolerance to short and long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in both protecting against and reducing bronchoconstriction is much stronger in the setting of an acute bronchoconstrictor challenge with chemical, allergen and 'natural' stimuli (<LINK REF="REF-Haney-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haney 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Studies comparing salmeterol and formoterol have shown that both cause tolerance compared to placebo but there was no significant difference between the drugs (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Woude-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Woude 2001</LINK>). There also appears to be little difference in the tolerance induced by regular formoterol and regular salbutamol treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Hancox-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancox 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2001</LINK>).  To the authors' knowledge no studies have looked specifically at the degree of tolerance caused by isoprenaline and fenoterol in the setting of acute bronchoconstriction. Tolerance to bronchodilation has been shown to clearly occur with addition of inhaled corticosteroids to salmeterol and formoterol (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2003</LINK>) and terbutaline (<LINK REF="REF-Yates-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yates 1996</LINK>). There is conflicting evidence as to whether high-dose steroids can reverse tolerance in the acute setting (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>At first glance the toxicity and tolerance hypotheses might appear incompatible as systemic and cardiovascular tolerance ought to protect against toxicity in the acute setting and there is good evidence that such tolerance occurs in stable asthmatic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1989</LINK>). However, whilst this study showed that changes in heart rate and potassium levels were blunted by previous beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist use, they were not abolished; furthermore, at the doses studied these side effects appear to follow an exponential pattern (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1989</LINK>). In contrast, in the presence of bronchoconstrictor stimuli the bronchodilator response to beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists follows a flatter curve (<LINK REF="REF-Hancox-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancox 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wong-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 1990</LINK>) and as previously discussed this curve is shifted downwards by previous beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Hancox-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancox 1999</LINK>). Thus, it is theoretically possible that in the setting of an acute asthmatic attack and strong bronchoconstricting stimuli, bronchodilator tolerance could lead to repetitive beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist use and ultimately more systemic side effects than would otherwise have occurred. Of course, other sequelae of inadequate bronchodilation including airway obstruction will be detrimental in this setting.</P>
<P>Whilst the tolerance hypothesis is often cited as contributing towards the asthma mortality epidemics it is difficult to argue that reduced efficacy of a drug can cause increased mortality relative to a time when that drug was not used at all. However, tolerance to the bronchodilating effect of endogenous circulating adrenaline is theoretically possible and there is also evidence of rebound bronchoconstriction when stopping fenoterol (<LINK REF="REF-Sears-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sears 1990</LINK>), which may be detrimental. Furthermore, it appears that regular salbutamol treatment can actually increase airway responsiveness to allergen (<LINK REF="REF-Cockcroft-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockcroft 1993</LINK>) a potentially important effect that could form a variant of the toxicity hypothesis. Differences between beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in this regard are unclear, but the combination of rebound hyper responsiveness and tolerance of the bronchodilator effect with regular beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist exposure has been recently advocated as a possible mechanism to explain the association between beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and asthma mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Hancox-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancox 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other explanations</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Confounding by severity</HEADING>
<P>Historically, this hypothesis has been used extensively to try to explain the association between mortality and the use of fenoterol during the 1970s New Zealand epidemic (see <LINK REF="REF-Pearce-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 2007</LINK>) and is still quoted today. The hypothesis essentially relies on the supposition that patients with more severe asthma are more likely to take either higher doses of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists or a particular beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist (such as fenoterol) thereby explaining the association. This hypothesis was carefully ruled out in the three case-control studies by comparing the association between fenoterol and mortality in patients with varying severity of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Crane-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crane 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grainger-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grainger 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pearce-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 1990</LINK>). Furthermore, the hypothesis cannot explain the overall increase in mortality in the 1960s and 1970s nor can it explain any significant increase in mortality (whether taking inhaled steroids or not) from randomised controlled trial data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">The delay hypothesis</HEADING>
<P>This hypothesis accepts that beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists or a particular beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist cause an increased risk of mortality but indirectly by causing patients to delay before getting medical help and further treatments including high dose steroids and oxygen. There is evidence that both salmeterol and formoterol can reduce awareness of worsening underlying inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Bijl_x002d_Hofland-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bijl-Hofland 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McIvor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIvor 1998</LINK>). It is difficult to rule out the delay hypothesis in either explaining or contributing towards both the asthma mortality epidemics and an association with regular use of LABAs. There is evidence that beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists with higher intrinsic efficacy are more effective at relieving bronchoconstriction in the acute setting (<LINK REF="REF-Hanania-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanania 2007</LINK>) and could paradoxically cause patients to delay seeking medical help for longer. For the delay hypothesis to explain the increase in mortality during the 1960s and 1970s one has to imply that hospital treatment of asthma when mortality rates were low during the earlier years of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century was effective. It is difficult to say exactly how effective such treatment is likely to have been.   </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Reduced corticosteroid treatment</HEADING>
<P>A slight but significant variation of the delay hypothesis suggests that patients who have separate beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and corticosteroid inhalers may choose to take less corticosteroid because of better symptom control from the inhaled beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and it is reduced corticosteroid treatment that contributes to a rise in mortality. It is rather difficult to see how this hypothesis explains the epidemics of asthma deaths in the 1960s and 1970s relative to the 1920s and 30s (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>), given that corticosteroids were not used for the treatment of asthma in the earlier decades. If this hypothesis were to explain increased mortality from more recent randomised controlled trial data one would not expect to see an increase in mortality in those taking LABAs alone. </P>
