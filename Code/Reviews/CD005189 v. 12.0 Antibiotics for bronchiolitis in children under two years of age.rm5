<P>
<B>Question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence on the effect of antibiotics on clinical outcomes in children with bronchiolitis.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Bronchiolitis is a serious respiratory illness that affects babies. It is most commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and is the most common reason for hospitalisation in babies younger than six months. Babies usually present with runny nose, cough, shortness of breath and signs of difficulty in breathing, which can become life-threatening. Despite its viral cause, antibiotics are often prescribed. Prescribers may be expecting benefits from anti-inflammatory effects attributed to some antibiotics or be concerned about secondary bacterial infection, particularly in children who are very unwell and require intensive care. We wanted to discover if antibiotics improved or worsened clinical outcomes in children with bronchiolitis.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This evidence is current to June 2014. We identified seven trials (824 participants) comparing antibiotics with placebo or no antibiotics in children with bronchiolitis. Two of these studies also compared intravenous and oral antibiotics.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Our primary outcome was duration of symptoms/signs (duration of supplementary oxygen requirement, oxygen saturation, wheeze, crepitations (crackles), fever). Secondary outcomes included duration of admissions/time to discharge from hospital, readmissions, complications/adverse events (including death) and radiological (X-ray) findings.</P>
<P>We included seven studies with a total of 824 participants. Four studies reported on duration of supplementary oxygen requirement and did not demonstrate a significant difference in the duration of oxygen use comparing antibiotics to placebo. We combined three studies comparing azithromycin versus placebo and again did not demonstrate a significant difference between antibiotics and placebo in the duration of oxygen requirement. Most of the included studies did not report on the primary outcomes of wheeze, crepitations and fever. One study with a high risk of bias found mixed results for the effects of antibiotics on wheeze but no difference for other symptom measures. One study found no difference in duration of fever and one study found no difference in presence of fever on day two.</P>
<P>In regards to secondary outcomes, six included studies did not find any difference between antibiotics and placebo for the outcomes of length of illness or length of hospital stay. For length of hospital stay, we combined data from three studies comparing the use of azithromycin versus placebo as a subtotal as part of the overall analysis of the effect of antibiotics on hospital stay. These combined results similarly showed no difference between antibiotics (azithromycin) and placebo. One small study with a high risk of bias found that three weeks of clarithromycin significantly reduced hospital readmission compared to placebo. However, this reduction in hospital readmissions was not replicated in a more recent study that randomised 97 children to receive either a single large dose of azithromycin or placebo. There were no deaths reported in any arms of any of the seven included trials and none of the studies specifically reported on adverse effects of antibiotics. Only two studies made general comments that no adverse effects were found with antibiotic use. Radiological findings were not reported as an outcome in any of the included studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>This 2014 updated review is stronger, owing to the inclusion of two new randomised controlled trials (RCTs). These two studies combined involved a further 138 participants in the antibiotic arm and 143 participants in the placebo arm. Prior to this only three small RCTs had examined antibiotics versus placebo, with only 72 participants in the antibiotic arms and 72 participants in the placebo arms. Consequently, this review makes a substantial contribution, especially with regards to the role of macrolides, such as azithromycin, in bronchiolitis. No new unpublished data have been included. However, the review authors have no reason to suspect that the search strategy has biased the review results. Raw data could not be obtained from one study conducted 40 years ago, nor from three other trials, which is a weakness of this review. Three trial authors did provide raw data for this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>This review did not find sufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotics for bronchiolitis. Research may be justified to identify a subgroup of patients who may benefit from antibiotics.</P>

<P>We included seven studies with a total of 824 participants. The results of these seven included studies were often heterogeneous, which generally precluded meta-analysis, except for deaths, length of supplemental oxygen use and length of hospital admission.</P>
<P>In this update, we included two new studies (281 participants), both comparing azithromycin with placebo.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-10-06 19:37:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-10-06 19:37:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bronchiolitis is a serious, potentially life-threatening respiratory illness that often affects young babies. It occurs most frequently in the first year of life and is the commonest cause of hospital admissions in infants under six months of age (<LINK REF="REF-Wohl-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wohl 1978</LINK>). The most commonly identified pathogen is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Other viruses such as human meta-pneumovirus (HMPV), influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus and rhinovirus have also been implicated (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2004</LINK>). Other less common pathogens include <I>Mycoplasma pneumoniae </I>(<I>M. pneumoniae</I>), which can occur in sporadic outbreaks (<LINK REF="REF-Glezen-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glezen 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rose-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 1987</LINK>). The diagnosis is most often made on clinical grounds, which usually includes tachypnoea (rapid breathing) and wheezing in children under two years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Bordley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bordley 2004</LINK>). Immunofluorescence and culture of the nasopharyngeal aspirate may be used to determine the causative organism and may reduce antibiotic use (<LINK REF="REF-Christakis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christakis 2005</LINK>). A chest X-ray may show hyperinflation and patchy atelectasis (where parts of the lung collapse or do not inflate properly) (<LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2006</LINK>). There are few effective therapies, including antiviral therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2006</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-10-06 19:37:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antibiotics are not recommended unless there is concern about complications such as secondary bacterial pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzgerald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzgerald 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lozano-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lozano 2002</LINK>). This is based on evidence suggesting a low risk of bacteraemia (0.2%) in children with bronchiolitis and fever - a lower risk than for children with a fever without a recognisable illness, where the rate ranges from 2% to 7% (<LINK REF="REF-Greenes-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenes 1999</LINK>). Antibiotic use comes with significant harms including common adverse reactions (rash, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting), cost and community bacterial resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Brook-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brook 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Infants with severe bronchiolitis requiring mechanical ventilation have been shown to have high rates of bacterial co-infection. Bacterial co-infection rates vary from 21% (<LINK REF="REF-Thorburn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorburn 2006</LINK>) to 26% (<LINK REF="REF-Kneyber-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kneyber 2005</LINK>), measured in both from endotracheal aspirates. Consistent with these results, <LINK REF="REF-Kneyber-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kneyber 2005</LINK> reported antibiotic use at 95% in infants with bronchiolitis in intensive care.</P>
<P>Antibiotics are commonly used in hospitalised infants, even in children who are not ventilated, at rates of 34% (<LINK REF="REF-Vogel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vogel 2003</LINK>), 45% (<LINK REF="REF-Christakis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christakis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorburn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorburn 2006</LINK>), and 99% (<LINK REF="REF-Kabir-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kabir 2003</LINK>). In one outpatient study antibiotics were used in 53% of children with bronchiolitis (<LINK REF="REF-Halna-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halna 2005</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-10-06 19:37:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antibiotics may be useful in cases of illness where superinfection with bacteria occurs, although it is unlikely that antibiotics will be effective for a condition that only has a viral cause. However, some antibiotics may have anti-inflammatory effects, which may improve symptoms.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-03-30 02:52:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of antibiotics for uncomplicated bronchiolitis is common yet is not justified by our understanding of bronchiolitis as a viral illness. The discord between clinical practice and the pathophysiological understanding of bronchiolitis as a viral illness will benefit from the empirical evidence offered by this systematic review.</P>

<P>Six included studies did not find any difference between antibiotics and placebo for their primary outcomes of length of illness (<LINK REF="STD-Field-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Field 1966</LINK>) or length of hospital stay (<LINK REF="STD-Kabir-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kabir 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kneyber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kneyber 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazumder-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mazumder 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCallum-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McCallum 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2012</LINK>). One small study with a high risk of bias found that three weeks of clarithromycin significantly reduced hospital admission compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Tahan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tahan 2007</LINK>). This reduction in hospital readmissions was not replicated in a more recent study that randomised 97 children to receive either a single large dose of azithromycin or placebo (n = 50 azithromycin, n = 47 placebo) (<LINK REF="STD-McCallum-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McCallum 2013</LINK>). Another study with a high risk of bias found mixed results for the effects of antibiotics on wheeze but no difference for other symptom measures (<LINK REF="STD-Mazumder-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mazumder 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>We only combined data for deaths, duration of supplementary oxygen use and length of hospital stay. There were no deaths in any arms of any of the seven included trials. For duration of supplementary oxygen use, we combined three studies comparing azithromycin versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Kneyber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kneyber 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCallum-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McCallum 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2012</LINK>). The three studies providing adequate data for days of supplementary oxygen showed no difference between antibiotics and placebo (pooled mean difference (MD) -0.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.72 to 0.33). For length of hospital stay, we combined data from three studies comparing the use of azithromycin versus placebo as a subtotal as part of the overall analysis of the effect of antibiotics on hospital stay (<LINK REF="STD-Kneyber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kneyber 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCallum-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McCallum 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2012</LINK>). One other study comparing erythromycin with placebo was not included because its addition resulted in statistically significant heterogeneity of the pooled results. This study had a higher risk of bias and it used a different antibiotic (erythromycin rather than azithromycin) as the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Kabir-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kabir 2009</LINK>). The three studies providing adequate data for length of hospital admission similarly showed no difference between antibiotics (azithromycin) and placebo, providing a pooled MD of -0.58 days (95% CI -1.18 to 0.02) with acceptable statistical heterogeneity. Two studies providing sufficient data to compare hospital readmissions showed no significant difference between antibiotic and placebo groups but we did not pool data as there was a substantial risk of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>statistic = 59%) (<LINK REF="STD-McCallum-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McCallum 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tahan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tahan 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-10-06 20:15:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinicians may be concerned that if they do not use antibiotics in a child presenting with a fever and clinical symptoms and signs of bronchiolitis, they may be putting the child at risk of serious complications such as pneumonia, septicaemia and death. It has already been noted that children with this presentation are very unlikely to have an occult bacteraemia (<LINK REF="REF-Greenes-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenes 1999</LINK>). In one study, paediatricians were less likely to evaluate febrile infants presenting with clinical signs of bronchiolitis for sepsis. In this series of 219 febrile infants with clinical signs of bronchiolitis, none had a serious bacterial infection and it was concluded that selective evaluation for sepsis in this population of febrile infants is appropriate (<LINK REF="REF-Luginbuhl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luginbuhl 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition to the four new randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the 2011 update, this 2014 updated review includes a further two new RCTs, all of which investigated the use of macrolide antibiotics for bronchiolitis. Macrolides are thought to have anti-inflammatory activities as well as antibiotic activity (<LINK REF="REF-Culic-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Culic 2001</LINK>), and so were thought to have potential in treating bronchiolitis, a viral condition. Additionally, clarithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, has been shown to have immune modulatory effects (<LINK REF="REF-Ichiyama-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ichiyama 2001</LINK>). One included study hypothesised that clarithromycin would be beneficial for bronchiolitis and found clinical benefit from clarithromycin (<LINK REF="STD-Tahan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tahan 2007</LINK>). However, firm conclusions about the benefits of clarithromycin for bronchiolitis cannot be drawn from this study of 21 participants because of the small numbers and the high risk of potential bias.</P>
<P>Another study examining a macrolide antibiotic, azithromycin, hypothesised that macrolide antibiotics would make no difference in bronchiolitis and this was what this study found (<LINK REF="STD-Kneyber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kneyber 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kneyber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kneyber 2008</LINK> was a larger study and had fewer quality appraisal concerns. The two new included studies in this 2014 update also demonstrated no statistically significant benefit of azithromycin compared to placebo for their primary outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-McCallum-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McCallum 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2012</LINK>). The pooled result of these three studies for length of hospital admission was close to attaining statistical significance. However, the pooled result shows a potential reduction of only half a day in hospital, which represents approximately a 10% decrease in hospital time, which is of dubious clinical significance for an outcome which depends on many structural factors independent of the disease course. Azithromycin also has a long half-life, which may contribute to increased risk of emerging resistant strains of bacteria.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mazumder-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mazumder 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kabir-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kabir 2009</LINK> compared intravenous ampicillin and oral erythromycin for bronchiolitis and found no significant difference between the two. There was also no significant difference with control. For <LINK REF="STD-Mazumder-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mazumder 2009</LINK>, the mixed results of antibiotics on the outcome of wheeze and high risk of potential bias mean that this study cannot support the use of antibiotics in bronchiolitis. No firm conclusions can be drawn from the empirical evidence contained in this review regarding the benefits of macrolide antibiotics for bronchiolitis.</P>
<P>None of the studies specifically reported on adverse effects of antibiotics. Only two studies made general comments that no adverse effects were found with antibiotic use (<LINK REF="STD-Field-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Field 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCallum-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McCallum 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Methods to reduce antibiotic use for bronchiolitis have been investigated. <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2002</LINK> found that a clinical pathway reduced inpatient antibiotic use for bronchiolitis from 27% to 9%.</P>
<P>Children with a serious illness requiring admission to intensive care, and especially those requiring ventilation, may have higher rates of bacterial co-infection, possibly justifying the increased use of antibiotics in this setting (<LINK REF="REF-Kneyber-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kneyber 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorburn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorburn 2006</LINK>). There have been no RCTs assessing the usefulness of antibiotics for bronchiolitis in an intensive care setting. <LINK REF="REF-Bloomfield-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloomfield 2004</LINK> found that aside from intensive care admission (2.9% with bacteraemia), children with a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection are more likely to be bacteraemic if they have a nosocomial RSV infection (6.5% bacteraemia) or cyanotic congenital heart disease (6.6% bacteraemia). The baseline rate of bacteraemia in children with RSV bronchiolitis in this study was 0.6%. However, a small study conducted in a paediatric intensive care unit in the United States found that otherwise low-risk infants (23 infants) with RSV bronchiolitis and respiratory failure had rates of concomitant bacterial pneumonia at 20% or higher (<LINK REF="REF-Levin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 2010</LINK>). Further evaluation of the risk of secondary bacterial infection following bronchiolitis would help inform the role of antibiotics in this viral infection, especially in the context of respiratory failure.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-10-06 19:37:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This 2014 update saw the addition of two larger studies examining azithromycin versus placebo for bronchiolitis (<LINK REF="STD-McCallum-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McCallum 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2012</LINK>). These two studies combined involved a further 138 participants in the antibiotic arm and 143 participants in the placebo arm and demonstrated no statistically significant benefit of azithromycin compared to placebo for their primary outcomes.</P>
<P>Prior to this only three small RCTs had examined antibiotics versus placebo, with only 72 participants in the antibiotic arms and 72 participants in the placebo arms. The two previous studies describing adequate randomisation conducted in high-income countries did not find any difference between antibiotic and placebo arms (<LINK REF="STD-Field-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Field 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kneyber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kneyber 2008</LINK>). The study which found clarithromycin more likely to reduce hospital admission than placebo did not adequately describe randomisation nor allocation concealment and 30% of those randomised were excluded owing to co-administration of corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Tahan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tahan 2007</LINK>). The inconsistency of results seems most likely to be owing to the differences in methodological quality. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Tahan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tahan 2007</LINK> was the only one to use clarithromycin and the only study to use antibiotics for three weeks. Two studies have been conducted in low-income countries (<LINK REF="STD-Kabir-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kabir 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazumder-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mazumder 2009</LINK>), with a further two being conducted in upper-middle income countries (<LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tahan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tahan 2007</LINK>). Both <LINK REF="STD-Mazumder-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mazumder 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kabir-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kabir 2009</LINK> were studies which had a high risk of bias.</P>

<P>This 2014 updated review is stronger, owing to the inclusion of a further two new RCTs and makes a substantial contribution, especially with regards to the role of macrolides in bronchiolitis. No new unpublished data have been included. However, the review authors have no reason to suspect that the search strategy has biased the review results. Raw data could not be obtained from one study conducted 40 years ago (<LINK REF="STD-Field-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Field 1966</LINK>), nor from <LINK REF="STD-Tahan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tahan 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mazumder-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mazumder 2009</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Kabir-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kabir 2009</LINK>, which is a weakness of this review. Some trial authors did provide raw data for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Kneyber-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kneyber 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCallum-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McCallum 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinto-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pinto 2012</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-10-06 19:37:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Research to identify a possible small subgroup of patients presenting with bronchiolitis-like symptoms who may benefit from antibiotics is justified. These might include those with respiratory failure, in intensive care, with nosocomially acquired respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and with cyanotic congenital heart disease. Future research may include subgroups based on tests for specific pathogens. Otherwise, research may be better focused on determining the reasons that clinicians use antibiotics so readily for bronchiolitis and how to reduce use of antibiotics for bronchiolitis, as well as ways to reduce clinician anxiety about not using antibiotics.</P>
