<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>This review examined the effects of different materials used for retrograde filling in children and adults for whom this treatment is necessary in order to save the tooth.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>The living part of the tooth, also known as the tooth pulp, can become irreversibly inflamed as a result of damage or bacterial infection due to tooth decay. To deal with this problem, the dentist has to drill a hole to access the inner space of the tooth or root canal system, and remove the infected tissue and toxic irritants by a combination of mechanical cleaning and irrigation. After this is done, the dentist fills the space with an inert packing material and seals the opening. This procedure is known as root canal therapy. Although results are generally good, a small number of failures do occur. This may be attributed to the complexity of the root canal system, which has many small additional pathways communicating with each other, making it difficult to completely eliminate all of the toxins and irritants. These can spread, causing the infection around the root to last indefinitely. When root canal therapy fails, a retreatment called retrograde filling is a good alternative to save the tooth. During retrograde filling the dentist cuts a flap in the gum and creates a hole in the bone to get access to the bottom tip of the root. After cutting off the tip, then thorough preparation, the apex is sealed (the apical seal) and the hole made by the dentist filled with a dental material. This sealing process is thought to be the single most important factor in achieving success in a retrograde root filling. Many materials have been developed to seal the root tip, mineral trioxide aggregate is the material of interest at present, but there is no consensus about which material is best.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence in this review, which was carried out together with Cochrane Oral Health, is up-to-date as of 13th September 2016. We included six studies that evaluated 916 participants and 988 teeth, who were undergoing retrograde filling using different types of filling material: mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), intermediate restorative material (IRM), super ethoxybenzoid acid (Super-EBA), dentine-bonded resin composite, glass ionomer cement, and amalgam. Five studies were conducted in Europe and one in Asia. Studies measured the success rate with clinical or radiological methods. None of the studies reported possible side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The limited evidence is insufficient to draw any conclusion as to the benefits of any one material over another, so we are not able to recommend which material is best to use in retrograde filling at present.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence presented is of very low quality due to the small amount of available studies, all at high risk of bias, results were imprecise and may not be applicable to other settings/countries.</P>

<P>Root canal therapy is a sequence of treatments involving root canal cleaning, shaping, decontamination and obturation. It is conventionally performed through a hole drilled into the crown of the affected tooth, namely orthograde root canal therapy. For teeth that cannot be treated with orthograde root canal therapy, or for which it has failed, retrograde root filling, which seals the root canal from the root apex, is a good alternative. Many materials, such as amalgam, zinc oxide eugenol and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), are generally used. Since none meets all the criteria an ideal material should possess, selecting the most efficacious material is of utmost importance.</P>

<P>Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 13 September 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 8) in the Cochrane Library (searched 13 September 2016); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 13 September 2016); Embase Ovid (1980 to 13 September 2016); LILACS BIREME Virtual Health Library (1982 to 13 September 2016); and OpenSIGLE (1980 to 2005). <A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</A> and the <A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform</A> were searched for ongoing trials. We also searched Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (in Chinese, 1978 to 20 September 2016); VIP (in Chinese, 1989 to 20 September 2016); China National Knowledge Infrastructure (in Chinese, 1994 to 20 September 2016); and Sciencepaper Online (in Chinese, to 20 September 2016). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-12-12 13:21:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only that compared different retrograde filling materials, with reported success rate that was assessed by clinical or radiological methods for which the follow-up period was at least 12 months.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-12-12 13:24:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors extracted data independently and in duplicate. Original trial authors were contacted for any missing information. Two review authors independently carried out risk of bias assessments for each eligible study following Cochrane methodological guidelines.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-12 13:41:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included six studies (916 participants with 988 teeth) reported in English. All the studies had high risk of bias. The six studies examined five different comparisons, including MTA versus intermediate restorative material (IRM), MTA versus super ethoxybenzoic acid cement (Super-EBA), Super-EBA versus IRM, dentine-bonded resin composite versus glass ionomer cement and glass ionomer cement versus amalgam. There was therefore little pooling of data and very little evidence for each comparison.</P>
<P>There is weak evidence of little or no difference between MTA and IRM at the first year of follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.97 to 1.22; 222 teeth; quality of evidence: low). Insufficient evidence of a difference between MTA and IRM on success rate at the second year of follow-up (RR 1.06; 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.25; 86 teeth, 86 participants; quality of evidence: very low). All the other outcomes were based on a single study. There is insufficient evidence of any difference between MTA and Super-EBA at the one-year follow-up (RR 1.03; 95% CI: 0.96 to 1.10; 192 teeth, 192 participants; quality of evidence: very low), and only weak evidence indicating there might be a small increase in success rate at the one-year follow-up in favour of IRM compared to Super-EBA (RR 0.90; 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.01; 194 teeth; quality of evidence: very low). There was also insufficient and weak evidence to show that dentine-bonded resin composite might be a better choice for increasing retrograde filling success rate compared to glass ionomer cement at the one-year follow-up (RR 2.39; 95% CI: 1.60 to 3.59; 122 teeth, 122 participants; quality of evidence: very low). And there was insufficient evidence of a difference between glass ionomer cement and amalgam at both the one-year (RR 0.98; 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.12; 105 teeth; quality of evidence: very low) and five-year follow-ups (RR 1.00; 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.20; 82 teeth; quality of evidence: very low).</P>
<P>None of these studies reported an adverse event.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-12-14 10:35:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Root canal therapy is a sequence of treatments for the infected pulp of a tooth which results in the elimination of that infection and the subsequent protection of the decontaminated tooth from future microbial invasion (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2006</LINK>). It involves the removal of the infected pulp, the subsequent shaping, cleaning, decontamination of the hollow tooth core and obturation. Traditionally, treatment is carried out through a hole drilled on the top of the crown of the tooth, and it is known as orthograde root canal therapy (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> (A and B)). With the development of new materials and techniques, orthograde root canal therapy has been demonstrated to provide satisfactory results for patients in most cases. However, because of the well-known complexity of the root canal system and the acknowledged difficulty of completely eliminating all bacteria, their by-products and toxins, from the canal system, failures occur at a reported rate of 4% to 15% (<LINK REF="REF-Sjogren-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sjogren 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swartz-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swartz 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2004</LINK>). A higher failure rate was ascertained by Eriksen's review of multiple clinical studies of success and failure (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksen 1991</LINK>). There are many causes for such failures, such as untreated canals, ledges formation, perforations, and overextensions of root-filling materials. To plan treatment effectively, the clinician may place the aetiological factors into four groups (<LINK REF="REF-Sundqvist-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sundqvist 1998</LINK>):<BR/>1. persistent or reintroduced intraradicular micro-organisms;<BR/>2. extraradicular infection;<BR/>3. foreign body reaction;<BR/>4. true cysts.<BR/>
</P>
<P>For these treatment failures, conventional orthograde endodontic retreatment is always the first choice. Although it is a highly predictable option in most cases, periradicular surgery may be indicated for teeth with persistent periradicular pathosis that have not responded to non-surgical approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2004</LINK>). Sometimes, apical surgery is preferred to orthograde treatment for expediency or if a tight-fitting post, especially a fibre post, is present. At this circumstance, conventional retreatment needs to remove more dentine to acquire a pathway into the original root canal, which may cause root perforation or root fracture.</P>
<P>Periradicular surgery should be considered as an extension to non-surgical treatment, because the underlying aetiology of the disease process and the treatment objectives are the same: the prevention or elimination of apical periodontitis (<LINK REF="REF-Hargreaves-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hargreaves 2015</LINK>). Periradicular surgery, also called retrograde filling, always requires root-end preparation and obturation (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> (D and E)). The former aims to expose the apical root via flap elevation and bone removal prior to cavity preparation on the apical root where the apical foramina is located. Following that, materials are placed in the cavity for apical sealing. Harty reported that the apical seal was the single most important factor in achieving success in such surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Harty-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harty 1970</LINK>). This apical seal is established by retrograde filling materials obturated between the root canal system and the surrounding tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Gutmann-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutmann 1991</LINK>). Thus, subsequent studies have evaluated many retrograde materials so as to determine which is most efficacious.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-12-14 10:37:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Amalgam has been used as a retrograde filling material for many years. Its earliest use as a root-end filling following resection has been reported in 1884 (<LINK REF="REF-Vasudev-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasudev 2003</LINK>). It has the advantages of being easily available, inexpensive and easy to handle. Therefore, for many years, amalgam was accepted as the material of choice for root-end filling, and the clinical application of amalgam was well documented in several clinical studies with a reported success rate of 50% to 80% (<LINK REF="REF-Dalal-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalal 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finne-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finne 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grung-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grung 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirsch-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsch 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Persson-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Persson 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rud-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rud 1972</LINK>). However, in recent years, the efficacy of amalgam has been questioned due to initial marginal leakage, corrosion, moisture sensitivity, mercury contamination of periapical tissue and the potential hazards associated with mercury-containing materials (<LINK REF="REF-Eley-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eley 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gartner-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartner 1992</LINK>). The disadvantages associated with amalgam and the potential long-term damage to the environment has led to the research and development of alternative materials.</P>
<P>In the past decades, amalgam has slowly given way to zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE) containing materials, such as intermediate restorative material (IRM), which has 20%, by weight, polymethacrylate added to the base zinc oxide powder and super ethoxybenzoic acid (Super-EBA), which contains ethoxybenzoic acid. In vitro leakage studies, animal studies, and retrospective in vivo studies indicate that these ZOE-containing materials are superior to amalgam in terms of sealability and biocompatibility (<LINK REF="REF-Dorn-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorn 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1990</LINK>). Shortcomings of the currently available ZOE-containing cements are their mild to moderate toxicity, when freshly mixed, and their radiopacity, which is similar to that of gutta-percha (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In recent years a promising new root-end filling material, mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), developed at Loma Linda University, California, USA (<LINK REF="REF-Torabinejad-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torabinejad 1993</LINK>) has received widespread attention (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1993</LINK>). Its major components are similar to Portland cement, a mixture of dicalcium silicate, tricalcium silicate, tricalcium aluminate, gypsum, and tetracalcium aluminoferrite (<LINK REF="REF-Camilleri-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camilleri 2005</LINK>). Although it is an expensive material and requires additional skill and equipment to use satisfactorily, the clinician can handle it satisfactorily after suitable training (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2010</LINK>). MTA has major advantages, including excellent biocompatibility (<LINK REF="REF-Camilleri-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camilleri 2006</LINK>), ideal adherence to cavity walls, low solubility (<LINK REF="REF-Poggio-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poggio 2007</LINK>), and the ability of inducing cementogenesis at the root surface, with deposition of new cementum onto the exposed dentine and MTA surfaces (<LINK REF="REF-Baek-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baek 2005</LINK>). MTA is an excellent bioactive material. When it is placed in direct contact with human tissues, it will form calcium hydroxide that releases calcium ions for cell attachment and proliferation (<LINK REF="REF-Takita-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takita 2006</LINK>); modulates cytokine production (<LINK REF="REF-Koh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koh 1998</LINK>), and encourages proliferation and migration of progenitors followed by their differentiation into odontoblast-like cells (<LINK REF="REF-Kuratate-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuratate 2008</LINK>). However, the mean setting time of MTA is 165 ± 5 minutes, which is longer than amalgam, Super-EBA, and IRM (<LINK REF="REF-Torabinejad-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torabinejad 1995</LINK>), which is potentially problematic in endodontic surgery.</P>
<P>In addition to polymers, glass ionomer cements, polycarboxylate cements, zinc phosphate cements, calcium phosphate cements and composite resins have all been employed and several cases reported (<LINK REF="REF-Hauman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauman 2003</LINK>). A new material, Biodentine, which is reported to have reparative dentine synthesis properties (<LINK REF="REF-Laurent-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laurent 2012</LINK>), is awaiting clinical evaluation as a possible retrograde filling material. All these materials have different characteristics and are potential alternatives to traditional materials, although potential harm should be carefully considered before widespread use is considered.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-12-05 13:05:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies have proved that the main contributory factor in endodontic failure is persistent microbial infection in the root canal system and periapical region (<LINK REF="REF-Siqueira-Jr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siqueira Jr 2003</LINK>). Chemical and mechanical preparation may not reach every corner of the complex root canal system. Bacteria in isthmuses, ramifications, irregularities and dentinal tubules may persist and some necrotic tissue debris may also remain. Bacteria may gain access to the periapical region if complete sealing is not achieved, leading to pathological lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siqueira-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siqueira 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>To control microbial infection is always a high priority in periradicular surgery. The surgery removes the pathogenic agents and establishes an environment facilitating the regeneration of damaged tissue first. Then the procedure usually involves root-end exposure and resection, in addition to preparing a Class I cavity and retrofilling with packing materials (<LINK REF="REF-Torabinejad-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torabinejad 1995</LINK>). Hence, these materials can form a proper seal of the internal root canal contents from the external periradicular tissues and therefore repair root defects (<LINK REF="REF-Chong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2004</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-12-05 13:05:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Periapical surgery is the last resort to save a tooth in endodontics. If it is not successful, the tooth might be lost. The use of proven retrograde filling materials is critical for apical sealing, which is the single most important factor in achieving success in periradicular surgery. To maintain a perfect apical seal, an ideal endodontic retrograde filling material is required to adhere to the tooth structure, be insoluble in tissue fluids, be dimensionally stable, non-resorbable, radiopaque, and exhibit biocompatibility, if not bioactivity (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kratchman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kratchman 2004</LINK>). In order to find the best, if not ideal, retrograde filling material, many clinical trials have been conducted in an attempt to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different materials. Secondly, the sample size of most clinical trials is small and some of the results conflict with one another. Therefore, the purpose of our systematic review, through the use of strict criteria to integrate small sample size trials, was to clarify the clinical effect and safety of different materials for retrograde filling in root canal therapy.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Characteristics of the outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcome in our review was success rate which was assessed via clinical or radiological methods or a combination of the two. It was defined as no pain, pain on percussion or palpation, tenderness, increased tooth mobility, sinus tract formation or any other subjective discomfort; and no presence of apical absorption or no bony change compared to the baseline indicated treatment failure.</P>
<P>All included studies followed the definition of success rate using the specified criteria provided by <LINK REF="REF-Molven-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molven 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Rud-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rud 1972</LINK> (<LINK REF="STD-Chong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chong 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Song-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-W_x00e4_livaara-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wälivaara 2011</LINK>) or <LINK REF="REF-Zetterqvist-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zetterqvist 1991</LINK> (<LINK REF="STD-Jesslen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jesslen 1995</LINK>).

<LI>incomplete or scar healing (improvement);</LI>
<LI>uncertain healing (no improvement);</LI>
<LI>unsatisfactory healing.</LI>

<P>As described in these specified criteria, the rate of complete healing, incomplete or scar healing (improvement) were all considered as meeting the definition of success rate used in our review; the other two (uncertain healing (no improvement), unsatisfactory healing) were considered to be failures.</P>

<P>We also collected data using the root of the teeth as the unit of analysis. However, instead of using combined methods for evaluation, only the radiological method was adopted in this case. As there was a clear description of the participants who were lost to follow-up, both PP and ITT analyses ('worst-case scenario' analysis) were performed. Insufficient and weak evidence indicated that dentine-bonded resin composite had a greater effect than glass ionomer cement on success rate (RR 1.59; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.09) with 73 roots in the dentine-bonded resin composite group and 54 roots in the glass ionomer cement group (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>). ITT analysis ('worst-case scenario' analysis) was adopted in this section, which supported the results of the PP analysis (RR 2.31; 95% CI 1.62 to 3.29) with 89 roots in each group (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>).</P>

<P>This review aimed at comparing the outcomes of different retrograde filling materials. Only six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chong 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jesslen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jesslen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Song-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-W_x00e4_livaara-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wälivaara 2011</LINK>) with five comparisons of retrograde filling materials were finally considered to be eligible for this systematic review. The quality of the body of evidence was assessed using GRADE (<LINK REF="REF-Atkins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkins 2004</LINK>). We present five 'Summary of findings' tables where we were able to perform quantitative analysis. They are mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) versus intermediate restorative material (IRM) (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), MTA versus super ethoxybenzoid acid (Super-EBA) (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>), Super-EBA versus IRM (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>), dentine-bonded resin composite versus glass ionomer cement (<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>) and glass ionomer cement versus amalgam (<LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was little pooled data and very little evidence for each comparison. There is weak evidence of little or no difference between MTA and IRM at the first year follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.22; 222 teeth; two studies at high risk of bias; quality of the body of evidence: low). The long setting time (165 ± 5 minutes) is potentially a problem in this type of surgery. Many investigations have been performed to overcome it, such as using a chelating agent or sodium phosphate dibasic (Na<SUB>2</SUB>HPO<SUB>4</SUB>) setting accelerator (<LINK REF="REF-Ber-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ber 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huang-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2008</LINK>). Some new and potentially promising materials have been available for root-end filling, such as Bioceramics (<LINK REF="REF-Damas-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Damas 2011</LINK>) and Biodentine (<LINK REF="REF-Soundappan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soundappan 2014</LINK>), but more clinical studies are needed to testify their properties.</P>
<P>All the other outcomes were based on single studies. There was insufficient evidence, from these single studies (mostly with small sample sizes), to determine differences between the following groups.</P>
<UL>
<LI>MTA versus Super-EBA after one-year follow-up (quality of the body of evidence: very low).</LI>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-12-06 14:55:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One of the studies included in the review was conducted in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Chong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chong 2003</LINK>), one in Denmark (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2002</LINK>), two in Sweden (<LINK REF="STD-Jesslen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jesslen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-W_x00e4_livaara-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wälivaara 2011</LINK>), one in South Korea (<LINK REF="STD-Song-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2012</LINK>) and one in the Netherlands (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2005</LINK>). 916 participants with 988 teeth were randomised. The participants were of different gender and age (the youngest reported was 17 (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2005</LINK>) and the oldest was 64 (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2005</LINK>)). The studies included different types of teeth. The applicability of the results could be adopted to different demographics of patients and different types of teeth.</P>
<P>All the studies followed a rigid surgical procedure. The procedures were of little difference except for some detail in the root resection and form of cavity. The lengths of apical root resection were 2 to 3 mm (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Song-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2012</LINK>), 3 mm (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2005</LINK>), and 3 to 4 mm (<LINK REF="STD-W_x00e4_livaara-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wälivaara 2011</LINK>). There was no complete agreement on how much of the root should be resected to satisfy biological principles. <LINK REF="REF-Gilheany-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilheany 1994</LINK> suggested that at least 2 mm be removed to minimize bacterial leakage from the canals. An anatomical study of the root apex showed that at least 3 mm of the root-end must be removed to reduce 98% of apical ramifications and 93% of lateral canals (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2001</LINK>). Besides the length of resection, the choice of root-end bevel angle was still in question. Traditionally, the bevel angle which provides best access and visibility was used. But the bevel may open up many channels of communication between the infected canal system and surrounding tissue, allowing the intradental infection to create persistent inflammation. Recent studies indicate that a right angle to the long axis of the root is preferable. In the studies included in this review, only one adopted such a right angle (<LINK REF="STD-Chong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chong 2003</LINK>). In the other five studies, a slightly oblique resection of the root was performed. <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2002</LINK> resected at a mean angle of 35 degrees, <LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2005</LINK> 10 to 25 degrees and <LINK REF="STD-Song-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2012</LINK> had a bevel angle of 0 to 10 degrees.</P>
<P>Recently the use of a microscope has become popular (<LINK REF="STD-Christiansen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Christiansen 2009</LINK>). In the studies within this review, <LINK REF="STD-Song-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2012</LINK> used a microscope and in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-W_x00e4_livaara-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wälivaara 2011</LINK>) the dental surgeon used magnification loupes to acquire a better visual field. Following root resection, cavities were prepared in two ways: four studies used ultrasonic equipment while two used a traditional bur. <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2002</LINK> prepared slightly concave cavities, and <LINK REF="STD-Jesslen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jesslen 1995</LINK> prepared box-type cavities. The depth of the cavity was 2 to 3 mm in <LINK REF="STD-Lindeboom-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeboom 2005</LINK>, 3 mm in <LINK REF="STD-Song-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-W_x00e4_livaara-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Wälivaara 2011</LINK>. The condition of the root-end varied. The modern concept of an ideal root-end preparation is defined as a Class I cavity at least 3 mm into the root dentine, with walls parallel to and coincident with the anatomic outline of the root canal space, which would achieve the aim of removing the intracanal filling material and associated irritants so as to create a cavity that could be properly filled. From this description, we could consider that the results of the systematic review may not be seriously influenced by heterogeneity of performance of the surgery.</P>

<P>The body of evidence that we identified does not allow for any robust conclusions about which retrograde filling material is best. Six studies, which analysed a total of 916 participants (988 teeth), were included. All the studies had a high risk of bias. All of the eight pieces of evidence produced from the studies were of low quality according to GRADE (<LINK REF="REF-Petrisor-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrisor 2006</LINK>). When such risk of bias issues were considered alongside the fact that the studies in each comparison/outcome were either single small studies (leading to serious imprecision) or had 95% confidence intervals that prevented the intervention being favoured over the control, the evidence was rated low to very low quality. These GRADE ratings can be interpreted as indicating that there is a lack of confidence in the effect estimates and further research is highly likely to change the estimates, and our confidence in them.</P>

<P>To discover as many relevant studies as possible, articles were identified irrespective of publication language, status and date through electronic searches and handsearching. The reference lists from each identified article, reviews and related textbooks were also searched.

We have tried all means to contact the author and the American Association of Endodontists, but no reply was received. Another four potentially eligible studies (<LINK REF="STD-Burstein-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Burstein 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nordenram-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Nordenram 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pantschev-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pantschev 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rud-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rud 1996</LINK>) were excluded because their study type could not be determined from the reports and the authors failed to reply to our contact.<BR/>

<P>A newly published systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2010</LINK>) compared the clinical outcomes of MTA used as root-end filling with other materials in endodontic surgery. They searched studies conducted on human teeth in vivo, regardless of whether they were prospective studies. Five studies, two that compared MTA with IRM, one that compared MTA with gutta-percha and two that compared MTA with amalgam, were selected. The analysis suggested that MTA as a root-end filling is better than amalgam but similar to IRM, which were similar to the results indicated in our review. However, the authors of <LINK REF="REF-Tang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2010</LINK> had included some studies which seemed non-existent (we have tried to retrieve the studies they included and discovered at least two studies to which they referred did not actually exist in the corresponding issues of those journals, and no studies with similar titles could be found).</P>
<P>Richard Niederman and his colleagues have carried out two systematic reviews focused on retrograde filling materials. The first one (<LINK REF="REF-Niederman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niederman 2003</LINK>) was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs), cohort studies and case-control studies, which were conducted on humans, in vivo. The languages were limited to English, German and French. Only two RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Jesslen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jesslen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zetterqvist-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zetterqvist 1991</LINK>), which were also analysed in our review, were included in this study. They concluded that glass ionomer cement is almost as effective as amalgam. Furthermore, the other six CCTs and six case-control studies selected in Niederman's review indicated that EBA cement, composite with Gluma and gold leaf, as well as orthograde gutta-percha, may be more effective than retrograde amalgam filling. The second review (<LINK REF="REF-Theodosopoulou-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theodosopoulou 2005</LINK>) tested the characteristics of retrograde filling materials in vitro. Thirty-four studies met all their inclusion and validity criteria. The results indicate that, beyond 10 days in vitro, the most effective retrofilling materials, when measured by dye/ink penetration are: composites, followed by glass ionomer cement, amalgam, orthograde gutta-percha, and EBA. The results of these in vitro studies are not congruent with in vivo study results, suggesting a need to re-evaluate the clinical validity and importance of in vitro studies.</P>

<P>The present results call for further research. We hope future studies could address and answer the following issues.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Participants: studies with a large number of participants from different races.</LI>
<LI>Intervention and comparison: trials focusing on the materials considered in this systematic review are still needed, and trials using new materials are also required. Many investigations have tried to use a chelating agent or accelerator to overcome the main drawback of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), its long setting time, which is also worth more research.</LI>
<LI>Follow-up: increasing the follow-up period to observe the long-term effects and safety.</LI>
<LI>To improve the quality of future evidence, we recommend blinding the outcome assessors. Most studies only have the participants and the statistical assessor blinded. But <LINK REF="STD-Christiansen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Christiansen 2009</LINK> figured out an easy method to blind the radiograph observers. They exported radiographs from the Digora system in TIFF format to Adobe Photoshop format, masking the apical root filling with grey patches. Future studies could make use of this methodology.</LI>

<CAPTION>
<P>A: an infected tooth. The inner space of the tooth is the root canal system, where the pulp is located. The pulp of this tooth is irreversibly inflamed from bacterial infection due to decay.</P>
<P>B and C: the process of root canal therapy. B: a hole has been drilled from the top of the crown of the tooth. The dentist could then remove the infected tissues and toxic irritants by a combination of mechanical cleaning and irrigation in the root canal system through the hole. C: after cleaning and irrigation, the dentist fills the space with an inert packing material and seals the opening.</P>
<P>D and E: the process of retrograde filling. D: when retrograde filling is indicated, the dentist needs to cut a flap in the gum and creates a hole in the bone to get access to the bottom tip of the root. E: after cutting off the tip, then thorough preparation, the apex is sealed (the apical seal) and the hole made by the dentist filled with a dental material.</P>
