We used randomised trials comparing either one of two types of vaccines with dummy vaccines or nothing. One type of vaccine is based on live but weakened influenza viruses (live attenuated influenza vaccines) and is given via the nose. The other is prepared by killing the influenza viruses with a chemical (inactivated virus) and is given by injection through the skin. We analysed the number of children with confirmed influenza and those who had influenza-like illness (ILI) (headache, high temperature, cough, and muscle pain) and harms from vaccination. Future updates of this review will be made only when new trials or vaccines become available. Data from 33 observational studies included in previous versions of the review have been retained for historical reasons but have not been updated due to their lack of influence on the review conclusions.</P><P><B>Key messages</B></P><P>Live attenuated and inactivated vaccines can reduce the proportion of children who have influenza and ILI. Variation in the results of studies means that we are uncertain about the effects of these vaccines across different seasons.</P><P><B>What was studied in this review? </B></P><P>Over 200 viruses cause ILI and produce the same symptoms (fever, headache, aches, pains, cough, and runny nose) as influenza. Doctors cannot distinguish between them without laboratory tests because both last for days and rarely cause serious illness or death.</P><P>The types of virus contained in the vaccines are usually those that are expected to circulate in the following influenza seasons, according to recommendations of the World Health Organization (seasonal vaccine). Pandemic vaccine contains only the virus strain that is responsible for the pandemic (e.g. the type A H1N1 for the 2009 to 2010 pandemic).</P><P><B>Main results </B></P><P>We found 41 randomised studies. Most studies included children older than two years of age and were conducted in the USA, Western Europe, Russia, and Bangladesh.</P><P>Compared with placebo or do nothing, live attenuated vaccines probably reduced the proportion of children who had confirmed influenza from 18% to 4% (moderate-certainty evidence), and may reduce ILI from 17% to 12% (low-certainty evidence). Seven children would need to be vaccinated for one child to avoid influenza, and 20 children would need to prevent one child from experiencing an ILI. We found data from one study that showed similar risk of ear infection in the two groups. There was insufficient information available to assess school absence and parents needing to take time off work. We found no data on hospitalisation, and harms were not consistently reported.</P><P>Compared with placebo or no vaccination, inactivated vaccines reduce the risk of influenza from 30% to 11% (high-certainty evidence), and they probably reduce ILI from 28% to 20% (moderate-certainty evidence). Five children would need to be vaccinated for one child to avoid influenza, and 12 children would need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of ILI. The risk of otitis media is probably similar between vaccinated children and unvaccinated children (31% versus 27%, moderate-certainty evidence). There was insufficient information available to assess school absenteeism due to very low-certainty evidence from one study.

We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for the key outcomes of influenza, influenza-like illness (ILI), complications (hospitalisation, ear infection), and adverse events. Due to variation in control group risks for influenza and ILI, absolute effects are reported as the median control group risk, and numbers needed to vaccinate (NNVs) are reported accordingly. For other outcomes aggregate control group risks are used.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-01-13 14:45:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We included 41 clinical trials (&gt; 200,000 children). Most of the studies were conducted in children over the age of two and compared live attenuated or inactivated vaccines with placebo or no vaccine. Studies were conducted over single influenza seasons in the USA, Western Europe, Russia, and Bangladesh between 1984 and 2013. Restricting analyses to studies at low risk of bias showed that influenza and otitis media were the only outcomes where the impact of bias was negligible. Variability in study design and reporting impeded meta-analysis of harms outcomes.</P><P><B>Live attenuated vaccines</B></P><P>Compared with placebo or do nothing, live attenuated influenza vaccines probably reduce the risk of influenza infection in children aged 3 to 16 years from 18% to 4% (risk ratio (RR) 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.41; 7718 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and they may reduce ILI by a smaller degree, from 17% to 12% (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.80; 124,606 children; low-certainty evidence). Seven children would need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza, and 20 children would need to be vaccinated to prevent one child experiencing an ILI. Acute otitis media is probably similar following vaccine or placebo during seasonal influenza, but this result comes from a single study with particularly high rates of acute otitis media (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.01; moderate-certainty evidence). There was insufficient information available to determine the effect of vaccines on school absenteeism due to very low-certainty evidence from one study. Vaccinating children may lead to fewer parents taking time off work, although the CI includes no effect (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.03; low-certainty evidence). Data on the most serious consequences of influenza complications leading to hospitalisation were not available. Data from four studies measuring fever following vaccination varied considerably, from 0.16% to 15% in children who had live vaccines, while in the placebo groups the proportions ranged from 0.71% to 22% (very low-certainty evidence). Data on nausea were not reported.</P><P><B>Inactivated vaccines</B></P><P>Compared with placebo or no vaccination, inactivated vaccines reduce the risk of influenza in children aged 2 to 16 years from 30% to 11% (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.48; 1628 children; high-certainty evidence), and they probably reduce ILI from 28% to 20% (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.79; 19,044 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Five children would need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza, and 12 children would need to be vaccinated to avoid one case of ILI. The risk of otitis media is probably similar between vaccinated children and unvaccinated children (31% versus 27%), although the CI does not exclude a meaningful increase in otitis media following vaccination (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.40; 884 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was insufficient information available to determine the effect of vaccines on school absenteeism due to very low-certainty evidence from one study. We identified no data on parental working time lost, hospitalisation, fever, or nausea.</P><P>We found limited evidence on secondary cases, requirement for treatment of lower respiratory tract disease, and drug prescriptions. One brand of monovalent pandemic vaccine was associated with a sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by the experience of an intense emotion (cataplexy) and a sleep disorder (narcolepsy) in children. Evidence of serious harms (such as febrile fits) was sparse.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-28 13:28:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><P>In children aged between 3 and 16 years, live influenza vaccines probably reduce influenza (moderate-certainty evidence) and may reduce ILI (low-certainty evidence) over a single influenza season. In this population inactivated vaccines also reduce influenza (high-certainty evidence) and may reduce ILI (low-certainty evidence). For both vaccine types, the absolute reduction in influenza and ILI varied considerably across the study populations, making it difficult to predict how these findings translate to different settings. We found very few randomised controlled trials in children under two years of age. Adverse event data were not well described in the available studies. Standardised approaches to the definition, ascertainment, and reporting of adverse events are needed. Identification of all global cases of potential harms is beyond the scope of this review.<BR/></P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-01-30 14:20:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-30 14:20:36 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-01-13 15:13:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Viral respiratory disease imposes a heavy burden on society. The majority of viral respiratory disease (influenza-like illness (ILI)) is caused by many different agents that are not clinically distinguishable from one another. A variable proportion of ILI (7% to 15% on average) is caused by influenza viruses and is known as influenza (<LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2005b</LINK>).</P><P>Influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by a virus of the <I>Orthomyxoviridae</I> family. Three serotypes are known (A, B, and C). Influenza causes an acute febrile illness with myalgia, headache, and cough. Although the median duration of the acute illness is three days, cough and malaise can persist for weeks. Complications of influenza include otitis media, pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, exacerbations of chronic respiratory disease, and bronchiolitis in children. Additionally, influenza can cause a range of non-respiratory complications including febrile convulsions, Reye's syndrome, and myocarditis (<LINK REF="REF-Treanor-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treanor 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiselka-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiselka 1994</LINK>). Efforts to prevent or minimise the impact of seasonal influenza in the second part of the 20th century centred on the use of vaccines. Due to the yearly changes in viral antigenic configuration and the lack of carry-over protection from year to year, a new vaccination campaign needs to be organised annually, with a huge scientific and logistic effort to ensure production and delivery of the vaccines.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-01-13 15:17:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There are four types of influenza vaccines currently available worldwide.</P><OL><LI>Whole-virion inactivated vaccines, which consist of complete viruses that have been 'killed' or inactivated, so that they are not infectious but retain their strain-specific antigenic properties.</LI><LI>Subunit inactivated vaccines, which are made of influenza surface antigens (H and N) only.</LI><LI>Split-virion inactivated vaccines in which the viral structure is broken up by a disrupting agent. These vaccines contain both surface and internal antigens.</LI><LI>Live attenuated, cold-adapted vaccines in which the live virus in the vaccine can only multiply in the cooler nasal passages and which are administered intranasally.</LI></OL><P>Periodic antigenic drifts and shifts pose problems for vaccine production and procurement. New vaccines closely matching the antigenic configuration of circulating strains must be produced and procured for the beginning of each new influenza 'season'. To achieve this, the World Health Organization (WHO) has established a worldwide surveillance system allowing early identification and isolation of viral strains circulating in the different parts of the world.</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-01-28 13:28:57 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><P>Vaccines work by simulating an infection and stimulating the body to produce antibodies against the threat and activate other defence mechanisms.</P><P>Efforts to prevent the spread of influenza have been shown to be unsuccessful due to the infectiousness of the condition, and public health interventions rely on vaccination to mitigate the worst consequences of the disease (death and hospitalisation).</P><P>Most high-income countries have vaccination programmes covering the elderly and so-called at-risk groups (e.g. people with pre-existing conditions likely to be made worse by influenza infection). However, for the influenza season 2004 to 2005, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that immunisation of healthy children between the ages of 6 and 23 months be instituted as a public health measure (<LINK REF="REF-AAPCID-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAPCID 2004</LINK>). This was later extended to cover children aged 6 to 59 months (i.e. 6 months to 5 years) (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2007</LINK>), and to healthy household contacts (including children) and caregivers of children aged under 5 years (<LINK REF="REF-ACIP-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACIP 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2007</LINK>). In February 2004, the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization followed the US authorities in recommending immunisation for the 6-to-23-months age group (<LINK REF="REF-Orr-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orr 2004</LINK>).</P><P>Finland is the only European country to have introduced routine vaccination of children aged six months to three years (from the beginning of the 2007 to 2008 influenza season). Other countries have also recommended childhood vaccination but have not included it in the routine childhood programmes. Slovenia and Latvia recommended vaccination of children aged six months to two years. Slovakia, Estonia, and Austria recommended it for children and adolescents aged six months to 18 years (<LINK REF="REF-Mereckiene-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mereckiene 2010</LINK>).</P><P>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has made recent changes to the registration of seasonal, pre-pandemic, and pandemic influenza vaccines (<LINK REF="REF-EMA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMA 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wijnans-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijnans 2016</LINK>).</P><P>The changes were introduced in 2014, triggered by the realisation that antibody responses are not sufficient predictors of field protection, as our reviews have consistently shown over the years. Most of the data for influenza vaccines included in our reviews are from registered vaccines, and yet the field protection afforded is modest or negligible. In addition, the methods of standardisation of antibody titres were lacking. The new rules for adults and elderly require demonstration of non-inferiority of antibody response (immunogenicity) by a candidate seasonal influenza vaccine compared to an established one. In addition, whenever a demonstration of clinical efficacy is necessary, the EMA encourages the minimisation of the use of placebo and encourages the use of active controls (such a non-influenza vaccine) with ILI (and relevant polymerase chain reaction results) as a primary endpoint. Clinical effectiveness should be tested by carrying out (preferably prospective) cohort studies or nested so-called test-negative case-control studies following the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control protocol (<LINK REF="REF-ECDC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECDC 2009</LINK>).</P><P>Harms surveillance is now required with a follow-up of at least six months&#8217; duration and in the general elderly population a database of at least 3000 people exposed to the vaccine.

Cochrane Reviews on the effects of the use of vaccines to prevent influenza in other age and risk groups show a striking difference between the vaccine efficacy (reduction in number of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza) and vaccine effectiveness against ILI (reduction in symptomatic cases), which can include illness caused by influenza viruses that is not laboratory confirmed or illness caused by other viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus. To allow a reasoned choice between alternative prevention strategies, accurate assessment of both the efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines is essential. The aim of this review was to identify, assess, and compare studies of vaccine efficacy and vaccine effectiveness in healthy children under 16 years of age, and to review the safety of vaccines in children up to 16 years of age.</P><P>Due to the unique production cycle of influenza vaccines (they are tested using surrogate outcomes - antibody stimulation - ahead of each influenza 'season'), past performance is probably the only reliable way to predict future performance. An accurate assessment of the effects (efficacy, effectiveness, and safety profile) of influenza vaccines is essential to allow rational choice between alternative strategies. This review, with its two companion reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Demicheli-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demicheli 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2012a</LINK>), are long-running reviews. They are among the most consistently accessed in the whole Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, confirming the importance of the topic and interest in it. Periodic updates, some stretching back almost two decades, have allowed us to include an increasing number of studies on the effects of influenza vaccines and monitor their impact on our reviews (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P><P>The reviews are not methodologically homogeneous, as their methods reflect the history and development of Cochrane Reviews. In particular the inclusion of observational studies which was initially favoured for the assessment of harms, has been a source of discussion. In this review randomised evidence represents 55% of studies considered. To enhance the relevance of the review to decision-makers, in the <LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2005b</LINK> update, we included comparative non-randomised studies reporting evidence of serious or rare harms (or both).</P><P>Historically observational studies have been of poor methodological quality, often reporting conflicting or paradoxical results, preventing the drawing of firm conclusions. However, inclusion of particular study types and increasing size of the data sets has not led to a change in the conclusion of the reviews, while leading to a greatly increased workload. This is the main reason why the authors, the review group and the Cochrane editors have decided to stabilise all three reviews, that is not to carry out routine updates of the observational data set and update the randomised data set if certain conditions are fulfilled in the future.</P><P>For the same reason we have retained the observational content of this review and its companions as historical evidence of the life cycle of the reviews.</P><P>We plan to update the randomised evidence in this review if any or all of the following conditions are fulfilled in the future.</P><UL><LI>a trial assessing the clinical effects of the evolution of current technologies becomes available;</LI><LI>a new type of vaccine is developed; or</LI><LI>a new credible causal paradigm for influenza is put forward.</LI></UL><P>For an overview of the three reviews, see the covering editorial at <A HREF="https://community.cochrane.org/news/why-have-three-long-running-cochrane-reviews-influenza-vaccines-been-stabilised">https://community.cochrane.org/news/why-have-three-long-running-cochrane-reviews-influenza-vaccines-been-stabilised</A>.</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-01-14 08:53:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To assess the effects (efficacy, effectiveness, and harm) of vaccines against influenza in healthy children.</P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2018-01-28 13:37:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-01-28 13:35:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2018-01-28 13:35:31 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><P>We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, comparative controlled trials (CCTs), and cohort and case-control studies.

For case-control studies we adopted the odds ratio (OR) with 95% CIs.</P><P>To enhance relevance to everyday practice, we also expressed the summary measure of the most reliable and significant comparisons (those from RCTs with influenza cases as an outcome by age group) as a risk difference (RD). This is a measure of absolute efficacy of the vaccines that incorporates significant information such as the incidence in the control arm and allows the calculation of its reciprocal, the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (in this case, vaccinate or NNV). Number needed to vaccinate expresses the number of children needed to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza. Evidence was insufficient to calculate meaningful RDs for rarer outcomes (such as hospitalisations or pneumonia), or the evidence was of poor quality (as in the case of cohorts).</P><P>The NNV expresses the number of children needed to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza. The NNV can be computed as 1/RD. Since meta-analysis estimates from RD are affected by spurious heterogeneity, we preferred to compute the NNV as CER*RR, where CER (control event rate) is the proportion of events in the control group. Given substantial variation in the control group rates across the studies for influenza and ILI outcomes, we have based NNVs on low, median, and high control group rates.

Australia consequently suspended its use. These episodes highlight the insufficient regulatory attention to potential harms from influenza vaccines in children, as the registration trials for the CSL vaccine had been carried out on 162 children aged up to three years (<LINK REF="REF-Collignon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collignon 2010</LINK>).</P><P>This degree of scrutiny to identify all global cases of missed potential harms is beyond the resources of this review.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></INTERVENTION_EFFECTS></RESULTS><DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2018-01-29 07:03:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-01-28 13:52:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><P>Our review shows that LAIVs have good relative efficacy (up to 80%), but lower relative effectiveness (around 33%) in children aged under 16 years and older than two years. Live attenuated influenza vaccines may be effective in controlling a school outbreak, although this observation is based on an old, poorly reported Russian study (<LINK REF="STD-ab-Slepushkin-1974" TYPE="STUDY">ab Slepushkin 1974</LINK>).</P><P>Inactivated vaccines have a lower relative efficacy (59%) than live attenuated vaccines. In children aged two years or younger, there is very limited evidence to determine their effects compared with placebo. This observation is based on a single small study (<LINK REF="STD-aa-Hoberman-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">aa Hoberman 2003a</LINK>). Under the age of six, TIV does not provide significant protection against influenza (has no significant efficacy). Below two years of age there is no evidence of effect of either LAIV or TIV.</P><P>Inactivated vaccines may reduce ILI by around 36% for children aged older than two years, but we could find no evidence for children aged two years or younger. Our conclusions on inactivated vaccines are based on almost 20,000 children from randomised studies.</P><P>Evidence from cohort studies (11,000 observations) yields higher estimates, suggesting that inactivated vaccines have higher (up to 64%) efficacy and effectiveness (56%) in the over-six-years age group; in children younger than two years of age, their efficacy is no better than that of a control arm, and there is evidence from a single study of 53% effectiveness. However, readers should bear in mind the very low quality of the cohort data sets.</P><P>The differences between efficacy and effectiveness of the vaccines are not surprising, as influenza vaccines are specifically targeted at influenza viruses and are not meant to prevent other causes of ILI.</P><P>We found little evidence for other outcomes. A trial at high risk of bias shows a significant effect of trivalent, cold-adapted influenza vaccine against outpatients' attendance for pneumonia and influenza and parents' working days lost (<LINK REF="STD-aa-Vesikari-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">aa Vesikari 2006a</LINK>). Evidence for other outcomes (secondary cases, lower respiratory tract disease, drug prescriptions, acute otitis media and other consequences and socioeconomic impact) suggests no difference from placebo or standard care. However, these conclusions are based on single studies lacking statistical power, except for acute otitis media. Virosomal vaccines reduce antibiotic consumption and school and work absenteeism, but these observations are based on a single cohort study at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-ca-Salleras-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ca Salleras 2006</LINK>).</P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-01-16 13:37:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The studies included in our review assess the effects of vaccines over several decades. Our review has several potential limitations. We found insufficient data to allow us to draw firm conclusions on vaccination routes (intramuscular or intranasal) or one- or two-dose schedules in inactivated vaccines. The evidence base for children younger than two years remains limited. We were unable to obtain dichotomous data from 1 study in 3200 children mainly younger than 2 years (mean age 20 months). <LINK REF="STD-aa-Bracco-Neto-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">aa Bracco Neto 2009a</LINK> reports similar vaccine efficacy to our summary estimate. Most eligible studies report influenza and ILI outcomes, but the measurement and reporting of data for other key outcomes, notably otitis media, hospitalisation, and adverse effects, remain inconsistent or incomplete.</P><P>The small number of included studies in each comparison prevents a sufficiently powerful test to assess empirical evidence of publication bias. The only method to mitigate publication bias is to include published and (if retrievable) unpublished literature, regardless of language or country.</P><P>Decision-makers looking to inform local or national policies with evidence summarised in this review should be aware of the wide variation in the NNVs we have calculated from the same risk ratios. Even where our results have shown consistent protective effects of vaccination, wide variation in control group risks point to additional sources of variation between settings that could explain why the absolute effects differ. This could be due to differences in between-study follow-up periods (the longer the follow-up period, the more the potential for identification of cases with vaccine effectiveness dilution as viral circulation declines), differences in ILI case definitions (our sensitivity analysis failed to show significant differences in case definition specificity), differences in performance of different live vaccines (we have no reason to believe this is so), differences in case-finding and in study quality, and differences in viral circulation levels. The included studies provided insufficient data to stratify for viral circulation or duration of follow-up. Irrespective of the variation in absolute effects, our estimates point to high vaccine efficacy but lower effectiveness.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-01-29 07:03:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><P>We have made different downgrading decisions for influenza and ILI outcomes across the two vaccine types (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). We downgraded the evidence for live attenuated vaccine to moderate quality for influenza due to inconsistency and for ILI to low quality due to risk of bias and inconsistency. For ILI, the direction of effect was discordant across the studies. For influenza, we made the decision to downgrade for inconsistency despite the similar direction of effect across the studies. High between-study variation of effect could not be explained by age or dose (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). The absence of an obvious relationship between control group risk and relative effect across the studies makes the variation in the absolute reduction a source of uncertainty. We downgraded the results for both absence from school and parental leave due to risk of bias. We further downgraded absence from school due to imprecision, and the discordant nature of the results for parental leave prompted us to downgrade further due to inconsistency. No data were available for hospitalisation or nausea. Variability in the reporting of fever prevented us from combining data. When taken together with risk of bias, we arrived at a rating of very low quality. The evidence for inactivated vaccines was high and moderate for influenza and ILI, respectively. The stability of the risk ratio for influenza gave us more confidence in its application to the variable control group risk across the studies. We considered bias a limitation only for ILI. Data for other outcomes were not available.</P><P>The general methodological quality of the included studies was poor. We found that description of vaccine content was variable, and no preservatives or excipients were reported. We could find no comment on the degree of matching between virus strains used in the studies, circulating strains, and composition of yearly World Health Organization (WHO) recommended vaccines. In healthy adults, antigenic composition is an important predictor of vaccine efficacy, as our Cochrane Review of influenza vaccines has shown (<LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2010</LINK>). The relative paucity of head-to-head comparisons of vaccines hinders meaningful comments on their relative performance and points to an absolute requirement for more direct-comparison trials. Our 2005 decision to include non-randomised evidence in the evaluation of efficacy/effectiveness resulted in the inclusion of a large number of studies of dubious quality. This is best observed in cohort studies. The majority of these are at high risk of bias, as are case-control studies. We found several case-control studies of similar design that claimed to be testing the effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccines in a "real world setting" (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-ba-Cochran-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">ba Cochran 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ba-Eisenberg-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">ba Eisenberg 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ba-Kelly-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ba Kelly 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ba-Kissling-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ba Kissling 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ba-Mahmud-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ba Mahmud 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ba-Staat-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">ba Staat 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ba-Valenciano-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ba Valenciano 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ba-Van-Buynder-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ba Van Buynder 2010</LINK>). The case test-negative design is described in detail elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Foppa-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foppa 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Valenciano-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valenciano 2012</LINK>). Cases and controls were both selected on the basis of the presence of ILI symptoms. The discriminating variable between cases and controls was the positivity (for influenza) of a laboratory-tested throat specimen. Consequently, this design does not test the effect of vaccine exposure on the onset of ILI. It tests the effect of the vaccines on microbiological specimens, which is of dubious public health significance.</P><P>The data included in a case test-negative design are sometimes harvested from an ongoing networked surveillance cohort. In this case, the case test-negative design is described as &#8220;nested&#8221; within the cohort. The source cohort can include community and hospitalised cases and controls, allowing flexibility (<LINK REF="REF-Kissling-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kissling 2017</LINK>). In Europe the surveillance programme has a formal structure and is known as Influenza - Monitoring Vaccine Effectiveness (I-MOVE). I-MOVE is partly funded and co-ordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</P><P>Briefly, the study design that is similar to a case-control design consists of selecting influenza cases (e.g. cases of ILI who have tested positive for influenza) and controls (cases of ILI who have tested negative) and calculating the relevant odds ratio (OR). Cases and controls are subsequently stratified by vaccination status. An estimate of vaccines' effectiveness (VE) is derived from the OR of influenza in vaccinated/unvaccinated participants using the standard formula VE = 1 - OR%. The practice of using the OR estimate as an approximation of the risk ratio (RR) was first used in a 1980 study on pneumococcal vaccine (<LINK REF="REF-Broome-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broome 1980</LINK>).</P><P>The design does not test field effectiveness, but the capacity of the vaccines to generate a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result (what we would call laboratory efficacy). Both cases and controls are symptomatic, so any prevention is solely focused on the negativity of laboratory tests. In addition, no useful public health absolute measures of effect can be derived (such as absolute risk reduction and its reciprocal NNV) by such designs, as the background rates of infection and viral circulation are not part of the calculation of the estimates of effect. The mathematical method first used by <LINK REF="REF-Broome-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broome 1980</LINK> is correct if three key assumptions are met:</P><UL><LI>the risk of non-influenza ILI is the same in vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals (a factor called &#8220;k&#8221; by <LINK REF="REF-Broome-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broome 1980</LINK>);</LI><LI>the attack rate in the vaccinated population is low;</LI><LI>the circulating serotypes are similar to those in the selected population within the case-control test-negative design.</LI></UL><P>All assumptions are unlikely to be fulfilled at the same time, especially in multicentre/multi country surveillance cohorts with a non-random sampling frame. For example, Cowling and colleagues reported an increased risk of non-influenza respiratory virus infections associated with receipt of inactivated influenza vaccine. In addition, the OR will give falsely high VE if the attack rate in the vaccinated population is high (<LINK REF="REF-Cowling-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cowling 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orenstein-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orenstein 1985</LINK>). Apart from these fundamental design problems, case test-negative studies are also affected by poor reporting. (See also <LINK REF="REF-Perencevich-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perencevich 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perencevich-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perencevich 2013b</LINK>).</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-01-29 06:46:45 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><P>We found a large data set showing variable quality evidence of vaccines' efficacy in children aged over three years.</P><P>As we had already observed in our Cochrane Review of influenza vaccines in healthy adults (<LINK REF="REF-Demicheli-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demicheli 2014</LINK>), there is marked difference between the efficacy and effectiveness of the vaccines due to the large proportion of ILI ('the flu') caused by agents other than influenza viruses. This is an important point in the decision to vaccinate whole populations. In addition, we found limited evidence that vaccines reduce the burden of school absences. Decision-makers' attention to the vaccination of very young children is not supported by the evidence summarised in our review. Although there is a growing body of evidence showing the impact of influenza on hospitalisations and deaths of children, at present we could find no convincing evidence that vaccines can reduce mortality, hospital admissions, serious complications, or community transmission of influenza.</P><P>We were surprised to find only one safety study of inactivated vaccine in children under 2 years, carried out nearly 30 years ago in 35 children (<LINK REF="STD-ab-Wright-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">ab Wright 1976a</LINK>). The lack of safety data for inactive vaccines in younger children is particularly surprising given that the inactive vaccine is now recommended for healthy children six months and older in the USA and Canada (<LINK REF="REF-AAPCID-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAPCID 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harper-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harper 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orr-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orr 2004</LINK>). In contrast, while the live vaccine is only licenced for children aged 5 and older in the USA, we found 10 studies testing its safety in younger children. However, the manufacturers' refusal to release all safety outcome data from trials carried out in young children, together with obvious reporting bias and inconsistencies in the primary studies, does not bode well for a fair assessment of the safety of live attenuated vaccines.</P><P>We found a notable range and diversity of safety outcomes and definitions (or lack thereof) in the included studies, leading to a loss of data. This clearly demonstrates the difficulty of attempting to meta-analyse safety data for a review when the data are not presented in a standardised format. The Brighton Collaboration, set up to facilitate the development, evaluation, and dissemination of high-quality information about the safety of human vaccines, has produced guidelines on the recording and presentation of temperature and induration. The results of this search and review clearly show the need for the existence of such guidelines and their adoption by researchers worldwide.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-01-29 06:48:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><P>The effects of influenza vaccination in those aged 16 or younger have recently been the topic of a number of other reviews.

Considering only studies performed on paediatric populations, the placebo-controlled RCTs are the same as those included in <LINK REF="REF-Rhorer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rhorer 2009</LINK>. A pooled meta-analysis was carried out on the same data sets (apart from one study: <LINK REF="STD-aa-Bracco-Neto-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">aa Bracco Neto 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-aa-Bracco-Neto-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">aa Bracco Neto 2009b</LINK>). Evidence from case-control studies is also discussed (against seasonal or H1N1 pandemic influenza), even if it is not included in the analysis. Relative efficacy estimates of LAIV against PCR- or culture-confirmed influenza in children aged six months to seven years was around 80%.</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Carter-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 2011</LINK> reports results of studies on LAIV efficacy, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity in children and adult populations. Evidence of the vaccines&#8217; efficacy in children (i.e. against influenza, as opposed to ILI) is the same as that included in <LINK REF="REF-Rhorer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rhorer 2009</LINK> (with the exception of <LINK REF="REF-Forrest-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forrest 2008</LINK>). A meta-analysis was not performed; only a descriptive review is presented. Estimates of LAIV efficacy in comparison with placebo or TIV are the same as that of the above mentioned studies. In contrast to the other reviews that included the study by <LINK REF="REF-Lum-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lum 2010</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Osterholm-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osterholm 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rhorer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rhorer 2009</LINK>), <LINK REF="REF-Carter-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carter 2011</LINK> assessed the effect of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine co-administration, concluding that this did not affect LAIV efficacy. The review also considers evidence on local and systemic reactions observed a few days after LAIV immunisation: runny nose, headache, and tiredness are likely to occur more frequently among LAIV than among placebo recipients, especially after the first dose. Live attenuated influenza vaccine is more reactogenic than TIV, and its administration is associated with an increased risk of wheezing within 42 days after vaccination in children younger than five years of age in comparison with TIV.</P><P>2) A second group of systematic reviews, <LINK REF="REF-Manzoli-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manzoli 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Negri-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Negri 2005</LINK>, present several methodological analogies with our 2005 Cochrane Review; the exceptions are that only RCTs or CCTs are included; safety issues of the vaccines are not considered; and some included studies also had a vaccine control arm. The most recent review confirms that there are no significant differences between TIV and LAIV effects on the three assessed outcomes (influenza, ILI, and otitis media). A sensitivity analysis was performed excluding Russian studies (classified at a lower level of methodological quality) from a pooled analysis, which resulted in a higher estimate of effect against clinical disease (pooled estimates for LAIV and TIV). <LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-Pendas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo Pendas 2007</LINK> includes studies (seven RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of both LAIV and TIV in preventing ILI, confirmed influenza, otitis media, and other respiratory illnesses.</P><P>3) Only one review presented the effect of vaccination on the contacts of children (<LINK REF="REF-Jordan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 2006</LINK>). Results from this industry-funded review including eight RCTs, three community studies, and three economic evaluations are discussed but a meta-analysis is not performed. The authors conclude that child vaccination could produce significant health benefits and be cost-saving to the community as a whole.</P><P>4) Two other reviews evaluated the immunogenicity of monovalent H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines (in both adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted formulations) (<LINK REF="REF-Manzoli-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manzoli 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yin 2011</LINK>). All tested split/subunit vaccines induced a satisfactory immunogenicity (over 70%) after only one dose in adolescents, while only non-adjuvanted vaccines at high doses and oil-in-water adjuvanted vaccines showed acceptable results for children. Even if the rate of serious adverse events was low for all 2009 H1N1 vaccines (0.013% overall), the review does not allow a firm conclusion to be drawn for vaccine safety at the population level. Mild to moderate adverse reactions were more frequent for oil-in-water adjuvanted vaccines. <LINK REF="REF-Wijnans-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijnans 2011</LINK> reviews several studies (clinical trials, case reports, results of surveillance) reporting safety data of monovalent H1N1 pandemic vaccine.</P><P>The key question of the relationship between a surrogate outcome (antibody production) and field outcomes (clinical illness) is left unaddressed, calling into question the rationale for applying results from the reviews in deciding vaccination policies.</P><P>5) One other review is based on evidence available in the Cochrane Library only (11 Cochrane Reviews; one other review/meta-analysis; 14 RCTs; 3 CCTs) (<LINK REF="REF-Michiels-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michiels 2011</LINK>). The review provides a critical approach to the opportunity to administer inactivated influenza vaccine to children, adults, and the elderly, but also to individuals affected by comorbidity conditions (diabetes, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, kidney or liver disease, and immune suppression). Inactivated influenza vaccines appear to be effective in healthy adults and children over six years but not in children younger than two years and institutionalised elderly. Inconsistent results are found in studies in children younger than six years, individuals with chronic obstructive airways disease, institutionalised elderly, elderly with comorbidity, and healthcare workers in elderly homes. Vaccination of children might be protective in non-recipients of all ages living in the same community. The vaccination of pregnant women might be beneficial for their newborns.</P><P>Despite the great variations in methods, the reviews all reached similar conclusions to those of our 2005 Cochrane Review: TIV has few effects, and there is no evidence that it affects deaths, complications, or transmission of influenza. Live attenuated influenza vaccine performed a little better at the expense of safety.</P><P>Most reviews present estimates of vaccine efficacy derived from studies in which principal outcome measures are 'confirmed' cases of influenza, that is with laboratory confirmation of infection. The reviews express results in relative terms (RR) (i.e. regardless of the level of influenza viruses circulating in the study population). The relative efficacy measure represents the capacity of the vaccine to prevent cases specifically due to virus strains contained in the vaccine compared to the control. When used in vaccination campaigns, the same vaccines are unlikely to prevent the same proportion of cases simply because most ILI cases are attributable to other viruses. To assess the real benefit produced by a campaign, it would be preferable to also look at the impact of the vaccines on ILI and to present results using absolute measure such as RDs and their reciprocal, the NNV. These take into account the level of influenza viral circulation in the population.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-25 06:28:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-01-25 06:28:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>In children under the age of 16 years, live influenza vaccines probably reduce influenza (moderate-certainty evidence) and may reduce influenza-like illness (ILI) (low-certainty evidence) over a single influenza season. In this population, inactivated vaccines also reduce influenza (high-certainty evidence) and may reduce ILI (low-certainty evidence). For both vaccine types, the size of effect when expressed in absolute terms varied considerably across the study populations. In addition to the variable certainty of the evidence, decision-makers looking to inform local or national policies with evidence summarised in this review should be aware of the wide variation in absolute effects for protection against influenza and ILl. We did not find evidence that either vaccine reduces otitis media.</P><P>To date no studies have adequately measured or reported hospitalisation. Few randomised studies have measured school absenteeism and parental leave following vaccination, and effects on these outcomes are uncertain. We found few studies assessing vaccination during seasonal influenza on children younger than two years of age. Findings from single studies are consistent with estimates of vaccine efficacy from our own analyses, but do not currently provide clear evidence of equivalent effects. Adverse event data and effects on nausea are not well described in the available studies. Standardised approaches to the definition, ascertainment, and reporting of adverse events are needed. We found only one old study of the harms of inactivated vaccine in children younger than two years, despite current recommendations to vaccinate healthy children from six months of age. Identification of all global cases of potential harms is beyond the scope of this review.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-01-16 17:10:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>When a new vaccination or preventive technology becomes available, an adequately powered, publicly funded, high-quality placebo-controlled trial run over several seasons should be undertaken. New insights into the role of viruses and other agents in the genesis of influenza and ILI are also needed. This is especially important for the investigation of the non-influenza causes of ILI, which could explain the findings of the study by <LINK REF="REF-Cowling-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cowling 2012</LINK>.</P><P>Further data on the safety of vaccines in children should also be collected or made available, particularly on inactivated vaccines in younger children. There is an immediate need to standardise safety outcome data according to Brighton Collaboration guidelines. Honest and full disclosure of all safety data to researchers is also a priority.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-01-28 14:49:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley"><P>The 2011 update was funded by Regione Piemonte, Italy and the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cochrane Review Incentive Scheme.

Analysed data come from the period 1 November to 31 December 2003, when influenza A circulated in a prevalent fashion according to hospital isolates. Respiratory syncytial virus started circulating at the end of December, so the authors attempted to restrict analysis to the period of maximum influenza circulation.

Our VE estimates mostly reflect the protection conferred to young healthy adults; the sample included few elderly persons or those with underlying conditions.

More worrying is the fact that the text clearly states that the authors identified the cases by looking at outcomes AND exposure, almost certainly introducing bias in the evaluation and not carrying out blinded assessment of exposure.

Population was selected, and there are very few data to compare cases and controls. 1-liner by-the- by effectiveness assessment of vaccine. Multivariate modelling use is unclear.

Formally this is a very well-reported study following CONSORT guidelines. There are however numerous discrepancies in the text. Vaccine was not available until the end of November in year 2, and it is unclear what effect this had (immunisation was completed on 21 December, in the case of Israel this was after the beginning of viral circulation). In addition, the centres went from 70 in year 1 to 62 in year 2 for unexplained reasons. A major unexplained problem is seen in Table 7 (harm events reporting). 2 figures are shown for the 6 columns (vaccine and placebo by dose by year of the trial) representing "the number of subjects with known values" and then presumably the randomised denominator (which does not fit with either ITT or PP numbers). The figures show runny nose as significantly higher in dose 1 year 1 recipients, which could explain the high attrition between dose 1 year 1 and single dose year 2 (from 1021 to 631).</P></CHAR_NOTES></INCLUDED_CHAR><INCLUDED_CHAR MODIFIED="2018-01-20 14:55:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" ORDER="386" STUDY_ID="STD-aa-Vesikari-2006b"><CHAR_METHODS MODIFIED="2018-01-20 14:54:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>2001 to 2002 season data from Vesikari 2006</P></CHAR_METHODS><CHAR_PARTICIPANTS/><CHAR_INTERVENTIONS/><CHAR_OUTCOMES/><CHAR_USER_DEF_1 MODIFIED="2012-02-16 23:30:57 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Industry</P></CHAR_USER_DEF_1><CHAR_NOTES MODIFIED="2018-01-20 14:55:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This second year could be biased due to attrition.</P></CHAR_NOTES></INCLUDED_CHAR><INCLUDED_CHAR MODIFIED="2018-01-20 15:08:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" ORDER="387" STUDY_ID="STD-ca-Wiggs_x002d_Stayner-2006"><CHAR_METHODS MODIFIED="2018-01-20 14:59:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Government-funded, nurse-led prospective cohort study carried out in the US state of Indiana.

Additionally, no differences in solicited reactogenicity events or other AEs were seen after either saline or excipient placebo.

Vaccinated participants contributed with exposure time in the UV cohort from 1 October to the date of vaccination. The incidence rates in the vaccinated and UV cohorts, respectively, were calculated as the number of persons diagnosed with an incident registration for narcolepsy in the health databases, divided by the person years at risk. The relative risk, vaccinated versus UV cohorts, was calculated as the corresponding ratio of incidence rates. Exact CIs for relative risk were calculated through exact CIs for binomial proportions.<BR/>Since there is no nationwide vaccination register, it was not possible to calculate the risk time directly for the total vaccinated and non&#8208;vaccinated cohorts in all of Sweden. However, risk time was extrapolated from the registry-based study using data from 4 counties/regions of Sweden.<BR/>It is not clear how the 5 cases with symptom onset and vaccination within the same month have been considered. They had initially been classified as not vaccinated (see page 5, lines 4 to 5 from the top, i.e. 9 vaccinated cases vs 7 + 5 non-vaccinated cases) and simply excluded from the main analysis (69 vaccinated cases vs 7 non-vaccinated cases), then the authors consider, erroneously, these 5 as part of the 7 unexposed in the &#8220;sensitivity analysis&#8221; (see page 6, third paragraph from the top and page 7, fourth paragraph from the bottom). It would be useful to complete the sensitivity analysis considering the 5 with uncertain vaccine exposure among vaccinated first and among not vaccinated.<BR/><BR/>The authors conclude that &#8220;These new results provide strengthened evidence that vaccination with Pandemrix during the pandemic period was associated with an increase in the risk for narcolepsy with cataplexy in children/adolescents 19 years and younger.

MODIFIED="2012-06-21 07:42:05 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The Cochrane article makes the claim that "<I>Inactivated vaccines have a lower efficacy (65%) than live attenuated vaccines and in children aged two or less, they appear to have similar effects to placebo, although this observation is based on a single small study (Hoberman 2003a).</I>"<BR/>This conclusion regarding children under 2 years old seems to be erroneous, as the single study on which the result is based actually showed effectiveness in this age range against influenza infection in epidemic seasons. The reviewers may have been confused, as the paper by Hoberman et al does have lines like "<I>Given that our study did not find a significant difference between vaccine and placebo</I>," but this is regarding the primary objective of the study, which is (as is suggested by the study's title) to investigate the effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccine in preventing Acute Otitis Media in young children. Note that while they may not have demonstrated a reduction in AOM, this does not mean that the vaccine was ineffective in preventing influenza infection.<BR/>The first cohort was during an epidemic season, and showed, "<I>efficacy rates against influenza in children aged 6 to 12 months, 13 to 18 months, and 19 to 24 months were 63%, 66%, and 69%, respectively.</I>" The second season failed to show an effect, but there were only 13 cases on influenza recorded for the second cohort, and influenza was infrequent, making it hard to come to any conclusion regarding effectiveness during that season.<BR/>I hope that this may prompt a revision of the claim that the vaccine was ineffective in the children under 2 years old, as the evidence in fact showed a rather substantial protective effect during the cohort exposed to epidemic influenza, and the seroprotection levels recorded in the study suggest that it should have performed similarly in the second cohort, had their been sufficient circulating influenza to detect a difference.<BR/>I agree with the conflict of interest statement below:<BR/>I certify that I have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with a financial interest in the subject matter of my feedback.</P></FEEDBACK_SUMMARY><FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2012-06-20 20:25:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Thank you. We have re-examined the evidence commented on by the reader. As the reader remarks, the primary objective of the trial by Hoberman et al was to assess the effects of TIV on otitis media (OM) in under two year olds. The secondary objectives "<I>were to evaluate the vaccine's safety, immunogenicity and efficacy against culture-proven influenza.....as well as...on children's utilisation of selected health care and related resources.</I>" (pdf page 2, just before "Methods"). See also our descriptive table of included studies.<BR/><BR/>Our comparison 2.1.1 shows the study's two influenza "seasons" (labelled as a and b). Overall the vaccine appears to have no effect. An equal lack of efficacy is seen against OM and resource utilisation.<BR/><BR/>Wide yearly differences in virus circulation as remarked on by the reader and observed by Hoberman and colleagues are precisely the reason why influenza vaccines studies should be carried out over several seasons and reviews of several studies are the most meaningful public health way to estimate the effects of influenza vaccines.<BR/><BR/>Hoberman A, Greenberg DP, Paradise JL, Rockette HE, Lave JR, Kearney DH, Colborn DK, Kurs-Lasky M, Haralam MA, Byers CJ, Zoffel LM, Fabian IA, Bernard BS, Kerr JD.
