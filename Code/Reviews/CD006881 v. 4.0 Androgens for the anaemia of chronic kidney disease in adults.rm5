<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-09-12 22:03:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Anaemia, which occurs when red blood cell and haemoglobin levels fall below normal, is a common problem among adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Anaemia can cause breathlessness, dizziness and chest pain (angina); reduce ability to think clearly; limits ability to exercise; and contributes to sexual problems, poor appetite and reduced quality of life. Anaemia may also cause longer hospital stays, and sometimes death.</P>
<P>There are several approaches to correct anaemia in people with CKD, including drugs to stimulate red blood cell production, dialysis to remove waste and excess water from the blood, blood transfusions, dietary management, and supplementary iron and folate agents.</P>
<P>Other drugs, such as androgens - which are male steroid hormones - may be given in some settings to help reduce undesirable effects of treatments. Another possible benefit of androgen therapy for people with CKD, especially in regions with limited health resources, is that these drugs have lower costs than some other treatments.</P>
<P>We assessed eight small studies that presented data from 181 adults with CKD-related anaemia that investigated use of androgen therapy. Limitations and flaws in the evidence lead to our conclusion that androgen therapy for adults with CKD-related anaemia was not associated with substantial benefits.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-12 22:09:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We included eight studies that reported data from 181 participants. Study quality was assessed as moderate in six studies, one was low quality, and one was high quality. The small number of included studies, and low participant numbers adversely influenced evidence quality overall.</P>
<P>We found limited evidence (1 study, 24 participants) to indicate that oxymetholone can increase haemoglobin (Hb) (MD 1.90 g/dL, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.14), haematocrit (HCT) (MD 27.10%, 95% CI 26.49 to 27.71), change in albumin (MD 4.91 g/L, 95% CI 3.69 to 6.13), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (MD 54.50 U/L, 95% CI 43.94 to 65.06), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (MD 47.33 U/L, 95% CI 37.69 to 56.97); and decrease high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (MD -15.66 mg/dL, 95% CI -24.84 to -6.48). We also found that compared with erythropoietin alone, nandrolone decanoate plus erythropoietin may increase HCT (3 studies, 73 participants: MD 2.54%, 95% Cl 0.96 to 4.12). Compared with erythropoietin (1 study, 27 participants), limited evidence was found to suggest that nandrolone decanoate can increase plasma total protein (MD 0.40 g/L, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.67), albumin (MD 0.20 g/L, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.39), and transferrin (MD 45.00 mg/dL, 95% CI 12.61 to 77.39) levels. Compared with no therapy (remnant kidney), evidence was found to suggest that nandrolone decanoate can increase Hb (2 studies, 33 participants: MD 1.04 g/dL, 95% Cl 0.66 to 1.41) and HCT (1 study, 24 participants: MD 3.70%, 95% Cl 0.68 to 6.72). Compared with no therapy (anephric), evidence was found (1 study, 5 participants) to suggest that nandrolone decanoate can increase Hb (MD 1.30 g/dL, 95% Cl 0.57 to 2.03), but nandrolone decanoate did not increase HCT (MD 2.00%, 95% Cl -0.85 to 4.85).</P>
<P>However, oxymetholone was not found to reduce blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (SCr), cholesterol, or triglycerides; or increase plasma total protein, prealbumin, or transferrin. No evidence was found to indicate that nandrolone decanoate increased prealbumin or decreased BUN, SCr, AST, ALT, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL or low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Adverse events associated with androgen therapy were reported infrequently.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-09-12 22:03:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-09-12 22:03:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health challenge. In the USA, 20 million adults have CKD, and another 20 million are at risk of developing the disease (<LINK REF="REF-NKF-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NKF 2007</LINK>). Data from NHANES III (1988 to 1994) and USRDS (1998) indicated that prevalence of CKD ranged from 64.3% for stage 1 to 0.2% for stage 5 (<LINK REF="REF-NKF-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NKF 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Anaemia occurs when levels of red blood cells and haemoglobin are reduced. Anaemia is a common complication among people with CKD, and contributes to the burden of disease, causing breathlessness, dizziness, angina, decreased exercise capacity, cognitive and dysfunctions, poor appetite, reduced quality of life, longer hospital stays, and death. Given that numbers of people with CKD are increasing, the public health impact of CKD-associated anaemia is substantial. Anaemia prevalence increases as kidney function decreases. <LINK REF="REF-McClellan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McClellan 2004</LINK> reported that anaemia was present in 47.7% of predialysis patients, and <LINK REF="REF-Hsu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsu 2002</LINK> estimated that the overall burden of CKD-associated anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) &#8804; 11 g/dL) was 610,000 women and 230,000 men in the US population. In 2000, five European countries participating in the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS, <LINK REF="REF-Combe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Combe 2001</LINK>) reported that 49% of haemodialysis patients had Hb concentrations below the level recommended by the European Best Practice Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2006</LINK>). Patients with Hb &lt; 10 g/dL were 29% more likely to be hospitalised than those with Hb levels between 11 and 12 g/dL. The risk of hospitalisation was 4% lower for every 1 g/dL increase in Hb concentration, and mortality risk in these patients was 5% lower for each 1 g/dL increase (<LINK REF="REF-Locatelli-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Locatelli 2004b</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-10-09 14:39:56 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several approaches are commonly applied to correct anaemia in adults with CKD, including erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), dialysis, blood transfusions, nutritional management, iron and folate supplements. ESAs augment erythropoiesis through direct or indirect actions on the erythropoietin receptor, and dialysis can improve anaemia by eliminating some toxins. In the past, iron and folate supplements were mainstay treatments. Although a direct and effective method of treating CKD-related anaemia, blood transfusion carries risk of infection and inducing histocompatibility leukocyte antigens, which may jeopardise future kidney transplant in eligible patients (<LINK REF="REF-Eschbach-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eschbach 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The human erythropoietin (EPO) gene was characterised in 1983 (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1985</LINK>), and recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) treatment efficacy was first demonstrated in dialysis patients in 1986 (<LINK REF="REF-Winearls-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winearls 1986</LINK>). The advent of rHuEPO revolutionised management for people with CKD-associated anaemia and contributed to reducing risks associated with blood transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Cody-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cody 2005</LINK>), sensitisation, and preventing iron overload, and enhancing exercise tolerance, cognitive capacity, sexual function, and quality of life. However, three key issues have been associated with rHuEPO use:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Cost: Medicare spending on EPO reached US$1.8 billion in 2004, an increase of 17% from 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2006</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Risk of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA): a severe, non-regenerative form of anaemia, with selective erythroid aplasia of the bone marrow.</LI>
<LI>Predictable side effects: hypertension, clotting of arteriovenous fistulas, and seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Navarro-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro 2003</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Furthermore, rHuEPO may increase cancer mortality risk by stimulating tumour growth (<LINK REF="REF-Brian-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brian 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henke 2003</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-10-09 16:50:07 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Androgens are a class of male steroid hormones that play a major role in the development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characters, and which also affect nitrogen metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-BOE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">BOE 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Omwancha-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omwancha 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pielecka-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pielecka 2006</LINK>). Androgens mechanism of action is thought to be due to an increase in EPO synthesis and secretion (<LINK REF="REF-Shahani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shahani 2009</LINK>). A positive correlation has been shown between increased Hb and HCT in people treated with androgens (<LINK REF="REF-Navarro-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Navarro-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Navarro-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Navarro 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yared-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yared 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adjuvant therapy is often required to help optimise therapeutic response among people with CKD-associated anaemia who are either unresponsive to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) or require large doses of ESAs (<LINK REF="REF-Navarro-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro 2001a</LINK>). In some settings, androgens may be administered as adjuvant therapies for people with CKD-related anaemia. Androgens have been reported to increase erythropoiesis, raise plasma EPO concentration in dialysed patients with CKD-anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Teruel-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teruel 1996a</LINK>), and elevate Hb concentration in people with CKD (<LINK REF="REF-Teruel-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teruel 1996b</LINK>). Androgens have also achieved satisfactory results for treating PRCA (<LINK REF="REF-Sanchez-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez 2006</LINK>). Economic cost benefits have been identified for androgen therapy in resource-limited settings (<LINK REF="REF-Locatelli-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Locatelli 2004a</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-10-09 16:52:16 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Controversy exists about the use of androgens to treat anaemia in people with CKD. The KDOQI guidelines strongly recommend against androgens as adjuvant therapy to ESA treatment in people with CKD-related anaemia. The rationale is that androgens have been associated with adverse effects including acne, virilisation, priapism, hyperglycaemia, liver dysfunction, injection site pain, risk of peliosis hepatis, hepatocellular carcinoma, risk of prostate cancer, and cancer risk in women. Three small, short-term RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Berns-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Berns 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaughan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gaughan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sheashaa-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Sheashaa 2005a</LINK>) explored the possible role of adjuvant androgen therapy with ESA for people undergoing haemodialysis. Recommended Hb levels were not achieved; however, these studies did not enrol participants with ESA hyporesponsiveness (<LINK REF="REF-NKF-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NKF 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>Based on the eight small included studies, scant evidence was identified in relation to the efficacy or safety of androgens for adults with CKD-related anaemia. Evidence was flawed by sparseness, methodological and reporting quality in most studies. More adequately powered and robust study designs would help to clearly determine the role of androgens for adults with CKD-related anaemia compared with other therapies. There was a marked absence of reporting of mortality and quality of life, and although there was some reporting of adverse effects, the small study cohorts may have meant that studies were underpowered to capture rates accurately. Our findings of adverse events reporting did not equate with those cited in the KDOQI guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NKF-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NKF 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Adamu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamu 2012</LINK> conducted a review that compared androgen therapy and EPO use for the treatment of people with CKD-related anaemia while focusing on implications for developing countries. Similar methodological approaches were applied in both reviews, and both looked at nandrolone decanoate versus rHuEPO and measures of anaemia correction such as haemoglobin, total protein and liver function.</P>
<P>There were differences in study inclusion criteria: we excluded reviews fewer than six months duration, which were eligible for inclusion by <LINK REF="REF-Adamu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamu 2012</LINK>; we included eight studies (181 participants) and <LINK REF="REF-Adamu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamu 2012</LINK> included four studies (114 participants). Only one study was common to both reviews (<LINK REF="STD-Navarro-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Navarro 2002</LINK>). Interventions investigated also differed: we investigated androgens versus EPO; androgens versus no drug or placebo alone; androgens plus EPO versus EPO; androgens plus EPO versus placebo plus EPO. <LINK REF="REF-Adamu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamu 2012</LINK> considered nandrolone versus EPO and nandrolone plus EPO versus EPO. There were also differences in outcome measures. We sought kidney function measures (BUN and SCr values), lipid profiles (TG, HDL, LDL values), albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin values; while <LINK REF="REF-Adamu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamu 2012</LINK> sought only blood pressure as an outcome measure.</P>
<P>Although there were some similarities in reported results, there were also differences.

<P>Oxymetholone may help to correct anaemia and increase albumin among adults with CKD-related anaemia by increasing ALT and AST, and decreasing HDL levels. However, evidence quality was poor, and we were unable to confirm if oxymetholone could reduce BUN, SCr, cholesterol, or TG. Furthermore, it could not be established if oxymetholone increased plasma total protein, prealbumin, or transferrin. Limited evidence suggested that nandrolone decanoate may increase HCT, plasma total protein, plasma albumin, and transferrin.</P>
<P>There was no compelling evidence to indicate if nandrolone decanoate increased Hb or prealbumin, or decreased BUN, SCr, AST, ALT, cholesterol, TG, HDL, adverse events, or LDL.</P>
<P>Suboptimal study quality meant that evidence to support the use of androgens in adults with anaemia of CKD was not identified.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-08-27 14:27:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Large, multicentre RCTs investigating androgens for anaemia of CKD in adults are required. Future investigators should ensure that people at all CKD stages are recruited, and assessment of a comprehensive range of targeted androgen therapies is undertaken. Triallists should plan measure changes in symptom relief, quality of life, and rate of CKD progression to end-stage kidney disease.</P>
<P>Reporting of mortality, quality of life and adverse events outcomes is required. Future studies should explore if occurrence of relative EPO insufficiency is a possible rationale for using androgens for adults with CKD-related anaemia, and whether prolonged or short courses of androgen therapy is of greater benefit. The most suitable dosages of androgens should also be explored for adults living with CKD-related anaemia.</P>
