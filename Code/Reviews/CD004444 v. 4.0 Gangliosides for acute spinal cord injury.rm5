<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>No evidence that treatment with gangliosides reduces death rate or improves life for survivors after spinal cord injury</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Injuries to the spinal cord are often devastating. Worldwide there are up to 40 million such injuries a year. People who survive often have severe disabilities. Gangliosides are substances that occur naturally in nerve cells. They can be manufactured and there have been studies to see whether they can be used to treat various conditions where nerves have been damaged. This review found two studies where a ganglioside had been used to treat people with spinal cord injury. The treatment did not produce a lower death rate and there was no evidence that movement, feeling or quality of life was improved for those who lived.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in loss of feeling and movement. The consequences can be devastating for the patient and his or her carers. Global estimates of the number of new cases annually range from 15 to 40 per million. Leading causes of acute SCI are road traffic injury, violence, and injuries sustained in sports and other recreational activities. Care for people with SCI has improved, leading to an increase in survival rates. Attempts to improve patients' feeling and movement have involved the use of a wide range of treatments. Gangliosides are compounds that occur naturally in cell membranes. Laboratory studies have suggested they may have protective effects on nerves and even help them to re-grow. Clinical trials have taken place using gangliosides (usually GM1 ganglioside) for a number of neurological conditions. </P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-11-06 15:18:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We searched the following databases to identify trials for inclusion: Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register (searched 4 June 2008), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library issue 2, 2008), MEDLINE to May (week 3) 2008, PUBMED (searched on 5 June 2008 (Limit: added to database in last 90 days), EMBASE to June 2008, Current Controlled Trials metaRegister (searched 5 June 2008), Web of Knowledge; Science Citation Index (searched 5 June 2008). We also searched web-based sources using the search engine Google.com. We approached the manufacturers of the most widely used ganglioside and researchers in this field to try to locate any unpublished data.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials of any ganglioside versus controls, in patients with SCI. Outcome measures specified were: mortality, recovery of motor function, improvement in sensory measures, measures of functional activity, infections and any other adverse events.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted from published studies and authors were contacted for further information. All data found was dichotomous and odds ratios (with 95% CIs) were calculated. A fixed-effects model was assumed.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two studies met the inclusion criteria. There were no deaths in one (n=37). In the other (n=760), there were slightly more deaths in the treatment group than in the control group; odds ratio 1.07 (0.57, 2.00 95%CI) - a result that can be explained by the play of chance. Methodological weaknesses regarding the collection and presentation of data from the two studies made it impossible to reach any conclusions regarding the effect of gangliosides on the other specified outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The evidence available does not support the use of ganglioside treatment to reduce the death rate in SCI patients. No evidence has yet emerged that ganglioside treatment improves recovery or quality of life in survivors. </P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-05-23 15:42:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is damage to the spinal cord that results in loss of feeling and movement. The consequences can be devastating for the patient and his or her carers.</P>
<P>There is no accepted figure for the number of new cases of acute SCI globally; estimates range from 15 to 40 cases per million annually (<LINK REF="REF-Sekhon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sekhon 2001</LINK>). The Japanese Society of Paraplegia has estimated the annual incidence nationally to be 39.4 per million (<LINK REF="REF-Shingu-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shingu 1994</LINK>). In the USA, it has been estimated that the number of cases admitted to hospitals will increase from 11,500 in 1994 to 13,400 in 2010, and that the number of people living with the consequences of an acute SCI will increase from 207,000 to 247,00 over the same period (<LINK REF="REF-Lasfargues-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lasfargues 1995</LINK>). Those injured are often young; a US study found that average age at injury was 32 (<LINK REF="REF-Kirshblum-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirshblum 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Leading causes of acute SCI are road traffic injury, violence, and injuries sustained in sports and other recreational activities (particularly diving and certain forms of football). The picture varies considerably between and within countries; thus traffic injury is the biggest cause in most developed countries (44.9% in Japan (<LINK REF="REF-Shingu-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shingu 1994</LINK>) but in south-eastern Turkey the leading causes were falls (37.3%), gunshot wounds (29.3%) and traffic injury (25.3%) (<LINK REF="REF-Karamehmetoglu-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karamehmetoglu 1997</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Care for people with acute SCI has improved, leading to an increase in survival rates (<LINK REF="REF-Sekhon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sekhon 2001</LINK>). Attempts to improve patients' feeling and movement have involved the use of a wide range of pharmacological and other treatments.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-09-18 11:56:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Gangliosides are compounds that occur naturally in cell membranes. They are particularly abundant in the membranes of the central nervous system. In vitro studies with gangliosides, dating back to the 1970s, suggested that gangliosides could promote axon growth (<LINK REF="REF-Roisen-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roisen 1981</LINK>). Animal studies have suggested that gangliosides may have protective effects on nerves and, in the longer-term, help them to re-grow (<LINK REF="REF-Ledeen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ledeen 1984</LINK>). The mechanisms of ganglioside action remain unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Blight-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blight 2002</LINK>) but those proposed include anti-excitotoxic activity, apoptosis prevention, and potentiation of neuritic sprouting and the effects of nerve growth factors (<LINK REF="STD-Geisler-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Geisler 2001</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Clinical trials have taken place using gangliosides for a number of neurological conditions, most notably stroke (for which use there has been a Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Candelise-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Candelise 2003</LINK>)) and Parkinson's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1998</LINK>). No major problem with adverse events has been detected, although sporadic cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome have been noted in stroke patients receiving gangliosides (<LINK REF="REF-Candelise-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Candelise 2003</LINK>). The potential use of gangliosides for patients with SCI has attracted considerable attention within the medical community. In the USA there have also been articles in the popular media (<LINK REF="REF-Torg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torg 1995</LINK>). Research has focused on one ganglioside - GM1 ganglioside (monosialotetrahexosylganglioside GM1; Sygen®). Other gangliosides include GM2, GM3, GD1a and GD1b.</P>

<P>While the studies above suggest that these compounds may have properties worthy of some further investigation, gangliosides are not registered for use for people with SCI.

<P>Abstracts of all studies identified were scanned independently by both reviewers and the full text of potentially relevant articles retrieved. The two reviewers independently assessed the identified studies for eligibility. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. The quality of trials was assessed using methodology developed by Schultz and Chalmers (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). This considers whether the intervention was blinded, whether people evaluating outcome were blinded, how many subjects were followed up, and the quality of the randomisation process. Allocation concealment was rated: A - adequate, B - unclear and C - inadequate. The reviewers attempted to ascertain whether intention-to-treat analysis had been undertaken in the trials.</P>

For continuous data, weighted mean differences (WMD) were to be used. A standard heterogeneity test was planned to assist in decisions whether or not to produce typical estimates of effect. Sub-group analysis had been anticipated as follows: according to the quality of allocation concealment in trials, type of ganglioside, whether administration is "early" (within eight hours) or "late", and whether spinal injury is considered "complete" or "incomplete". Had there been heterogeneity in the length of follow-up, a sensitivity analysis would have been considered, data allowing.</P>

<P>A total of 138 records have been retrieved in the search for studies to June 2008. All studies were screened independently by two review authors and 30 papers were obtained in full. Of these, one study, which was translated from Chinese to English <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2002</LINK>, is still under investigation, three were potentially eligible, however one (<LINK REF="STD-Walker-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1993</LINK>) was excluded as patients suffered from chronic, not acute, SCI. Two studies met the inclusion criteria and were eligible for review.</P>

<P>The first study (<LINK REF="STD-Geisler-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Geisler 1991</LINK>) involved 37 patients (of 351 screened) randomised to receive GM1 ganglioside (17 patients) or a placebo (20) but, for reasons described by the researchers as 'technical not therapeutic', only 34 completed treatment. Some heterogeneity was noted between patients in the treatment and control groups, for example with regard to the level of the injury. Follow-up assessment of patients took place after one year. The missing three patients (one in the treatment group and two in the placebo group) were not assessed neurologically though they were included in the analysis of adverse events. Six of the 34 patients who completed treatment were excluded from analysis of sensory function, because their grade, at entry, on the five-point Frankel system was in one of the highest two categories. (The researchers recorded the number of patients who improved by two or more grades and these six patients thus 'lacked room' to do this.)</P>
<P>The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Geisler-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Geisler 2001</LINK>) involved 760 patients, of 3165 screened according to several eligibility criteria. Patients were required to have at least one lower extremity with a substantial motor deficit; patients with spinal cord transection or penetration were excluded, as were patients with a significant cauda equina. Patients were randomised to three groups: high-dose GM1 ganglioside, low-dose ganglioside and placebo. A further 37 patients were 'randomised in error' but no data is available on these patients. At the first interim analysis, an extramural monitoring committee recommended early discontinuation of the high-dose treatment group because, at that stage, there appeared to be greater mortality and lower efficacy in this group. Low-dose treatment was given to 331 patients (44%), high-dose to 99 (13%) and placebo to 330 (43%). Outcomes were: mortality, number of patients considered to have made 'marked recovery', motor and sensory scores, bowel and bladder function, safety. Follow-up regarding some outcomes ceased at six months; with others the final follow-up was at one year.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Geisler-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Geisler 1991</LINK> there was no loss to follow-up. However, as described above, treatment was discontinued in three of the 37 randomised patients and these three did not undergo neurological testing. Although data on American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor scores are available on all 34 patients who completed treatment, we have not included this outcome in our analysis as, without data on the other three patients, the analysis would not be 'intention-to-treat'. Likewise the approach used to assess sensory function, which excludes both the three patients who did not complete treatment and a further six patients who lacked 'room to improve', makes intention-to-treat analysis impossible. Data on adverse events are available for all 37 randomised patients and we have therefore included this in our analysis.<BR/>
<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Geisler-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Geisler 2001</LINK> mortality data is available on all of 760 correctly randomised patients, i.e. there was no loss to follow-up.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Geisler-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Geisler 2001</LINK>, the authors recorded the number of patients considered to be making a 'marked recovery', this being assessed at 4, 8, 16 and 26 weeks after entry. This does not correspond with our inclusion criteria for outcome measures and we have not used the data in our analysis. Other data recorded in the study were: ASIA light touch, pinprick and motor scores; and number of patients with normal bowel and bladder function. The published paper presents summary graphs of this information but the data itself is not given. We contacted the researchers for missing data. We supplied them with a table wherein spaces were left blank for data we lacked. The researchers were unable to provide data in this form but kindly supplied us with data analysis print-outs. Unfortunately this still did not provide us with the information we needed to conduct an analysis on an intention-to-treat basis. We were therefore unable to analyse the data or draw any conclusions from it.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events (Table 02)</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Geisler-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Geisler 1991</LINK>, 16 GM1-treated patients had a total of 56 events of which 36 were urinary infections; comparable figures for the placebo group - 19 patients, 75 events, 49 urinary. For all adverse events combined, the odds of an event were slightly lower in the control group; OR 0.84 (0.05, 14.57 95%CI) - again a result that can be explained by the play of chance.<BR/>
<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Geisler-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Geisler 2001</LINK> the authors considered that "The reported adverse events were typical for the acute SCI population, and there were no noteworthy differences among treatment groups in frequency or severity of events". No data was, however, published and the authors have not been able to supply the reviewers with data for the events they recorded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Both of the included studies have been extensively discussed in review articles by the authors and by others. The publication of the very small 1991 study led to optimism that GM1 ganglioside offered new hopes for the treatment of SCI. However, the results of the 2001 study found no difference between treatment and control groups in terms of mortality. Although the presentation by authors of the studies of the data on other outcomes makes it difficult to conduct an analysis, no clear difference between treatment and control groups has emerged. No evidence of any harm from ganglioside treatment has been found, but we cannot exclude the possibility of rare adverse events that would only have been detected had much larger sample sizes been used.</P>
<P>Central to the approach adopted by the authors of the two studies is the notion that gangliosides may be effective with some but not other subgroups of patients, depending in particular on the exact site of the injury. This has influenced their presentation of the data but makes it hard to analyse the effects of gangliosides on SCI patients overall, while failing to identify any subgroup for whom the response to the treatment might be beneficial.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence for the use of gangliosides in the treatment of acute SCI.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is no evidence that ganglioside treatment reduces mortality in SCI patients. Further randomised trials of good quality would have to examine, as well as mortality, the improvement in sensory and motor scores of <I>all</I> recruited patients according to recognised motor and sensory scales. </P>
