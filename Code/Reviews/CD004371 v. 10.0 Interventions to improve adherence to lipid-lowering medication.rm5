However, taking these medications as prescribed has not been as high as one would wish. In the past, several methods have been tried to improve the rate at which people take these lipid-lowering treatments. Previous Cochrane Reviews have not shown a clear benefit of any particular method. We have updated our review to see if any new methods in this digital age have been tested as ways of improving these rates.</P><P><B>Search</B></P><P>Our search included the 11 studies identified from previous versions in 2004 and 2010. We conducted an updated search of the same electronic databases on 3 February 2016, and we searched clinical trials registers up to 27 July 2016.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>The people included in the studies were adults over 18 years of age in outpatient settings, for whom lipid-lowering therapy was recommended. We now include 35 studies covering 925,171 participants in this review.</P><P><B>Key results</B></P><P>Of the 35 included studies, 16 compared interventions categorised as 'intensified patient care' versus usual care. These interventions included electronic reminders, pharmacist-led interventions, and healthcare professional education to help people better remember to take their medications. These types of interventions when compared to standard care demonstrated significantly better adherence rates both over the short term (up to and including six months) as well as the long term (longer than six months). Additionally, cholesterol levels were better over both long- and short-term periods in those offered the intervention, compared to those receiving usual care.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>We considered only randomised controlled trials for this review. Given the nature of the interventions, it was not possible to keep participants unaware of which group they were in. However, analysis of other forms of bias indicated that generally the studies were at low risk of bias. We assessed the evidence for the outcomes using the GRADE system, and rated it as high quality for long-term adherence (more than six months) and for reduction in total cholesterol, and moderate quality for short-term medication adherence (up to six months) and for LDL-cholesterol levels. For the outcome total cholesterol levels at less than six months follow-up, we downgraded the evidence to low quality.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2016-12-20 10:59:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-18 13:27:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill"><P>Lipid-lowering drugs are widely underused, despite strong evidence indicating they improve cardiovascular end points.

We have therefore included 35 studies, randomising 925,171 participants. Seven studies including 11,204 individuals compared adherence rates of those in an intensification of a patient care intervention (e.g. electronic reminders, pharmacist-led interventions, healthcare professional education of patients) versus usual care over the short term (six months or less), and were pooled in a meta-analysis. Participants in the intervention group had better adherence than those receiving usual care (odds ratio (OR) 1.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 2.88; 7 studies; 11,204 participants; moderate-quality evidence). A separate analysis also showed improvements in long-term adherence rates (more than six months) using intensification of care (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.91 to 4.29; 3 studies; 663 participants; high-quality evidence). Analyses of the effect on total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels also showed a positive effect of intensified interventions over both short- and long-term follow-up. Over the short term, total cholesterol decreased by a mean of 17.15 mg/dL (95% CI 1.17 to 33.14; 4 studies; 430 participants; low-quality evidence) and LDL-cholesterol decreased by a mean of 19.51 mg/dL (95% CI 8.51 to 30.51; 3 studies; 333 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Over the long term (more than six months) total cholesterol decreased by a mean of 17.57 mg/dL (95% CI 14.95 to 20.19; 2 studies; 127 participants; high-quality evidence). Included studies did not report usable data for health outcome indications, adverse effects or costs/resource use, so we could not pool these outcomes. We assessed each included study for bias using methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. In general, the risk of bias assessment revealed a low risk of selection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. There was unclear risk of bias relating to blinding for most studies.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-12-20 10:59:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Mieke L van Driel"><P>The evidence in our review demonstrates that intensification of patient care interventions improves short- and long-term medication adherence, as well as total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels. Healthcare systems which can implement team-based intensification of patient care interventions may be successful in improving patient adherence rates to lipid-lowering medicines.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2016-12-20 13:58:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-18 15:28:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill"><P>Despite compelling evidence about the effectiveness of lipid-lowering drugs and the introduction of clear guidelines, lipid-lowering therapy is still underused (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenson-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenson 2015</LINK>). Recent recommendations by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association are expected to significantly increase the number of individuals for whom statin therapy is indicated (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-Guidelines-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA Guidelines 2013</LINK>). Lack of adherence and high rates of discontinuation have been shown to be important factors in failing treatment when looking both at high cholesterol levels and at morbidity in terms of recurrent myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Blackburn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackburn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wei-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wei 2002</LINK>).</P><CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-12-18 15:13:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill"><P>High cholesterol is one of the top 10 risk factors that account for more than one-third of all deaths worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-Report-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Report 2002</LINK>). It is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), estimated to cause 18% of CVD and 56% of ischaemic heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-Report-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Report 2002</LINK>). There is compelling evidence for the effectiveness of lipid-lowering drugs in reducing both lipid levels and the risk of heart attacks and strokes (<LINK REF="REF-Baigent-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baigent 2005</LINK>). Elevated serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total triglycerides (TRG) are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), whereas high-density lipoproteins (HDL) or a low TC to HDL ratio appear to be protective. Lipid-lowering medications (hypolipidaemics) for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia include statins, fibrates and anion-exchange resins. Statins, in particular, have been shown in large randomised controlled trials to be effective in preventing CHD events and in reducing overall mortality (<LINK REF="REF-_x0034_S-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">4S 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Athyros-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Athyros 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Downs-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-LIPID-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">LIPID 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MRC_x002f_BHF-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC/BHF 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sacks-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sacks 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 1995</LINK>). Fibrates and anion-exchange resins achieved reductions in CHD events, but showed a non-significant increase in non-coronary mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Downs-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1998</LINK>). Statins are therefore recommended as first-line therapy, whereas fibrates and anion-exchange resins can be considered as second-line therapy and also in combination with statins (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2007</LINK>).</P><P>Recommendations about drug treatments vary from country to country. In the UK, treatment with statins for secondary prevention is indicated in people with clinical evidence of CVD to reduce further ischaemic events. For primary prevention of CVD, lipid-lowering medication is recommended in asymptomatic adults who have a 20% or greater risk of developing CVD in the next 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2007</LINK>). A combination of statins, blood pressure-lowering drugs and low-dose aspirin is recommended by the World Health Report (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-Report-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Report 2002</LINK>) for secondary prevention of CVD, as this could cut death and disability rates from CVD by more than 50%. A meta-analysis confirmed an approximately linear relationship between the absolute reduction in LDL-cholesterol and the proportional reductions in the incidence of coronary and major vascular events (<LINK REF="REF-Baigent-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baigent 2005</LINK>). Statin therapy resulted in a 19% proportional reduction in CHD deaths per mmol/L LDL-cholesterol reduction. It can safely reduce the five-year incidence of cardiovascular events largely irrespective of the initial lipid profile, relating the absolute benefit mainly to an individual's absolute risk of such events and the absolute reduction in LDL-cholesterol achieved (<LINK REF="REF-Baigent-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baigent 2005</LINK>). In England, 7000 myocardial infarctions and 2500 strokes could be avoided each year if individuals at high risk, who are not taking medication, received lipid-lowering treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Primatesta-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Primatesta 2000</LINK>). These figures show the impact of lipid-lowering drugs on public health and thus the importance of the acceptance of and adherence to medication by the public.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-12-18 15:28:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill"><P>Adherence is defined as the extent to which people take medication as prescribed. Since the landmark publication by <LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1976</LINK>, it has been the focus of research over the last three decades (<LINK REF="REF-Vermeire-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermeire 2001</LINK>). Adherence can either be intentional or non-intentional, and is determined by a variety of factors such as lack of knowledge, denial, adverse effects, poor memory and adverse attitudes to treatment. Reliable indicators of adherent behaviour have not been found to date and demographic factors such as age, sex or social class have been shown to be poor predictors of adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Vermeire-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermeire 2001</LINK>). The importance of the person's agreement (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2003</LINK>) and the significance of their role within the doctor-patient relationship have been emphasised, which has led to replacing the term 'compliance' with more patient-centred synonyms such as 'adherence' and 'concordance' (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marinker-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinker 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mullen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mullen 1997</LINK>). The treatment of a symptomless condition such as hyperlipidaemia signifies a particular challenge to both doctor and patient. It has been difficult to identify the scope of the problem, as adherence rates from hyperlipidaemia trials show considerable variation, ranging from 37% to 80%, depending on factors such as study population, background morbidity, classes of drugs, duration of follow-up and adherence-measuring methods (<LINK REF="REF-Tsuyuki-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsuyuki 2001</LINK>). Epidemiological data show that target cholesterol concentrations are achieved in fewer than 50% of people receiving cholesterol-lowering drugs and that only one in four people continue taking medication in the long term (<LINK REF="REF-Benner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benner 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Primatesta-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Primatesta 2000</LINK>). Not surprisingly, primary prevention trials appear to have higher discontinuation rates than secondary prevention trials, which indicates a relationship between adherence and awareness of illness (<LINK REF="REF-Tsuyuki-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsuyuki 2001</LINK>). This was confirmed in a population-based study involving elderly people, where 60% of people prescribed a statin for acute coronary syndrome gave up treatment within two years, compared to 75% of those without coronary disease (<LINK REF="REF-Jackevicius-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackevicius 2002</LINK>).</P><P>A wide range of interventions to improve adherence to medication have been studied (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Costa-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costa 2015</LINK>). They can focus on the person, the drug regimen, the physician or the health system (delivery of medication). Patient education and empowerment is important, as people adhere less to drugs or treatments if they do not understand why they need to take them (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2011</LINK>). Simplification of the drug regimen may assist, as adherence is inversely related to the number of drugs the person is taking (<LINK REF="REF-Pasina-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pasina 2014</LINK>), and especially complex dosing schedules are at risk. Interventions focused on physicians advocate good communication and a patient-centred approach (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2011</LINK>), which could include appropriate follow-up and support. System-based approaches could include pharmacist involvement and (automated) patient reminder systems.</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2016-12-18 14:03:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill"><P>A number of systematic reviews looking at adherence-enhancing interventions have been published in the Cochrane Library<I>. </I><LINK REF="REF-Nieuwlaat-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieuwlaat 2014</LINK> identified effective ways to improve medication adherence for a variety of medical conditions in widely differing populations. Adherence to short-term drug treatment was improved by written information, personal phone calls and counselling. For long-term treatments, no simple intervention and only some complex ones led to some improvement in health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Nieuwlaat-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieuwlaat 2014</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 2004</LINK> focused on medications for controlling blood pressure and reported enhanced adherence by reducing the number of daily doses. Patient support and education interventions improved adherence to antiretroviral therapy when targeting practical medication management skills aimed at individuals rather than groups (<LINK REF="REF-Rueda-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rueda 2006</LINK>). In the treatment of type 2 diabetes, it was concluded that nurse-led interventions, home aids, diabetes education and pharmacy-led interventions do not show significant effects (<LINK REF="REF-Vermeire-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermeire 2005</LINK>). Another review concluded that reminder packaging increased the proportion of people taking their medications, but the effect was not large (<LINK REF="REF-Mahtani-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahtani 2011</LINK>).</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-12-18 14:04:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill"><P>The indication for prescribing lipid-lowering drugs has changed substantially over the last 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-Guidelines-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA Guidelines 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baigent-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baigent 2005</LINK>). With evidence to suggest that effectiveness of statins occurs irrespective of initial lipid level, greater numbers of people are being actively prescribed lipid-lowering agents. Observational studies have shown that adherence to lipid-lowering drugs is poor, with people taking their medication only 60% of the time in a one-year period (<LINK REF="REF-Avorn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avorn 1998</LINK>). There is strong evidence that adherence diminishes over time in people who are being treated as part of a primary or secondary prevention strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Benner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benner 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jackevicius-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackevicius 2002</LINK>). The consequence of inadequate adherence to lipid-lowering therapy is substantial. In secondary prevention, inadequate adherence is associated with an increase in recurrent myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Wei-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wei 2002</LINK>). For these reasons, it is important that clinically effective and cost-effective strategies to improve adherence are found for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in the community. The findings of our review can be integrated into clinical practice guidelines and assist clinicians in making a difference to patient outcomes.

We obtained full-text articles of potentially relevant studies. Following this initial screening, the three review authors (JS, MM, RU) selected trials independently by applying predetermined inclusion criteria.

For instance, medication refill data are likely to measure adherence more objectively than manual pill counts, even if outcome assessors are not blinded to group allocation.

In the studies classified as intensification of patient care, enough high-quality studies exist with similar outcomes where we noted significant trends favouring the interventions. The types of studies in this category included large groups of outpatients and would seem to be generalisable to other outpatient cohorts. Studies in the other categories could address the objectives of our meta-analysis, but given the relatively small number of comparable studies with similar interventions and outcome measures, no clear trends emerged.</P><P>The interventions in the intensified patient care group are of a type which is applicable to current practice. Many large healthcare systems are evaluating methods to improve the health of large populations of patients. Large-scale structural interventions noted in the intensified patient care group of interventions are generally feasible for these types of systems.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-12-18 15:18:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill"><P>The studies in this review investigate the impact of a wide range of interventions on adherence to lipid-lowering treatments. The nature of the majority of interventions implies that blinding of participants was not possible (e.g. interventions such as reminder phone calls or education sessions). As this is acceptable in a pragmatic context, we have not downgraded the evidence for lack of blinding. Studies demonstrating a fixed dose combination or &#8216;polypill&#8217; placebo comparison are feasible, but we could not pool them in our review.</P><P>We assessed the quality of the pooled evidence using the GRADE classification for five pooled outcomes in the comparison of intensification of patient care vs usual care. We graded the evidence for the outcomes of long-term adherence (more than six months) and reduction in total cholesterol as being of high quality. We rated the short-term outcomes (up to six months) of patient adherence and LDL-cholesterol as being of moderate quality. We downgraded these outcomes by one level because of heterogeneity of the pooled data. We downgraded the short-term outcome of total serum cholesterol to low quality, due to heterogeneity and a wide confidence interval (imprecision).</P><P>The review authors independently reviewed data at various checkpoints, ensuring the selection of a series of rigorous studies.

It is nevertheless still possible that we have missed relevant material. In addition, two review authors selected studies independently, thus minimising the risk of overlooking any. The updated searches in 2015 and 2016 retrieved a considerable number of new studies for inclusion, indicating that the topic is still being actively researched. In order to maintain the relevance of this review, we will therefore attempt to update our searches regularly. The evidence is quite consistent and robust and it may therefore be unlikely that a missed study could have changed our conclusions.</P><P>The diverse nature of the studied interventions and absence of a standard classification of interventions to improve medication adherence means that studies can be grouped in different ways.

Patients generally purchase their medication from a number of different pharmacies. A study in a similar setting found a clustering effect of -0.006, which justifies using uni-level analysis. It is possible that we have overestimated the effect of the intervention, however, it is unlikely that this will have influenced the conclusion.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-12-13 15:36:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill"><P>The two previous versions of this review concluded that there were no reliable interventions that have been shown to improve adherence rates to lipid-lowering medications (<LINK REF="REF-Schedlbauer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schedlbauer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schedlbauer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schedlbauer 2010</LINK>).

Moderate-quality evidence shows that intensification of patient care interventions improves short-term medication adherence and LDL-cholesterol. The evidence for total cholesterol reduction in the short term is of low quality. Given the importance of statin therapy in both primary and secondary prevention, strategies to improve adherence rates should have significant benefit in those people for whom statin therapy is recommended. The interventions which were identified as successful in the intensification of patient care interventions typically involved strategies beyond what a single clinician could provide. Instead, healthcare delivery systems might be better equipped to deliver the types of interventions which have been shown to best improve adherence rates. Health system-related interventions which showed benefit involved strategies such as pharmacist-led interventions, multidisciplinary educational or counselling sessions, and automated reminders of various types. A combination of all of these types of interventions, along with an added focus on teamwork with the primary physician, also proved to be effective (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2014</LINK>). In these studies, effectiveness was generally demonstrated by improvements in both adherence rates and in lipid levels. The effect appeared durable and was significant over both short-term and long-term time periods. Healthcare systems which are able to involve teams of healthcare professionals in the implementation of such interventions may well be successful in decreasing the burden of cardiovascular disease in the populations whom they serve through improved adherence to statin medications.</P><P>The results of our meta-analysis must, however, be seen in the context of the healthcare system in which they were trialled. For instance, the pharmacy-led interventions are applicable in systems with a strong and well-structured medication delivery system through pharmacies, but will not be feasible in, for instance, low-income countries where drug dispensing is much less controlled or integrated into the healthcare system. Cultural and social context will also play a role and the impact of automated reminders delivered as text messages, for instance, will be less effective if patients' beliefs regarding their medicines have not been addressed.</P><P>it is important to acknowledge the wide diversity of control interventions that we have grouped as 'usual care', which is different in each setting. For instance, pharmacy usual care can include patient education in some settings but none at all in others. Likewise, usual care in the context of physician-delivered interventions can also vary extensively. The results of our comparisons therefore need to be interpreted with caution.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-18 15:23:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill"><P>Exploration of additional factors which influence adherence to drug therapy may help in identifying other targets for interventions. These additional factors include knowledge, health beliefs, risk perception, memory, side effects of medication, costs of medication and inconvenience (<LINK REF="REF-Ebrahim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebrahim 1998</LINK>). The phenomenon of adherence is complex and it would seem reasonable for interventions to address this complexity with a more patient-centred approach. People's beliefs and preferences need to be acknowledged and incorporated into adherence-enhancing interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Marinker-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinker 1997</LINK>). A combination of strategies including information, reminding, adherence reinforcement and emphasis on the person's perspective might lead to more effective strategies. In terms of the lipid-lowering drug class, the main focus should be on statins, as they have been shown to be the most potent lipid-lowering drugs (<LINK REF="REF-ACC_x002f_AHA-Guidelines-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACC/AHA Guidelines 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baigent-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baigent 2005</LINK>). Other important aspects for future studies include valid methods for measuring adherence and assessing the effects on serum lipid levels. Long-term follow-up, of 12 months and more, will reveal a more realistic picture of adherence to life-long treatment and allow for the evaluation of morbidity and costs. Finally, studies evaluating these types of interventions on other outcomes such as morbidity, mortality, quality of life and cost effectiveness would be very useful. Data relating to which interventions were the most cost-effective can provide guidance to healthcare systems.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2016-12-13 15:43:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill"><P>We would like to acknowledge the important contributions by Knut Schroeder and Tim Peters, who were co-authors of the original review.

At the end of this period, data will be collected from the GP/Pharmacy pairs in both study arms.</P><P>The integrated intervention comprises the following 3 elements: (1) HealthTracker, (2) availability of the Polypills and (3) Pharmacy Adherence Support Service (PASS).</P><P>(1) HealthTracker is an electronic decision support tool that aims to assist general practitioners in the management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. It aims to promote best practice care by giving management advice to healthcare providers based on national guidelines. HealthTracker incorporates a single, extensively validated screening and management algorithm, based on a synthesis of recommendations from several guidelines for CVD, kidney disease and diabetes prevention and management. HealthTracker interfaces with Medical Director (MD) and Best Practice (BP), two clinical practice software systems that together comprise around 80% of general practice record systems in Australia. Data from the patient records in MD or BP pre-populate HealthTracker which then provides the GP point-of-care recommendations on optimal use of CVD risk preventive medications (including option of polypill), based on that patient&#8217;s absolute CVD risk estimate.</P><P>(2) 8 CVD polypills will be available and they are:</P><P>(i) Name: PolyPill Hydroirb; Components: Hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) + Irbesartan (150 mg) + atorvastatin (40 mg)</P><P>(ii) Name: PolyPill Hydroirb Asp; Components: Hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) + Irbesartan (150 mg) + atorvastatin (40 mg) + 100 mg aspirin</P><P>(iii) Name: PolyPill Amloirb; Components: Amlodipine (5 mg) + Irbesartan (150 mg) + atorvastatin (40 mg)</P><P>(iv) Name: PolyPill Amloirb Asp; Components: Amlodipine (5mg) + Irbesartan (150mg) + atorvastatin (40 mg) + aspirin (100 mg)</P><P>(v) Name: PolyPill Perindap; Components: Perindopril (4 mg) + indapamide (1.25 mg) + atorvastatin (40 mg</P><P>(vi) Name: PolyPill Perindap Asp; Components: Perindopril (4 mg) + indapamide (1.25 mg) + atorvastatin (40 mg) + aspirin (100 mg)</P><P>(vii) Name: PolyPill Peramlo; Components: Perindopril (4 mg) + amlodipine (5 mg) + atorvastatin (40 mg)</P><P>(viii) Name: PolyPill Peramlo Asp; Components:Perindopril (4 mg) + amlodipine (5 mg) + atorvastatin (40 mg) + aspirin (100 mg)</P><P>(3) Pharmacy Adherence Support Service (PASS): This intervention involves supporting patients with their &#8220;medication journey&#8221; by a trained pharmacist. Patients who have been prescribed a Polypill or a new CVD preventative medication will be referred by the GP to a partner Pharmacist who will firstly administer the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) for assessing medication adherence in patients presenting with new CVD preventative medication prescriptions. In patients with an MMAS score &#8805; 6, pharmacists will offer and provide to patients the PASS. PASS, is a customised adherence programme which involves a structured clinical interview (approximately 20 minutes) focused on: (i) understanding how the patient actually &#8216;uses&#8217; their medications; (ii) understanding patient beliefs about their medications; and (iii) capturing patient-reported barriers to adherence. The structured interview is based on a modified version of the Brief Medication Questionnaire 1 (BMQ1), which will be used to systematically review and collect adherence data. Depending on the individualised recommendations, pharmacists may see enrolled patients at approximately 2 weeks (telephone discussion, 5 minutes), and during scheduled pharmacy visits at approximately 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after enrolment, to coincide with prescription refills (patients may however present each month for a regular refill of their medications). Adherence issues and barriers to medication taking will be reviewed at each visit (10 minutes). An electronic software (PASS Application) has been developed to deliver the MMAS-8 and the PASS via a Tablet/Ipad provided to Pharmacists.</P><P>The use of HealthTracker will be monitored centrally by the research team. The use of PASS will be monitored by Project Officers who will contact and visit pharmacies regularly. Fidelity measures (e.g. number of times a recommendation was clicked or the PASS intervention was delivered) will be collected throughout the study.</P></CHAR_INTERVENTIONS><CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2016-12-16 10:51:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill"><P>Primary outcomes:</P><P>Proportion of high-risk participants who were not on full treatment at baseline achieving recommended target (i) BP and (ii) LDL-C target levels, at the end of the study.

The programme will be delivered over 24 weeks. Messages focus on providing participants with key behaviour change strategies to initiate and maintain the respective behaviours.</P><P>Additional features include prompting and support to undertake the behaviour. Intervention messages were developed according to New Zealand clinical guidelines for the management of coronary heart disease, and are based on Social Cognitive Theory principles.</P><P>Each participant in the intervention group will receive at minimum the basic heart health CR program, consisting of 5 messages per week for 6 months. The general heart health messages provide overall advice and support on undertaking lifestyle change, including, taking medication, being physically active, eating healthy, and reducing alcohol consumption. One message per week on each topic is delivered or the entire six months.</P><P>Messages are sent to participants at times that suit them and will be personalised to participant&#8217;s name (or nickname, and their sex). Participants can also choose their preferred time for receiving messages. The intervention will be predominantly unidirectional; however if participants choose to text questions to the team, these will be answered within 24 hours. Participants will be instructed that the messages are for general heart health issues and that all emergency issues should be managed as per normal procedures. All participants will be offered brief training at enrolment on how to read a text message and how to delete or save messages.</P><P>Participants will be able to request additional text messages based on the suboptimal behaviour (see below) they wish to modify (identified at their baseline assessment).</P><P>1.

MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>In their Cochrane Systematic Review, Van Driel et al. reported statistically significant improvement of medication adherence and reductions in total cholesterol and LDL-C with intensified patient care. They concluded that healthcare systems that are able to implement such interventions &#8220;may well be successful in decreasing the burden of cardiovascular disease in the populations whom they serve through improved adherence to statin medications.&#8221; We are not convinced of this statement as it makes several potentially invalid assumptions. Firstly, a clear unidirectional association between achieving lower LDL-C targets (as would be achieved by improved adherence to lipid-lowering medications) and a decreased risk of mortality, is not apparent in the current body of evidence. Although two recent meta-analyses by Silverman et al. and Koskinas et al. have shown an association between lower LDL-C levels and risk of major vascular events, a systematic review by Ravnskov et al. suggested an inverse association between LDL-C and mortality in the elderly. Given the results of the latter study, more intensive LDL-C lowering does not necessarily translate to improved clinical outcomes, and may in fact be associated with harm in certain populations. Furthermore, there are examples of interventions that reduce LDL-C and do not result in clinical benefit (e.g. ezetimibe), and drugs that increase LDL-C but have benefit for cardiovascular outcomes (e.g. empagliflozin). We believe that measurement of LDL-C lowering is not a good surrogate for cardiovascular benefit due to these conflicting observations amongst studies.</P><P>With the evidence mentioned above, we believe that investigating clinical outcomes would have been more relevant than assessing LDL-C lowering in this review. However, the included studies did not report any usable data for health outcome indications (e.g. all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events), adverse effects or costs/resource use, and Van Driel et al. assessed the included studies in their review to have a low risk of reporting bias. The Cochrane Handbook states, &#8220;in many systematic reviews, only a few eligible studies can be included in a meta-analysis for a specific outcome because the necessary information [is] not reported by the other studies. While that outcome may not have been assessed in some studies, there is almost always a risk of biased reporting for some studies. Review authors need to consider whether an outcome was collected but not reported or simply not collected&#8221;. It is unclear whether van Driel et al. have determined if relevant and important clinical outcomes such as mortality were collected but not reported or simply not collected in the included studies. Without such information, we believe that at the very least, the risk of bias is unclear.</P><P>We also believe that performing a per-protocol analysis instead of an intention to treat analysis may result in misleading effect estimates that do not accurately represent the true effect of adherence interventions. Per-protocol analyses represent an ideal scenario where patients are under close observation by study investigators and may be more motivated to adhere to study treatments. In a real-world scenario, patients are not monitored so closely and may be less motivated than patients included in RCTs. As a result, adherence to interventions may be lower than in RCTs. An intention to treat analysis may be a more accurate representation of the true effect of these adherence interventions in real life, since it would include data from those who deviate from study protocols. By focusing on participants who are adherent to their lipid-lowering therapy, the effect size of these interventions is overestimated.</P></FEEDBACK_SUMMARY><FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2018-03-23 07:22:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Thank you for your thoughtful feedback on our review. The points you raise are very pertinent. We discussed these issues extensively within the author team when working on the review. </P><P>We fully agree that cholesterol levels are merely surrogate markers of the burden of cardiovascular disease in the population. They are also surrogate outcomes of trials aimed at reducing cardiovascular outcomes in individuals. Ideally, studies would collect data on clinical outcomes such as morbidity or mortality. Unfortunately, none of the studies included in this review report these outcomes. This may be explained by the fact that the focus of the trials was on improving medication adherence (primary outcome in the majority of included studies). The cholesterol markers were measured as an indicator of adherence to the lipid-lowering drug, not as a marker of effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, we don&#8217;t think that this is highly suspicious of reporting bias. Most studies were simply not designed to track morbidity and mortality outcomes. This of course, shows the limitations of the available evidence. As clinicians we would be most interested in knowing if encouraging and monitoring our patients to be compliant with the treatments we prescribe, is worthwhile on outcomes that matter to patients (and not just lipid levels). Our review doesn&#8217;t give a straightforward answer. We can only say that these interventions seem to improve adherence to treatment which is reflected in cholesterol levels. These in turn are linked (albeit not directly) to cardiovascular outcomes.</P><P>Your point regarding the per-protocol analysis is valid. We may be painting a more ideal picture with this kind of analysis. In the real world, without the careful follow up of a clinical trial, patients are often much less adherent to their medications. Moreover, we know that people who participate in trials are usually better motivated than those who choose not to. However, an intention to treat (ITT) analysis which considers all those lost to follow up as treatment failures (in this case non-adherent), will seriously underestimate the effect. If the per protocol (PP) analysis provides a &#8216;best case scenario&#8217;, the ITT analysis portrays the &#8216;worst case&#8217;. In this review we have chosen to report the PP analysis as the interventions are complex and mostly pragmatic (set in the &#8216;messiness&#8217; of real world health systems, which means that even the follow up of participants in the trials is messy).
