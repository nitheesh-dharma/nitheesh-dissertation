<TITLE>Interventions for replacing missing teeth: antibiotics at dental implant placement to prevent complications</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-29 14:32:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question </B>
</P>
<P>This review, carried out by authors of the Cochrane Oral Health Group, has been produced to assess the possible benefits of antibiotics taken orally at the time of the placement of a dental implant in order to prevent infection. If antibiotics are shown to be of benefit in preventing infection, this review also seeks to establish which type, dosage and duration of treatment is the most effective. The use of antibiotics to prevent infection in implant dentistry is controversial, and there is a need to answer these questions in order to improve the success rates of dental implants whilst minimising complications, harms or adverse effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Missing teeth can sometimes be replaced with dental implants to which a crown, bridge or denture can be attached. Bacteria introduced during the placement of implants can lead to infection, and sometimes implant failure. Infections around biomaterials (such as dental implants) are difficult to treat and almost all infected implants have to be removed, which is why it is so important to prevent infection if possible.</P>
<P>It has been suggested that taking antibiotics orally either before or after placement (or both) can minimise the chances of infection.</P>
<P>Generally the use of antibiotics in surgery in order to prevent infection is only recommended for people at risk, when surgery is extensive, or performed in infected sites, and when large foreign materials are implanted in the body. Recently, a short term course of antibiotics has been recommended when antibiotics have to be used, because sometimes antibiotics can cause side effects that range from diarrhoea to life-threatening allergic reactions. Another major concern associated with the widespread use of antibiotics is the increase in the appearance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence on which this review is based was up to date as of 17 June 2013. Six trials were included with a total of 1162 participants.</P>
<P>All six of these trials compared the use of antibiotics to prevent infection (failures and complications) with no treatment or treatment with a placebo (a fake medicine with no active ingredient). The antibiotic used in all the trials was amoxicillin; doses and timing of doses varied, although most used a single dose taken just before the implant was placed. One of the trials, with 100 participants, also looked at different doses of amoxicillin taken at different times.</P>
<P>There were no trials that looked at alternative antibiotics.</P>
<P>Participants were people over 18 years of age who were able to give consent to taking part in a medical trial. Potential participants were excluded for a variety of reasons that included: if they were at risk of heart disease, had artificial joints, had problems with their immune system, were affected by diabetes, had received radiotherapy in the head and neck area, had need of additional procedures at the time of implant placement, were allergic to penicillin, had chronic/acute infections near the planned implant site, were already receiving antibiotic treatment for any other reasons (or had taken them up to six months previously), had been treated with or were receiving intravenous amino-bisphosphonates, were pregnant or breast feeding, were receiving long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy, or had blood clotting problems. The follow-up period in all the trials was at least three months.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>It appears that the oral administration of two grams of amoxicillin one hour before placement of dental implants is effective in reducing implant failures. More specifically, giving antibiotics to 25 people will avoid one person experiencing early implant losses. It is still unclear whether postoperative antibiotics are beneficial, or which antibiotics work best.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence from the six trials (1162 participants) that compared the use of antibiotics with placebo or no treatment was considered to be of moderate quality. However, the one trial (100 participants) that investigated antibiotics given for different lengths of time was found to be at high risk of bias.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-29 13:29:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some dental implant failures may be due to bacterial contamination at implant insertion. Infections around biomaterials are difficult to treat, and almost all infected implants have to be removed. In general, antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery is only indicated for patients at risk of infectious endocarditis; with reduced host-response; when surgery is performed in infected sites; in cases of extensive and prolonged surgical interventions; and when large foreign materials are implanted. A variety of prophylactic systemic antibiotic regimens have been suggested to minimise infections after dental implant placement. More recent protocols recommended short-term prophylaxis, if antibiotics have to be used. Adverse events may occur with the administration of antibiotics, and can range from diarrhoea to life-threatening allergic reactions. Another major concern associated with the widespread use of antibiotics is the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The use of prophylactic antibiotics in implant dentistry is controversial.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-07-29 13:33:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 17 June 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2013, Issue 5), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 17 June 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 17 June 2013). There were no language or date restrictions placed on the searches of the electronic databases.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-07-29 13:33:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) with a follow-up of at least three months, that compared the administration of various prophylactic antibiotic regimens versus no antibiotics to people undergoing dental implant placement. Outcome measures included prosthesis failures, implant failures, postoperative infections and adverse events (gastrointestinal, hypersensitivity, etc).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-07-29 13:34:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the risk of bias of the trials and data extraction were conducted in duplicate and independently by two review authors. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RRs) using a random-effects model for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity, including both clinical and methodological factors, was to be investigated.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-30 12:02:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six RCTs with 1162 participants were included: three trials compared 2 g of preoperative amoxicillin versus placebo (927 participants), one compared 3 g of preoperative amoxicillin versus placebo (55 participants), one compared 1 g of preoperative amoxicillin plus 500 mg four times a day for two days versus no antibiotics (80 participants), and one compared four groups: (1) 2 g of preoperative amoxicillin; (2) 2 g of preoperative amoxicillin plus 1 g twice a day for seven days; (3) 1 g of postoperative amoxicillin twice a day for seven days, and (4) no antibiotics (100 participants). The overall body of evidence was considered to be of moderate quality. The meta-analyses of the six trials showed a statistically significant higher number of participants experiencing implant failures in the group not receiving antibiotics (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.67, P value 0.002, heterogeneity: Tau<SUP>2</SUP> 0.00; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> 2.87, df = 5 (P value 0.57); I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%). The number needed to treat for one additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) to prevent one person having an implant failure is 25<B> </B>(95% CI 14 to 100), based on an implant failure rate of 6% in participants not receiving antibiotics. There was borderline statistical significance for prosthesis failures (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.00), with no statistically significant differences for infections (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.36 to 1.35), or adverse events (RR 1; 95% CI 0.06 to 15.85) (only two minor adverse events were recorded, one in the placebo group). No conclusive information can be derived from the only trial that compared three different durations of antibiotic prophylaxis since no event (implant/prosthesis failures, infections or adverse events) occurred in any of the 25 participants included in each study group. There were no trials that evaluated different antibiotics or different antibiotic dosages.
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-29 13:38:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Scientific evidence suggests that, in general, antibiotics are beneficial for reducing failure of dental implants placed in ordinary conditions. Specifically 2 g or 3 g of amoxicillin given orally, as a single administration, one hour preoperatively significantly reduces failure of dental implants. No significant adverse events were reported. It might be sensible to suggest the use of a single dose of 2 g prophylactic amoxicillin prior to dental implant placement. It is still unknown whether postoperative antibiotics are beneficial, and which antibiotic is the most effective.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-07-29 13:39:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dental implants are widely used for replacing missing teeth. Despite the high success rates published in the literature, implant failures do occur (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 1998a</LINK>). It is believed that a certain number of early dental implant losses are due to bacterial contamination at implant insertion (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 1998b</LINK>). It is known that infections around biomaterials, such as implants, are very difficult to treat and almost all infected implants have to be removed sooner or later (<LINK REF="REF-Esposito-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 1998b</LINK>). The likelihood of an infection around dental implants is influenced by the surgical skill (traumatic and prolonged surgery is more likely to favour infections) and by the degree of asepsis (sterility). In general, antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery is only recommended in the following situations: for patients at risk of infectious endocarditis, patients with reduced host-response, when surgery is performed in infected sites, for extensive and prolonged surgical interventions, and when large foreign materials are implanted.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-07-30 11:52:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In order to minimise infections after dental implant placement various prophylactic systemic (whole body) antibiotic regimens have been suggested. Initially, antibiotics were recommended preoperatively and up to 10 days postoperatively, one of the most commonly followed protocols being the administration of 2 g of phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin-V), orally, about one hour preoperatively and then 2 g twice a day for 10 days (<LINK REF="REF-Adell-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adell 1985</LINK>). More recent protocols recommended short-term prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Flemmig-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flemmig 1990</LINK>): 2 g of penicillin-V (or amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate) administered orally, one hour prior to surgery and 500 mg of penicillin-V four times a day for one day. </P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-07-29 13:40:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While it is important to minimise risk of implant failures, it is also sensible to minimise the use of antibiotics, since adverse events may occur. Complications most commonly associated with the use of antibiotics range from diarrhoea to life-threatening allergic reactions. Another major concern associated with the widespread use of antibiotics is the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-07-29 13:40:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of antibiotics in implant dentistry is controversial and some controlled clinical trials yielded contradictory results (<LINK REF="REF-Dent-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dent 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gynther-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gynther 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laskin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laskin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Binahmed-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binahmed 2005</LINK>). It would be useful to know whether prophylactic antibiotics are effective in reducing postoperative infections and failures of dental implants; and, if so, which is the most effective antibiotic, at what dose and for what duration.</P>

<P>This was conducted using the recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). It is a two-part tool, addressing the six specific domains (namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and 'other bias'). Each domain includes one specific entry in a 'Risk of bias' table. Within each entry, the first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry, either 'low risk', 'high risk' or, where there is insufficient information on which to base a judgement, 'unclear risk'.</P>
<P>The risk of bias assessment of the included trials was completed independently and in duplicate by two review authors as part of the data extraction process. On occasions when the review authors were also authors of trial reports that needed to be assessed, the reports were independently evaluated only by review authors who had not been involved in the trials.</P>

<P>A meta-analysis was performed only if there were studies with similar comparisons that reported the same outcome measures. Risk ratios were combined for dichotomous data, using random-effects models provided there were more than three studies in the meta-analysis.

The recommendations of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> were followed for studies with zero-cell counts (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The fixed value of 0.5 was added to all cells with zero-cell counts and risk ratios calculated with the Review Manager (RevMan) software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2013</LINK>).

<P>A total of 1162 participants were analysed in the six included trials, three of which were assessed as being at low risk of bias and three at high risk of bias. The overall body of evidence was considered to be of moderate quality. More participants experienced implant losses in the group that did not receive antibiotics and this was statistically significant (risk ratio (RR) 0.33; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.67, P value 0.002, heterogeneity: Tau<SUP>2</SUP> 0.00; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> 2.87, df = 5 (P value 0.57); I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%) (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). In order to illustrate the magnitude of the effect of implant failures, the number of people needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB), i.e. given antibiotics, to prevent one person having an implant failure is 25 (95% CI 14 to 100). This is based on an implant failure of 6% in participants not receiving antibiotics, as seen in the meta-analysis. No heterogeneity was observed in the meta-analysis. The meta-analyses for the other outcomes showed borderline statistical significance in favour of antibiotics for prosthesis failures (five trials) (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.00) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), and no statistically significant difference for postoperative infections (six trials) (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.36 to 1.35) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), and adverse events (six trials) (RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.06 to 15.85) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-29 15:37:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The meta-analysis of six randomised controlled trials (RCTs), three of which were assessed as being at high risk of bias and three at low risk of bias, suggests that short-term antibiotics, e.g. 2 g (<LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anitua-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Anitua 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esposito-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Esposito 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Caiazzo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Caiazzo 2011</LINK>), or 3 g (<LINK REF="STD-Nolan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nolan 2013</LINK>), of amoxicillin administered one hour prior to implant placement or 1 g of amoxicillin administered one hour prior to implant placement and 500 mg four times a day for two days postoperatively (<LINK REF="STD-Abu_x002d_Ta_x0027_a-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Abu-Ta'a 2008</LINK>), significantly decrease early implant failures (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.67). This observation has important clinical implications, as the use of antibiotics in this way would prevent one person experiencing an early implant loss for every 25 people receiving antibiotics.</P>
<P>There were borderline statistical significance for prosthesis failures in favour of antibiotics (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.00), and no statistically significant differences for any of the other outcomes: infections (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.36 to 1.35) or adverse events (RR 1; 95% CI 0.06 to 15.85). In particular only two minor adverse events were reported, one in the antibiotic group (diarrhoea and somnolence) and one in the placebo group (itching for one day), which suggest that the antibiotic regimens used may not have a significant negative impact on the participants' well-being. In other words, the benefit of using short-term antibiotics may outweigh the risks in the short-term for individual patients. However we need to consider that the sample sizes of all trials together were far too small to be able to catch rare - but life-threatening - adverse events such as anaphylactic shock.</P>
<P>No conclusive information can be derived from the only trial that compared three different durations of antibiotic prophylaxis, since no event (implant or prosthesis failures, infections or adverse events) occurred in any of the 25 participants included in each study group (<LINK REF="STD-Caiazzo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Caiazzo 2011</LINK>).</P>

The main issues were the lack of blinding of operators, participants and outcome assessors in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Abu_x002d_Ta_x0027_a-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Abu-Ta'a 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Caiazzo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Caiazzo 2011</LINK>), and the withdrawal of randomised participants not attending all follow-ups in another (<LINK REF="STD-Nolan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nolan 2013</LINK>). Lack of blinding may induce surgeons to perform, more 'clean and careful' implantation procedures in people without antibiotic coverage to minimise risks of infection, and patients may report more or fewer adverse events depending on their personal beliefs on the role of antibiotic coverage. Proper blinding remains the only way to minimise these risks, and could have been easily and effectively done by use of a placebo. The withdrawal of participants who did not attend the immediate postoperative visits should not be done, since they attended the most relevant appointments, such as abutment connection, when the main outcome measures could have been recorded (implant/prosthesis success). All data should be recorded and reported, allowing readers to make their own judgements. Theoretically the trial authors could have retrieved this information from the participants' files, however participants were assigned a unique identification number at the beginning of the study and their names were not used, as requested by the ethical committee. Unfortunately, the list identifying participants was deleted recently, so their records could not be retrieved to see the outcome of their implants.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-07-30 21:52:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An earlier systematic review on this topic concluded that there is little evidence for the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in general dentistry, and recommended monitoring of antibiotic use among dental practitioners (<LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 2007</LINK>). One RCT was not included in this review because its follow-up was too short (eight weeks) (<LINK REF="STD-Tan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2013</LINK>). In this trial 329 healthy adults in need of a single implant-supported crown were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) preoperatively 2 g of amoxicillin one hour before surgery (81 participants), 2) 2 g of amoxicillin immediately following surgery (82 participants), 3) preoperatively 2 g of amoxicillin one hour before surgery and 500 mg thrice daily on days two and three after surgery (86 participants), 4) preoperatively 2 g of placebo one hour before surgery (80 participants). Subjects were examined clinically by blinded examiners up to crown delivery at eight weeks after implant placement. Implants were not submerged. There was only a significant difference in flap closure at week 4, where 5% of the participants who did not receive antibiotic did not achieve complete wound closure when compared to 0% for the three other groups (P value 0.01). There was only one implant failure, which again occurred in one of the participants who did not received antibiotics. It is worth to observe that this trial reported an extremely low failure rate (0.3% at participant level), which is almost 13 times less than that reported in another trial (3.81% at participant level) that included participants with similar characteristics (<LINK REF="STD-Anitua-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Anitua 2009</LINK>). The latter figures are more representative of what currently happens in 'everyday' conditions. Nevertheless, the findings of the non-included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Tan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2013</LINK>) agree with the findings of the present review.</P>
<P>There are a few controlled trials that provided contradictory results. The first study on this subject evaluated implant success at abutment connection (four to six months after implant placement) (<LINK REF="REF-Dent-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dent 1997</LINK>). This trial compared various dosages and antibiotics given preoperatively and postoperatively, generally compared with no antibiotics or antibiotics given in an insufficient dosage to an unknown number of participants (2641 implants). Significantly fewer failures occurred in the antibiotic group (1.5% versus 4%). The study was updated by a second publication that presented data with a follow-up of three years after loading (<LINK REF="REF-Laskin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laskin 2000</LINK>). This reported 387 participants (1743 implants) in the antibiotic group and 315 participants (1247 implants) in the control group. The results suggested fewer failures when antibiotics were used (4.6% versus 10%). This multicentre trial was initially described as a randomised controlled trial (RCT), but, in reality, dentists were free to choose when to give antibiotics, which antibiotics to give, and which dosage to use. In addition, there was no blinded assessment and participants were not considered as the statistical unit of the analysis, so the possible clustering of failures was not taken into account.</P>
<P>In a retrospective controlled clinical study (<LINK REF="REF-Gynther-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gynther 1998</LINK>), 147 participants (790 implants) who received 1 g of phenoxymethylpenicillin one hour preoperatively and 1 g every eight hours postoperatively for 10 days were compared with 132 participants (664 implants) who did not receive any antibiotics. Both groups were treated at the same centre, but at different time points (antibiotic group between 1980 and 1985; no antibiotic group between 1991 and 1995). No differences in survival rates of implants were reported. Another prospective multicentre controlled clinical study administered a single preoperative dose of penicillin G or V (1,000,000 units) or 600 mg of clindamycin to all patients, then one group had no postoperative antibiotics, the other receiving 300 mg penicillin V orally four times a day, or in case of penicillin allergy, 150 mg clindamycin orally three times a day for seven days (<LINK REF="REF-Binahmed-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binahmed 2005</LINK>). A single dose was given to 125 participants (445 implants), while long-term prophylactic antibiotics were given to 90 participants (302 implants). Biological complications only were evaluated at one and two weeks post surgery and just before abutment connection. There were no differences regarding biological complications, which included three wound dehiscences in each group, with one developing an infection in the long-term antibiotic group. The authors concluded that long-term prophylactic antibiotic use was of no advantage or benefit over a single dose, however implant success, which should have been the primary outcome measure, was not evaluated. Unfortunately, all these studies were highly biased in their methodology, so the validity of their conclusions should be questioned.</P>
<P>Additional information can be obtained from three double-blinded RCTs that evaluated the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics used for bone augmentation procedures prior to implant placement (<LINK REF="REF-Lindeboom-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindeboom 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindeboom-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindeboom 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindeboom-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindeboom 2006</LINK>). One pilot placebo-controlled RCT (<LINK REF="REF-Lindeboom-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindeboom 2003</LINK>) compared a preoperative single dose of 2 g penicillin phenethicillin with a placebo in 20 participants undergoing intraoral buccal onlay grafting with resorbable barriers to allow implant placement. Two participants developed an infection at both the receptor and donor sites; two participants developed a wound infection at the receptor site; and one participant developed an infection at the donor site only. All of these participants (50%) were in the placebo group. No infections were observed in the antibiotic group. It could be concluded that there was a statistically significant increased risk of having an infectious complication after bone augmentation with resorbable barriers without antibiotic prophylaxis. One RCT compared 2 g penicillin phenethicillin versus 600 mg of clindamycin as a single dose in participants treated with block-shaped bone graft harvested from the mandibular ramus and covered by resorbable barriers (the implants were not placed in the study) (<LINK REF="REF-Lindeboom-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindeboom 2006</LINK>). Each group had 75 participants and the presence of infection was assessed weekly for eight weeks. No statistically significant differences were observed for postoperative infections (four infections at the augmented sites of the penicillin phenethicillin versus two in the clindamycin group, and three infections at the donor site of each group). The findings of this trial suggest that both penicillins and clindamycin are effective in reducing infection at augmented sites. No side effects related to the single-administration of antibiotics were reported. In another, similar, RCT the same research group evaluated whether it was more effective to use a single dose of 600 mg clindamycin one hour prior to onlay bone grafting procedures followed by either placebo or 300 mg clindamycin every six hours for one day (<LINK REF="REF-Lindeboom-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindeboom 2005</LINK>). Each group had 62 participants. No statistically significant differences were observed for postoperative infections (two infections at the augmented sites of the single dose group versus three infections in the one-day group, and four infections at the donor sites of the single dose group versus two infections in the one-day group). Again, no side effects related to the administration of antibiotics were reported.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-07-29 14:02:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence from a meta-analysis including six trials with 1162 participants suggesting that administration of antibiotics significantly reduces early failure of dental implants placed in ordinary conditions. Five of these compared a single administration of preoperative antibiotics (2 g or 3 g of amoxicillin given orally one hour preoperatively) with placebo or no antibiotics. More specifically, giving antibiotics to 25 people will prevent one person experiencing early implant losses. Borderline statistical significance was shown for prosthesis failures. No statistically significant differences in postoperative infections and adverse events were observed. No major adverse events were reported. It might be sensible to suggest routine use of a single dose of 2 g of prophylactic amoxicillin just before placing dental implants. It remains unclear whether an adjunctive use of postoperative antibiotics is beneficial, and which antibiotic is the most effective.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-07-29 14:02:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Priority should be given to large pragmatic double-blinded RCTs evaluating the efficacy of prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis compared to a single preoperative dose in those subgroups of people where implant failures are more likely to occur, particularly in those receiving immediate post-extractive implants and augmentation procedures in conjunction with implant placement. It would also be useful to evaluate which antibiotic type is the most effective.</P>

<P>The authors could not supply information about whether some of the prostheses could not be placed after implant failures without placing additional implants for replacing the failed ones. This was due to the fact that participants were assigned a unique number to identify their sample at the beginning of the study and the participants' names were not be used after assignment of this number (as per ethics committee requirements). The list identifying participants had been deleted recently, so their records could not be identified to see what happened with their prostheses</P>
