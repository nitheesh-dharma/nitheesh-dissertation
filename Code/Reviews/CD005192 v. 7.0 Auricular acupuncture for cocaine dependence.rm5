<TITLE MODIFIED="2008-03-21 13:46:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Auricular acupuncture for cocaine dependence</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>There are no effective drugs for the treatment of cocaine dependence, and doctors do not agree on a best method of treatment. More than 400 substance abuse clinics in the USA and Europe offer a treatment for cocaine dependence called auricular acupuncture. In this treatment, needles are usually inserted into five specific points in the ear, but some clinics use only four or three of the points. In this Cochrane review the authors set out to discover whether auricular acupuncture is effective in treating cocaine dependence and whether the number of points used makes a difference. The authors searched the medical literature for studies called randomized controlled trials, in which one group of patients receives a treatment (such as acupuncture) and is compared with a similar group who receives a different treatment or no treatment (the control group). The authors found seven studies with a total of 1433 people. Most of the studies compared acupuncture with 'sham' acupuncture in which needles were inserted into random places in the ear but not into the specific points required for treatment. The studies used a variety of acupuncture techniques, using three, four, or five of the treatment points. The studies had a number of problems with the way their results were reported. The authors conclude that there is no evidence that any form of auricular acupuncture is effective for treating cocaine dependence. They recommend that better research be done, since it was difficult for them to draw conclusions from the few available studies.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Auricular acupuncture (insertion of acupuncture into a number, usually five, of specific points in the ear) is a widely-used treatment for cocaine dependence. <BR/> </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether auricular acupuncture is an effective treatment for cocaine dependence, and to investigate whether its effectiveness is influenced by the treatment regimen.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>Issue 3, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2004) , EMBASE (January 1988 to October 2004); PsycInfo (1985 to October 2004); CINAHL (1982 to October 2004); SIGLE (1980 to October 2004) and reference lists of articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing a therapeutic regimen of auricular acupuncture with sham acupuncture or no treatment for reduction of cocaine use in cocaine dependents. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently extracted data from published reports and assessed study quality using the Drug and Alcohol CRG checklist. All authors were contacted for additional information; two provided data. Separate meta-analyses were conducted for studies comparing auricular acupuncture with sham acupuncture, and with no treatment. For the main cocaine use outcomes, analyses were conducted by intention to treat, assuming that missing data were treatment failures. Available case analyses, using only individuals who provided data, were also conducted. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seven studies with a total of 1,433 participants were included. All were of generally low methodological quality. No differences between acupuncture and sham acupuncture were found for attition RR 1.05 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.23) or acupuncture and no acupuncture: RR 1.06 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.26) neither for any measure of cocaine or other drug use. However, the number of participants included in meta-analyses was low, and power was limited. Moderate benefit or harm is not ruled out by these results. Methodological limitations of the included studies may have also made the results open to bias.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is currently no evidence that auricular acupuncture is effective for the treatment of cocaine dependence. The evidence is not of high quality and is inconclusive. Further randomised trials of auricular acupuncture may be justified.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Cocaine use is common in North America, Europe and some other parts of the world, and cocaine dependence has become a serious public health problem, causing medical, psychological and social problems, crime, violence and spread of infectious diseases including AIDS, hepatitis and tuberculosis. There is no consensus on the best method of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 1994</LINK>): no effective pharmacological agent has yet been identified (<LINK REF="REF-Lima-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lima 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lima-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lima 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soares-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares 2004a</LINK>), but some psychological and behavioural treatments have shown promise (<LINK REF="REF-Soares-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares 2004b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Auricular (ear) acupuncture is a widely used treatment for cocaine dependence, being available in more than 400 substance abuse clinics in the USA and Europe (<LINK REF="REF-SAMHSA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">SAMHSA 2000</LINK>). Its use was developed at the Lincoln Hospital in New York in the 1970s. The procedure developed there involves insertion of needles into five points in the ear: the "lung", "liver", "kidney", "sympathetic" and "<I>shen men</I>" points. The process has been codified by the (American) National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA) and this treatment is often referred to as the "NADA protocol" or "five point protocol". The method is intended as a general treatment for addiction, and is not specific to cocaine. </P>
<P>Several variations of the standard NADA protocol have been used: for example, <LINK REF="STD-Margolin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Margolin 2002</LINK> used a four point acupuncture protocol, while <LINK REF="REF-Bullock-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bullock 1999</LINK> used a three point method. In addition, there are many possible variations in the way treatment is delivered: group or individual therapy, variable frequency and duration of treatment, and a variety of other interventions may be used along with acupuncture.</P>
<P>Methods of acupuncture other than auricular acupuncture using the NADA five point protocol or variants of it have been used for treating addiction (for example, whole body acupuncture), but studies using these methods will not be considered in this review.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>(1) To determine whether auricular acupuncture is effective compared with sham or no treatment for reduction of cocaine use in cocaine dependent individuals.<BR/>(2) To determine whether variations in treatment such as modification of the NADA protocol, or additional treatments used along with acupuncture, influence its effectiveness.</P>

<P>
<B>Study selection<BR/>
</B>One author (LS) screened the titles and abstracts of all papers identified by the electronic searches to reject studies that clearly did not meet the review's inclusion criteria. We obtained full reports of all studies identified as potentially eligible. Two authors (SG and LS) then independently evaluated whether studies should be included or excluded. In the event of any disagreement, a third author was to be consulted, but this was not necessary.<BR/>Two authors independently extracted data from eligible studies (SG and LS). These included information on the study design and quality, participant characteristics and results. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Assessment of the methodological quality<BR/>
</B>Included studies were assessed and graded for methodological quality and bias (SG and LS). Quality assessment of randomised trials included:</P>
<P>
<B>Allocation concealment<BR/>
</B>(A) Adequate allocation concealment: central randomizations (e.g. allocation by a central office unaware of subject characteristics), opaque sealed envelopes, on-site computer system combined with allocations kept in a locked unreadable computer file that can be accessed only after the characteristics of an enrolled participant have been entered or another description that guaranteed concealment.<BR/>(B) Unclear allocation concealment: when the authors either did not report an allocation concealment approach or reported an approach that did not fall in the category A or C.<BR/>(C) Inadequate allocation concealment: alternation or reference to case numbers, dates of birth, day of the week. Any procedure that is entirely transparent before allocation, such as an open list of random numbers or other description that contained elements not guaranteeing concealment.</P>

<P>
<B>Blinding of the acupuncturist was not possible</B>

<P>
<B>Attrition Bias<BR/>
</B>(A) Loss to follow up completely recorded<BR/>(B) Loss to follow up incompletely recorded<BR/>(C) Unclear or not done</P>
<P>
<B>Completeness of follow-up was evaluated by recording the following aspects:<BR/>
</B>(i) Method of analysis - Intention to treat or per-protocol<BR/>(ii) Method of imputation used for missing data<BR/>(iii) Proportion of participants completing the full follow-up period<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>If participants had not all been analysed in their randomised groups, they were restored to the correct group for the review if there was sufficient information in the report to allow this.</P>
<P>Many published studies were analysed using techniques such as analysis of variance or analysis of covariance and were presented as statistics and p-values. Numbers of individuals with outcomes or mean values of continuous outcomes were only rarely reported. All authors of included studies were therefore contacted to request further information about study methodology and outcomes in a format suitable for inclusion in meta-analyses.</P>
<P>We decided whether or not to perform meta-analyses based on the similarity of the included studies. Meta analyses used a fixed effect model if the studies were considered sufficiently similar that this is reasonable (for example, evaluations of the same acupuncture method in similar populations), or a random effects model otherwise. Analyses of dichotomous outcome variables used relative risks, and continuous outcome variables used either the weighted mean difference, or standardised mean difference, if different trials measured the same outcome in different ways (for example, severity of addiction measured by different scales). We planned to perform sensitivity analysis excluding quasi-randomised trials and any other studies thought to be at high risk of bias (for example, an RCT with high loss to follow up, unevenly distributed between the groups), but there were insufficient data to allow this.</P>
<P>To assess heterogeneity in meta-analyses we used the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic for quantifying the inconsistency (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). This describes the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance). Low values (&lt;30%) are indicative of homogeneity; greater than 30% indicates a moderate amount of heterogeneity, and greater than 50% suggests substantial heterogeneity that needs to be taken into account in the analysis. If heterogeneity was found and there were sufficient similar studies for pooling, a random effects analysis would be conducted and pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed. If the subgroup analyses did not explain the heterogeneity, random effects analysis were used if an overall summary was desired, although it may be considered inappropriate to present an overall summary if the results of individual trials were heterogeneous (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The following subgroup analyses were pre-specified:<BR/>(1) Trial quality: low quality (quasi randomised or insecure allocation concealment versus higher quality);<BR/>(2) Trials in which all participants received additional therapy (e.g. behavioural or psychological interventions) versus those not including additional treatments;<BR/>(3) Type of acupuncture used: e.g. NADA 5 point protocol versus 4 point versus 3 point. The exact comparison to be made will depend on the interventions used by the included trials. The interventions will be classified at the time of data extraction.</P>

<P>Eleven potentially eligible RCTs were identified.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Excluded studies</B>
<BR/>Four were excluded: the majority of the participants were addicted to opiates in one (<LINK REF="STD-Wells-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wells 1994</LINK>), were healthy volunteers in one (<LINK REF="STD-Margolin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Margolin 1993</LINK>), one evaluated a single acupuncture dose for treatment acceptability not addiction (<LINK REF="STD-Margolin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Margolin 1995</LINK>) and one did not evaluate drug related outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Killeen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Killeen 2002</LINK>). Seven trials were therefore included. One report ( <LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK>) included two randomised trials; only Trial 1 was included in the review, trial 2 was excluded as it investigated different doses of acupuncture treatment and did not have a non-acupuncture or sham acupuncture group.</P>
<P>
<B>Included studies</B>
<BR/>Six studies included comparisons of a therapeutic regimen of auricular acupuncture with sham acupuncture (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Avants-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lipton 1994</LINK>; Margolin 2002; <LINK REF="STD-Otto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Otto 1998</LINK>). Three of these had an additional treatment arm comparing acupuncture with no acupuncture (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK>; Margolin 2002). In <LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK>, participants in both needle insertion groups also received psychosocial treatment. The remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Richard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1995</LINK>) was a four-arm trial, two of which were included in the review (acupuncture plus neuro behavioural treatment versus neuro behavioural treatment alone). This study did not have any needle insertion in the control group.</P>
<P>Four studies required participants to satisfy DSM III or IV criteria for cocaine dependence (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; Margolin 2002; <LINK REF="STD-Otto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Otto 1998</LINK>). The other studies had less stringent entry criteria: crack cocaine addiction but no diagnostic criteria were given (<LINK REF="STD-Richard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1995</LINK>), or self-reported cocaine use (<LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lipton 1994</LINK>). One study excluded patients if they were addicted to other substances (<LINK REF="STD-Otto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Otto 1998</LINK>) or were dependent on substances other than cocaine, opiates or nicotine (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; Margolin 2002). The remaining studies may have included participants with other substance use disorders.</P>
<P>The type of "active" auricular acupuncture varied between trials. All studies used acupuncture as the active treatment in some or all of the five sites specified by NADA; sympathetic, shen men, lung, liver and kidney, but they varied in the number used. All five points were used by <LINK REF="STD-Richard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Otto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Otto 1998</LINK>. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lipton 1994</LINK>; Margolin 2002) used four points, one (<LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK>) used three ear points, and one (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 1995</LINK>) used three ear points and one in the hand. Three of the trial reports contained diagrams of the locations of the active points (<LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lipton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Otto 1998</LINK>), but these were not consistent; the lung, liver and kidney points were not in the same place in all three diagrams. Two studies did not specify whether acupuncture was applied to one or both ears (<LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1995</LINK>); the other studies used both ears.</P>
<P>The size of groups in which treatments were given varied. In Avants 1995 the treatments were given individually or in groups of two. Three studies gave treatments in groups of up to six (Lipton 1994, Avants 2000, Margolin 2002), one stated that they were given in groups but did not specify the size (<LINK REF="STD-Otto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Otto 1998</LINK>), and one (<LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK>) used groups of up to 15.</P>
<P>The studies that used sham acupuncture varied in the type of needle insertion used for the control group. Three different types of control were used: 1. insertion of needles into non specific points a few millimetres from the addiction-specific points used (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK>); 2. insertion of needles into specific points not relevant to addiction (points relevant to back pain were used in both studies) (<LINK REF="STD-Lipton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lipton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Otto 1998</LINK>); 3. insertion of needles into zones or regions in the helix of the ear (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; Margolin 2002).</P>
<P>The duration and intensity of treatment specified in the study protocol varied between studies. The duration of treatment varied from 1 month (<LINK REF="STD-Lipton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lipton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1995</LINK>) to 8 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK>; Margolin 2002), and the number of sessions specified in the study protocol varied from 22 (<LINK REF="STD-Otto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Otto 1998</LINK>) to 40 (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; Margolin 2002).</P>
<P>Most studies did not perform any long-term follow-up of participants to evaluate the long-term effects of auricular acupuncture on cocaine dependence. The longest follow-up periods were those of <LINK REF="STD-Richard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1995</LINK> (9 months) and Margolin 2002 (6 months).</P>

<P>Three studies gave no information on the methods of randomisation and allocation concealment used (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Otto 1998</LINK>). The authors were contacted but no information was provided. Three studies used a computer program to allocate participants to randomised groups, and ensured that allocations were concealed (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; Margolin 2002; <LINK REF="STD-Richard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1995</LINK>). For the study by Lipton and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Lipton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lipton 1994</LINK>), there was a discrepancy between the information in the published paper and that provided by the author, and were, therefore, rated as unclear. The report suggested that allocations were determined by social security numbers, but the author informed the authors that randomisation was performed by a central office using a random number table.</P>

<B>Blinding</B>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Due to the nature of the interventions, it was not possible to blind the acupuncturists who delivered the intervention. Studies that compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture were able to ensure blinding of participants, and this was reported in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lipton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Otto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Otto 1998</LINK>). In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; Margolin 2002) blinding of participants was unclear; both reports stated that participants were informed of their allocation, but later stated that patients in the two needle insertion groups were not aware of whether or not they received real or sham acupuncture. <LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK>, although it was described as "single blind", apparently did not have blinding of the participants. In <LINK REF="STD-Richard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1995</LINK>, where there was no sham acupuncture control, blinding of participants was not mentioned, but was presumably not possible.</P>
<P>Five of the seven included studies stated that outcome assessment was blinded to allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lipton 1994</LINK>; Margolin 2002; <LINK REF="STD-Otto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Otto 1998</LINK>). The remaining two studies did not mention blinding of outcome assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1995</LINK>).</P>

<B>Post-randomisation exclusions and Intention To Treat (ITT) analysis</B>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Five studies appeared to have no post-randomisation exclusions and adequately accounted for all randomised participants (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; Margolin 2002; <LINK REF="STD-Otto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Otto 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1995</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Lipton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lipton 1994</LINK> stated that 192 patients were randomised, but 42 were subsequently excluded from the analysis for a variety of reasons. No data were presented for these 42 participants. In <LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK>, 236 patients were randomised, but the number in each group was not given.</P>
<P>Most studies presented results with participants in their randomised groups. However, much reporting of analyses used statistics and p-values rather than reporting numbers with each outcome. This was especially true where repeated measurements were taken, for example of urine samples that were screened for cocaine metabolites. This limited the data that could be included in meta-analyses. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-03-21 14:00:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although most of the studies measured one or more outcomes relevant to the review, in most cases they were not reported in a format suitable for meta-analysis. In many cases, data were analysed using methods such as analysis of variance or analysis of covariance, and results were presented as summary statistics only, rather than the numbers of participants with outcomes. All authors were therefore contacted for further information on the review's outcome measures. Only one author did not respond, even after a reminder (<LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK>). For four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; Margolin 2002; <LINK REF="STD-Otto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Otto 1998</LINK>) the authors responded, but did not provide any additional data. One author was unable to provide additional data because the data set had been destroyed in the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in 2001, but was able to clarify the study's methodology (<LINK REF="STD-Lipton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lipton 1994</LINK>). One study provided additional data that were included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Richard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>All studies reported high levels of missing data for self-reported and biochemically validated drug use outcomes, due to participants dropping out from the trial or being lost to follow-up. In the analyses we have assumed that missing data are treatment failures, that is, missing participants have been counted as positive for cocaine use. This means that the denominators are the number of participants randomised rather than the number with available data (ITT analysis). As the level of missing data was high, and hence assumptions had to be made about a large proportion of the participants, we also performed analyses including only participants with data (available case analysis), which are reported in the text only.</P>
<P>Most studies collected cocaine use outcome data. Typically, participants were asked for urine samples several times a week during the treatment period, and at specified follow-up points. This means that the outcome 'percentages of urine screens that were positive' contained non-independent data, as each participant contributed a number of screens to the analysis. The studies often analysed these data using analysis of variance or analysis of covariance, and it was unclear in some cases whether appropriate adjustments for the inclusion of non-independent data had been made. Some studies reported the results only as summary statistics, and did not include any data on the number of participants with the relevant outcomes.</P>
<P>We did not perform any of the pre-planned sub-group or sensitivity analyses as most analyses had too few studies. For most analyses heterogeneity was not detected; where it was detected it was noted in the text.</P>
<P>
<B>(1) Cocaine use (bio chemically validated)</B>
<BR/>All included studies reported bio chemically validated cocaine use, but only four provided data in a format suitable for meta-analysis. Combining these studies showed no difference between auricular acupuncture and sham acupuncture in ITT analysis, either in the short term (three studies: <LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Avants-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 1995</LINK>; Margolin 2002) RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.08) or long term (one study: Margolin 2002) RR 0.98 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.09). When auricular acupuncture was compared with no acupuncture, no difference was found in the short term (two studies: <LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; Margolin 2002) RR 0.99 (95% 0.92 to 1.05); heterogeneity I<SUP>2</SUP> = 67.9%. We decided the fixed effects estimate was more appropriate as the two trials had very similar protocols. The long-term outcomes, recorded at six and nine months in the two studies with data, did not show any difference, but the upper 95% confidence limit only just exceeded one (two studies:Margolin 2002; <LINK REF="STD-Richard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1995</LINK>) RR 0.92 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.01). Results were similar for available case analysis; no differences were found in short term or long term outcomes for acupuncture versus sham acupuncture (short term, three studies: <LINK REF="STD-Avants-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; Margolin 2002) RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.18); (long term, one study: Margolin 2002) RR 1.06 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.35) or acupuncture versus no acupuncture (short term, two studies: <LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; Margolin 2002) RR 0.96 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.15); (long term, two studies: Margolin 2002; <LINK REF="STD-Richard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1995</LINK>), RR 0.90 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.10).</P>
<P>Of the other three studies, <LINK REF="STD-Otto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Otto 1998</LINK> published no data but stated that there was no significant difference between the acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups. <LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lipton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lipton 1994</LINK> gave the results as the percentages of urine screens that were positive rather than the number of participants with positive screens, and it was unclear whether these had been analysed correctly, with adjustment for inclusion of non-independent data. Three of the four studies that were included in the meta-analyses presented repeated measures analyses of variance including all urine screens collected. Margolin 2002 showed no difference between auricular acupuncture and either of the comparison groups (statistics not given); <LINK REF="STD-Avants-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 1995</LINK> found no difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture (statistics not given); <LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK> found that the auricular acupuncture group were less likely to give cocaine positive urine samples than either the sham acupuncture group or the no acupuncture group, and reported odds ratios (OR), OR 2.40 (95% CI 1.00 to 5.75) and 3.41 (95% CI 1.33 to 8.72), respectively. <LINK REF="STD-Richard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1995</LINK> reported no significant difference between acupuncture and no acupuncture for cocaine use (p=0.46).</P>
<P>
<B>(2) Cocaine use (self report)</B>
<BR/>Data on self-reported cocaine use were available from two studies. <LINK REF="STD-Richard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 1995</LINK> reported the number of participants using cocaine at 30 days and six months. No difference between the acupuncture and no acupuncture groups was seen in the ITT analysis (short term) RR 1.09 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.69); (long-term) RR 1.04 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.43) or available case analysis (short term) RR 1.17 (95% CI 0.67 to 2.04); (long term) RR 1.07 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.58). <LINK REF="STD-Avants-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 1995</LINK> reported the amount of cocaine used at six weeks (grams). There was no difference between the auricular acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups (mean difference 0.00, 95% CI -0.29 to +0.29).<BR/>
<BR/>Margolin 2002 recorded self-reported cocaine use, and stated that there was no difference between the groups (no data presented).</P>
<P>
<B>(3) Severity of dependence</B>
<BR/>The Addiction Severity Index was used by five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lipton 1994</LINK>; Margolin 2002). All reported no significant difference between the acupuncture and control groups but did not present any data.</P>
<P>
<B>(4) Side effects</B>
<BR/>Side effects of treatment were not reported by any study.</P>
<P>
<B>(5) Attrition</B>
<BR/>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Avants-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 2000</LINK>; Margolin 2002; <LINK REF="STD-Otto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Otto 1998</LINK>) reported the number of participants not completing their allocated treatment. Combining data from all studies showed no difference in attrition rates between acupuncture and sham acupuncture RR 1.05 (95&amp; CI 0.89 to 1.23), and between acupuncture and no acupuncture RR 1.06 95% CI 0.90 to 1.26); I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 83.2%, again we decided the fixed effects estimate was more appropriate as the two trials had very similar protocols.</P>
<P>
<B>(6) Cocaine craving</B>
<BR/>Only one study comparing acupuncture and sham acupuncture reported data for cocaine craving, measured on a 0-10 scale (<LINK REF="STD-Avants-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Avants 1995</LINK>). The mean difference was -2.30 (-3.78, -0.82) which suggested a reduction in craving in the acupuncture group, although there was evidence of skewness in the data and the standard deviations differed between the groups. Craving was measured by four other studies. Margolin 2002 stated that there was no significant difference between the three treatment groups (data not given); <LINK REF="STD-Bullock-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bullock 1997</LINK> did not specify what measure was used, but there was no significant difference between the groups; <LINK REF="STD-Otto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Otto 1998</LINK> used the Halikas cocaine craving scale, but presented no results; <LINK REF="STD-Lipton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lipton 1994</LINK> used a 5 point craving scale and stated that there was no significant difference between the groups.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The results of this review do not support the hypothesis that auricular acupuncture is effective for treating cocaine dependence, either when compared with sham acupuncture or with no acupuncture. Two other recently published reviews have reached similar conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Alberto-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Alberto 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mills-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mills 2005</LINK>). However, the conclusions that can be drawn from the existing evidence are limited, for several reasons. </P>
<P>First, the reporting of the included studies was poor and did not meet the standards recommended in the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2001</LINK>). Most studies did not include important details of the methodology, including aspects such as allocation concealment, making it difficult to assess their risk of bias. We cannot be sure that many of the studies were not seriously biased. Reporting of outcomes in many cases relied only on statistics from analyses of variance or covariance rather than stating the numbers of participants who had an outcome. This limited the number of studies that provided data for meta-analysis.</P>
<P>All of the studies reported a high level of withdrawal, which introduces difficulties into the analysis. Either assumptions must be made about the outcomes of those who withdrew, or the sample size is reduced and there is a risk of bias from differential withdrawals between trial arms. The sample sizes of the included trials were in any case fairly small, and not sufficient to detect small treatment effects. Based on the number of trial participants, clear conclusions about the effectiveness of auricular acupuncture cannot be made.</P>
<P>Only a few studies performed long-term follow-up, and this was often compromised by high levels of attrition. Long-term cocaine use is probably the most important outcome, as a treatment would not be very useful if it reduced patients' cocaine use only during active treatment. A follow-up period of at least several months is therefore crucial to the assessment of the effectiveness of auricular acupuncture. </P>
<P>All the included studies used biochemical validation of cocaine use status, all through the use of urine tests. Similar methods were used by the studies and the same threshold for considering a urine sample to be positive was used (benzoylecgonine 300ng/ml). Biochemical validation gives the most reliable indication of cocaine use, but raises logistical problems and may contribute to reduced follow-up rates.</P>
<P>All included studies used as their control intervention either sham acupuncture or no acupuncture. In this review we have performed separate comparisons of "active" acupuncture with the two control groups. This is because we believe that it is reasonable to suppose that sham acupuncture might have different effects from no acupuncture. Insertion of needles into the ear into sites that are not thought to affect addiction could have physiological effects, if any exist, that are similar to those of insertion of needles into the addiction acupuncture points used in "true" acupuncture. In addition, the individual attention given by the acupuncture therapist in delivering both sham and true acupuncture might have beneficial effects that would be common to these two interventions, but not shared by the "no acupuncture" arm. Thus, it is possible that sham acupuncture may have effects that are different from no acupuncture. If any benefits of acupuncture are derived from the individual attention given to patients rather than to the specific sites into which needles are inserted, sham acupuncture could have effects that are indistinguishable from true acupuncture.</P>
<P>Studies that used sham acupuncture used a variety of sites for insertion of needles in the control group. Some used sites supposed to be specific for other problems such as back pain, whereas others used supposedly inactive sites. Whether there is any difference in the effects of insertion of needles into these different sites on cocaine dependence is unknown.</P>
<P>Supporters of acupuncture have criticised the existing trials for using an acupuncture intervention that is different from the way it is used in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Hammerschlag-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammerschlag 1998</LINK>). However, if insertion of needles into specific ear points were an effective intervention against cocaine dependence, benefit should be seen whether trials mimic clinical practice or not. The existing evidence does not exclude a beneficial effect of acupuncture, but neither does it suggest that there is a major benefit associated with this intervention. It is possible that any beneficial effects of acupuncture that practitioners see in their clinical practice may be due to their extra interactions with patients rather than insertion of needles.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence that auricular acupuncture is effective as a treatment for cocaine dependence. However, the evidence is not of high quality and is not conclusive. The widespread use of acupuncture is not based on sound evidence. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further randomised trials of auricular acupuncture for cocaine dependence are warranted. These should use a sample size large enough to detect modest effects, include long-term follow up and endeavour to minimise losses to follow up. Participants who withdraw from treatment should be included in follow up. Studies should be fully reported according to the CONSORT guidelines. It is questionable whether a trial of acupuncture versus sham acupuncture is a meaningful comparison as sham acupuncture may have some treatment effects similar to true acupuncture and would not be used in clinical practice. Consideration should be given to cluster randomised designs comparing clinics providing a specified package of services for cocaine dependence including acupuncture with clinics providing a similar package without acupuncture.</P>
