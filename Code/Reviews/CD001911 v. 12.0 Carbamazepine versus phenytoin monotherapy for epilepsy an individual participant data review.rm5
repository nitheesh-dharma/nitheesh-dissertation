<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in which recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain. We studied two types of epileptic seizures in this review: generalised onset seizures in which electrical discharges begin in one part of the brain and move throughout the brain, and partial onset seizures in which the seizure is generated in and affects only one part of the brain (the whole hemisphere of the brain or part of a lobe of the brain). For around 70% of people with epilepsy, generalised onset or partial onset seizures can be controlled by a single antiepileptic drug. Worldwide, phenytoin and carbamazepine are commonly used antiepileptic drugs, although carbamazepine is used more commonly in the USA and Europe due to concerns over side effects associated with phenytoin. Phenytoin is still commonly used in low- and middle-income countries in Africa, Asia and South America, because of the low cost of the drug.</P>
<P>
<B>Objective</B>
</P>
<P>For this updated review, we looked at the evidence from 12 randomised controlled clinical trials comparing phenytoin and carbamazepine based on how effective the drugs were at controlling seizures (i.e. whether people went back to having seizures or had long periods of freedom from seizures (remission)), and how tolerable any related side effects of the drugs were.</P>
<P>
<B>Main results</B>
</P>
<P>We were able to combine data for 595 people from four of the 12 trials; for the remaining 597 people from eight trials, information was not available to use in this review. The evidence is current to November 2016.</P>
<P>Results of this review suggest that people with generalised seizures are more likely to withdraw from carbamazepine treatment earlier than from phenytoin treatment, due to seizure recurrence, side effects of the drug, or both, but for people with partial seizures there was no difference in times of withdrawal from treatment between the two drugs. Even though phenytoin is thought to cause more and worse side effects than carbamazepine, we found that twice as many people withdrew from treatment with carbamazepine due to side effects than from treatment with phenytoin.</P>
<P>Results of the review show no difference between carbamazepine and phenytoin for people achieving long periods of seizure freedom (six- or 12-month remission of seizures), or experiencing more seizures after starting treatment.</P>
<P>We judge the evidence from this review to be of low to moderate quality. We recommend that caution is used when interpreting the results of this review, as we were unable to combine the data for all people treated in trials comparing carbamazepine to phenytoin. Also, up to 30% of people in the trials used in our results may have been wrongly classified as having generalised seizures; this may have affected the results of our review.</P>
<P>We recommend that any future trials comparing these drugs, or any other antiepileptic drugs, should be designed using high-quality methods, and that the seizure types of people included in trials should be classified very carefully, to ensure results are of high quality.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-01-31 15:22:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-01-31 15:22:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 2, 2002 and its subsequent updates in 2010 and 2015.</P>
<P>Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which recurrent, unprovoked seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain. It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy with a single antiepileptic drug in monotherapy.</P>
<P>Worldwide, carbamazepine and phenytoin are commonly-used broad spectrum antiepileptic drugs, suitable for most epileptic seizure types. Carbamazepine is a current first-line treatment for partial onset seizures in the USA and Europe. Phenytoin is no longer considered a first-line treatment due to concerns over adverse events associated with its use, but the drug is still commonly used in low- to middle-income countries because of its low cost. No consistent differences in efficacy have been found between carbamazepine and phenytoin in individual trials, although the confidence intervals generated by these studies are wide. Differences in efficacy may therefore be shown by synthesising the data of the individual trials.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-01-10 12:38:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To review the time to withdrawal, six- and 12-month remission, and first seizure with carbamazepine compared to phenytoin, used as monotherapy in people with partial onset seizures (simple partial, complex partial, or secondarily generalised tonic-clonic seizures), or generalised tonic-clonic seizures, with or without other generalised seizure types.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-01-10 12:39:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the latest update we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group&#8217;s Specialised Register (1st November 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO, 1st November 2016), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 1 November 2016), <A HREF="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</A> (1 November 2016), and the World Health Organization (WHO) <A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">International Clinical Trials Registry Platform</A> (ICTRP, 1st November 2016). Previously we also searched SCOPUS (1823 to 16th September 2014) as an alternative to Embase, but this is no longer necessary, because randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials in Embase are now included in CENTRAL. We handsearched relevant journals, contacted pharmaceutical companies, original trial investigators and experts in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-01-10 12:39:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children or adults with partial onset seizures or generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures, comparing carbamazepine monotherapy versus phenytoin monotherapy.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-01-10 12:39:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an individual participant data (IPD) review. Our primary outcome was time to withdrawal of allocated treatment, and our secondary outcomes were time to six-month remission, time to 12-month remission, and time to first seizure post-randomisation. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain study-specific estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the generic inverse variance method to obtain the overall pooled HR and 95% CI.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-11 09:31:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>IPD were available for 595 participants out of 1192 eligible individuals, from four out of 12 trials (i.e. 50% of the potential data). For remission outcomes, HR greater than 1 indicates an advantage for phenytoin; and for first seizure and withdrawal outcomes, HR greater than 1 indicates an advantage for carbamazepine. The methodological quality of the four studies providing IPD was generally good and we rated it at low risk of bias overall in the analyses.</P>
<P>The main overall results (pooled HR adjusted for seizure type) were time to withdrawal of allocated treatment: 1.04 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.39; three trials, 546 participants); time to 12-month remission: 1.01 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.31; three trials, 551 participants); time to six-month remission: 1.11 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.37; three trials, 551 participants); and time to first seizure: 0.85 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.04; four trials, 582 participants). The results suggest no overall statistically significant difference between the drugs for these outcomes. There is some evidence of an advantage for phenytoin for individuals with generalised onset seizures for our primary outcome (time to withdrawal of allocated treatment): pooled HR 0.42 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.96; two trials, 118 participants); and a statistical interaction between treatment effect and epilepsy type (partial versus generalised) for this outcome (P = 0.02). However, misclassification of seizure type for up to 48 individuals (32% of those with generalised epilepsy) may have confounded the results of this review. Despite concerns over side effects leading to the withdrawal of phenytoin as a first-line treatment in the USA and Europe, we found no evidence that phenytoin is more likely to be associated with serious side effects than carbamazepine; 26 individuals withdrew from 290 randomised (9%) to carbamazepine due to adverse effects, compared to 12 out of 299 (4%) randomised to phenytoin from four studies conducted in the USA and Europe (risk ratio (RR) 1.42, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.80, P = 0.014). We rated the quality of the evidence as low to moderate according to GRADE criteria, due to imprecision and potential misclassification of seizure type.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-01-10 12:39:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have not found evidence for a statistically significant difference between carbamazepine and phenytoin for the efficacy outcomes examined in this review, but CIs are wide and we cannot exclude the possibility of important differences. There is no evidence in this review that phenytoin is more strongly associated with serious adverse events than carbamazepine. There is some evidence that people with generalised seizures may be less likely to withdraw early from phenytoin than from carbamazepine, but misclassification of seizure type may have impacted upon our results. We recommend caution when interpreting the results of this review, and do not recommend that our results alone should be used in choosing between carbamazepine and phenytoin. We recommend that future trials should be designed to the highest quality possible, with considerations of allocation concealment and masking, choice of population, choice of outcomes and analysis, and presentation of results.</P>

<P>Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in which recurrent, unprovoked seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain. Epilepsy is a disorder of many heterogeneous seizure types, with an estimated incidence of 33 to 57 per 100,000 person-years worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Annegers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Annegers 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirtz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirtz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olaffsson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olaffsson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sander-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sander 1996</LINK>), accounting for approximately 1% of the global burden of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1994</LINK>). The lifetime risk of epilepsy onset is estimated to be 1300 to 4000 per 100,000 person-years (<LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Juul_x002d_Jenson-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juul-Jenson 1983</LINK>), and the lifetime prevalence could be as large as 70 million people worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Ngugi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ngugi 2010</LINK>). It is believed that with effective drug treatment, up to 70% of individuals with active epilepsy have the potential to become seizure-free and go into long-term remission shortly after starting drug therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cockerell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockerell 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sander-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sander 2004</LINK>), and that around 70% of individuals can achieve seizure freedom using a single antiepileptic drug in monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cockerell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockerell 1995</LINK>); current National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend that both adults and children with epilepsy should be treated by monotherapy wherever possible (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>). The remaining 30% of individuals experience refractory or drug-resistant seizures which often require treatment with combinations of antiepileptic drugs, or alternative treatments such as epilepsy surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Kwan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwan 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>We study two seizure types in this review: generalised onset seizures (generalised tonic-clonic seizures with or without other generalised seizure types), in which electrical discharges begin in one part of the brain and move throughout the brain; and partial onset seizures, in which the seizure is generated in and affects only one part of the brain (the whole hemisphere of the brain or part of a lobe of the brain).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-01-10 12:39:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Carbamazepine and phenytoin are among the most commonly used and earliest drugs licensed for the treatment of epileptic seizures; phenytoin has been used as monotherapy for partial seizures and generalised tonic-clonic seizures for over 50 years (<LINK REF="REF-Gruber-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gruber 1962</LINK>) and carbamazepine for over 30 years (<LINK REF="STD-Shakir-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Shakir 1980</LINK>). Current NICE guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>) for adults and children recommend carbamazepine as a first-line treatment for partial onset seizures and as a second-line treatment for generalised tonic-clonic seizures if first-line treatments sodium valproate and lamotrigine are deemed unsuitable; however, there is evidence that carbamazepine may exacerbate some other generalised seizure types such as myoclonic and absence seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Liporace-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liporace 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shields-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Snead-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snead 1985</LINK>). Phenytoin is no longer considered a first-line treatment in the USA and most of Europe, due to concerns over adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Wallace-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilder-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilder 1995</LINK>), but phenytoin is still used as a first-line drug in low- to middle-income countries (<LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pal-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pal 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both carbamazepine and phenytoin have been shown to have teratogenic effects where the risk is estimated to be two to three times that of the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Gladstone-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gladstone 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meador-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meador 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nulman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nulman 1997</LINK>). Carbamazepine is associated particularly with neural tube defects (<LINK REF="REF-Matlow-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matlow 2012</LINK>) and phenytoin is associated with fetal hydantoin syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Scheinfeld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheinfeld 2003</LINK>), low folic acid levels and megaloblastic anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Carl-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carl 1992</LINK>). Both carbamazepine and phenytoin are associated with an allergic rash (<LINK REF="REF-Tennis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tennis 1997</LINK>) in 5% to 10% of users, which on rare occasions may be life-threatening, and phenytoin is also associated with long-term cosmetic changes including gum hyperplasia, acne and coarsening of the facial features (<LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheinfeld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheinfeld 2003</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-01-10 12:39:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antiepileptic drugs suppress seizures by reducing neuronal excitability. Phenytoin and carbamazepine are broad-spectrum treatments suitable for many seizure types and both have an anticonvulsant mechanism through blocking ion channels, binding with neurotransmitter receptors or through inhibiting the metabolism or reuptake of neurotransmitters (<LINK REF="REF-Ragsdale-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ragsdale 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willow-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willow 1985</LINK>) and the modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA-A) receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Granger-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Granger 1995</LINK>).</P>

<P>The aim of this review is to summarise efficacy and tolerability data from existing trials comparing carbamazepine and phenytoin when used as monotherapy treatments. The adverse event profiles of the two drugs are well documented (see example references from <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of the intervention</LINK>), but no consistent differences in efficacy have been found between the two drugs from a number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) individually (for example: <LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1983</LINK>). Although no clear difference in efficacy has been found from individual studies, the confidence intervals generated by these studies are wide. We cannot exclude important differences in efficacy, which may be shown by synthesising the data of the individual trials.</P>
<P>There are difficulties in undertaking a systematic review of epilepsy monotherapy trials, as the important efficacy outcomes require analysis of time-to-event data (for example, time to first seizure after randomisation). Although methods have been developed to synthesise time-to-event data using summary information (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2002</LINK>), the appropriate statistics are not commonly reported in published epilepsy trials (<LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2013a</LINK>). Furthermore, although seizure data have been collected in most epilepsy monotherapy trials, there has been no uniformity in the definition and reporting of outcomes. For example, trials may report time to 12-month remission but not time to first seizure or vice versa, or some trials may define time to first seizure from the date of randomisation, while others use date of achieving a maintenance dose. Trial investigators have also adopted differing approaches to the analysis, particularly with respect to the censoring of time-to-event data. For these reasons, we performed this review using individual participant data (IPD), which helps to overcome these problems. This review is one in a series of Cochrane IPD Reviews investigating pair-wise monotherapy comparisons. These data have also been included in a network meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Tudur-Smith-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tudur Smith 2007</LINK>), undertaken following a previous version of this review.</P>

<P>For each trial for which we did not obtain IPD, we carried out an assessment to see whether any relevant aggregate-level data had been reported.</P>
<P>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>), seizure data were provided in terms of the number of seizures recorded between each follow-up visit rather than specific dates of seizures. To enable us to calculate time-to-event outcomes, we applied linear interpolation to approximate dates of seizures between follow-up visits, assuming a uniform seizure rate. For example, if four seizures were recorded between two visits which occurred on 1st March 1990 and 1st May 1990 (an interval of 61 days), then the date of first seizure would be approximately 13th March 1990 (i.e. 61 days divided by number of seizures plus 1 rounded to the next day, i.e. 13 days). This allowed us to compute an estimate of the time to six-month remission, 12-month remission, and the time to first seizure.</P>
<P>We calculated time to six-month and 12-month remission from the date of randomisation to the date (or estimated date) the individual had first been free of seizures for six or 12 months respectively. If the person had one or more seizures in the titration period, a six-month or 12-month seizure-free period could also occur between the estimated date of the last seizure in the titration period and the estimated date of the first seizure in the maintenance period.</P>
<P>We calculated time to first seizure from the date of randomisation to the date that their first seizure was estimated to have occurred. If seizure data were missing for a particular visit, we censored these outcomes at the previous visit. We also censored these outcomes if the individual died or if follow-up ceased prior to the occurrence of the event of interest. These methods had been used in the remaining three trials (<LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>) for which outcome data (dates of seizures after randomisation) were provided directly.</P>
<P>In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>), all participants completed the 12-week trial duration without withdrawing from the study. For three trials (<LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>) we extracted dates and reason for treatment withdrawal from trial case report forms for the original review. Two review authors (SJN and CT) independently extracted data from all case report forms, resolving disagreements by reconsidering the case report forms at conference. For the remaining trials, data on length of time spent in trial and reason for withdrawal of allocated treatment were provided directly. For the analysis of time to event, we defined an 'event' as either the withdrawal of the allocated treatment due to poor seizure control, or adverse events, or both. We also classified non-compliance with the treatment regimen or the addition of another antiepileptic drug as 'events'. We censored the outcome if treatment was withdrawn because the individual achieved a period of remission, or if the individual was still on allocated treatment at the end of follow-up.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2017-01-10 12:40:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out our analysis on an intention-to-treat basis (that is, analysing participants in the group to which they were randomised, irrespective of which treatment they actually received). For the time-to-event outcomes 'Time to six-month remission', 'Time to 12-month remission' and 'Time to first seizure post-randomisation', participants were therefore not censored if the treatment initially assigned was withdrawn.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we investigated the relationship between the time-to-event and treatment effect of the antiepileptic drugs. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to obtain study-specific estimates of log (HR) or treatment effect and associated standard errors in statistical software SAS version 9.2 (Copyright, SAS Institute Inc. SAS and all other SAS Institute Inc. product or service names are registered trademarks or trademarks of SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA.). The model assumes that the ratio of hazards (risks) between the two treatment groups is constant over time (i.e. hazards are proportional). We tested this proportional hazards assumption of the Cox regression model for each outcome of each study by testing the statistical significance of a time-varying covariate in the model. We also inspected Kaplan-Meier plots for overlapping of curves, which can indicate departures from proportional hazards. We evaluated overall estimates of HRs (with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) using the generic inverse variance method. We expressed results as a hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CIs.</P>
<P>By convention, a HR greater than 1 indicates that an event is more likely to occur earlier with carbamazepine than with phenytoin. Hence, for time to withdrawal of allocated treatment or time to first seizure, a HR greater than 1 indicates a clinical advantage for phenytoin (e.g. HR = 1.2 would suggest a 20% increase in the risk of withdrawal from carbamazepine compared to phenytoin) and for time to six-month and 12-month remission a HR greater than 1 indicates a clinical advantage for carbamazepine.</P>
<P>We used GRADE (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2004</LINK>) quality assessment criteria in the 'Summary of findings' tables.</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-01-10 12:40:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to the strong clinical belief that some antiepileptic drugs are more effective in some seizure types than others (see <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of the intervention</LINK> and <LINK TAG="THEORY" TYPE="SECTION">How the intervention might work</LINK>), we have stratified all analyses by seizure type (partial onset versus generalised onset), according to the classification of main seizure type at baseline. We classified partial seizures (simple or complex) and partial secondarily generalised seizures as partial epilepsy. We classified primarily generalised seizures as generalised epilepsy. To statistically assess an association between treatment and seizure type we conducted a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test of interaction between treatment and epilepsy type.</P>
<P>If we found significant statistical heterogeneity to be present, we performed meta-analysis with a random-effects model in addition to a fixed-effect model, presenting the results of both models and performing sensitivity analyses to investigate differences in study characteristics.</P>
</SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS>
<SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-01-10 12:40:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Misclassification of seizure type is a recognised problem in epilepsy, whereby some people with generalised seizures have been mistakenly classed as having partial onset seizures, and vice versa. There is clinical evidence that individuals with generalised onset seizures are unlikely to have an 'age of onset' greater than 25 to 30 years (<LINK REF="REF-Malafosse-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malafosse 1994</LINK>). In a previous review, in our series of pair-wise reviews for monotherapy in epilepsy, misclassification impacted upon the results (<LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2013b</LINK>). Given the overlap with studies contributing to this review and the phenytoin versus sodium valproate review (<LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2013b</LINK>), we suspected that misclassification of seizure type could also be likely in this review, and so we examined the distribution of age at onset for individuals with generalised seizures.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK> was a paediatric study and <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK> recruited participants with partial seizures only, so there were no participants with new-onset generalised seizures over the age of 30 in these studies. Twenty-nine out of 72 individuals (42%) with generalised onset seizures were over the age of 30 in <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>, and 19 out of 29 individuals (66%) with generalised onset seizures were over the age of 30 in <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>. Therefore out of 150 participants from the four studies providing IPD, 48 (32%) may have been wrongly classified as having new-onset generalised seizures.</P>

Such a design is unlikely to be appropriate for monotherapy treatment, due to carry-over effects from one treatment period into another (participants were also treated during washout periods with their "regular medication"), and such a design does not allow long-term outcomes such as the time-to-event outcomes of interest to us in this review.

<P>For this outcome, a HR greater than one indicates a clinical advantage for carbamazepine.</P>
<P>Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment and reason for withdrawal were available for 546 participants from three of the four trials providing IPD (99% of 558 participants from <LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK> (see <LINK TAG="INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Included studies</LINK>), and 45.8% of the 1192 participants from the 12 included studies). Although two participants withdrew from allocated treatment (one in each group) in <LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>, a reason for withdrawal was not available and could not be determined from the case notes. Similarly in <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>, for one participant taking carbamazepine, the reason for withdrawal was not available and could not be determined from case notes. Also in <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>, two participants (both on phenytoin) had reasons for treatment withdrawal recorded but no date of withdrawal. We have not included the five participants with missing reasons for withdrawal or withdrawal dates from the two trials in analysis of time to withdrawal of allocated treatment. Sufficient IPD were available in the published report for a further 43 participants from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Forsythe-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Forsythe 1991</LINK>). Therefore, 589 participants from four trials were available for the analysis of this outcome (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>350 participants prematurely withdrew from treatment (59%): 172 out of 290 participants randomised to carbamazepine (59%) and 178 out of 299 participants randomised to phenytoin (60%). See <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> for reasons for premature termination of allocated treatment (by treatment) and how we classified these withdrawals in analysis. We deemed 210 participants (36%) to have withdrawn for reasons related to the study drug, 103 (36%) on carbamazepine and 107 (36%) on phenytoin, and we classified these withdrawals as 'events' in analysis. We classified the other 140 withdrawals as not related to the study drug and censored these participants in analysis, in addition to those who completed the study without withdrawing.</P>
<P>The overall pooled HR (for 589 participants in four trials) was 0.99 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.30, P = 0.92), indicating no advantage for either drug. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between trials (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 2.73, degrees of freedom (df) = 3, P = 0.44, I<SUP>2</SUP>= 0%, see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).

<P>Phenytoin is no longer considered as a first-line treatment in much of the USA and Europe, due to concerns around adverse events (see <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of the intervention</LINK>). <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> shows that 26 out of 172 participants (15%) who withdrew from carbamazepine and 12 out of 178 participants (7%) who withdrew from phenytoin withdrew from the study due to adverse events; in other words, statistically significantly more participants withdrew from carbamazepine than from phenytoin due to adverse events in four studies conducted in the USA and Europe ( P = 0.012).</P>
<P>Withdrawal data for 43 participants extracted from <LINK REF="STD-Forsythe-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Forsythe 1991</LINK> did not distinguish between epilepsy type (partial onset or generalised onset) and therefore could not be included in the meta-analysis stratified by epilepsy type.</P>
<P>The overall pooled HR (adjusted by epilepsy type for 546 participants in three trials) was 1.04 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.39, P = 0.79), again indicating no clear advantage for either drug, and there was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between trials (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 5.86, df = 4, P = 0.21, I<SUP>2</SUP>= 32%, see <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). This result is similar to the unadjusted pooled HR (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) and conclusions remain unchanged following the exclusion of 43 individuals (<LINK REF="STD-Forsythe-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Forsythe 1991</LINK>) in the stratified analysis.</P>
<P>For participants with partial onset seizures (n = 428, three trials), the pooled HR was 1.18 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.60, P = 0.30), indicating an advantage for carbamazepine, which is not statistically significant. For participants with generalised onset seizures (n = 118, two trials), the pooled HR was 0.42 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.96, P = 0.04), indicating a statistically significant advantage for phenytoin. We found a statistically significant interaction between seizure type (generalised versus partial onset) and treatment effect (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 5.18, df = 1, P = 0.02, I<SUP>2</SUP>= 80.7%).</P>
<P>We conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of potential seizure misclassification on results for the 29 participants aged 30 years or older with new-onset generalised seizures in <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK> (see <LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>). Following reclassification, for the remaining participants with generalised onset seizures (89) the pooled HR was 0.51 (95% CI 0.21 to 1.24, P = 0.14), which still indicates an advantage for phenytoin, but this advantage is no longer statistically significant. Reclassifying these 29 participants as having new-onset partial seizures, the pooled HR for 517 participants is 1.11 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.50, P = 0.50), indicating a slight advantage for carbamazepine, which is not statistically significant. Following reclassification, the interaction between seizure type (generalised versus partial onset) and treatment effect is no longer statistically significant (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 2.16, df = 1, P = 0.10, I<SUP>2</SUP>= 62.3%). Results were similar when the 29 participants were reclassified as uncertain seizure type (see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given that subgroup sizes are unbalanced (118 with generalised seizures and 428 with partial seizures (as classified by the studies)) and that results may be confounded by misclassification of seizure type in up to 29 participants, we cannot draw any firm conclusions about an association between treatment and seizure type (i.e. that participants with partial seizures are less likely to withdraw from phenytoin and participants with generalised seizures are less likely to withdraw from carbamazepine). We require more evidence, particularly from individuals with correctly classified generalised onset seizures to inform this analysis.</P>
<P>We judged evidence for 'Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment' to be of moderate quality according to GRADE criteria, due to the potential impact of misclassification of seizure type on the results (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>For this outcome, a HR greater than one indicates a clinical advantage for phenytoin.</P>
<P>Data for 551 participants (99% of 558 randomised participants from <LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK> (see <LINK TAG="INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Included studies</LINK>) and 45.8% of the 1192 participants from the 12 included studies) from three out of four trials providing IPD were available for the analysis of this outcome.

<P>Two hundred and eighty-nine out of 551 participants (52%) achieved 12-month remission: 155 out of 282 (55%) on phenytoin and 134 out of 269 (50%) on carbamazepine. The overall pooled HR (for 551 participants, three trials) was 0.99 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.25, P = 0.95), suggesting no advantage for either drug. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity between trials (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 1.49, df = 2, P = 0.47, I<SUP>2</SUP>= 0%, see <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Substantial statistical heterogeneity was present between the trials for generalised onset seizures (I<SUP>2</SUP>= 73%, P = 0.06), so we calculated HRs using the random-effects model. For participants with partial onset seizures (n = 430, three trials), the pooled HR was 0.94 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.25, P = 0.68, random-effects), indicating no clear advantage for either drug. For participants with generalised onset seizures (n = 121, two trials), the pooled HR was 1.17 (95% CI 0.53 to 2.57, P = 0.70, random-effects), indicating an advantage for phenytoin, which is not statistically significant. Overall, the pooled HR (adjusted for seizure type for 551 participants, three trials) was 1.01 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.31, P = 0.93, random-effects), suggesting no clear advantage for either drug (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). The test for interaction between seizure type (generalised versus partial onset) and treatment effect was not significant (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.25, df = 1, P = 0.62, I<SUP>2</SUP>= 0%).</P>
<P>Following reclassification of the 29 participants aged 30 years or older with new-onset generalised seizures in <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK> (see <LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>), the pooled HR for 92 participants with generalised onset seizures was 1.44 (95% CI 0.90 to 2.31, P = 0.32, I<SUP>2</SUP>= 0%, calculated with fixed-effect model), showing that all of the heterogeneity in <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK> is explained by misclassification of participants with generalised onset seizures. The pooled estimate for individuals with partial onset seizures and the overall estimate for all participants stratified by seizure type were similar to the original analysis, and our conclusions remain unchanged (see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>, there is an indication that the proportional hazards assumption may be violated (see <LINK TAG="DATA_SYNTHESIS" TYPE="SECTION">Data synthesis</LINK>); the P value of time-varying covariate is 0.051 and visual inspection of the cumulative incidence plot (<LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK>) shows crossing of the curves at around 2500 days. In other words, up to 2500 days, participants on phenytoin seem to be achieving 12-month remission quicker than those on carbamazepine, but this changes after 2500 days; however, participant numbers are small (15 participants at risk out of 108 randomised), so small changes may be magnified at this time.</P>
<P>As a sensitivity analysis, we fitted a piecewise Cox regression model to investigate any change in treatment effect over time, assuming proportional hazards within each interval. From the visual inspection of <LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK>, the follow-up period of <LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK> is split into two intervals; 0 to 2500 days and over 2500 days (maximum follow-up was 4163 days). We can estimate separate HRs for each interval as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>For the interval 0 to 2500 days (88 events in 108 participants at risk) the HR is 1.29 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.96, P = 0.23), suggesting an advantage for phenytoin, which is not statistically significant.</LI>
<LI>For the interval over 2500 days (five events in 15 participants at risk) the HR is 0.63 (95% CI 0.25 to 1.57, P = 0.32), suggesting an advantage for carbamazepine, which is not statistically significant.</LI>
</UL>
<P>These results suggest some indication of a change in treatment effect over time, with an advantage for phenytoin earlier on in the study, changing to an advantage for carbamazepine later in the study. However, CIs of estimates are wide, particularly for the HR after 2500 days due to small numbers of events and participants at risk, so we do not have statistically significant evidence to support the hypothesis of a change in treatment effect over time for <LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>, and conclude that the change of direction in effect at around 2500 days is likely to be due to small participant numbers after this time.</P>
<P>We judged the evidence for 'Time to 12-month remission' to be of low to moderate quality according to GRADE criteria, due to the potential impact of misclassification of seizure type on the results and heterogeneity between studies (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>

<P>Three hundred and thirty-eight out of 551 participants (61%) achieved six-month remission: 179 out of 282 (63%) on phenytoin and 159 out of 269 (59%) on carbamazepine. The overall pooled HR (for 551 participants, three trials) was 1.08 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.34, P = 0.46), suggesting no clear advantage for either drug.

Less statistical heterogeneity was present between the trials for generalised onset seizures compared to the analysis of time to 12-month remission (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 39%, P = 0.20), so we present HRs from a fixed-effect model. Overall, the pooled HR (adjusted for epilepsy type for 551 participants, three trials) was 1.11 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.37, P = 0.36, three trials), suggesting a slight advantage for phenytoin, which is not statistically significant. The test for interaction between seizure type (generalised versus partial onset) and treatment effect was not significant (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 1.03, df = 1, P = 0.31, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 3.4%, see <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>

Reclassifying these 29 participants as having new-onset partial seizures, the pooled HR for 517 participants is 1.02 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.31), similar to <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>, indicating no clear advantage for either drug. Following reclassification, the test for interaction between seizure type (generalised versus partial onset) and treatment effect was borderline statistically significant (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 3.63, df = 1, P = 0.06, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 72.5%). Results were similar when the 29 participants were reclassified as uncertain seizure type (see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, as in the analysis of our primary outcome 'Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', as subgroup sizes are unbalanced (118 with generalised seizures and 428 with partial seizures, as classified by the studies) and as results may be confounded by misclassification of seizure type in up to 29 participants, we cannot draw any firm conclusions about an association between treatment and seizure type (i.e. that participants achieve six-month remission quicker on phenytoin than on carbamazepine).

<P>Three hundred and eighty-three out of 582 participants (66%) experienced a recurrence of seizures: 192 out of 297 (64%) on phenytoin and 191 out of 285 on carbamazepine (67%). The overall pooled HR (for 582 participants, four trials) was 0.88 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.08, P = 0.21), suggesting a slight advantage for phenytoin, which is not statistically significant.

For the participants with generalised onset seizures (n = 150, three trials), the pooled HR was 0.84 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.24, P = 0.38), again indicating a slight advantage for phenytoin, which is not statistically significant.

Unlike in analysis of 'Time to 12-month remission', heterogeneity for participants with generalised onset seizures in <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK> is barely reduced following reclassification of seizure type (I<SUP>2 </SUP>is reduced from 45% to 42% following reclassification).</P>
<P>Following visual inspection of the forest plot in <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK> (generalised epilepsy type), there is a difference in the direction of effects of the three studies, with <LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> showing an advantage for phenytoin, which is not statistically significant, and <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK> showing a slight advantage for carbamazepine, which is not statistically significant).</P>
<P>From correspondence with the study authors, we know that <LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK> were conducted under the same protocol and therefore trial characteristics should be homogeneous; the only difference between the two studies is within the age groups recruited (<LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK> recruited children only and <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK> recruited adults only). We therefore performed a further subgroup analysis by adult versus paediatric studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> also recruited adults only). For 101 adults with generalised onset seizures, the pooled HR was 1.02 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.68, P = 0.94), indicating no clear advantage for either drug, and for 49 children with generalised onset seizures in <LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK> the HR was 0.63 (95% CI 0.34 to 1.16, P = 0.14), indicating an advantage for phenytoin, which is not statistically significant.</P>
<P>The test for interaction between age groups recruited (adults versus children) and treatment effect was not significant (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 1.45, df = 1, P = 0.23, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 30.9%). However, participant numbers with generalised onset seizures are quite limited in this review, so we may not have had the power to detect a difference between age groups.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> there is an indication that the proportional hazards assumption may be violated (see <LINK TAG="DATA_SYNTHESIS" TYPE="SECTION">Data synthesis</LINK>); the P value of time-varying covariate is 0.02 and visual inspection of the cumulative incidence plot (<LINK REF="FIG-14" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 14</LINK>) shows clear crossing of the curves at around 10 days. In other words, up to 10 days, more participants seem to be having seizure recurrence on phenytoin, but this changes to those on carbamazepine after 10 days.</P>
<P>As a sensitivity analysis, we fitted a piecewise Cox regression model to investigate any change in treatment effect over time, assuming proportional hazards within each interval. From the visual inspection of <LINK REF="FIG-14" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 14</LINK>, the follow-up period of <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> is split into two intervals; 0 to 10 days and over 10 days (maximum follow-up is 84 days). We can estimate separate HRs for each interval as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>For the interval 0 to 10 days (13 events in 37 participants at risk) the HR is 1.49 (95% CI 0.45 to 4.88, P = 0.51), suggesting an advantage for carbamazepine, which is not statistically significant.</LI>
<LI>For intervals over 10 days (eight events in 24 participants at risk) the HR is 32 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.91, P = 0.03), suggesting a large statistically significant advantage for phenytoin. Visual inspection of <LINK REF="FIG-14" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 14</LINK> also shows a clear advantage for phenytoin after 10 days.</LI>
</UL>
<P>These results suggest some indication of a change in treatment effect over time, with a slight early advantage for carbamazepine, changing to a large statistically significant advantage for phenytoin later in the study, and support the hypothesis of a change in treatment effect over time for <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> is by far the shortest of the studies for which we have IPD (maximum follow-up was 84 days in <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> compared to maximum follow-up of 3995 days in <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>, 4589 days in <LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK> and 1838 days in <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>), and we did not find statistically significant evidence of a difference between carbamazepine and phenytoin for 'Time to first seizure after randomisation' in any of the three studies with a longer duration (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). The apparent large advantage for phenytoin from 10 to 84 days in <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>, may therefore have reduced in size or even changed direction to favour carbamazepine if this study had continued for a longer duration.</P>
<P>We judged evidence for 'Time to first seizure after randomisation' to be of low to moderate quality according to GRADE criteria, due to the potential impact of misclassification of seizure type on the results and imprecision of the effect sizes (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).</P>

<P>Because of the differences in methods of reporting adverse event data across the studies (see <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>), it is difficult to summarise the 'most common' adverse events overall across the 12 studies, or to deduce whether carbamazepine or phenytoin are most associated with specific adverse events. Adverse event data for individuals were not included in the original IPD requests for earlier versions of this review, but will be sought in all future IPD requests.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-11 10:47:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review demonstrate a statistically significant advantage for phenytoin over carbamazepine for the 118 individuals with new-onset generalised tonic-clonic seizures for the primary global outcome 'Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment'; however, this result is likely to have been confounded by misclassification of seizure type for 29 individuals and when this misclassification is taken into account in sensitivity analysis, the advantage for phenytoin is no longer statistically significant. Results for 428 individuals with new-onset partial seizures suggest an advantage for carbamazepine, which is not statistically significant. Overall, for the 546 individuals contributing withdrawal data to this review, we found no statistically significant evidence for a difference between carbamazepine and phenytoin.</P>
<P>Results of this review also show that among 589 participants recruited in the USA and Europe, carbamazepine is around twice as likely to be withdrawn than phenytoin for adverse events, despite concerns about serious adverse events leading to the replacement of phenytoin with carbamazepine or lamotrigine as a first-line drug for partial onset seizures across much of the USA and Europe (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our primary outcome is a measure of effectiveness influenced by both the relative efficacy of the two drugs and differences in tolerability and safety, so a difference in efficacy in one direction may be confounded by a difference in tolerability in the other. It may therefore not be surprising that any estimated differences are small, and the results of this review cannot exclude clinically important differences between the drugs and between seizure types. Furthermore, the largest study, contributing over 60% of participants to the analysis of our primary outcome, recruited participants with partial onset seizures only, so the subgroups of participants by seizure type are unbalanced in size (428 participants with partial seizures versus 118 with generalised seizures), resulting in less precise results and wide CIs for individuals with generalised onset seizures.</P>
<P>Similarly for the secondary outcomes 'Time to 12-month remission', 'Time to six-month remission', and 'Time to first seizure', we found no statistically significant differences between phenytoin and carbamazepine, for participants overall or by seizure type. However, subgroups of participants by seizure type are again unbalanced in size, and misclassification of seizure types may have confounded analyses. More evidence is needed, particularly from individuals with correctly classified generalised seizures, to inform all of the outcomes of this review.</P>
<P>For all outcomes in this review we would recommend caution in the interpretation of the results (see <LINK TAG="APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS" TYPE="SECTION">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</LINK>), and we would not recommend basing a choice between these two drugs on the results of this review alone.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-01-10 12:42:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We believe our systematic electronic searches identified all relevant evidence for this review. We have gratefully received individual participant data (IPD) for 595 individuals (50% of individuals from all eligible trials) from the authors of four trials (<LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>), which included a comparison of phenytoin versus carbamazepine for the treatment of epilepsy. However, 574 individuals (48%) from seven relevant trials (<LINK REF="STD-Callaghan-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Callaghan 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Czapinski-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Czapinski 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miura-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miura 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pulliainen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pulliainen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ravi-Sudhir-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ravi Sudhir 1995</LINK>) could not be included in any analysis as IPD were not available and outcomes of interest were not reported in the published reports. Sufficient data for 23 individuals (2%) were published in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Forsythe-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Forsythe 1991</LINK>) to contribute to analysis for the primary outcome 'Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment', but insufficient data were available to include these individuals in the analyses by seizure type and the analyses of other outcomes. Having to exclude data from half of eligible participants due to lack of IPD and insufficient reporting in study publications is likely to have impacted on the applicability of the evidence, but it is difficult to quantify exactly how large this impact was on the results of this review (see <LINK TAG="POTENTIAL_BIASES" TYPE="SECTION">Potential biases in the review process</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials contributing around 80% of the participant data to this review recruited adults only (<LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>); the remaining study was a paediatric trial (<LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>). Also, the largest single trial contributing over half of the participant data to this review (<LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>) recruited individuals with partial onset seizures only, so that only around 25% of participants included in this review were experiencing generalised onset seizures. Furthermore, there is evidence within this review to suggest that up to 30% of individuals with new-onset generalised seizures may have had their seizure type misclassified. For these reasons, the results of this review may not be fully generalisable to children or to individuals with generalised onset seizures, and more evidence is required from participants with generalised seizure types.</P>

<P>The four trials for which IPD were available were generally at low risk of bias (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Three of the trials contributing around half of the participant data to this review described adequate methods of randomisation and allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>), but the largest single trial contributing 54% of participant data (<LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>) did not describe the method of randomisation and allocation concealment used, and this information was not available from study authors. We are uncertain whether this lack of information has impacted on the results of this review. See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK> for GRADE assessments of the quality of the evidence.</P>
<P>Two of the trials providing IPD blinded participants and outcome assessors (<LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>) and the other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>) were designed as pragmatic open-label trials, as masking of treatment would not be &#8220;practicable or ethical", would &#8220;undermine compliance&#8221; and would have &#8220;introduced bias due to a very large drop-out rate.&#8221; For the three trials providing withdrawal information, the withdrawal rate in the double-blinded trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK>) was 40%, and withdrawal rates were 36% and 24% in <LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK> respectively (29.5% withdrawal rate overall in the two open-label studies, which is statistically significantly lower than the withdrawal rate in the double-blind study; P = 0.009). It is therefore debatable whether a double-blind design is the most appropriate for trials of monotherapy in epilepsy of long duration and whether such a design does have an impact upon the dropout rate and therefore on the results of the trial.</P>
<P>Further differences between the studies were in the population recruited (age of participants and seizure types). We discuss these differences below in <LINK TAG="APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS" TYPE="SECTION">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</LINK>.</P>
<P>Trials for which no IPD were available were generally of poorer quality than those for which we were had IPD, with two studies describing inadequate methods of randomisation or allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Callaghan-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Callaghan 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forsythe-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Forsythe 1991</LINK>), three trials presenting incomplete outcome data following exclusion of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Pulliainen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pulliainen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramsay-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ramsay 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ravi-Sudhir-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ravi Sudhir 1995</LINK>), one study using an inadequate cross-over design for investigating monotherapy treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino 1974</LINK>), and two trials providing very limited information on trial methodology, available only in abstract or summary form (<LINK REF="STD-Czapinski-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Czapinski 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miura-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miura 1993</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-01-11 10:56:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We were provided with IPD for 595 out of 1192 eligible participants (50%) from four out of 12 studies included; we conducted all analyses as IPD analyses. Such an approach has many advantages, such as allowing us to standardise definitions of outcomes across trials, and attrition and reporting biases being reduced as we can perform additional analyses and calculate additional outcomes from unpublished data. For the outcomes we used in this review which are of a time-to-event nature, an IPD approach is considered to be the &#8216;gold standard&#8217; approach to analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, despite the advantages of this approach, for reasons out of our control we were not able to obtain IPD for 597 participants from eight eligible studies and no aggregate data were available for our outcomes of interest in study publications. We therefore had to exclude around half of eligible participants from our analyses, which may have introduced bias into the review.</P>
<P>From the results reported in these eight studies (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for narrative description of the results of each study), only one study showed a statistically significant difference in efficacy between carbamazepine and phenytoin for participants with generalised onset seizures (73% seizure-free with phenytoin versus 39% seizure-free with carbamazepine, <LINK REF="STD-Callaghan-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Callaghan 1985</LINK>). There was no difference between treatments for participants with partial onset seizures (P = 0.006). Some significant differences between carbamazepine and phenytoin in terms of specific adverse events and cognitive adverse events were also reported (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). However, no consistent differences in efficacy or tolerability were reported in these eight studies, so it is unclear whether the exclusion of these studies from our meta-analysis has impacted upon our results and conclusions. Furthermore, six of the eight studies that we could not include in meta-analysis were at high risk of bias for at least one methodological aspect (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), so inclusion of these data may have introduced bias into our results.</P>
<P>We have good evidence from previous reviews conducted by the Cochrane Epilepsy Group (<LINK REF="REF-Marson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2013b</LINK>) that misclassification of seizure type is an important issue in epilepsy trials. We believe that the results of the original trials and hence the results of this meta-analysis may have been confounded by classification bias, particularly the 48 individuals from two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>) classified with new-onset generalised seizures over the age of 30 (<LINK REF="REF-Malafosse-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malafosse 1994</LINK>). Sensitivity analysis to investigate potential misclassification of these 48 individuals changes our conclusion for two outcomes ('Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment' and 'Time to six-month remission'), and explains all heterogeneity among individuals with generalised onset seizures for the outcome 'Time to 12-month remission'. Both studies with potentially misclassified participants used the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification of 1981 (<LINK REF="REF-Commission-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Commission 1981</LINK>) to classify generalised onset and partial onset seizures. <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK> was initiated before the publication of the revised ILAE classification in 1989 (<LINK REF="REF-Commission-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Commission 1989</LINK>), so some individuals in <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK> may have been classified correctly according to Commission 1981 but misclassified by the revised Commission 1989. <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK> was initiated around 10 years after the publication of <LINK REF="REF-Commission-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Commission 1989</LINK>, but this study was conducted in Nigeria, a low-income country without access to the same facilities as trials conducted in the USA and Europe; seizure types were therefore classified clinically, and electroencephalographs (EEGs)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were not required for diagnosis of epilepsy. Clinical classification may have contributed to potential misclassification in this study.</P>
<P>Finally, we made some assumptions in the statistical methodology used in this review. Firstly, when we received only follow-up dates and seizure frequencies, we used linear interpolation to estimate seizure times. We are aware that an individual's seizure patterns may be non-linear; we therefore recommend caution when interpreting the numerical results of the seizure-related outcomes.</P>
<P>Further, the statistical methodology used in this review made an assumption that the treatment effect for each outcome did not change over time (proportional hazards assumption, see <LINK TAG="DATA_SYNTHESIS" TYPE="SECTION">Data synthesis</LINK>). For three of the outcomes, there was evidence that this assumption may have been violated for one of the trials. Sensitivity analysis showed that changes in treatment effect tended to occur in the later stages of the studies when small participant numbers were being followed up, so small changes in treatment effect would be magnified. However, we are aware that in studies of long duration (<LINK REF="STD-De-Silva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">De Silva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heller-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Heller 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mattson 1985</LINK> followed up participants for between three and 10 years), the assumption of treatment effect remaining constant over time is unlikely to be appropriate, so if more data can be made available to us for updates of this review, we would like to perform statistical analyses which allow for treatment effects to vary over time.</P>

<P>No single trial included in this review has found convincing differences between phenytoin and carbamazepine with respect to seizure control or seizure type. However, CIs around estimates have been wide and equivalence cannot be inferred. Furthermore, this systematic review and meta-analysis has not found any statistically significant differences between phenytoin and carbamazepine for any of the outcome measures for all included participants. The results of this review suggest a potential advantage for phenytoin over carbamazepine for our primary global outcome 'Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment' for individuals with generalised onset seizures, but this result may have been confounded by misclassification of seizure type.</P>
<P>To our knowledge, this is the only systematic review and meta-analysis which compares phenytoin and carbamazepine monotherapies for partial onset seizures and generalised onset tonic-clonic seizures. A network meta-analysis has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Tudur-Smith-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tudur Smith 2007</LINK>), comparing all direct and indirect evidence from phenytoin, carbamazepine and other standard and new antiepileptic drugs licensed for monotherapy, and found no statistically significant differences between phenytoin and carbamazepine for the outcomes specified in this review; this agrees with the findings of this review. The network meta-analysis is currently being updated to include more recently published studies such as <LINK REF="STD-Ogunrin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ogunrin 2005</LINK>, so we will compare the results of this review with the updated network meta-analysis.</P>

<P>Current guidelines recommend carbamazepine or lamotrigine as first-line treatment for adults and children with new-onset partial seizures and sodium valproate for adults and children with new-onset generalised seizures (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results of this systematic review do not provide any conclusive evidence for a difference between carbamazepine and phenytoin in terms of efficacy for individuals with partial onset or generalised onset seizures. Phenytoin is no longer considered to be a first-line treatment in the USA and Europe, due to concerns over adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Wallace-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilder-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilder 1995</LINK>), but the results of this review show that among 589 participants from four studies conducted in the USA and Europe carbamazepine was around twice as likely to be withdrawn as phenytoin due to adverse events. Furthermore, from a study conducted in Africa (Nigeria), where phenytoin is still commonly used as a first-line treatment due to low cost, no participants withdrew from either carbamazepine or phenytoin due to adverse events. The results of this review provide no evidence in favour of the withdrawal of phenytoin as a first-line treatment.</P>
<P>The results of this review do not provide sufficient evidence to choose between carbamazepine and phenytoin for the treatment of partial onset or generalised onset seizures.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-01-10 12:47:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found few consistent differences in efficacy between the two standard antiepileptic drugs in individual trials and from the pooled results of this review. If differences in efficacy do exist across heterogeneous populations of individuals such as those studied here, then it is likely that these differences are small. It has been argued that future comparative antiepileptic drug trials should be powered to establish equivalence (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1996</LINK>), and therefore be capable of detecting what is considered to be the smallest important clinical difference.</P>
<P>This review highlights the need for future antiepileptic drug monotherapy trials that recruit individuals of all ages with specific epilepsy syndromes, to be designed and powered to detect a difference between particular antiepileptic drugs. An approach likely to reflect and inform clinical practice, as well as being statistically powerful, would be to recruit heterogeneous populations for whom epilepsy syndromes have been adequately defined, with testing for interactions between treatment and epilepsy syndrome. In view of the potential problems of misclassification, syndromes will have to be well defined, with adequate checking mechanisms to ensure that classifications are accurate, and with a system to recognise uncertainty surrounding epilepsy syndromes in individuals within trials.</P>
<P>Consideration is also required in the design of a trial about whether to blind participants and outcome assessors to treatment allocation. Results of this review show that withdrawal rates are higher in a double-blind trial compared to open-label, more pragmatic trials. However, in trials involving drugs with documented adverse event profiles, such as phenytoin, masking of treatment may be important to avoid preconceptions about the drug being more likely to be associated with serious adverse events, which were not shown in the results of this review.</P>
<P>The choice of outcomes at the design stage of a trial, and the presentation of the results of outcomes, particularly of a time-to event nature, require very careful consideration. While an outcome measuring efficacy (seizure control), and an outcome measuring tolerability (adverse events) are recorded in the majority of studies of a monotherapy design, there is little uniformity between the definition of the outcomes and the reporting of the summary statistics related to the outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2013a</LINK>), making an aggregate data approach to meta-analysis in reviews of monotherapy studies impossible. Where trial authors cannot or will not make IPD available for analysis, we are left with no choice but to exclude a proportion of relevant evidence from the review, which will impact upon the interpretation of results of the review and applicability of the evidence and conclusions. The International League Against Epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Commission-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Commission 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ILAE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILAE 2006</LINK>) recommends that studies of a monotherapy design should adopt a primary effectiveness outcome of 'Time to withdrawal of allocated treatment (retention time)' and should be of at least 48 weeks duration to allow for assessment of longer-term outcomes such as remission. If studies followed these recommendations, an aggregate data approach to meta-analysis may be feasible, reducing the resources and time required for an IPD approach.</P>
<P>A network meta-analysis has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Tudur-Smith-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tudur Smith 2007</LINK>), comparing all direct and indirect evidence from phenytoin, carbamazepine and other standard and new antiepileptic drugs licensed for monotherapy. This review and the network meta-analysis will be updated as more information becomes available. However, we acknowledge that as phenytoin is no longer considered to be a first-line agent for newly-diagnosed individuals, (with newer agents such as lamotrigine and levetiracetam replacing its use), it is unlikely that substantial new evidence will become available for this review.</P>
