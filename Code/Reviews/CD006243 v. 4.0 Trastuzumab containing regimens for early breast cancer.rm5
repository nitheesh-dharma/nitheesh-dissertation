<TITLE MODIFIED="2011-01-10 01:51:20 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Efficacy and safety of trastuzumab in early breast cancer</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-17 09:41:58 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Valentina ">
<P>Patients with early breast cancer may have HER2-positive or -negative tumours. HER2-positive cancers tend to be more aggressive. Knowing whether a cancer has high levels of the HER2 protein (about one in five breast cancers) influences the choice of treatment. Trastuzumab (brand name Herceptin) is a drug specifically available for these patients. The aim of the cancer treatment is to eliminate micrometastases at an early stage (i.e. adjuvant) so that more women survive without recurrence of the disease.</P>
<P>The review includes eight trials that involved 11,991 women with HER2-positive operable breast cancer who were assigned by chance to receive trastuzumab or not. Trastuzumab is always paired with a standard chemotherapy as starting treatment but it can also be continued alone or with hormone-blocking medications, such as an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen. Women were followed by clinicians for several years (three on average). The review found that trastuzumab significantly reduced recurrence and mortality. Some patients in treatment develop severe heart toxicity (i.e. congestive heart failure (CHF)). Breast cancer mortality is reduced by one-third but the risk of heart toxicity is five times more likely for women receiving trastuzumab than women receiving standard therapy alone. If 1000 women were given standard therapy alone (with no trastuzumab) then about 900 would survive and five would have experienced heart toxicities. If 1000 women were treated with standard chemotherapy and trastuzumab for one year, about 933 would survive (33 more women will have their lives prolonged), about 740 would be free of disease recurrence (95 more women will not experience the disease return), and 26 would have serious heart toxicity (21 more than the chemotherapy alone group) due to the drug. These heart toxicities are often reversible if the treatment is stopped straight away.</P>
<P>Longer treatment (one year) might involve a greater risk of severe heart toxicities than shorter treatment (six months or less), although these results are based on only two studies and few patients. In women at higher risk of recurrence and with no signs of a weak heart, trastuzumab offers far more benefits than risks. The balance of risks to benefits in patients at lower risk of recurrence (e.g. a small rather than a large tumour) must be carefully evaluated. The oncologist should share the decision with the patient concerning whether and how to start the treatment.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-02-17 08:38:46 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ludovica  Tagliabue">
<P>Approximately one-fifth of women who develop early breast cancer have HER2-positive tumours, which if untreated, have a worse prognosis than HER2-negative tumours. Trastuzumab is a selective treatment targeting the HER2 pathway. Although the results on efficacy seem to support its use, there are potential cardiac toxicities which need to be considered, especially for women at lower risk of recurrence, or those at increased cardiovascular risk.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-02-17 08:38:58 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ludovica  Tagliabue">
<P>To assess the evidence on the efficacy and safety of therapy with trastuzumab, overall and in relation to its duration, concurrent or sequential administration with the standard chemotherapy regimen in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-02-17 08:28:18 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's (CBCGs) Specialised Trials Register, and used the search strategy developed by the CBCG to search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, TOXNET, and the WHO ICTRP search portal (up to February 2010).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-02-17 08:30:48 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ludovica  Tagliabue">
<P>RCTs comparing the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab alone, or in combination with chemotherapy, or no treatment, or standard chemotherapy alone, in women with HER2-positive early breast cancer including women with locally advanced breast cancer.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-02-17 08:40:26 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>We collected data from published and unpublished trials. We used hazard ratios (HRs) for time-to-event outcomes and risk ratio (RRs) for binary outcomes. Subgroup analyses included duration (less or greater than six months) and concurrent or sequential trastuzumab administration.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-17 08:47:12 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Valentina ">
<P>We included eight studies involving 11,991 patients. The combined HRs for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) significantly favoured the trastuzumab-containing regimens (HR 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.77, P &lt; 0.00001; and HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.71, P &lt; 0.00001, respectively). Trastuzumab significantly increased the risk of congestive heart failure (CHF: RR 5.11; 90% CI 3.00 to 8.72, P &lt; 0.00001); and left ventricular ejection fraction decline (LVEF: RR 1.83; 90% CI 1.36 to 2.47, P = 0.0008). For haematological toxicities, risks did not differ. The two small trials that administered trastuzumab for less than six months did not differ in efficacy from longer studies, but found fewer cardiac toxicities. Studies with concurrent administration gave similar efficacy and toxicity results to sequential studies. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-02-17 08:51:59 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ludovica  Tagliabue">
<P>Trastuzumab significantly improves OS and DFS in HER2-positive women with early and locally advanced breast cancer, although it also significantly increases the risk of CHF and LVEF decline. The available subgroup analyses are limited by the small number of studies. Studies that administered trastuzumab concurrently or sequentially did not differ significantly in efficacy. Shorter duration of therapy may reduce cardiotoxicity and maintain efficacy, however there is insufficient evidence at present to conclude this due to small numbers of patients in these trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-03-09 14:58:07 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Valentina ">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-02-17 09:47:40 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Valentina ">
<P>Breast cancer is the most common diagnosed cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Patients with breast cancer are classified as having cells that overexpress the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (known as HER2-positive) or do not overexpress the receptor (HER2-negative). Patients with HER2-positive disease typically have a worse prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Gschwind-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gschwind 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-03-09 14:58:07 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Valentina ">
<P>The antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin®) was developed as a means of blocking the tyrosine kinase-linked HER2 receptor (<LINK REF="REF-Coussens-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coussens 1985</LINK>). This receptor is overexpressed in 20% to 25% of women with early breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Slamon-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slamon 1987</LINK>). The <LINK REF="REF-Baselga-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baselga 1996</LINK> study provided the first clinical evidence of the anti-tumour activity of trastuzumab in patients with HER2-overexpressing breast carcinomas. Trastuzumab was not associated with the most common chemotherapy-related side effects such as alopecia, neutropenia, mucositis, and vomiting, with a favourable risk-benefit profile in patients with metastatic breast cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Cobleigh-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cobleigh 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vogel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vogel 2001</LINK>). Its potential efficacy in early breast cancer has also been investigated and three large clinical trials which involved women with early breast cancer were reported in 2005 (<LINK REF="STD-B31" TYPE="STUDY">B31</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HERA" TYPE="STUDY">HERA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-N9831" TYPE="STUDY">N9831</LINK>). The most common adverse events reported in these trials were fever, chills, and other acute, self-limiting symptoms that may accompany the first infusion of trastuzumab.</P>
<P>Cardiac dysfunction, an important side effect in patients with metastatic breast cancer when trastuzumab was used with or after anthracyclines, seemed to be of less concern in neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-B31" TYPE="STUDY">B31</LINK>, see <LINK REF="REF-Tan_x002d_Chiu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan-Chiu 2005</LINK>). On the other hand, isolated central nervous system (CNS) progression of the tumour was more common in patients with HER2-overexpressing early breast cancer who received trastuzumab (<LINK REF="STD-HERA" TYPE="STUDY">HERA</LINK>), probably as a consequence of better control of extra CNS disease by the drug (<LINK REF="REF-Burstein-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burstein 2005</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-02-17 10:21:03 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Valentina ">
<P>Most currently available evidence supporting trastuzumab regimens relies on surrogate endpoints (i.e. disease free-survival (DFS) in patients with early breast cancer). The strength of this evidence has been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Apolone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Apolone 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joppi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joppi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lancet-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancet 2005</LINK>). Against this background, the following important clinical questions concerning trastuzumab's influence on mortality need to be tackled.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>The risk-benefit profile in patients at low and intermediate risk of death from the neoplastic disease.</B> In these cases, trastuzumab might provide a limited net benefit since the recurrence and mortality risks for breast cancer are low but the drug is associated with cardiac toxicity, which might be independent of the disease stage and prognosis.</LI>
<LI>
<B>The optimal treatment duration.</B> One year is the generally accepted reference duration for trastuzumab therapy based on pivotal trial protocols (<LINK REF="STD-HERA" TYPE="STUDY">HERA</LINK>). A similar clinical improvement was found in a subsequent trial in which trastuzumab was given for nine weeks (<LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK>). Since cardiotoxicity may be dose-related, it is important to assess the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab administered over a shorter period.</LI>
<LI>
<B>The best modality of administration.</B> Trastuzumab can be given with chemotherapy concurrently (at the same time), or sequentially (after), and therefore it is important to compare the efficacy and safety of these two schedules.</LI>
<LI>
<B>The efficacy in subgroups.</B> We explored the effect of trastuzumab in subgroups on the basis of patients' characteristics or studies. Various prognostic factors may influence the effect of trastuzumab, i.e. tumour size or methodological characteristics of the studies (e.g. trial stopped early for benefit).</LI>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2012-02-17 11:08:48 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>At least two review authors (LM, LT, EP) independently screened the titles and abstracts of articles that were found for inclusion. We also assessed information available from conference proceedings on unpublished studies. We resolved disagreements by discussion. We obtained a copy of the full article for each reference reporting a potentially eligible trial. We sought further information from the authors where papers contained insufficient information to make a decision about eligibility. We applied the selection criteria described above to each trial. We recorded reasons for exclusion. We entered the characteristics and outcomes of the included trials, and details of the excluded trials into our database.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2012-02-17 11:19:40 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Three review authors (LT, SB, EP) independently extracted information from included trials using the pro-forma process piloted on a random sample of papers investigating other chemotherapy agents. We recorded details of study design, participants, setting, interventions, follow-up, quality components, efficacy outcomes, and side effects. (The extraction form is available from the review authors upon request). We also recorded details of previous therapies given to patients (including endocrine or other therapy). Two more review authors (LM, RD) resolved any discrepancies regarding the extraction of quantitative data or the quality assessment of RCTs. When a trial was presented in abstract form, we searched for further information using the Internet, contacting the authors, and checking for the best available resource or publication. Where possible, we sought any missing data or unclear information from the authors. For studies with more than one publication, we extracted data from all of the publications. However, we considered the final or updated version of each trial to be the primary reference for efficacy and toxicity unless otherwise specified (i.e. a large part of included patients crossed over to the other treatment arm during follow-up).</P>
<P>We included trials where patients crossed over to the other treatment arm at the time of progression, or received other treatment off-study and were managed according to the arm where they were originally randomised.</P>

<P>We classified the generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, completeness of outcome data, and selective outcome reporting as 'adequate' (low risk of bias), 'inadequate' (high risk of bias), or 'unclear' following the criteria specified in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We considered these four items as the key domains for the risk of bias assessment. Studies with adequate procedures in all four domains were considered to have a low risk of bias; studies with inadequate procedures in one or more key domain(s) were considered to have a high risk of bias; and studies with unclear procedures in one or more key domain(s) were considered to have an unclear risk of bias. Two reviewers (SB, LT) independently assessed trials according to the predefined quality criteria. They resolved disagreements by consulting a third party (LM).</P>

These components are part of a list of quality items identified through a systematic review of the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2003</LINK>).

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-03-13 00:41:26 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>The measure of association chosen for OS and DFS was the hazard ratio (HR). A HR less than 1.0 favoured regimens containing trastuzumab and ratios larger than 1.0 favoured regimens that do not contain trastuzumab. The measure of association chosen for combining toxicities was the risk ratio (RR). A RR greater than 1.0 indicated that the experimental treatment was more toxic than the control, and less than 1.0 suggested that the control was more toxic than treatment.</P>
<P>We assessed the risk/benefit profile by calculating the absolute effects using STATA 11 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA). For efficacy, we obtained the absolute effect using the HR for mortality or disease progression estimated in meta-analysis and calculated this considering the outcome at 36 months (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1999</LINK>). We obtained two absolute safety effects, the first using the RR for CHF and the second one using the RR for LVEF decline. We considered several hypothetical scenarios based on three patient baseline risks (low, medium, and high) for mortality, recurrence, and cardiovascular events.</P>
<P>We investigated the association between the occurrence of brain metastases as site of first relapse and trastuzumab by comparing the proportion of patients with a specific pattern of relapse, such as brain metastases between arms.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-02-17 11:40:27 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>We assessed heterogeneity using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic indicated the percentage variability due to between-study (or inter-study) variability, as opposed to within-study (or intra-study) variability. Because we assumed that latent clinical heterogeneity was ubiquitous, we combined the studies using the random-effects model, regardless of statistical evidence for heterogeneity effect sizes. We classified an I<SUP>2</SUP> value greater than 50% as having substantial heterogeneity and discussed this accordingly (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We performed meta-regressions to assess whether the treatment effect was associated with the duration and concurrent or sequential administration of trastuzumab. These analyses were done with STATA 11.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-02-17 11:42:13 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>We evaluated the risk of outcome reporting bias for OS and DFS. In each study, we assessed the absence of these outcomes and discussed its possible impact on the overall estimates.</P>
<P>We assessed the impact of data from RCTs stopped early for benefit on the meta-analysis by comparing the HRs obtained from the meta-analysis which did or did not consider studies stopped early.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2012-03-13 00:41:06 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>We directly extracted the HRs and their variances for OS and DFS from the papers. If not reported, we indirectly obtained the HRs by using the methods described in <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>, employing either other available summary statistics or data extracted from published Kaplan-Meier curves. If all arms in a multi-arm trial had to be included in the meta-analysis and one treatment arm had to be considered for more than one comparisons, we decided to divide the number of events and the number of participants in that arm by the number of treatment comparisons made. This method avoided the multiple use of participants in the pooled estimate of treatment effect while retaining information from each arm of the trial. It slightly compromised the precision of the pooled estimate.</P>
<P>For all adverse events and brain metastases treated as binary data, we used the RR as measure of association and fixed a higher type-I error (&#945; = 0.10) (<LINK REF="REF-Shadish-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shadish 2002</LINK>).</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2012-03-13 00:49:29 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>We carefully reviewed the data to explore how sources of possible heterogeneity influenced the direction and magnitude of the effect and grouped studies according to the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Duration of administration: we compared studies in which trastuzumab was given for less than six months, or more than six months, with regards to OS, DFS, cardiotoxicity, neutropenic fever, anaemia, neutropenia, and brain metastases as the site of first relapse.</LI>
<LI>Modality of administration: concurrent or sequential administration of trastuzumab with regards to OS, DFS, CHF, LVEF, and brain metastases as the site of first relapse.</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment: studies with adequate allocation concealment or studies classified as unclear or inadequate with respect to the outcomes OS and DFS.</LI>
<LI>Prognostic factors that could possibly modify the efficacy of trastuzumab (e.g. node-positive or negative status, positive or negative hormonal receptors, tumour size &gt; 2 cm or &lt; 2 cm, and age &gt; 60 or &lt; 60 years).</LI>
<LI>Possible impact on the meta-analysis of the results from RCTs stopped early for benefit or non-truncated RCTs.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We explored different strategies to identify the main effect modifiers of trastuzumab. First, we assessed the consistency of treatment effect among studies, for efficacy and safety outcomes in relation to their intervention characteristics (i.e. duration and concurrent or sequential administration of trastuzumab). We followed the same approach to evaluate the consistency among studies for efficacy outcomes, with regard to the methodological characteristics (i.e. allocation concealment and early stop for benefit). We assessed consistency by testing the differences between the above subgroups using a meta-regression analysis. Second, we asssessed whether the magnitude or direction of the treatment effect was modified by patients' prognostic characteristics, i.e. lymph node status (negative or positive), hormone-receptor status (negative or positive), tumour size (&gt; 2 cm or &lt; 2 cm) and age (&gt; 60 or &lt; 60) by summarising the ratios of HRs in each study using the random-effects model. The estimated weighted mean of the ratio of HRs and its 95% CI were reported with the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. Since this test often has low power for identifying sources of heterogeneity, we fixed a higher type-I error (&#945; = 0.10) (<LINK REF="REF-Hardy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardy 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>In the eight RCTs, 11,991 women were randomised to the following treatment groups: 7,020 women to a trastuzumab-containing arm and 4,971 women to a treatment without trastuzumab. There was a wide age range (from 22 to 80 years) and the median age was 49 years. The trials recruited patient populations with varying risk profiles but all trials excluded patients with metastatic breast cancer. All included patients had local (axillary) node-positive breast cancer or high risk node-negative disease on the basis of the size of the primary tumour and were HER2-positive. Four trials included patients both with (node-positive) and without (node-negative) pathological axillary lymph nodes (<LINK REF="STD-BCIRG006" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG006;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-HERA" TYPE="STUDY">HERA;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-N9831" TYPE="STUDY">N9831</LINK>). To be eligible, node-negative patients in these studies had to have a primary tumour bigger than 2 cm (<LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-N9831" TYPE="STUDY">N9831</LINK>) or 1 cm (<LINK REF="STD-HERA" TYPE="STUDY">HERA</LINK>) in diameter.

<P>Six trials evaluated trastuzumab as an adjuvant therapy (surgery followed by chemotherapy plus or minus trastuzumab) while the <LINK REF="STD-Buzdar" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NOAH" TYPE="STUDY">NOAH</LINK> trials enrolled patients before surgery and gave trastuzumab on a neoadjuvant basis, together or without chemotherapy.</P>
<P>Seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-B31" TYPE="STUDY">B31</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BCIRG006" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG006;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Buzdar" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-N9831" TYPE="STUDY">N9831;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-NOAH" TYPE="STUDY">NOAH;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-PACS_x002d_04" TYPE="STUDY">PACS-04</LINK>) used an anthracycline (with or without a taxane) in both the trastuzumab and non-trastuzumab-containing arms. In the <LINK REF="STD-NOAH" TYPE="STUDY">NOAH</LINK> trial, the control therapeutic scheme contained cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-BCIRG006" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG006;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-HERA" TYPE="STUDY">HERA</LINK>) gave trastuzumab with different chemotherapy regimens. In the <LINK REF="STD-BCIRG006" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG006</LINK> trial, one of the three arms was excluded as trastuzumab was given with docetaxel and carboplatin (TCH arm), which was completely different from the control arm (i.e. doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel). Although we recognise that the TCH arm has been adopted by many clinicians, our protocol considered trastuzumab as the only difference between arms. The <LINK REF="STD-HERA" TYPE="STUDY">HERA</LINK> trial tested trastuzumab's efficacy in patients who had received at least four cycles of an approved (neo-) adjuvant chemotherapy regimen. This could include anthracyclines with or without taxanes, a non-anthracycline regimen that included cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil, or any regimen approved by the trial committee. In the <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK> trial, the anthracycline was given after a regimen with vinorelbine or docetaxel.</P>
<P>The study design of the <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-PACS_x002d_04" TYPE="STUDY">PACS-04</LINK> trials involved two randomisations. The <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK> study was designed to compare vinorelbine with docetaxel, and <LINK REF="STD-PACS_x002d_04" TYPE="STUDY">PACS-04</LINK> evaluated the efficacy of fluorouracil plus epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide compared with epirubicin and docetaxel. In both of these trials, we considered the data concerning the second randomisation, i.e. the one focusing on trastuzumab, for the purpose of this review.</P>
<P>Trastuzumab and the other chemotherapies were given sequentially in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-HERA" TYPE="STUDY">HERA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PACS_x002d_04" TYPE="STUDY">PACS-04</LINK>) and concurrently in the other six trials (<LINK REF="STD-B31" TYPE="STUDY">B31;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-BCIRG006" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG006;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Buzdar" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-N9831" TYPE="STUDY">N9831;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-NOAH" TYPE="STUDY">NOAH</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-N9831" TYPE="STUDY">N9831</LINK> trial contained three arms: two treatment groups and one control group. Trastuzumab was administered sequentially in one arm, concurrently in the second arm, and not given in the third arm.</P>
<P>The National Cancer Institute and the Food and Drug Administration approved an unplanned joint analysis of two independent trials (<LINK REF="STD-B31" TYPE="STUDY">B31</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-N9831" TYPE="STUDY">N9831</LINK>) as the experimental and control arms were considered similar. We were unable to find publications presenting the two results on efficacy separately. In this meta-analysis, we used data from <LINK REF="REF-Romond-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romond 2005</LINK> to assess efficacy in terms of OS and DFS. In the subgroup analysis pertaining to the effect of concurrent or sequential trastuzumab administration on adverse events, we halved the control arm of the <LINK REF="STD-N9831" TYPE="STUDY">N9831</LINK> trial to avoid the repeated use of participants in the pooled estimate.</P>
<P>We obtained the dose and duration of trastuzumab from the registered trial protocols and the treatment regimens varied amongst these trials. Six trials (<LINK REF="STD-B31" TYPE="STUDY">B31;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-BCIRG006" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG006;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-HERA" TYPE="STUDY">HERA;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-N9831" TYPE="STUDY">N9831;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-NOAH" TYPE="STUDY">NOAH</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PACS_x002d_04" TYPE="STUDY">PACS-04</LINK>) administered trastuzumab for one year with differing schedules: 6 mg/kg every three weeks (with a loading dose of 8 mg/kg) in the <LINK REF="STD-HERA" TYPE="STUDY">HERA</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-NOAH" TYPE="STUDY">NOAH</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-PACS_x002d_04" TYPE="STUDY">PACS-04</LINK> trials; and 2 mg/kg weekly doses (with a loading dose of 4 mg/kg) in the other three trials. In the <LINK REF="STD-Buzdar" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK> trials, trastuzumab was prescribed for a shorter time, six months and nine weeks respectively, with 2 mg/kg weekly doses after the 4 mg/kg loading dose. In the <LINK REF="STD-BCIRG006" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG006</LINK> trial, trastuzumab was given for one year but the dosage was never reported. The trial reports did not specify the total doses of anthracyclines or taxanes administered, but they probably differed across the trials. Other adjuvant treatments included postoperative radiotherapy and endocrine therapy for women with hormone-receptor-positive disease (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors for postmenopausal women).</P>
<P>The median follow-up of patients ranged from 18 months (<LINK REF="STD-N9831" TYPE="STUDY">N9831</LINK>) to 65 months (<LINK REF="STD-BCIRG006" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG006</LINK>).</P>

<P>Since the trials were large and conducted at multiple sites, it is likely that these trials had unbiased central randomisation procedures, protocol integrity and rigorous and reliable data registration, in order to satisfy regulatory authorities and human investigation committees. We could not directly assess methodological quality because details of the methods used (such as the mechanism of allocation concealment) were not always provided in the published reports or congress presentations. None of the studies used blinding to treatment allocation, a common practice in phase III oncological trials, because of the difficulty in concealing different infusion times, schedules and toxicities. This was unlikely to bias the results of the studies where OS was measured, as this outcome was not subject to observer or patient bias in interpretation.</P>

<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK> trial, distant disease-free survival (DDFS) became the primary endpoint in the final analysis instead of recurrence-free survival, which was considered the primary endpoint in the first interim analysis. DDFS was more closely associated with mortality than recurrence-free survival and this allowed for a longer follow-up period and the collection of more events. Although the authors provided a rationale for this amendment, from the available data we cannot rule out selective outcome reporting bias.</P>
<P>The study protocol of <LINK REF="STD-BCIRG006" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG006</LINK> was available but largely incomplete, and the study results were reported only as meeting abstracts or presentations, therefore it was likely that not all of the prespecified outcomes had been reported.

Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-HERA" TYPE="STUDY">HERA</LINK>) published the results of an interim analysis which strongly supported the efficacy of trastuzumab and allowed patients in the control arm to switch to the experimental arm.

<P>We cannot rule out the possibility of publication bias in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-HERA" TYPE="STUDY">HERA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-N9831" TYPE="STUDY">N9831</LINK>). Data on efficacy from arm B (n = 981) in the <LINK REF="STD-N9831" TYPE="STUDY">N9831</LINK> trial, where trastuzumab was given sequentially, were never published in full. A second issue about the <LINK REF="STD-N9831" TYPE="STUDY">N9831</LINK> trial concerns the impact of the results of 152 patients who were assigned to the control group but were eventually excluded from the joint analysis without the trial authors providing an explanation for this decision. The results of the <LINK REF="STD-HERA" TYPE="STUDY">HERA</LINK> trial, based on 1701 patients treated with trastuzumab over two years, have never been published. We cannot discount the possibility that the data are associated with partial efficacy or increased toxicity. Members of the steering committee of the study reported to us that the reason that these results have not been yet published is that the International Independent Data Monitoring Committee of the trial have recommended that the trial follow-up continue (Nicholas Wilcken, personal communication).</P>

Cardiac toxicity data for the <LINK REF="STD-BCIRG006" TYPE="STUDY">BCIRG006</LINK> trial were extracted from the Slamon 2006 reference. There were 135 cases (2.5%) of CHF out of 5471 patients in the trastuzumab group and 20 cases (0.4%) out of 4810 in the control group. The overall result indicated a higher risk of CHF with trastuzumab (RR 5.11; 90% CI 3.00 to 8.72, P &lt; 0.00001). Heterogeneity was minimal (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 28%).

A shorter treatment period did not appear to be associated with an increase in the risk of CHF (RR 0.50; 90% CI 0.07 to 3.74, P = 0.57). However, this analysis was based only on one trial (<LINK REF="STD-FinHer" TYPE="STUDY">FinHer</LINK>) and three events as there were no reported events in the <LINK REF="STD-Buzdar" TYPE="STUDY">Buzdar</LINK> trial.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Congestive heart failure stratified by concurrent or sequential administration of trastuzumab</HEADING>
<P>We further defined sequential subgroups on the basis of the time of randomisation: before or after chemotherapy. Two sequential trials (<LINK REF="STD-HERA" TYPE="STUDY">HERA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PACS_x002d_04" TYPE="STUDY">PACS-04</LINK>) randomised patients after the completion of chemotherapy but the <LINK REF="STD-N9831" TYPE="STUDY">N9831</LINK> trial randomised patients before starting chemotherapy. Therefore the <LINK REF="STD-HERA" TYPE="STUDY">HERA</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-PACS_x002d_04" TYPE="STUDY">PACS-04</LINK> trials did not take into account cardiotoxicity during chemotherapy. The different randomisation times reflected the cardiotoxicity risk of the control group; the risk is extremely low in those trials which randomised patients later. If the trials with different randomisation times were grouped, we would find a subgroup difference for concurrent or sequential administration influenced by the different cardiotoxicity risk in the control arms. The <LINK REF="STD-N9831" TYPE="STUDY">N9831</LINK> trial monitored cardiotoxicity across chemotherapy and trastuzumab periods and reported a significantly higher risk of CHF (RR 8.42; 90% CI 1.56 to 45.45, P = 0.04), accounting for all patients and events in the subgroup (1042 and 19, respectively). In the other subgroups, the risk of CHF was significantly higher when trastuzumab was given sequentially with chemotherapy (RR 11.05; 90% CI 3.46 to 35.29, P &lt; 0.0007) and concurrently (RR 3.90; 90% CI 2.42 to 6.28, P &lt; 0.00001). The former analysis (i.e. sequential - randomisation after chemotherapy) was based on 3914 patients and 43 events, and the latter (i.e. concurrent) on 5325 patients and 93 events. The test for differences between subgroups was not significant (P = 0.2214).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-03-13 03:24:07 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>In view of the large effect, the large number of meta-analysed studies and patients, and the relative absence of substantial differences between studies, we believe that trastuzumab is associated with a beneficial effect for both OS and DFS in women with HER2-positive breast cancer with a moderate-to-high risk of recurrence. However, cardiac toxicities pose an appreciable clinical problem. For these toxicities, the definition of the outcome, congestive heart failure (CHF) was more homogeneous amongst trials than the left ventricular ejection fraction definition (LVEF decline); so the summary of CHF results can be considered more trustworthy. Overall mortality can be reduced by one-third but the risk of severe cardiac toxicity (i.e. CHF) is five times more likely. This means that if 1000 women at low risk were not treated with trastuzumab, five of them would be expected to experience severe cardiac toxicity and 900 would be expected to survive at three years, whereas if they were treated with trastuzumab the numbers would be 26 and 933, respectively. Therefore, careful attention is needed in patient selection, as the benefit of trastuzumab could be eroded by cardiac toxicity, particularly in low risk patients or those at increased cardiovascular risk. An assessment of the balance between benefit and harm of trastuzumab therapy is even more difficult as the importance of harmful and beneficial events can be perceived differently by patients and clinicians, along with the fact that some cardiac toxicities might be reversible if the treatment is stopped immediately. In terms of haematological toxicities, there is no evidence of raised risk.</P>
<P>We explored the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab according to duration and concurrent or sequential administration in the subgroup analyses. These analyses have limitations, because they are observational by definition and they may lack statistical power to detect even an important clinical difference between groups. Misleading subgroup effects can result in withholding efficacious treatment from patients who would benefit, or prescribing ineffective or even potentially harmful treatments for patients who would fare better without the treatment. However, the efficacy of trastuzumab does not seem to vary in relation to the duration and concurrent or sequential administration. The incidence of cardiac toxicities seemed to be higher in regimens where trastuzumab was given for a longer period: the risk of severe CHF when trastuzumab was used for more than six months is estimated to be more than ten times than in those where trastuzumab was administered for less time, but the number of studies and patients in the shorter term subgroup was very limited. When the risks of cardiac toxicity in the longer trastuzumab schedules were compared to those with shorter duration, the test for subgroup differences reached statistical significance; heterogeneity across studies and subgroups was null or minimal. It seemed that differences may exist in cardiotoxicity between shorter and longer trastuzumab administration, and appeared to be large in terms of harm to the patient. These results need to be confirmed in randomised trials designed to test the optimal duration of adjuvant trastuzumab such as the Short-HER (<LINK REF="REF-Guarneri-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guarneri 2008</LINK>), the <LINK REF="REF-SOLD" TYPE="REFERENCE">SOLD</LINK>, and the <LINK REF="REF-PHARE" TYPE="REFERENCE">PHARE</LINK> trials. These may either consolidate or negate the finding of a difference between short or long term treatment.</P>
<P>In patients receiving trastuzumab sequentially, the risks of LVEF decline seemed higher than in those patients receiving it concurrently. Although the subgroup differences were significant, these results should be interpreted with even more caution, since the higher risk in the subgroup of studies giving trastuzumab sequentially might be explained by different cardiotoxicity of the chemotherapy preceding trastuzumab. On the basis of these limitations, we believe that trastuzumab should be considered cardiotoxic irrespective of its sequential or concurrent administration. This interpretation is consistent with the very limited heterogeneity within subgroups. The potential difference needs to be further explored in a trial designed to randomise patients to sequential or concurrent schedules of trastuzumab, and by considering CHF as a primary outcome.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-03-09 15:11:29 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Valentina ">
<P>The results of our meta-analysis could not be generalised to all women with early or locally advanced breast cancer. Firstly, the majority of women in the trials included in our review were younger (median age 49 years), tended to be healthier and had fewer comorbidities than women usually affected by the disease. This limitation especially concerns data on cardiotoxicity: all trials excluded patients with existing cardiovascular disorders or with suboptimal LVEF (&lt; 55%). Therefore the results of this review may not be entirely generalised to clinical practice. Given the high risk of cardiotoxicity-related to the use of trastuzumab, oncologists should seriously consider that outside RCTs the number of patients experiencing these adverse events may be higher and the clinical consequences of the treatment even more severe. The higher risk of cardiotoxicity could erode the net benefit of trastuzumab, particularly in women with a low risk of recurrence, such as patients with small tumours and negative lymph nodes (i.e. size of less than 1 cm and lymph node-negative - T1a, bN0). These patients were largely excluded from all RCTs included in our review, further limiting the applicability of the evidence and the use of trastuzumab in this group.</P>
<P>Moreover, trastuzumab was associated with a longer DFS (composite outcome, defined as the time from randomisation to the date of recurrence of tumour or death from any cause) and probably with a lower risk of relapse overall. The patients treated with trastuzumab who relapse are more likely to have brain metastases as the site of first relapse than the controls, which were apparently unaffected by the duration or schedule of administration. There is debate on whether the higher incidence of CNS metastases is due to the higher aggressiveness of HER2-positive breast cancer, or to a better control of extra CNS disease by trastuzumab. This might be related to the limited penetration across the blood-brain-barrier of the drug and a general inefficacy in controlling CNS metastases or is a result of the improvements of the drug in systemic control and OS, that may lead to an unmasking of CNS disease recurrence that would otherwise remain clinically silent before the patient's death. The report of <LINK REF="STD-N9831" TYPE="STUDY">N9831</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-B31" TYPE="STUDY">B31</LINK> studies indicated that the overall incidence of CNS events after the first relapse was similar in the two study groups, thus supporting the view that the higher incidence of brain metastases in trastuzumab-treated patients reflects a greater control of systemic disease.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-02-20 10:51:39 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ludovica  Tagliabue">
<P>All articles included in this systematic review were published in the past decade and could be classified as high quality trials, which probably reflects a generally increasing emphasis on higher expectations for study quality by researchers, regulatory agencies, and journal editors. The fact that three trials stopped early for benefit, raises concerns. Methodological studies have reported that RCTs stopped early showed implausible large treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Bassler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassler 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pocock-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pocock 1999</LINK>). Anyway, we assessed whether the RCTs that stopped early for benefit gave different results from those that did not. We did not find any statistical differences between these trials in terms of efficacy. Furthermore, in four trials selected patients were given (during the course of the study) the possibility to switch from the control arm, in which they were initially allocated, to the trastuzumab arm. Patients were switched mostly for ethical considerations and when an interim analyses supported the hypothesis of trastuzumab efficacy. The consequences of this selective crossover gives problems in data analysis and interpretation of results (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 2011</LINK>). It is worth considering the possible effect of the switch on efficacy and safety outcomes. In situations in which the intervention is effective but toxic, as in this review, the differences (deltas) between treatment and control, obtained by considering patients who have crossed over, tend to become smaller. After the crossover, the number of events in the control arm dropped, and the difference between arms was reduced. In general, the more effective the drug, the smaller is the difference after the crossover. The same applies to safety: the more toxic the drug, the smaller is the difference after the crossover. So the risk-benefit profile of trastuzumab might have been modified by the switch. For that reason we believe that reporting the efficacy results before the crossing over and the safety results after the crossing over may depict a biased risk-benefit profile.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-02-17 15:31:29 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>While there is confidence about the benefit of trastuzumab, there is still uncertainty about its magnitude and duration over time. Trials that stopped early after favourable interim analyses could have partially influenced the results of this meta-analysis, inflating positive results. However, we did not find any strong evidence of that. It is also possible that publication bias in favour of significant findings may have led to an overestimation of the overall treatment effect: two completed trials (<LINK REF="STD-HERA" TYPE="STUDY">HERA</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-N9831" TYPE="STUDY">N9831</LINK>) have never published data on 2782 patients, which is undoubtedly a considerable figure. The absence of the publication could also be related to a high frequency of cardiotoxic events, diminishing the net benefit of trastuzumab.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-02-17 15:32:11 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ludovica  Tagliabue">
<P>Despite some limitations of the trials examined, there is strong evidence that the use of trastuzumab for early and locally advanced breast cancer: a) improves both OS and DFS in HER2-positive women with moderate-to-high risk of recurrence; and b) increases the likelihood of few women experiencing cardiac toxicities. The fact that the relative risk of CHF is greater than the relative risk of LVEF decline may imply that trastuzumab is more likely to cause severe cardiac outcomes than mild ones. Another possible explanation is that the concomitant chemotherapy use may decline the LVEF in the control, therefore decreasing the difference between the groups. One year of trastuzumab is the standard care on the basis of scientific evidence. Although this systematic review does not provide definitive<B> </B>evidence that the risks of CHF rise with longer administration of trastuzumab, careful attention must still be paid to the duration and modality of administration of the drug. Because of the high prevalence of small tumours and node-negative disease in a more elderly patient population, women and clinicians should discuss the trade-offs between benefits and cardiac toxicities carefully when facing the decision on whether and how to start the treatment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-03-13 03:13:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Valentina ">
<P>The next generation of studies is awaited to define the precise role of trastuzumab as adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-positive early breast cancer.</P>
<P>The first compelling question is clinical and regards the different durations of treatment: a short term course (between nine and 24 weeks) or standard duration (over 24 weeks and usually 52 weeks)? </P>
<P>The second compelling question is methodological and concerns the impact of the offered crossover from the control to the trastuzumab group following positive results from interim trial analyses or from concomitant trials; it makes it difficult to complete the trial as planned. If women agree to cross over, data analysis is no longer straightforward and can bias the estimates of efficacy and safety, leaving the scientific community with greater uncertainty about the study results. As discussed above, the estimates of efficacy and safety outcomes obtained with ITT analyses tend to be biased towards the null hypothesis. In general, if a treatment is effective but toxic, the ITT analysis provides estimates of the chosen measure of associations, which are likely to be biased towards the hypothesis of no-difference for both outcomes. The direction and magnitude of the bias associated with the estimates of efficacy and safety outcomes obtained with censored analyses is highly dependent on the characteristics of patients who are offered and decide to cross over. If the treatment is effective and patients who cross over have a better prognosis, the direction of bias will go in the opposite direction of no-difference (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We recommend publication of all randomised trial data evaluating trastuzumab as this might help clarify the net benefit and cardiac toxicities across all enrolled patients.</P>
<P>Finally it would be useful if independent researchers conducted an individual patient data meta-analysis, fully exploring the interactions between the effect size and prognostic patient characteristics in a multivariate model; and sequential and concurrent trastuzumab schedules were tested in a parallel randomised trial.</P>
