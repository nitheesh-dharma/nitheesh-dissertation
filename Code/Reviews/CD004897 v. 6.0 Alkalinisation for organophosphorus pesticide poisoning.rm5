<TITLE>Use of sodium bicarbonate to treat organophosphorus pesticide poisoning</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-26 16:59:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Many people, particularly in developing countries, are poisoned by organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) used in agriculture or for killing insects in the home. Poisoning may be accidental or intentional. Even when the usual antidotes are given, 10 to 20% of those poisoned still die. Research in animals has suggested that use of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or similar chemicals which make the blood alkaline might save people poisoned by OPs.</P>
<P>The review authors looked for studies in which such chemicals were given to OP poisoned patients, to see how effective the treatment is. They sought randomised controlled trials, a type of research study in which one group of patients is given one treatment, while a similar group (the control group) is given a different treatment.</P>
<P>The authors found eight studies but only two small randomised controlled trials, one using higher dose sodium bicarbonate and the other a lower dose. Only the trial using higher dose sodium bicarbonate, which included 53 participants, showed a slight benefit from using sodium bicarbonate in conjunction with standard treatment for OP poisoning. This study does not provide enough evidence to recommend routine clinical use of sodium bicarbonate. There are hundreds of different kinds of OPs so treatment may vary based on the type of poisoning as well as the severity of the poisoning. More research needs to be done to determine the best treatment for poisoning with OPs in various situations.</P>

<P>Poisoning with organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in developing countries. The case-fatality for intentional self-poisoning is around 10 to 20% even when the standard antidotes (atropine, oximes and benzodiazepines) are used. Alternative treatments have been trialled in an attempt to improve outcomes from acute OP poisoning, one of which is blood alkalinisation. Animal and preliminary human research has suggested benefit from blood alkalinisation with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<SUB>3</SUB>) as a treatment for acute OP poisoning.</P>

<P>Preliminary studies suggest benefit from blood alkalinisation with NaHCO<SUB>3</SUB> in OP poisoning, but there is insufficient evidence to support its routine clinical use. Further research is required to determine the method of alkalinisation that will optimise outcomes, and the regimen which will produce the target arterial pH of 7.50 (range 7.45 to 7.55). This should be followed by a well-designed randomised controlled trial to determine efficacy.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-09-23 12:49:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are used in developed and developing countries to improve crop yield, control disease vectors (such as mosquitoes) and for household use. OPs are among the most toxic and common pesticides associated with poisoning (<LINK REF="REF-Eddleston-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddleston 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tinoco-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tinoco 1998</LINK>). Hundreds of thousands of people die each year around the world from OP poisoning, the majority in developing countries, from intentional or occupational exposures (<LINK REF="REF-Eddleston-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddleston 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The case-fatality for pesticide self-poisoning is as high as 10 to 20%, depending on the type of OP and route of exposure. OPs induce multi-system toxicity through inhibition of multiple esterases, particularly acetylcholinesterase (AChE) which causes accumulation of synaptic acetylcholine (ACh). Death occurs, in most cases during the acute cholinergic phase, from cardio-respiratory arrest. Some deaths occur later, secondary to complications from severe poisoning and prolonged hospital admission (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Management of OP poisoning depends on the severity of symptoms. Supportive care, appropriate decontamination, and management of symptoms with antidotes (anticholinergics such as atropine, oximes and benzodiazepines) remain the treatment priority. In severe poisonings, patients require advanced cardio-respiratory management, close observation, and careful titration of antidotes (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2007</LINK>). Acidosis is a prominent clinical manifestation with significant OP poisoning (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite widespread clinical use, there is no good quality evidence that oximes are effective in reducing morbidity or mortality in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Buckley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buckley 2005</LINK>). The lack of confidence in oximes, and the high case-fatality from OP self-poisoning has encouraged clinicians to find alternative antidotes. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<SUB>3</SUB>) has been shown to decrease mortality in animals poisoned by OPs experimentally (<LINK REF="REF-Cordoba-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cordoba 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jeevarathinam-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeevarathinam 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stefanovic-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stefanovic 2006</LINK>). Clinical use in humans has supported these benefits in uncontrolled case series (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2000</LINK>). In two controlled case series NaHCO<SUB>3</SUB> clinical benefits were suggested, including an earlier discharge and/or lower total atropine dose, but no change in mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Balali_x002d_Mood-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balali-Mood 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vucinic-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vucinic 2008</LINK>).</P>

<B>Current role of alkalinisation in the treatment of OP poisoning<BR/>
</B>Alkalinisation is not widely used for the treatment of OP poisoning, largely because of clinicians' lack of confidence in its efficacy. In some centres, however, NaHCO<SUB>3</SUB> is commonly used for severe poisonings (<LINK REF="REF-Balali_x002d_Mood-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balali-Mood 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vucinic-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vucinic 2008</LINK>). NaHCO<SUB>3</SUB> is readily accessible and relatively cheap, so it is likely to be used first-line to induce alkalosis clinically. If beneficial effects relate to bicarbonate-induced pH changes, rather than the sodium component, alkalinisation by other means (e.g. hyperventilation or administration of alternative alkalinising agents) may also be effective.</P>
<P>The purpose of this systematic review is to determine the efficacy of alkalinisation, in particular NaHCO<SUB>3</SUB>, for the treatment of OP poisoning.</P>

<P>Relative risk (RR) of death plus 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated; a relative risk of more than 1.00 indicates a higher risk of death (or ventilation, etc.) in the first group named.

<P>Had the data been suited to meta-analysis, a random-effects model relevant to the data (dichotomous or continuous) was to be used, given that heterogeneity between studies is likely.

<P>Two studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and both were small, randomised controlled trials. In the earlier study with higher dose NaHCO<SUB>3</SUB>, concealment was poor and the analysis was not intention to treat given that 7 patients (4 in the intervention arm and 3 controls) did not complete the study and were excluded from analysis; but follow-up was complete (<LINK REF="STD-Balali_x002d_Mood-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Balali-Mood 2005</LINK>). The second study using lower dose NaHCO<SUB>3</SUB>was presented in abstract form only with limited documentation to adequately assess bias (<LINK REF="STD-Afshari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Afshari 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two studies fulfilled inclusion criteria, but sufficient data were only available for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Balali_x002d_Mood-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Balali-Mood 2005</LINK>), the results of which are given in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table. The relative risk of death in patients receiving NaHCO<SUB>3</SUB> compared to controls was 0.52 (95% CI 0.05 to 5.39). The weighted mean difference for total dose of atropine was -36.1 (95% CI -68.43 to -3.77), although individual patient data was not available to determine whether it was a normal or skewed distribution. The relative risk of mechanical ventilation in patients receiving NaHCO<SUB>3</SUB> compared to controls was 0.50 (95% CI 0.04 to 5.87). The length of stay was significantly reduced in the patients who received NaHCO<SUB>3</SUB>, however, it is not clear whether this included only live or all discharges, so it was not considered further. High dose NaHCO<SUB>3 </SUB>in this study appeared to be safe (<LINK REF="STD-Balali_x002d_Mood-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Balali-Mood 2007</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-10-26 17:21:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>This systematic review identified eight studies investigating the effect of alkalinisation for the treatment of OP poisoning. In all studies, NaHCO<SUB>3</SUB> was administered to induce alkalinisation. Two studies were randomised and fulfilled the inclusion criteria, but allocation was poorly concealed in one of these (<LINK REF="STD-Balali_x002d_Mood-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Balali-Mood 2005</LINK>) and not described in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Afshari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Afshari 2010</LINK>). </P>
<P>Studies that were not included in this review were three controlled but not randomised studies (<LINK REF="STD-Balali_x002d_Mood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Balali-Mood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosa-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Rosa 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vucinic-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vucinic 2008</LINK>) and three uncontrolled case series (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Balali_x002d_Mood-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Balali-Mood 2007</LINK>). While the non-randomised studies suggested benefit from alkalinisation, their sub optimal study design limited conclusions that can be inferred regarding the efficacy.</P>
<P>There are a number of impediments to further clinical research in this area that are apparent from the studies already conducted. In particular, the heterogeneity of individual OPs and OP-poisoned patients, the lack of information to suggest optimal dose, and concerns about adverse effects from alkalinisation (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2007a</LINK>) are issues that must be considered in study design.</P>
<P>In regards to heterogeneity, large variations in patients (for example, age, gender, co-morbidities), the type and dose of OP ingested, the severity of poisoning and differences in the other treatments were noted in the studies identified. For example, there was a 50-fold variation in the dose of atropine required during the first 24 hours, which is a reflection of the severity of OP poisoning.</P>
<P>There are hundreds of OPs and each is different with respect to its toxicity, and may also vary in terms of response to treatment with NaHCO<SUB>3</SUB>. The in-hospital mortality varies 10-fold between OPs (<LINK REF="REF-Eddleston-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddleston 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dawson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 2010</LINK>) and the magnitude of the change in rate of non-enzymatic hydrolysis with alkalinisation varies between individual OPs (<LINK REF="REF-Eto-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eto 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Repetto-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Repetto 1994</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The optimum target pH and dosing regimen of NaHCO<SUB>3</SUB> has not been established, although an arterial pH of 7.50 (range 7.45 to 7.55) is probably the maximum that can be safely recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Proudfoot-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proudfoot 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seger 2003</LINK>). The regimens used by Balali Mood and colleagues produced a mean arterial pH of 7.46, 7.48 and 7.33 (<LINK REF="STD-Balali_x002d_Mood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Balali-Mood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Balali_x002d_Mood-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Balali-Mood 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Afshari-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Afshari 2010</LINK>) and only the higher dose regimen appeared to be effective.<BR/>
<BR/>Adverse effects have been reported from the use of NaHCO<SUB>3</SUB> in various medical conditions, but these have not been demonstrated in poisoned patients receiving careful alkalinisation of short duration (<LINK REF="REF-Liebelt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liebelt 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Proudfoot-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proudfoot 2004</LINK>). Adverse effects from treatment with NaHCO<SUB>3</SUB> were not noted in the high dose study (<LINK REF="STD-Balali_x002d_Mood-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Balali-Mood 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Balali_x002d_Mood-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Balali-Mood 2007</LINK>), but were not discussed in the other clinical studies.</P>

<P>Formal dose-optimisation studies of NaHCO<SUB>3</SUB> in acute OP poisoning should be conducted to determine the regimen that will rapidly, reliably and safely produce a target arterial pH of 7.50 (range 7.45 to 7.55). This should be followed by a randomised controlled trial to determine efficacy. To minimise the effect of heterogeneity, this requires the study of a large cohort of patients who have been poisoned by particular OPs which are common and problematic.</P>
