<P>Penicillin is effective in curing syphilis during pregnancy but more research is needed on the best dosage and duration of treatment.</P>
<P>Syphilis is a potentially fatal, sexually transmitted disease that passes from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby. If the woman is untreated, the fetus might be aborted or her baby may be born with the disease, suffer permanent disability and be disfigured. The effectiveness of penicillin in curing infection with syphilis in pregnant women and preventing the baby being born with congenital syphilis was established soon after its introduction in the 1940s and before the widespread use of randomised controlled trials. Although rare in developed countries, the incidence of syphilis is high and increasing in many developing countries, particularly where HIV/AIDS is common. The review of trials found no trials comparing the effectiveness of different doses of penicillin or comparing penicillin with other antibiotics. More research is needed to find the best dosage and duration of treatment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of syphilis infection</HEADING>
<P>Syphilis is a complex systemic disease with protean manifestations and virtually any organ in the body can be involved. It has been described in medicine as the great imitator or the great imposter in view of the multiple possible clinical manifestations, many of which are severe. It is caused by the spirochete, Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum), and is usually transmitted by sexual contact. Unlike most infectious diseases, it is rarely diagnosed by isolation and characterisation of the causative organism (<LINK REF="REF-Eccleston-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eccleston 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lukehart-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lukehart 2008</LINK>). Humans are the natural hosts of T. pallidum and also act as the vector.</P>
<P>T. pallidum penetrates usually abraded or damaged skin or mucous membrane although less often it can penetrate intact mucous membrane and the organisms rapidly become disseminated. Usually a primary lesion develops at the point of inoculation two to six weeks after infection (<LINK REF="REF-Fenton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenton 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Infection with syphilis is characterised by several stages (<LINK REF="REF-Garnett-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garnett 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sparling-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sparling 2008</LINK>). The development of clinical syphilis is usually denoted by the appearance of a chancre, which is the classical lesion of primary syphilis at the site of inoculation. Most, but not all, patients with primary syphilis develop secondary syphilis. This is a systemic illness characterised by an array of signs and symptoms including fever, malaise, generalised lymphadenopathy and a rash and mucosal lesions. Even without treatment the manifestations of both primary and secondary syphilis resolve spontaneously over a few weeks, but recur in about a quarter of patients usually during the second year of infection. This is then followed by a latent period when the patient has few or no signs or symptoms. This is frequently divided into an early period (usually one year following the resolution of the secondary stage) and a late latent period. About a third of untreated patients with latent syphilis, subsequently develop tertiary manifestations of the disease, which can include neurosyphilis (tabes dorsalis and general paresis), cardiovascular involvement, or gummatous disease at many possible sites (<LINK REF="REF-Sparling-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sparling 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Unlike most other common bacterial infections, T. pallidum cannot be cultured sufficiently quickly or cheaply to assist diagnosis. T. pallidum is very difficult to visualise using light microscopy and instead requires visualisation by darkfield microscopy, but even this depends crucially on the type of specimen and how it has been obtained. Partly as a consequence of the limited availability of microscopic methods for diagnosis, as well as that some patients with secondary syphilis and all patients with more advanced stages of the disease do not have lesions which can be microscopically examined, serologic testing is the mainstay of syphilis screening and diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Fenton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenton 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hook-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hook 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hutchinson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutchinson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peeling-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peeling 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sparling-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sparling 1971</LINK>). There are two main types of serologic tests for syphilis; the non-treponemal and the treponemal tests. Non-treponemal tests detect antibodies to reagin, a cholesterol-lecithin-cardiolipin antigen that cross-reacts with antibodies present in the sera of patients with syphilis. The first syphilis serologic test was developed by Wasserman in 1906, but it was later realised that the antibodies detected by this test were not specific for syphilis. This led to the development of more specific and sensitive non-treponemal tests, of which the two commonly used today are the VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) and the RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) tests. In most people with syphilis, non-treponemal serologic tests become reactive in early syphilis, at about four to seven days following the appearance of lesions. However, they are non-reactive in 13% to 41% of individuals presenting with primary disease (<LINK REF="REF-Hutchinson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutchinson 1990</LINK>). These tests are almost always reactive in people with secondary syphilis. Antibody titers usually peak during the secondary or latent phases of the disease, after which even when not treated they decline and with long follow up and even without treatment around 25% eventually become non-reactive in the late stages. In people who are treated for syphilis the RPR declines to become non-reactive more rapidly, usually between three and 12 months after treatment.</P>
<P>The main advantages of non-treponemal tests are that they are relatively inexpensive, easy to perform, and sensitive, making them useful as screening tests and, in addition, they are quantitative and can be followed over time to monitor response to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Eccleston-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eccleston 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fiumara-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiumara 1978</LINK>). A disadvantage of non-treponemal tests is that false positives, often of a transitory nature, can be caused by acute viral infections such as hepatitis and measles, and sustained false positive tests can be caused, particularly by auto-immune conditions. The diagnosis of syphilis should be confirmed in people with a positive non-treponemal test result by testing with a treponemal serologic test such as the FTA-ABS (fluorescent-treponemal antibody-absorbed test). Treponemal tests usually become reactive before reaginic tests. In most people, the treponemal tests remain positive indefinitely, whether the person has been treated or not. The treponemal tests are more expensive than the reaginic tests and can be technically more difficult to carry out. Antibody titers measured by reaginic tests vary during the natural history of untreated syphilis, becoming detectable shortly after the primary stage and climbing to their highest levels during the secondary or early latent stages (<LINK REF="REF-Hook-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hook 1992</LINK>). Recent technological advances have resulted in improved serodiagnostic tools for syphilis (<LINK REF="REF-Fenton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenton 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peeling-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peeling 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoner 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies of the sexual partners of people with syphilis document infection risks of 10% to 60%; a useful estimate is that syphilis develops in about a third of those exposed to early syphilis. Sexual contact with patients who have early syphilis is associated with the highest risk of developing the disease, whereas sexual contact with those who have latent disease is associated with lower risk (<LINK REF="REF-Hook-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hook 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Syphilis is common among people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the converse is also true. The relationships between syphilis and HIV are complex, with several areas of potential interaction. For instance, syphilis may predispose individuals to HIV acquisition, or transmission of either disease could be potentiated by the presence of the other (<LINK REF="REF-Fenton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenton 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karumudi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karumudi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zetola-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zetola 2007</LINK>). In addition, in HIV infected people with clinical features of syphilis, laboratory manifestations or the response to currently recommended syphilotherapy may be modified.</P>
<P>Infection with HIV, as with syphilis, produces a protean disease and the two interact on a number of levels. Syphilitic genital ulcers may enhance the acquisition and transmission of HIV; the natural history of syphilis may be modified in people co-infected with HIV; the results of laboratory tests for syphilis may be different in HIV-infected persons; and currently recommended therapy for syphilis may be less reliable for persons who are co-infected with HIV. Given the progressive decline of host defence that characterises the natural history of HIV infection, interactions between the two diseases may also depend on the degree of HIV-related immunosuppression present at the time of contact with syphilis (<LINK REF="REF-Hook-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hook 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karumudi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karumudi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zetola-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zetola 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Magnitude of the problem of syphilis infection</HEADING>
<P>Syphilis continues to cause a significant burden of disease particularly in less developed countries and among poor and marginalised people (<LINK REF="REF-Fenton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenton 2008</LINK>). The World Health Organization estimates there are 12 million new cases of syphilis every year with the majority being in Africa (four million), South and Sotheast Asia (four million) and Latin America and the Caribbean (three million) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). WHO estimates there are relatively few new cases in other regions (North Africa and the Middle East 370,000, East Asia and Pacific 240,000, Western Europe 140,000, North America 100,000, Eastern Europe and Central Asia 100,000 and Australia and New Zealand 10,000). Reported rates of syphilis vary greatly from country to country. The rates for industrialised countries are better documented, whereas there are fewer data for developing countries, where the disease is more widespread. For example, in 1990, the incidence of primary and secondary syphilis in the United States was 20 per 100,000 population, far less than the 360 per 100,000 estimated for parts of Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Hook-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hook 1992</LINK>). It is possible that the availability of penicillin in developing countries and its use in mass campaigns such as that directed against yaws in the 1950s and 1960s had some temporary effect on the prevalence and incidence of syphilis, but this had no long-term impact. Syphilis remains at levels in these countries that were seen in developed countries 70 or more years ago.</P>
<P>During the 1980s, syphilis became a subject of renewed concern due to rapidly increasing syphilis rates in North America and Europe. This was partly because the disease has been epidemiologically linked with HIV infections, and as a result of indications that currently recommended treatment regimens may not be sufficient to reliably cure syphilis, particularly in patients with concomitant HIV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Hutchinson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutchinson 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Syphilis was a major public health problem in Europe and North America until the 1950s and its late complications were major causes of neurologic and cardiovascular disease. During the early part of the 20th century more than 20% of patients in mental institutions in the United States had tertiary syphilis (<LINK REF="REF-Hook-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hook 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hutchinson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutchinson 1990</LINK>). Annual incidence reached a peak during the second world war with 575,000 cases being reported in 1943, a rate of 4/1000 population (<LINK REF="REF-Zenker-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zenker 1990</LINK>). With the introduction of penicillin after the second World War in the United States, the incidence of syphilis decreased.</P>
<P>In the United States, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the number of cases increased again, fluctuating between 19,000 and 26,000 cases per year until 1978. The rates increased slightly in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and a disproportionate number of cases occurred in homosexual men. In the mid-1980s, primarily because of behavioural changes adopted in response to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, it is presumed syphilis declined among homosexual men, as did the male to female ratio of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Hook-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hook 1989</LINK>). However, from the late 1980s the disease became more common and has been linked epidemiologically with HIV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Hook-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hook 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-St-Louis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">St Louis 1996</LINK>). Around 1985 the incidence of syphilis among heterosexual men and women began to increase rapidly, however, from a peak in 1990 rates of primary and secondary syphilis fell after control measures were strengthened and in 1999 the rate was the lowest ever recorded with 6657 cases of primary and secondary cases of syphilis being reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1999b</LINK>). This led to the question being raised of whether possible "elimination of endemic syphilis transmission (is) a realistic goal for the USA" (<LINK REF="REF-Hook-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hook 1998</LINK>) and in 1999 a 'National Plan to Eliminate Syphilis from the United States' was launched by the Surgeon General (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1999c" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1999c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2000</LINK>). A recent evaluation indicates that the syphilis elimination activities are overall having an impact on syphilis rates (<LINK REF="REF-Chesson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chesson 2008</LINK>), however, while syphilis rates declined until 2000 from 2001 to 2007 the rate of primary and secondary syphilis increased annually to 11,466 in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2009b</LINK>). The increase has been primarily among men and particularly those 'men who have sex with men' (MSM) who now account for around 52% of primary and secondary syphilis cases (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2009b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In England and Wales a similar pattern has been seen with a peak number of annual cases being reported shortly after the second World War, at 27,761 in 1946 (<LINK REF="REF-Macfarlane-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macfarlane 1984</LINK>). During the 1950s incidence was low but, after this, numbers gradually increased and peaked in the late 1970s at just under 4000 (<LINK REF="REF-Adler-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adler 1995</LINK>). Numbers then fell to very low levels and, in 1997, 150 new diagnoses of primary and secondary syphilis (100 males and 50 females) were reported by genitourinary medicine clinics (<LINK REF="REF-CDSC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDSC 1999</LINK>). However, from 1998 numbers of primary and secondary syphilis cases increased markedly (<LINK REF="REF-Chakraborty-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chakraborty 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doherty-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doherty 2002</LINK>) and in 2007 there were 3789 cases diagnosed with infectious syphilis (<LINK REF="REF-HPA-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">HPA 2009a</LINK>). Most (73%) of the cases of infectious syphilis between 1999 and 2008 were among MSM.</P>
<P>The increase in syphilis infections in Western Europe from very low levels has continued during the first decade of the 21st century (<LINK REF="REF-Eurosurveillance-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eurosurveillance 2004</LINK>), including in Denmark (<LINK REF="REF-Eurosurveillance-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eurosurveillance 2002</LINK>), Germany (<LINK REF="REF-Marcus-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcus 2005</LINK>), Scotland (<LINK REF="REF-Currie-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Currie 2008</LINK>) and Sweden (<LINK REF="REF-Velicko-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Velicko 2008</LINK>), Similar increases have been reported in Australia, Canada and New Zealand (<LINK REF="REF-Fenton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenton 2008</LINK>). Syphilis infection rates in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have increased dramatically in recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Deayton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deayton 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Linglof-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linglof 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rudnicka-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudnicka 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Z_x00e1_kouck_x00e1_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zákoucká 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>Treatment of syphilis with penicillin was a notable early success and has remained the preferred treatment of all types of syphilis since its first use for this indication by Mahoney in 1943 (<LINK REF="REF-Adler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adler 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rolfs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolfs 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1949" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1949</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willcox-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willcox 1981</LINK>). However, in strict terms of evidence from randomised controlled trials, neither the optimal dose nor the optimal duration of administration is known (<LINK REF="REF-Zenker-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zenker 1990</LINK>).Studies carried out in the 1940s indicated that the doubling time for T. pallidum was 30 to 33 hours in early disease (Magusen quoted in <LINK REF="REF-Zenker-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zenker 1990</LINK>). Idsoe (<LINK REF="REF-Idsoe-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Idsoe 1972</LINK>) after extensive review of treatment studies suggested that effective treatment of early syphilis required the maintenance of a minimal serum concentration of 0.03 I.U. of penicillin/ml (0.018 mug/ml) for seven to 10 days without interruption for more than 24 hours, however, it was admitted that the choice of this minimal treponemicidal level was rather arbitrary.</P>
<P>Other antibiotics have been used to treat primary and secondary syphilis including macrolides and cephalosporins (<LINK REF="REF-Fenton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenton 2008</LINK>). Doxycycline and tetracycline appear to be as effective as penicillin for the treatment of early syphilis (<LINK REF="REF-Ghanem-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghanem 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wong-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2008</LINK>). In 2005 the results of a randomised controlled trial of a single 2 g oral dose of azithromycin compared to 2.4 million units of penicillin G given intramuscularly for the treatment of early syphilis among high-risk populations (72% of the 328 included in the trial were women) in Mbeya, Tanzania were published (<LINK REF="REF-Riedner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riedner 2005</LINK>). This concluded that the randomised controlled trial "...provided clear evidence that a single 2 g dose of azithromycin is as effective as a 2.4 MU dose of penicillin G benzathine for the treatment of early syphilis....given logistical advantages conferred by this oral treatment, particularly in resource-poor settings in developing countries,...our findings support the wider use of this alternative regimen in syphilis-control programs". This has been confirmed by a meta analysis and a Cochrane review is being undertaken (<LINK REF="REF-Bai-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bai 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bai-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bai 2008b</LINK>). However, concerns have been raised about the emergence of azithromycin-resistant T. pallidum (<LINK REF="REF-Ballard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballard 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fenton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenton 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holmes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klausner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klausner 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riedner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riedner 2006</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Syphilis in pregnancy and congenital syphilis</HEADING>
<P>Although a mother can transmit syphilis to her baby at the time of delivery, the majority of cases of congenital syphilis arise from in utero infection (<LINK REF="REF-Shafii-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shafii 2008</LINK>). The infection is usually transmitted vertically from an infected pregnant woman via the placenta to her fetus and at least two-thirds of all babies born to untreated women with primary and secondary syphilis are infected (<LINK REF="REF-Chakraborty-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chakraborty 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woods-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zenker-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zenker 1990</LINK>). The risk to the fetus or baby varies considerably according to the stage of untreated syphilis of the mother and decreases as maternal disease progresses (<LINK REF="REF-Chakraborty-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chakraborty 2008</LINK>). The general obstetric history of a woman with untreated syphilis (known as Kassowitz's law) is that early pregnancies and when the mother has recently been infected end in abortion or a stillborn child, later pregnancies in full-term infants with congenital syphilis and even higher parities in unaffected infants. In other words the natural history, in terms of perinatal outcome, of untreated syphilis in women is that the infectivity and severity become less with each successive pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Chakraborty-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chakraborty 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Congenital syphilis is a systemic infection in which a baby might have been delivered prematurely and the classic description of the congenital syphilitic baby is a severely infected premature infant with marasmus, a pot belly, 'old man facies' and withered skin. Congenital syphilis is a serious condition which if not fatal at a young age, can cause permanent impairment, debilitation and disfigurement from the stigmata associated with this condition (<LINK REF="REF-Chakraborty-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chakraborty 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richens-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richens 2008</LINK>). The clinical state of failure to thrive may be correlated with the frequently encountered pathologic finding of intense pancreatitis and inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (<LINK REF="REF-Woods-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Syphilis can be transmitted transplacentally at all stages during the course of untreated maternal disease, from incubation, through primary, secondary, latent and to tertiary syphilis (<LINK REF="REF-Doroshenko-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doroshenko 2006</LINK>). Transplacental transmission during maternal spirochetamia can occur as early as nine to 10 weeks of gestation and at any subsequent times during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Woods-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2005</LINK>). Transmission in utero causes the wide dissemination of the organism in the fetus (analogous to secondary acquired syphilis) and pathologic changes have been seen as early as 15 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Woods-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2009</LINK>). It had been thought that dissemination of the infection occurred when the Langhans' cell layer began to atrophy during the fourth month of pregnancy and the fetus became increasingly exposed to the risk of infection (<LINK REF="REF-Woltz-1946" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woltz 1946</LINK>), but electron microscopy has demonstrated the persistence of the Langhans' cell throughout pregnancy and the detection of spirochaetes by immunofluorescent techniques in fetal tissue from spontaneous abortions at nine to 10 weeks of gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Shafii-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shafii 2008</LINK>). Failure to appreciate syphilis as a cause of first-trimester abortion is due to the fetus's inability to mount a characteristic histopathologic response until 18 to 20 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Shafii-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shafii 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the United States from the mid-1980s there were dramatic increases in congenital syphilis with the reported incidence increasing from 4.3 cases per 100,000 live births (158 cases) in 1983 to 107.0 cases per 100,000 live births (4398 cases) in 1991 (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 1993</LINK>). Since the implementation of 'National Plan to Eliminate Syphilis from the United States' in 1991 there was initially a substantial decline in syphilis including congenital syphilis (<LINK REF="REF-Chesson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chesson 2008</LINK>). From 1991 the congenital syphilis rate declined steadily (a decline of about 92% between 1992 and 2004) with a rate of 8.8 cases per 100,000 live births in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fenton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenton 2008</LINK>). The decline was not even throughout the country and for instance in Baltimore there was an epidemic of congenital syphilis in 1996 to 1997 with the rate rising to 282 per 100,000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1998b</LINK>). After 14 years of decline in the United States, the rate of congenital syphilis increased by 15.4% between 2005 and 2007 (from 9.1 to 10.5 cases per 100,000 live births (373 cases in 2006 and 430 in 2007) (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2009b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the last few decades of the 20th century, the incidence of congenital syphilis in the United Kingdom remained low (five cases in 1992 and for 1994 to 1997 seventeen children meeting case definitions for congenital syphilis, but none had definitive syphilis, nine were presumptive and eight were possible cases (<LINK REF="REF-Hurtig-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurtig 1998</LINK>), and with only two cases reported in 1996 (<LINK REF="REF-CDSC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDSC 1998</LINK>). This low incidence is ascribed largely to control of early acquired infectious syphilis in women through the screening of all pregnant women for syphilis (<LINK REF="REF-Adler-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adler 1995</LINK>). In the period 1994 to 1997 it is estimated that more than two million women were screened as part of antenatal care in the UK and of the 139 women who were reported to have been treated for syphilis during or within three months of pregnancy 121 were identified by antenatal screening alone (results from the British Co-operative Clinical Group Survey of Syphilis among Pregnant Women quoted in <LINK REF="REF-CDSC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDSC 1998</LINK>). However, between 1999 and 2007 the diagnoses of infectious syphilis among women more than doubled (from 136 to 448) and as the incidence among women has risen so have the numbers of babies born with congenital syphilis (<LINK REF="REF-HPA-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">HPA 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HPA-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">HPA 2009b</LINK>). Since 1999, around 10 cases of congenital syphilis have been reported each year by genitourinary clinics (<LINK REF="REF-HPA-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">HPA 2009a</LINK>) giving a rate of about 1.4 cases per 100,000, live births. Although these numbers probably represent only 30% to 50% of cases that occur (<LINK REF="REF-Simms-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simms 2006</LINK>). Similarly elsewhere in Europe congenital syphilis has remained at low levels with the annual number of cases in the Czech Republic between seven and 18 cases per year (<LINK REF="REF-Z_x00e1_kouck_x00e1_-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zákoucká 2004</LINK>), in France at six cases in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Nicolay-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolay 2008</LINK>), in Germany between seven and eight cases in recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Marcus-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcus 2005</LINK>) and in Poland between four and 16 cases annually (<LINK REF="REF-Rudnicka-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudnicka 2005</LINK>). In several countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union which have experienced marked economic and social reforms syphilis and congenital syphilis are on the rise (<LINK REF="REF-Shafii-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shafii 2008</LINK>). During the Soviet era antenatal care was free and accessible and congenital syphilis was rare. However, recent epidemics of syphilis in the Former Soviet Union have affected pregnant women and for instance in Moscow the prevalence of syphilis among pregnant women increased from 0.02% in 1990 to 0.33% in 1995 (quoted in <LINK REF="REF-CDSC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDSC 1998</LINK>). There have been equally dramatic increases in reported congenital syphilis in the Russian Federation from 29 in 1991 to 743 in 1999 (<LINK REF="REF-Tikonova-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tikonova 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In most developing countries syphilis is endemic and congenital syphilis continues to be a serious public health problem (<LINK REF="REF-Beltrami-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beltrami 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mascola-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mascola 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2007</LINK>). It is a major cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity in sub-Saharan AfricaIt and remains the leading cause of perinatal mortality resulting in an estimated 21%% of all perinatal deaths and about a third of stillbirths (<LINK REF="REF-Shafii-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shafii 2008</LINK>). For instance, at the University Teaching Hospital in Zambia almost 9% of infants had congenital syphilis (<LINK REF="REF-Chattopadhyay-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chattopadhyay 1988</LINK>) and in the Central Hospital of Maputo, Mozambique about 1% of neonates had congenital syphilis (<LINK REF="REF-Bastos-dos-Santos-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bastos dos Santos 1992</LINK>). It is estimated that about a million pregnancies globally are annually adversely affected by syphilis (about 270,000 babies are born with congenital syphilis, 460,000 pregnancies end in abortion or perinatal death and 270,000 babies are born prematurely or with low birthweight) (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2007</LINK>).  This is higher than for other major neonatal infections including HIV infection and tetanus.</P>
<P>Reported prevalences among women attending antenatal clinics in African, Asian and Latin American countries with positive sero-reactivity for syphilis range up to 19% (<LINK REF="REF-Desperthes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desperthes 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gichangi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gichangi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luthra-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luthra 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maggwa-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maggwa 1992</LINK>). Rates vary greatly with, for example, the reported prevalence in Asia of syphilis among pregnant women being generally below 5%, while in Latin America and the Caribbean rates tend to be higher at between 5% and 10%, in sub-Saharan Africa syphilis is common among women in the fertile age group, with national surveys undertaken over the past decade reporting rates ranging from 3.1% in Uganda to 4.2% in Madagascar, 6.6% in Ghana and 8.3% in Zambia (<LINK REF="REF-Shafii-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shafii 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2007</LINK>). Among pregnant women prevalence is frequently around 10% and rates as high as 17% have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Mbopi-Keou-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mbopi Keou 1998</LINK>). Reinfection with syphilis during pregnancy is also common with reports suggesting it occurs in about 10% of infected women (<LINK REF="REF-Qolahle-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qolahle 1995</LINK>). Several studies from sub-Saharan Africa have identified similar risk factors for maternal syphilis seroreactivity including fewer years of education, history of preterm delivery, none or few antenatal visits, maternal HIV infection, history of genital ulcer disease and several recent sexual partners (<LINK REF="REF-Shafii-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shafii 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>While there are very few time series, it appears that, the incidence of congenital syphilis is increasing in many developing countries; for instance Faundes (<LINK REF="REF-Faundes-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faundes 1992</LINK>) reports a 10-fold increase in congenital syphilis in the Brasilian Federal District from 0.17 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1980 to 1.7 in 1984. It is probable that these rates are underestimates of the actual situation and are unlikely to be due to cross reactivity with non-venereal treponemal infections (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The main factors associated with continuing rates of congenital syphilis cases in many 'affluent' countries have been the near-epidemic increase during the late 20th century in the incidence of primary and secondary syphilis among young females particularly among inner-city minorities; the use of crack cocaine and the exchange of illegal drugs for sex among multiple sex partners (<LINK REF="REF-Shafii-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shafii 2008</LINK>). In the United States while public health efforts have been successful in increasing syphilis screening in some populations over the last two decades, lack of prenatal care continues to be the major risk factor consistently associated with congenital syphilis (<LINK REF="REF-Fenton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenton 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shafii-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shafii 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In developing countries lack and poor quality of antenatal care appear to be an important risk factor for increasing numbers of mothers giving birth to babies with congenital syphilis (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 1998</LINK>). The need to maintain effective measures to prevent congenital syphilis is illustrated by China. The epidemic of the 1950s was halted in the 1960s and syphilis was virtually eliminated due to a government initiated programme of population screening, free treatment and a ban on prostitution (<LINK REF="REF-Shafii-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shafii 2008</LINK>). However, with a relaxation of economic and social systems including control of geographic mobility, syphilis and congenital syphilis have reached epidemic proportions (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Senanayake-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senanayake 2007</LINK>). Risk factors for congenital syphilis include, single status, less education, multiple sex partners, travel of partner in the past 12 months, a history of induced abortion and previous sexually transmitted infections (<LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2007</LINK>). A programme to control congenital syphilis has been recently established (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment of early infection with syphilis in pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>The success of penicillin for the treatment of syphilis in pregnant women was established in the 1940s soon after it became available (<I>see</I> summaries of early experience with penicillin in pregnancy: (<LINK REF="REF-Beerman-1945" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beerman 1945</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 1950</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ingraham-1948a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingraham 1948a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ingraham-1948b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingraham 1948b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jefferiss-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferiss 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kampmeier-1981b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kampmeier 1981b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stokes-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stokes 1950</LINK>). Prior to this, the standard treatment for syphilis during pregnancy was arsenic therapy involving a series of injections usually of neoarsphenamine plus bismuth often, with side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Paley-1937" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paley 1937</LINK>). While from the late 1940s penicillin became the standard treatment, in strict terms of evidence from randomised controlled trials, neither the optimal dose nor the optimal duration of administration is known (<LINK REF="REF-Zenker-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zenker 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Present treatment schedules are based on expert opinions which have been reinforced by case series and clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Fenton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenton 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wendel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wendel 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The 2006 CDC 'Guidelines for Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases' (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2006</LINK>) are similar to earlier CDC guidelines (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="REF-CDC-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2006</LINK>) and are reaffirmed by the US Preventive Services Task Force (<LINK REF="REF-U.S.-Preventive-Services-Task-Force-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolff-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolff 2009</LINK>). These guidelines recommend that "treatment during pregnancy should be the penicillin regimen appropriate for the stage of syphilis". These are: for primary and secondary syphilis, benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly in a single dose; early latent syphilis, benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly in a single dose; late latent syphilis or latent syphilis of unknown duration, benzathine penicillin G 7.2 million units total, administered as three doses of benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly each at one week intervals. It is recommended that treatment of primary and secondary syphilis in HIV-infected persons should be "... with benzathine penicillin G , 2.4 million units i.m., as for HIV-negative patients". The CDC Guidelines note that "parenteral penicillin G is the only therapy with documented efficacy for neurosyphilis or for syphilis during pregnancy.... Penicillin is effective for preventing maternal transmission to the fetus.... Evidence is insufficient to determine whether specific, recommended penicillin regimens are optimal.... Some experts recommend additional therapy in some settings. A second dose of penicillin 2.4 million units i.m. may be administered one week after the initial dose for women who have primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis".</P>
<P>The CDC guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2006</LINK>) note that " the efficacy of penicillin for the treatment of syphilis was well established through clinical experience even before the value of randomized controlled clinical trials was recognized. Therefore, nearly all the recommendations for the treatment of syphilis are based on the opinions of persons knowledgeable about STDs and are reinforced by case series, clinical trials, and 50 years of clinical experience. Parenteral penicillin G is the only therapy with documented efficacy for syphilis during pregnancy". "Parenteral penicillin G has been used effectively for more than 50 years to achieve clinical resolution (i.e., healing of lesions and prevention of sexual transmission) and to prevent late sequelae. However, no comparative trials have been adequately conducted to guide the selection of an optimal penicillin (i.e., the dose, duration, and preparation). Substantially fewer data are available for nonpenicillin regimens". "Treatment failure can occur with any regimen. However, assessing response to treatment frequently is difficult, and definitive criteria for cure or failure have not been established". "Clinical trial data have demonstrated that 15% of patients with early syphilis treated with the recommended therapy will not achieve a two dilution decline in nontreponemal titer used to define response at 1 year after treatment (<I>100</I>). Failure of nontreponemal test titers to decline fourfold within 6 months after therapy for primary or secondary syphilis might be indicative of probable treatment failure". " Penicillin is effective for preventing maternal transmission to the fetus and for treating fetal infection. Evidence is insufficient to determine specific, recommended penicillin regimens that are optimal".</P>
<P>The International Union against Sexually Transmitted Infections (IUSTI) and the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region recommend either: benzathine penicillin 2.4 units intramuscularly as a single dose (1.2 million units in each buttock or 2.4 million units as a single dose; or procaine penicillin 600,000 to 1.2 million units intramuscularly daily during 10 to 14 days (<LINK REF="REF-French-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2009</LINK>). Recommendations in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Venereology-Society-of-Victoria-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venereology Society of Victoria 2002</LINK>), Canada (<LINK REF="REF-Public-Health-Agency-of-Canada-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Public Health Agency of Canada 2006</LINK>) and the UK (<LINK REF="REF-AGUM_x002c_-MSSVD-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">AGUM, MSSVD 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kingston-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kingston 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 2003, the European Office of WHO published a review of different antibiotic regimens (principally using penicillin) for treating syphilis followed in different European countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-Euro-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Euro 2003</LINK>). WHO Geneva in 2003 as part of "Guidelines for the Management of Sexually Transmitted Infections" recommended that for syphilis "pregnant patients at all stages of pregnancy, who are not allergic to penicillin, should be treated with penicillin according to the dosage schedules recommended for the treatment of non-pregnant patients at a similar stage of the disease" which give those recommended by CDC and as alternatives those proposed in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Reservations have been raised regarding whether recommended schedules for the treatment of syphilis during pregnancy are adequate (<LINK REF="REF-Conover-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conover 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Galan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hardy-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardy 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hollier-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollier 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monif-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monif 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rawstron-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rawstron 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richardson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheffield-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheffield 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tourneux-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tourneux 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wendel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wendel 2002</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Treatment of syphilis in pregnancy can lead to development of the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myles-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myles 1998</LINK>). "The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is similar in frequency, character, and intensity to that in non-pregnant adults, but gravidas may have increased uterine activity and transient alterations in fetal well-being. The pregnant patient with a severely affected fetus with congenital syphilis may experience preterm labour, preterm delivery, or fetal death in association with the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction" (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>A separate issue is allergy to penicillin which in the United States is estimated to be between 5% and 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Wendel-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wendel 1985</LINK>). However, desensitisation, under close supervision, with increasing oral doses of penicillin over four to six hours (<LINK REF="REF-Wendel-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wendel 1985</LINK>) or a slowly increasing infusion of penicillin G (<LINK REF="REF-Ziaya-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziaya 1986</LINK>), and then treatment with penicillin appear safe and effective.</P>
<P>There have been concerns raised that the "resurgence in the incidence of congenital syphilis in the United States" was because of inadequate levels of penicillin following recommended guidelines. A small study showed "a wide range of penicillin levels ...in gravidas at term in the maternal serum, cerebro-spinal fluid, umbilical cord serum, and amniotic fluid within one week after 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin G intramuscularly (i.m.)" (<LINK REF="REF-Nathan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathan 1993</LINK>). The precise penicillin regimens for the treatment of early syphilis and syphilis during pregnancy and congenital syphilis remain controversial issues (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crowe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowe 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rolfs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolfs 1995</LINK>). For instance in the United States, depot preparations of penicillin, usually benzathine penicillin G (BPG), are preferred for the treatment of early syphilis (one dose of 2.4 million units intramuscularly), because they are easier to administer, are inexpensive, and do not require frequent readministration (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hook-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hook 1992</LINK>). While in the United Kingdom treatment with daily injections of procaine penicillin (0.6 to 0.9 million units daily for 10 to 14 days intramuscularly) is preferred (<LINK REF="REF-Adler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adler 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDSC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDSC 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kingston-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kingston 2008</LINK>). The regimen of benzathine penicillin G recommended by the CDC for treatment of early syphilis, one dose of 2.4 million units intramuscularly (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1998a</LINK>), has been criticised on the grounds that it does not achieve treponemicidal levels in CSF (<LINK REF="REF-Hook-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hook 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Polinikorn-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polinikorn 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rolfs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolfs 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1956</LINK>). This debate about appropriate penicillin preparations and adequate dosage regimens to treat syphilis has been reopened in the light of reports of inadequately treated cases of syphilis in patients who are seropositive to HIV, despite following agreed treatment schedules (<LINK REF="REF-Crowe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowe 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hook-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hook 1992</LINK>). Although a randomised trial of two treatments (2.4 million units of penicillin G and that therapy enhanced with a 10-day course of amoxicillin and probenecid) for early syphilis in non-pregnant people with and without HIV infection found that the enhanced treatment "...did not improve outcomes" (<LINK REF="REF-Rolfs-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolfs 1997</LINK>). The high seroconversion rates for both syphilis and HIV during pregnancy found in certain populations has led to the suggestion that screening of women twice during a pregnancy for these diseases might be justified (<LINK REF="REF-Qolahle-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qolahle 1995</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">The costs of treating and not treating syphilis in pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>The hospital costs of caring for newborn infants with congenital syphilis are considerable (<LINK REF="REF-Bateman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bateman 1997</LINK>) and cost- benefit studies in developed countries indicate the substantial advantages of screening pregnant women for syphilis (<LINK REF="REF-Stray_x002d_Pedersen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stray-Pedersen 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1985</LINK>). This has led several people to emphasise the importance of continued routine screening programmes in, for instance, North America (<LINK REF="REF-Genc-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Genc 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ray-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ray 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanchez-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmid-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmid 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheffield-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheffield 1999</LINK>) and the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Hurtig-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurtig 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicoll-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicoll 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sweeney-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeney 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Welch-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welch 1998</LINK>). Although, in view of the low incidence in the UK, it has been suggested that targeted screening might be more cost-effective. The United Kingdom National Screening Committee has considered a 'systematic review and national options appraisal' (undertaken before the recent increase in numbers of congenital syphilis) dealing with antenatal syphilis screening in the UK carried out by the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre and decided that "screening should continue" and that "antenatal screening was effective and that only a small amount (of resources) would be saved by withdrawing the service" (<LINK REF="REF-Connor-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NSC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSC 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several studies have documented how screening and treatment of maternal syphilis is cost-effective particularly in developing countries in preventing congenital syphilis (<LINK REF="REF-Blandford-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blandford 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gloyd-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gloyd 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rydzak-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rydzak 2008</LINK>). In the early 1990s, it was estimated that in many developing countries an adverse outcome associated with syphilis during pregnancy could be averted at a cost of US$12, which includes the cost of the diagnostic test (rapid plasma reagin) and penicillin. This compares favourably with cost estimates per-childhood-death-prevented for measles of US$41, pertussis US$100 and neonatal tetanus US$153 for immunisation (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1992</LINK>). More recently, WHO (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>) cites antenatal screening and treatment for syphilis as one of the most cost-effective health interventions available:cost of interventions per day saved at US$ 2 to 20 for expansion of childhood immunizations; US$ 7 to 28 for oral rehydration therapy; US$ 50 to 200 for prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (15% prevalence) and US$ 4 to 18 for antenatal syphilis screening (8% prevalence).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Problems with studying syphilis treatment</HEADING>
<P>Syphilis is a difficult disease to study as the natural history in an individual can often cover several decades and both the diagnosis and the outcome are usually made on the results of serology and not clinically or bacteriologically. Because the development of neurosyphilis (or other late sequelae) cannot be predicted, long-term follow up is needed to measure treatment efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Garnett-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garnett 1997</LINK>). Instead of performing long-term follow up and observation, investigators usually monitor titers of non-treponemal antibody to assess the response to treatment.</P>
<P>Because of penicillin's immediate clinical success very few further clinical trials after an initial period of intensive investigation were carried out and over time the recommended penicillin regimens have changed only slightly (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1976a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1976a</LINK>). Furthermore, because the early studies occurred before modern clinical-trial methodology was fully developed, interpretation of the results is problematical (<LINK REF="REF-Zenker-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zenker 1990</LINK>). As a result, while current regimens for syphilis therapy appear to be largely effective, they may or may not be optimal. With the accumulation of reports of treatment failures and the appearance of HIV, current regimens for the treatment of syphilis are being questioned. Zenker (<LINK REF="REF-Zenker-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zenker 1990</LINK>) has noted the evaluation of syphilis treatment trials is complicated by three factors: first, many studies lack the essentials of good study design: randomisation, blinding, an adequate number of patients (i.e., statistical power), and inclusion of a control group; second, because T. pallidum cannot be routinely cultured, diagnosis of active disease often relies on serology tests; third, the natural history of syphilis necessitates long-term follow up to assess treatment efficacy. Because of the last two factors, studies should have clearly defined entry and outcome criteria, but rarely do. As a result, treatment trials are difficult to evaluate, and optimal treatment regimens are difficult to determine (<LINK REF="REF-Zenker-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zenker 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>In view of increasing incidence of syphilis and congenital syphilis in many countries and reports (albeit relatively few) of apparent non-response to current antibiotic regimens, questions have been more frequently raised about whether the established regimens to treat pregnant women with syphilis and babies born with congenital syphilis are optimal and effective (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Giles-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giles 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hook-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hook 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hook-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hook 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mascola-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mascola 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCraken-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCraken 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Musher-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musher 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rawstron-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rawstron 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rolfs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolfs 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Eijk-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Eijk 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zenker-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zenker 1990</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-01-14 14:52:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Syphilis in pregnancy with the consequent likelihood of severe long-term morbidity in the mother and fatal or severely debilitating sequelae in her fetus has been largely controlled in affluent countries through effective screening and treatment programmes (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1999c" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1999c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NSC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSC 2000</LINK>), although in recent years there has been some increase in numbers (<LINK REF="REF-Fenton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenton 2008</LINK>). In countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union and to an even greater extent in many developing countries the morbidity caused by syphilis and particularly congenital syphilis is increasing and significant. This has become even more of a burden in populations where the HIV/AIDS epidemic is severe. This is tragic because since the introduction of penicillin in the 1940s a very effective means of treatment of syphilis and of the prevention of congenital syphilis has been available. It is also notable and extremely fortuitous that since then no penicillin resistance has been found among any T. pallidum isolates (<LINK REF="REF-Shafii-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shafii 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In an ideal situation, treatment policies for pregnant women who are infected with syphilis should be based on research which compares an intervention group and a control group of pregnant women with syphilis who are randomly allocated to treatment by different schedules or doses, or both, of antibiotics. However, the efficacy of penicillin in the treatment of particularly early syphilis in pregnant women in terms of curing the infection in the woman and also preventing a baby being born with congenital syphilis was dramatically established shortly after the introduction of penicillin. The effective treatment of syphilis including pregnant women with the infection was a notable early success of the use of penicillin during the 1940s. The recommended penicillin regimen for the treatment of syphilis in pregnant women developed at this time (<LINK REF="STD-Cole-1946" TYPE="STUDY">Cole 1946</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cole-1949" TYPE="STUDY">Cole 1949</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cross-1949" TYPE="STUDY">Cross 1949</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ingraham-1946" TYPE="STUDY">Ingraham 1946</LINK>) has changed very little over the past 60 or so years and certainly since the development of long-acting preparations of penicillin G in the early 1950s (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1962</LINK>).</P>
<P>A prospective case series carried out in 1987 to 1989 involving 340 women treated antepartum with 2.4 MU of benzathine penicillin G has generally confirmed the effectiveness of benzathine penicillin G for the treatment of maternal infection with syphilis and the prevention of congenital syphilis (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1999</LINK>). Congenital transmission was prevented in 98% of patients representing all stages of syphilis; congenital transmission was prevented in 95% and 98% of women with secondary and early latent syphilis respectively. This study found the ".. highest risk of fetal treatment failure exists with maternal secondary syphilis".</P>
<P>However, as noted by Rolfs "though the efficacy of penicillin is firmly established, the scientific evidence for specific recommendations is weak by current standards for clinical investigation" (<LINK REF="REF-Rolfs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolfs 1995</LINK>). Rolfs (<LINK REF="REF-Rolfs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolfs 1995</LINK>) also notes that "although these early studies did not utilise methods considered standard practice for acceptable clinical trials today - particularly randomised, concurrent comparisons between different therapy regimens - many were carefully conducted and involved large numbers of patients. Several conclusions can be drawn from these early studies: (1) both duration and dosage of therapy were important, (2) re-treatment rates were lowest for primary infections and highest for patients with second-stage infection, (3) long-acting preparations were probably as effective as regimens using multiple injections of aqueous crystalline or procaine penicillin G."</P>
<P>The latest CDC 'Guidelines for Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases' (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2006</LINK>) recommend that "treatment during pregnancy should be the penicillin regimen appropriate for the stage of syphilis". These are: for primary and secondary syphilis, benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units i.m. in a single dose; early latent syphilis, benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units i.m. in a single dose; late latent syphilis or latent syphilis of unknown duration, benzathine penicillin G 7.2 million units total, administered as three doses of benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units i.m. each at one week intervals. It is recommended that treatment of primary and secondary syphilis in HIV-infected persons should be "... with benzathine penicillin G , 2.4 million units i.m., as for HIV-negative patients". The CDC Guidelines note that "parenteral penicillin G is the only therapy with documented efficacy for ... for syphilis during pregnancy.... Penicillin is effective for preventing maternal transmission to the fetus.... Evidence is insufficient to determine whether specific, recommended penicillin regimens are optimal.... Some experts recommend additional therapy in some settings. A second dose of penicillin 2.4 million units i.m. may be administered one week after the initial dose for women who have primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis".</P>
<P>In the United Kingdom treatment of primary, secondary and early latent syphilis is usually with daily injections of procaine penicillin (0.6 to 0.9 million units daily for 10 to 14 days intramuscularly) and for late latent and tertiary syphilis (excluding neurosyphilis) the daily injections are continued for 17 to 21 days (<LINK REF="REF-Adler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adler 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AGUM_x002c_-MSSVD-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">AGUM, MSSVD 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDSC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDSC 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crowe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowe 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kingston-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kingston 2008</LINK>). The incidence of congenital syphilis in the United States in 1999 was 14.3 cases per 100,000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2000</LINK>) compared to 6.2 in the United Kingdom for the three years 1994 to 1996 (results from the British Co-operative Clinical Group Survey of Syphilis among Pregnant Women quoted in <LINK REF="REF-CDSC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDSC 1998</LINK>). Clearly many factors other than the antibiotic regimen used to treat syphilis during pregnancy such as the coverage of antenatal care could explain these differences. However, concerns have been raised on several occasions that the standard dose of benzathine penicillin G (2.4 million units) recommended by CDC does not achieve adequate concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid and may not be the most effective therapy regimen. These concerns have been heightened as treatment failures appear to be more common in women with HIV and those who deliver soon after treatment has begun (<LINK REF="REF-Crowe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowe 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hook-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hook 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McFarlin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarlin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rawstron-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rawstron 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rolfs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolfs 1995</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>The high seroconversion rates for both syphilis and HIV during pregnancy found in South Africa led to the suggestion that screening of women twice during a pregnancy for these diseases is justified (<LINK REF="REF-Qolahle-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qolahle 1995</LINK>). It has also been suggested that a second dose of penicillin 2.4 million units should be given as standard practice (<LINK REF="REF-Genc-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Genc 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Markovitz-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markovitz 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mascola-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mascola 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>An underlying issue is that uncertainty continues about what are the appropriate treatment regimens for syphilis during pregnancy as, in strict terms of evidence from randomised controlled trials, neither the optimal dose nor the optimal duration of administration is known (<LINK REF="REF-Zenker-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zenker 1990</LINK>).</P>

<P>Further studies are needed to evaluate treatment failure cases with currently recommended regimens and this should include an assessment of the role of HIV infection in cases of prenatal syphilis treatment failure.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of various antibiotic regimens for the treatment of primary and secondary syphilis in pregnant women needs to be assessed using randomised controlled trials which compare them with existing recommendations. These studies should also document possible side effects of the various treatments. The comparisons could include one and two injections of 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin G, daily injections of procaine penicillin 0.6 to 0.9 million units for 10 to 14 days, one injection of 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin G followed by a course of amoxicillin/ampicillin and probenecid or high-dose amoxicillin/ampicillin and probenecid for syphilis.</P>
<P>These comparisons could be carried out for the treatment of primary and secondary syphilis detected before the last trimester and probably more importantly for those detected in the last trimester.</P>
<P>Consideration could also be given to trials which assess the effectiveness of treatment with oral antibiotics such as 2 g single-dose azithromycin compared to benzathine penicillin G or procaine penicillin, or both. Treatment with oral antibiotics could be particularly relevant in resource-poor countries where the availability of safe needles and syringes cannot be guaranteed.</P>

<P>A non-randomised trial to evaluate prospectively the 1988 CDC recommended regimens for the treatment of antepartum syphilis and prevention of congenital syphilis. This was a prospective evaluation of recommended syphilis treatment regimens carried out from September 1, 1987, to August 31, 1989, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Texas, U.S.A. Women with syphilis were staged and treated according to CDC recommendations. Treatment included 2.4 million units of i.m. benzathine penicillin G for primary, secondary, or early latent (less than 1 year) syphilis. Women with late latent (uncertain or longer than 1 year) syphilis were treated with 7.2 million units of benzathine penicillin G i.m. over 3 weeks. During the study period, 448 of 28,552 women (1.6%) who delivered were diagnosed with syphilis. 108 were diagnosed at delivery and treated postpartum. The remaining 340 (75.9%) gravidas with untreated syphilis attending the prenatal clinic comprised the study group. The success of therapy in preventing congenital syphilis was as follows: primary syphilis, 27 of 27; secondary syphilis, 71 of 75; early latent syphilis, 100 of 102; and late latent syphilis, 136 of 136. The success rate for all stages of syphilis was 334 of 340 (98.2%). The success rate of therapy in secondary syphilis was significantly different from that of the other groups (P = 0.03). 2 of the 6 fetal treatment failures produced preterm stillborns. Only one maternal treatment failure occurred, in a human immunodeficiency virus-infected woman. The authors conclude that the CDC-recommended regimens for the prevention of congenital syphilis and treatment of maternal infection are effective, but the highest risk of fetal treatment failure exists with maternal secondary syphilis.</P>

<P>A case series of 31 pregnant women from Baltimore, U.S.A. recruited prior to September 1945, all of whom had early infectious (primary or secondary) syphilis at the time of treatment. These women from Baltimore are compared with the Philadelphia series (26 mothers) of Ingraham (1946). Both series were similar with regard to: type of infection, primary 7/57, secondary 50/57; single course of penicillin 52/57 and multiple courses 5/57; duration of treatment 4 to 15 days; duration of pregnancy 14/57 &lt; 16 weeks, 31/57 16-32 weeks, 12/57 &gt; 32 weeks. Most (48/57) received 1.2 to 2.4 million units of penicillin. Of the 57 women, 3 had 2 pregnancies during the period covered by the article and thus there were 60 infants born and only in 1 was a diagnosis of congenital syphilis made. A comparison is also made with an historical case series carried out in the 1930s of pregnant women with syphilis treated with metal chemotherapy ('standard' arsenic-bismuth-mercury) in terms of arsphenamine. Depending on the stage of pregnancy this was administered by weekly, or 3 times weekly or by intravenous drip or multiple syringe injection over 5 to 10 days. The cure figures are given for different doses of arsphenamine. These range for early syphilis (71 cases) from: no treatment 5% normal infant and 95% almost certainly syphilitic, to for 3+ gm arsphenamine 95% almost certainly normal and 5% almost certainly syphilitic; and for late (usually latent) syphilis (579) cases from: no treatment 35% almost certainly normal and 65% almost certainly syphilitic, to 3+ gm arsphenamine 98% almost certainly normal and 2% almost certainly syphilitic. The article recommends that "... in syphilitic pregnant women penicillin be used routinely for the prevention of prenatal syphilis, other methods of treatment being abandoned." "The total dose of penicillin should not be less than 2.4 million units administered intramuscularly and over not less than 7.5 days."</P>

<P>An article which summarises a case series concerned with the outcome of pregnancy of 1959 women with syphilis from the University of Pennsylvania, (484 women) and Philadelphia General Hospital (1475 women) U.S.A. and of which 1063 received penicillin. "All cases are included ... in which the surviving infant was followed for at least 60 days and in whom at the time of the last medical observation there seemed no reasonable doubt as to the presence or absence of syphilis." In addition "for adequate clinical statistical analysis of the value of penicillin in the prevention of congenital syphilis, it was felt that three types of control groups were necessary. In the first place, since normal, or non-syphilitic, pregnancy does not invariably result in the birth of a full term living infant it was felt that data on the results from a comparable group of pregnancies from which syphilis had been excluded, in so far as possible, were a requisite. This information was obtained through inclusion in the study of such a control group giving outcome of pregnancy in 10,323 mothers at the Philadelphia General Hospital for the years 1945 to 1949 inclusive, in whom syphilis was ruled out .... Secondly, it seemed necessary to obtain information concerning the effect of untreated syphilis on the outcome of pregnancy in comparable material over a period concurrent with the study ... In the 10 years 1940 to 1949 inclusive it was possible to derive information at the Philadelphia General Hospital on the outcome of 302 untreated syphilitic pregnancies, 220 with early syphilis and 82 cases with late syphilis at the time of delivery ... In controlling the results of penicillin therapy in this field it also seemed highly desirable to have information in a comparable series of cases concerning the outcome of pregnancy when arsenic and bismuth, which it is proposed be replaced by penicillin, is employed. Such a group ... with early syphilis was found at Philadelphia General Hospital for the interval January 1940 to August 1946 inclusive ... This group of cases numbers 594." The authors conclude that: "the probability of pregnancy, uncomplicated by syphilis, resulting in a normal full-term living infant is about 86% .... Untreated early syphilis ... resulted in a dead or diseased infant in about 82% of cases .... (and in) untreated women with late syphilis the likelihood of a normal full term infant was 3 in 4 (75%) and of a living full-term syphilitic infant only 2.4%, though the stillbirth rate at 12.2% continued to remain higher than that of the normal control group ... Effective dosage of penicillin given to 663 women with early syphilis during pregnancy resulted in 92.5% normal full-term living infants and only 1.5% living syphilitic infants. The most practical tested course for average use would consist in 600,000 Oxford units procaine penicillin G in oil with 2% aluminium monostearate once daily for 10 days ... An analysis of 267 pregnant women treated for early syphilis with more than 10 weeks arsenicals, with or without bismuth, in the period immediately preceding the introduction of penicillin yielded results not statistically different from the penicillin treated group. Nonetheless, ease of administration and short duration of therapy, lack of toxicity and the ability to cure in utero the already infected fetus, makes penicillin alone the preferred treatment in the prevention of congenital syphilis".</P>

<P>A case series of pregnant women with a positive serologic test for syphilis and who had early or latent infection and were treated with benzathine penicillin G (BPG) at the Jefferson Davis Hospital and the Social Hygiene Clinic, Houston, Texas, U.S.A. from December 1957 to August 1960. 130 women were studied; 90 had received 2.4 million units BPG (group 1) and 40 either 4.8 or 7.2 million units BPG (group 2). In addition "...20 pregnant women with evidence of syphilis who came to delivery without having had any antisyphilitic therapy" were included in the study (group 3). The outcome of these groups was: group 1: 77 infants with non-reactive serology at 3 to 8 months age, 1 with congenital syphilis (mother treated 6 days prior to delivery for secondary syphilis), 11 lost to follow up, 1 complete abortion of non-syphilitic fetus; group 2: 29 infants with non-reactive serology at 3 to 8 months age, 0 with congenital syphilis, 9 lost to follow up, 2 infant deaths neither showed evidence of syphilis; group 3: 11 infants with non-reactive serology at 3 to 8 months age, 8 with congenital syphilis, 1 lost to follow up, 0 deaths. The authors conclude that "a dosage of 2.4 mU of aqueous BPG given at the time of diagnosis can be recommended as an adequate form of treatment for early and latent syphilis in pregnancy. Following any therapeutic regimen, serologic and clinical evaluation of the baby should be carried out at the age of 3 to 6 months".</P>

The patients were divided into 3 groups: group 1, 149 patients treated during pregnancy (123 early infectious syphilis and 26 latent syphilis); group 2, 84 patients treated prior to pregnancy (all early infectious syphilis); and group 3, 26 patients who were re-treated for relapse or reinfection following their initial treatment (23 relapsed or were reinfected during pregnancy and 3 relapsed prior to pregnancy). Various treatment schedules were used ranging from 600,000 units of penicillin to 4,000,000 units and in some cases arsenoxide was added. The results reported were: group 1: 114 non-syphilitic babies, 16 probably non-syphilitic babies but follow up less than 16 weeks, 10 abortions or premature deliveries but syphilis was excluded as a cause in all of them; group 2: from 86 pregnancies in 84 women, 73 non-syphilitic babies, "4 mishaps that were not attributable to syphilis" and 1 congenital syphilis; group 3: 3 relapses after arsenoxide and fever therapy, at least 6 were re-infections and the re-treatment schedules were varied, the outcomes, 20 non-syphilitic babies, 3 probably non-syphilitic babies and 2 late abortions and 1 stillbirth, possibly due to syphilis.

<P>2 case series are presented, A of 281 pregnant women "in all stages of syphilis" treated in Philadelphia, U.S.A. from September 1946 until April 1948 with 2.4 million Oxford units of aqueous penicillin (crystalline G) given i.m. in 60 individual doses of 40,000 units each every 3 hours (71/2 days) and B "... 73 pregnancies in women who were treated for syphilis with penicillin prior to conception." The authors state "to evaluate even more thoroughly the results of penicillin therapy we have exercised 3 types of clinical control not generally employed in previous studies." These were group 1: the outcome of all non-syphilitic pregnancies occurring in the obstetrical service; group 2: outcome of pregnancy among syphilitic women who delivered during the period of the study without receiving any anti-syphilitic therapy; group 3: "... outcome of 390 pregnancies (401 infants) in which the syphilitic mother had been treated with varying amounts of arsenical and bismuth in the years just prior to the advent of penicillin treatment." The results were as follows: for group 1 (5596 non-syphilitic deliveries) 87.6% normal living infants, 170 neonatal deaths, 160 premature infants and 320 miscarriages; group 2, (75 untreated syphilitics, 90.4% with either latent or late syphilis), 29 normal live births, 21 congenital syphilitics, 4 neonatal deaths, 12 stillbirths, 4 premature infants and 5 miscarriages; group 3: 22 mothers with congenital syphilis were excluded from further analyses, 194 pregnant women with early syphilis who gave birth to 198 infants of whom 171 were normal, 13 had congenital syphilis, 3 neonatal deaths, 7 stillbirths and 4 premature infants; 174 pregnant women with latent syphilis who gave birth to 180 infants, 160 normal, none with congenital syphilis, 4 neonatal deaths, 10 stillbirths. Of the group of 281 syphilitic women treated with penicillin during pregnancy, 18 had early syphilis, 161 early latent syphilis and 88 late syphilis and 14 had congenital syphilis and were excluded from further analysis. Of the 179 with early or early latent syphilis: 171 delivered normal infants, 3 syphilitic living infants, 2 neonatal deaths, 2 stillbirths 2 premature infants and 1 miscarriage. The 88 pregnant mothers with late syphilis delivered 90 infants, 88 normal, none with congenital syphilis and 2 neonatal deaths. 71 women (with 73 infants) were treated with penicillin prior to being pregnant for syphilis and gave birth to 68 normal infants, 1 with congenital syphilis, 2 neonatal deaths, 1 stillbirth and 1 miscarriage. The authors conclude their article by stating that "in this study aqueous penicillin (crystalline G) was employed in total dosage of 2.4 million oxford units over a period of 71/2 days in 60 injections of 40,000 units each. Because of its ease of administration and effectiveness it should replace completely arsenical and bismuth treatment".</P>

<P>In the background, you discuss development of the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction as a complication of treatment of syphilis and imply desensitisation with penicillin may protect against this reaction. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is not due to penicillin allergy. The references quoted (Wendel 1985, Ziaya 1986) relate to desensitisation for penicillin allergy. There are no data to suggest that desensitisation has any ameliorating effect on the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.</P>
