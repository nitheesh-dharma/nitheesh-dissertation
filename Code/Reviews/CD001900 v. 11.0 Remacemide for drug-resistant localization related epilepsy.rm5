<P>Remacemide has only a modest effect as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant localization related (partial) epilepsy.</P>
<P>Epilepsy is a disorder where recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain. Most seizures can be controlled by a single antiepileptic drug but sometimes they are resistant to those drugs. The review of trials found that the new drug, remacemide, has only a modest effect on seizures and was more likely to be withdrawn than placebo.

<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in issue 4, 2002.</P>
<P>Epilepsy is a common neurological condition, affecting 0.5% to 1% of the population. Nearly 30% of people with epilepsy have seizures that are refractory to currently available drugs. In response to this problem, potential new drugs are being developed. Remacemide is one of these.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effects of add-on treatment with remacemide upon seizures, adverse effects, cognition and quality of life for people with drug-resistant localization related epilepsy.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-08-31 12:26:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (31 August 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL issue 3 of 4, <I>The Cochrane Library </I>2011) and MEDLINE (1948 to August week 3, 2011). In addition, we contacted AstraZeneca (makers of remacemide) and colleagues in the field to see if they were aware of any trials that we had missed.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized placebo controlled add-on trials of people of any age with localization related seizures, in which an adequate method of concealment of randomization was used. The studies could be blinded or unblinded and be of parallel or crossover design. They had to have a minimum treatment period of eight weeks.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion. Outcomes investigated included 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, treatment withdrawal, adverse effects, effects on cognition and quality of life. The primary analyses were by intention-to-treat. Dose response was evaluated in regression models.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two parallel group trials were included representing 514 individuals. Daily doses of 300 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg and 1200 mg of remacemide were tested. The overall relative risk (RR) for remacemide versus placebo with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency was 1.59 (95% CI 0.91 to 2.79). Due to differences in response rates among trials, regression models were unable to provide reliable estimates of responses to individual doses. Regression models did however suggest a significant effect for 800 mg to 1200 mg remacemide per day. Remacemide was more likely to be withdrawn than placebo, the RR for treatment withdrawal was 1.90 (95% CI 1.00 to 3.60). The RR for dizziness indicates that it is significantly associated with remacemide 3.08 (99% CI 1.37 to 6.95). Effects on cognition and quality of life were not reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Given the modest effect on seizure frequency and significant withdrawal rate it is unlikely that remacemide will be further developed as an antiepileptic drug.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-11 09:41:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 4, 2002) on 'Remacemide for drug-resistant localization related epilepsy'.</P>
<P>Epilepsy is a common neurological condition, with an estimated incidence of 50 per 100,000 and prevalence of 5 to 10 per 1000 in the developed world (<LINK REF="REF-Sander-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sander 1996</LINK>). Between two to three per cent of the population will be given a diagnosis of epilepsy at some time in their lives (<LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1993</LINK>), the majority of whom will go into remission. However, up to 30% will develop refractory epilepsy, despite treatment with combinations of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (<LINK REF="REF-Cockerell-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockerell 1995</LINK>). The majority of people with refractory epilepsy have partial onset (localization related) seizures which are divided into three types: simple partial; complex partial and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Commission-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Commission 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Over the past 10 to 15 years, there has been renewed interest in the development of new AEDs, as standard drugs (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate) do not control all of our patients' seizures, and they are not without adverse effects. As a result, there is continued interest in the development of newer AEDs, and one such drug is remacemide, the subject of this review.</P>
<P>Remacemide is a novel antiepileptic agent which emerged from a drug discovery programme aimed at creating a molecule with a three-dimensional structure similar to that of phenytoin (<LINK REF="REF-Rogawski-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogawski 1990</LINK>). It is chemically unrelated to any other anticonvulsant, and would appear to act via a unique non-competitive block of NMDA receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1993</LINK>) as well as some inhibition of sustained repetitive neuronal firing (<LINK REF="REF-Cheung-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 1992</LINK>) probably via blocking activity at sodium channels (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1995</LINK>). The former action may provide some neuroprotectant activity in a wide range of neurological conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Garske-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garske 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this review, we assess the effects of remacemide when used as an add-on treatment in people with drug-resistant localization related epilepsy. As well as investigating its effect on seizures and adverse effects, we planned to assess its effect on cognitive function and quality of life. This review is one in a series of reviews investigating the new AEDs.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effects of remacemide when used as an add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant localization related epilepsy.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2011-08-31 12:27:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>(1) Randomized controlled trials, in which an adequate method of concealment of randomization was used (e.g. allocation of sequentially sealed packages of medication, sealed opaque envelopes, telephone randomization).<BR/>(2) Double, single or unblinded trials.<BR/>(3) Placebo controlled.<BR/>(4) Parallel group or crossover studies. <BR/>(5) Minimum treatment period of eight weeks.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Individuals of any age with drug-resistant localization related epilepsy (ie experiencing simple partial, complex partial or secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>(1) The active treatment group received treatment with remacemide in addition to conventional antiepileptic drug treatment.<BR/>(2) The control group received matched placebo in addition to conventional antiepileptic drug treatment.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>
<B>
<I>(1) 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency</I>
</B>
<BR/>The proportion of individuals with a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency in the treatment period compared to the pre-randomization baseline period. This outcome was chosen as it is commonly reported in this type of study, and can be calculated for studies that do not report this outcome provided that baseline seizure data were recorded.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>(2) Treatment withdrawal</I>
</B>
<BR/>The proportion of individuals having treatment withdrawn during the course of the treatment period was chosen as a measure of global effectiveness. Treatment may be withdrawn due to adverse effects, lack of efficacy or a combination of both. However, in studies of relatively short duration such as those studies here, adverse effects are likely to be the main reason for treatment withdrawal.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>(3) Adverse effects</I>
</B>
<BR/>(a) The proportion of individuals experiencing any of the following five adverse effects, considered by the review authors to be common and important adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs: <BR/>(i) ataxia;<BR/>(ii) dizziness;<BR/>(iii) fatigue;<BR/>(iv) nausea;<BR/>(v) somnolence.</P>
<P>(b) The proportion of individuals experiencing the commonest five adverse effects if different from (a) above (also <I>see</I> methods of review section).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>(4) Cognitive effects</I>
</B>
<BR/>At present, there is no consensus as to which instruments should be used to assess the effects of AEDs on cognition, and as a result the assessment of cognitive effects has been approached in a heterogeneous way (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 1998</LINK>). In view of this difficulty, in the first instance we planned to tabulate results, but make no attempt to combine results in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>(5) Quality of life</I>
</B>
<BR/>Once again, there is no consensus as to which instruments should be used to assess this, and in the first instance we planned to tabulate results, but make no attempt to combine results in a meta-analysis.</P>

<B>
<I>Analysis<BR/>(1) 50% reduction in seizure frequency, treatment withdrawal and adverse effects</I>
<BR/>
</B>We checked statistical heterogeneity using a chi squared test for heterogeneity. Provided no significant heterogeneity was present (p &lt; 0.05), we used a fixed-effect model for analysis. Our preferred estimator was the relative risk. For the outcomes 50% reduction in seizure frequency and treatment withdrawal, we quoted 95% confidence interval (CIs). For individual adverse effects we quoted 99% CIs to make allowance for multiple testing.</P>

<P>(a) Primary (intention-to-treat) analysis: participants not completing follow up or with inadequate seizure data were assumed non responders.<BR/>(b) Worst case: participants not completing follow up or with inadequate seizure data were assumed non responders in the remacemide group, and responders in the placebo group.<BR/>(c) Best case: participants not completing follow up or with inadequate seizure data were assumed responders in the remacemide group, and non responders in the placebo group.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>(2) Regression analysis<BR/>
</I>
</B>We examined dose response relationships using logistic regression, and probabilities for the following were calculated for differing doses:<BR/>(i) the percentage of participants having a 50% response;<BR/>(ii) the difference in the percentage of participants responding to each dose compared to placebo. A binary variable was defined with value 0 if the response was less than 50% and value 1 otherwise. Dose-response relationships were examined using logistic regression, in the framework of generalized linear models, and using the package GLIM, with this binary variable as the outcome variable (<LINK REF="REF-McCullagh-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullagh 1989</LINK>).</P>

<RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-27 10:24:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Three randomized double blind placebo controlled trials were found (<LINK REF="STD-CR2237" TYPE="STUDY">CR2237</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CR2241" TYPE="STUDY">CR2241</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 2000</LINK>), and all were sponsored by Astra Pharmaceuticals (now AstraZeneca). One crossover trial (<LINK REF="STD-Richens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Richens 2000</LINK>) was excluded as the treatment periods were of only four weeks duration. The two included trials (<LINK REF="STD-CR2237" TYPE="STUDY">CR2237</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CR2241" TYPE="STUDY">CR2241</LINK>) have not yet been published in full, although the methodology used for managing the pharmacokinetic interaction between carbamazepine and remacemide has been reported for <LINK REF="STD-CR2237" TYPE="STUDY">CR2237</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Mawer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mawer 1999</LINK>). The information for this review was primarily gained from research reports provided by the company.</P>
<P>The interaction between carbamazepine and remacemide is a potential drawback of their combined use. The inhibition of carbamazepine metabolism may either lead to adverse effects or may confound the results of the study by producing a therapeutic effect independent of remacemide's antiepileptic activity. In order to overcome this, participants on combined medication with carbamazepine and remacemide had their carbamazepine dose controlled by an unblinded observer who received regular notifications of the plasma carbamazepine concentrations. The observer was able to change the dose of carbamazepine in a blinded fashion in response to any rise in serum carbamazepine. </P>
<P>Both trials recruited adults, the majority of whom had a partial onset to their seizures, (91% for <LINK REF="STD-CR2237" TYPE="STUDY">CR2237</LINK>, 86% for <LINK REF="STD-CR2241" TYPE="STUDY">CR2241</LINK>). In order to be randomized, individuals had to experience at least one seizure per week for the duration of the baseline period. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-CR2237" TYPE="STUDY">CR2237</LINK>) participants were randomized to placebo, 300, 600 or 1200 mg of remacemide per day. In the second trial (<LINK REF="STD-CR2241" TYPE="STUDY">CR2241</LINK>) participants were randomized to placebo, 300 mg, 600 mg or 800 mg per day. Both trials had a pre-randomization baseline period of eight weeks followed by a dose titration period of four to seven weeks followed by a dose continuation phase of eight weeks.</P>
<P>Further details are outlined in the table of study characteristics.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>For both studies, allocation was concealed by dispensing sequentially numbered packages. Random lists were generated using random permuted blocks. In both trials, blinding was achieved by providing packaging and tablets that were identical for remacemide and placebo groups. </P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-CR2237" TYPE="STUDY">CR2237</LINK>, 27 participants withdrew during the dose titration. A total of 22 participants withdrew from <LINK REF="STD-CR2241" TYPE="STUDY">CR2241</LINK> during dose titration, and a further eight participants withdrew during the continuation phase. In the company reports, participants exposed to less than 14 days double blind treatment were not included in the efficacy analysis. The primary analyses in this review are 'intention-to-treat', including all withdrawn participants in the denominator of estimates of risk.</P>

</I>When exploring dose regression models it becomes apparent that there were substantial differences in response rates among trials, and we are unable to give valid summary estimates across both trials (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In addition, there appears to be a threshold effect, with higher doses (800 mg and 1200 mg) having greater effect than lower doses (placebo, 300 mg and 600 mg), in other words there is a 'dose contrast'. Two models provide an adequate fit to the data, a dose contrast model and a linear dose response model after trials effects had been taken into account. Results are summarized in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Both models indicate a clear but modest effect for higher doses of remacemide, with approximately 10% more individuals responding to 800 mg or 1200 mg per day than to placebo (with a placebo response rate of 6% to 14%).</P>
<P>
<I>(b) Best case scenario<BR/>
</I>For the best case scenario, the model which gives the best summary of the log odds includes a linear dose response plus a trial effect variable. The log-odds for a 50% response increase by 0.16 (s.e. 0.029) for a 100 mg increase in dose, which is approximately a 16% increase in odds of a response to a 100 mg increase in dose. The reduction in deviance due to dose is 27.5 on 1 df, p = 0.001. After adjusting for dose, the reduction due to trial effect is 6.2 on 1 df, p = 0.013, and the residual deviance is 2.74 on 5 df. The actual and estimated response rates are given in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<I>(c) Worst case scenario<BR/>
</I>For the worst case scenario, the placebo response rates are higher than those for 300 mg and 600 mg doses, and there is no association between odds ratios and actual dose. As for the intention-to-treat analysis, the 'dose contrast', adjusting for trial, gives a good summary of the log-odds. The reduction in deviance due to contrast in dose, after adjusting for trial effects is 4.3 on 1 df, and the residual deviance is 2.9 on 5 df. The odds ratio for the contrast between low and high doses is 1.72 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.83). The odds ratio for the difference in rates for study <LINK REF="STD-CR2241" TYPE="STUDY">CR2241</LINK> versus study <LINK REF="STD-CR2237" TYPE="STUDY">CR2237</LINK> is 1.79 (95% CI 1.11 to 2.89). The actual and estimated response rates are given in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>(3) Treatment withdrawal</I>
</B>
<BR/>A chi squared test indicates no significant heterogeneity (chi squared (1df) = 0.07, p = 0.79). The overall relative risk for treatment withdrawal was 1.90 (95% CI 1.00 to 3.60), indicating that remacemide was significantly more likely to be withdrawn than placebo.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>(4) Adverse effects</I>
</B>
<BR/>The 99% confidence intervals for dizziness do not include unity, relative risk 3.08 (99% CI 1.37 to 6.95), indicating that it was significantly associated with remacemide. Confidence intervals for the other adverse effects investigated crossed unity, and were therefore not significantly associated with remacemide: fatigue 1.86 (99% CI 0.90 to 3.85); headache 1.34 (99% CI 0.69 to 2.60); nausea 1.63 (99% CI 0.75 to 3.51) and visual disturbance (diplopia or vision reported abnormal) 1.60 (99% CI 0.74 to 3.48).</P>

</B>
<BR/>These outcomes were not assessed in the included trials.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The two trials included in this systematic review were sponsored by AstraZeneca and neither have been published in full in a peer-review journal. Both trials were of good methodological quality and used adequate methods of allocation concealment, were double blind and data were available for intention to treat analyses. The design of these studies was complicated by the pharmacokinetic interaction between remacemide and carbamazepine and considerable effort was made to minimize this during the conduct of the trials by the use of an unblinded observer who made changes to carbamazepine doses if plasma levels rose.</P>
<P>Ignoring dose, the relative risk for a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency for remacemide compared to placebo was non-significant at 1.59 (95% CI 0.91 to 2.79). This point estimate is consistent with approximately six per cent more participants responding to remacemide than placebo. The regression models assessing the effects of individual doses were confounded by different response rates in the two trials. However, there appears to be a threshold effect, with 300 mg to 600 mg per day having similar effect to placebo, and it is likely that optimal doses for seizure control have not been tested. From the regression models one can say that approximately 10% more participants will respond to 800 mg to 1200 mg remacemide per day than to placebo.</P>
<P>Results for the outcome 'withdrawal of allocated treatment' indicate that remacemide was significantly more likely to be withdrawn than placebo, an effect that is likely to be related to a higher incidence of adverse effects. In this review, dizziness was the only adverse effect significantly associated with remacemide.</P>
<P>The results for a 50% response are low when compared to similar reviews of other drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Jette-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jette 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramaratnam-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramaratnam 2001</LINK>). It may be that higher doses of remacemide would have a greater effect on seizures but given the significant withdrawal rate this could be at the cost of further adverse effects. Remacemide is at present unlicensed for treating people with epilepsy, and given these results and the availability of treatments with more favourable results from placebo controlled trials it is unlikely that remacemide with be further developed as a treatment for epilepsy.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Remacemide is not licensed for treating epilepsy. This review does provide some evidence of an effect of remacemide for people with a localization related epilepsy. However, for the doses tested, the effect on seizures appears to be modest compared to other licensed treatments. Given the availability of other treatments, we would not recommend the use of remacemide as a treatment for epilepsy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given the availability of other treatments with more favourable trial results, we consider further investigation of remacemide unnecessary at this time.</P>
