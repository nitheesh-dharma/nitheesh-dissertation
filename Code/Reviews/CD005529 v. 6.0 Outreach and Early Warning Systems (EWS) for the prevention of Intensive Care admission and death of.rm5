<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-04-22 13:43:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Research has shown that patients in general hospital wards often show early signs and symptoms, such as changes in breathing and pulse, when their condition is getting worse. If treatment for these patients is delayed they could die or require admission to intensive care (ICU). It is thought that if hospital staff could identify and manage these patients earlier then there would be less deaths and ICU admissions. One way to identify and treat patients who are deteriorating is to introduce outreach services. This usually includes the introduction of an Early Warning System to record physiological observations, training of hospital staff to recognise signs or creating special teams to respond to calls when a patient is deteriorating.</P>
<P>This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of outreach services for patients on general hospital wards. The review found two studies which were of good quality. One study compared 12 hospitals with outreach services to 11 that did not. Another study compared 16 wards with outreach to general wards without outreach.</P>
<P>One of the studies showed that outreach reduced the number of hospital deaths, while the other study found no differences between hospitals with outreach and those with no outreach. It is not clear whether outreach reduces hospital deaths or ICU admissions. High quality research is needed to determine the effect of outreach services.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-04-22 13:34:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Despite the fact that outreach and early warning systems (EWS) are an integral part of a hospital wide systems approach to improve the early identification and management of deteriorating patients on general hospital wards, the widespread implementation of these interventions in practice is not based on robust research evidence. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-04-22 13:34:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary objective was to determine the impact of critical care outreach services on hospital mortality rates. Secondary objectives included determining the effect of outreach services on intensive care unit (ICU) admission patterns, length of hospital stay and adverse events.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The review authors searched the following electronic databases: EPOC Specialised Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and other Cochrane databases (all on <I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2006, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1996-June week 3 2006), EMBASE (1974-week 26 2006), CINAHL (1982-July week 5 2006), First Search (1992-2005) and CAB Health (1990-July 2006); also reference lists of relevant articles, conference abstracts, and made contact with experts and critical care organisations for further information.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series designs (ITS) which measured hospital mortality, unanticipated ICU admissions, ICU readmissions, length of hospital stay and adverse events following implementation of outreach and EWS in a general hospital ward to identify deteriorating adult patients versus general hospital ward setting without outreach and EWS were included in the review. <BR/> </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Three review authors independently extracted data and two review authors assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity. Summary statistics and descriptive summaries of primary and secondary outcomes are presented for each study. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two cluster-randomised control trials were included: one randomised at hospital level (23 hospitals in Australia) and one at ward level (16 wards in the UK). The primary outcome in the Australian trial (a composite score comprising incidence of unexpected cardiac arrests, unexpected deaths and unplanned ICU admissions) showed no statistical significant difference between control and medical emergency team (MET) hospitals (adjusted P value 0.640; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.16). The UK-based trial found that outreach reduced in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.85) compared with the control group. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The evidence from this review highlights the diversity and poor methodological quality of most studies investigating outreach. The results of the two included studies showed either no evidence of the effectiveness of outreach or a reduction in overall mortality in patients receiving outreach. The lack of evidence on outreach requires further multi-site RCT's to determine potential effectiveness. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-04-22 14:36:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Many hospital deaths are potentially predictable and preventable (<LINK REF="REF-Goldhill-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldhill 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGloin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGloin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1998</LINK>). Observational studies suggest that clinical deterioration of patients on general hospital wards is often preceded by changes in physiological observations that are recorded by clinical staff six to 24 hours prior to a serious adverse event (<LINK REF="REF-Franklin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hillman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kause-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kause 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schein-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schein 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1998</LINK>). The most common physiological abnormalities are changes in basic vital signs of respiration, pulse, oxygenation and mental function (<LINK REF="REF-Goldhill-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldhill 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schein-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schein 1990</LINK>), however, these changes in clinical signs are often missed, misinterpreted or mismanaged (<LINK REF="REF-Goldhill-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldhill 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McQuillan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuillan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1998</LINK>). The main reasons for staff failing to manage basic vital signs can be attributed to delays in seeking advice, failure to recognise clinical urgency, lack of knowledge and skills in resuscitation, inadequate supervision or organisational problems within the hospital setting (<LINK REF="REF-McQuillan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuillan 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>Delays in treatment or inadequate care of patients on general hospital wards often results in unanticipated admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU), increased length of hospital stay, cardiac arrest or death. McQuillan showed that up to 50% of ward based patients received substandard care prior to ICU admission and that up to 41% of ICU admissions were potentially avoidable (<LINK REF="REF-McQuillan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuillan 1998</LINK>).This is reflected in other studies (<LINK REF="REF-Bristow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bristow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldhill-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldhill 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hillman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGloin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGloin 1999</LINK>). It has major implications for critically ill patients on general wards as unanticipated ICU admissions are twice as likely to develop cardiac arrest and are associated with an increased ICU and hospital mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Goldhill-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldhill 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGloin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGloin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McQuillan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuillan 1998</LINK>). This provision of sup-optimal care on general wards has significant consequences not only for in-hospital morbidity and mortality, but also ICU requirements and cost (<LINK REF="REF-McQuillan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuillan 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>The findings from this research suggest that the number of preventable deaths and unanticipated ICU admissions could be reduced if deteriorating patients on general hospital wards were identified earlier. This lead to the introduction of a number of innovations for early detection and treatment of deterioration in ward based patients, namely an Early Warning System (EWS), the 'Acute Life-threatening Early Recognition and Treatment' (ALERT<SUP>TM</SUP>) course (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2000</LINK>), or similar educational programme, and a Critical Care Outreach Service (CCOS) (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCEPOD-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCEPOD 2005</LINK>). EWSs are simple algorithms (plans of action)<B> </B>based on bedside observations that have been recommended to identify patients at risk on general hospital wards (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ICS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICS 2002</LINK>). These EWS are tools that have been developed to record physiological parameters of systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, urinary output, temperature and level of consciousness (<LINK REF="REF-Goldhill-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldhill 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Subbe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subbe 2001</LINK>;). A number of EWSs exist which are either based on exceeding any one of the set criteria or on the allocation of points to physiological observations which are then added to give a score. This criteria or score provides a mechanism for action in order for early intervention and treatment to be initiated. The action depends on the score or mechanisms in place within the hospital for referral of patients for review. </P>
<P>Several educational programmes have been developed to provide basic knowledge and skills in acute care for ward nurses. The main generic and nationally available training provision for acute care in the United Kingdom (UK) is the ALERT<SUP>TM</SUP> course. It is a multiprofessional competency based training programme which is well established and provided by UK Trusts for trained nurses and doctors. The course focuses on systematic patient assessment, interprofessional teamwork, communication, documentation and an understanding of when to seek help (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2000</LINK>). Thus the course content attempts to address the main reasons highlighted by McQuillan and colleagues for suboptimal ward care (<LINK REF="REF-McQuillan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuillan 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>The concept of outreach has evolved in response to the recognised need for a more equitable hospital wide approach to the management of 'at risk' patients (<LINK REF="REF-Audit-Commission" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audit Commission</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DOH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DOHMA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOHMA 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ICS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICS 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCEPOD-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCEPOD 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCP 2002</LINK>). This approach redefines or classifies critically ill patients by need or level of care required and not by the geographical boundaries of where the patient is located (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2000</LINK>). Levels of care classify patients according to the complexity of acute care required on a scale of zero (patients whose needs can be met through normal ward care in an acute hospital) to three (patients requiring advanced respiratory support in ICU). Outreach is generally intended to provide support across all levels of care within the hospital with specific support for level one patients on general wards that are at risk of deterioration. </P>
<P>The key component of the outreach service consists of multidisciplinary critical care teams, called critical care outreach teams (CCOT) or Patient At Risk Teams (PART) in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Goldhill-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldhill 1999b</LINK>), Medical Emergency Teams (MET) in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1995</LINK>) and Rapid Response Teams in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Berwick-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berwick 2006</LINK>). These critical care teams respond to call outs from general ward staff following identification of patients at risk based upon the EWS score. The purpose of outreach services is to ensure timely and appropriate management of deteriorating patients on general hospital wards. This could potentially avert the need for ICU admissions, enable more timely ICU discharges and provide educational support to extend the skills of general ward staff in identifying and managing deteriorating patients (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ICS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICS 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>EWS have been introduced despite limited high quality evidence to demonstrate their sensitivity, specificity and usefulness (<LINK REF="REF-Goldhill-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldhill 2000</LINK>). To date the research evidence on EWS tools in predicting patient outcomes or impending critical illness is poor and the extent to which the existing tools are valid or reliable predictors of deterioration is unknown (<LINK REF="REF-McCrossan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCrossan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2006</LINK>). It is clear from the available evidence that ensuring effective use of EWS is problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Sterling-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterling 2002</LINK>) and that the adoption of EWS does not invariably result in improved clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Subbe-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Subbe 2003</LINK>). The development and implementation of EWS are often decided locally which has resulted in a wide range of scoring systems that restrict comparison of outcomes and standardisation of care. </P>
<P>A recent systematic review on outreach found a lack of evidence to support the benefits of outreach as a result of the poor methodological quality of the included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Esmonde-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esmonde 2006</LINK>). As considerable resources have been invested in outreach it is imperative that further robust evidence is provided on the effectiveness of these services. The aim of this systematic review is to provide up-to-date and robust evidence on the impact of outreach on patient outcomes of critically ill adult patients on general hospital wards. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective of this review was to determine the impact of outreach services on hospital mortality rates. Secondary objectives were to determine the effects of outreach services on ICU admission patterns (admissions and readmissions), length of hospital stay and the number of adverse events (unexpected cardiac or respiratory arrest) in adult patients who deteriorate on general hospital wards before and after the introduction of outreach services. </P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), Controlled Clinical Trials (CCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs) and interrupted-time-series designs (ITS) of outreach utilising EWS with no outreach and EWS. ITS studies with fewer than three data points before and three data points after the intervention were not included in the review. Published and unpublished data were included. </P>

</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The implementation of outreach using an EWS in an acute hospital setting to identify deteriorating patients on general wards versus general ward based care without outreach and EWS. Outreach included the terms Critical Care Outreach Team (CCOT), Patient At Risk Team (PART), Medical Emergency Team (MET) or Rapid Response Team (RRT) and EWS included the terms Modified Early Warning System (MEWS) or Patient At Risk (PAR) score. Subgroup analysis for comparison of MET, which is medically led, versus CCOT, which is nurse led , was not possible due to the heterogeneity and limited number of included studies. </P>

<P>JM reviewed all of the search results, conference abstracts and reference lists of relevant articles and reports independently to make an initial identification of potentially relevant studies. Once the abstracts of all potentially relevant studies for inclusion had been identified, full copies of them were obtained. All abstracts and full text studies were independently assessed for inclusion by three review authors (JM, RF, AK). Disagreement or lack of consensus between review authors regarding inclusion or exclusion was resolved through discussion or arbitration by another review author (AM). All studies that initially appeared to meet our inclusion criteria and were not included in the review are detailed in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table.</P>
<P>Data extraction was performed independently by three review authors (JM, RF, AK) using an adapted version of the EPOC Data Collection checklist (see METHODS USED IN REVIEWS under GROUP DETAILS on <I>The Cochrane Library</I>). The data were checked for any discrepancies and were then collated. Any discrepancies identified were resolved through discussion until consensus was reached among the review authors. Eleven review authors were contacted about missing data.</P>
<P>Two independent review authors (JM, RF) assessed the methodological quality of each included study using the EPOC Data Collection checklist. We collected information about concealment of allocation, baseline measurements, follow up of professionals, follow up of patients, intention-to-treat analysis, blinding, reliability of primary outcomes and protection against contamination for all randomised controlled trials. Discrepancies in quality ratings were resolved by discussion between review authors.</P>
<P>In the results, we report the pre-intervention and post-intervention statistical tests used for both study and control groups. Meta-analysis was not possible for the following reasons: the included studies did not measure the same outcome; their study designs were different; one study included all admissions while the other included admissions to certain wards; and the treatment and follow-up periods varied between the studies. Information on each study design, participants, type of intervention, setting, methods, outcomes and results are listed and significant research data from each RCTs are presented.</P>

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2008-04-22 14:35:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two RCTs met the inclusion criteria for this review (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). One study was from Australia and the other was from the UK. The two studies were published in 2004 and 2005 and included all adult patient admissions (14 years of age and over) to general hospital wards.</P>
<P>One study was a prospective cluster randomised controlled trial of general inpatient wards in 23 hospitals over a 12-month period (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>). The 23 hospitals were randomised as either intervention hospitals (12) or control hospitals (11). In order to conceal the randomisation sequence or study treatment from project investigators and participating hospitals, an independent statistician randomly assigned hospitals to receive standardised MET implementation or to be controls.</P>
<P>The other study was a prospective stepped-wedge randomised controlled trial which phased in the introduction of CCOT in 16 acute adult general wards in one hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>). Wards were paired (high risk and low risk pairings) using professional judgement to match for overall risk of death and serious adverse outcomes. Each of the matched and randomised pairs of wards was then randomised to introduce outreach following a four week training period. On completion of the training the paired wards moved from control to intervention wards. The sequence of outreach intervention was randomised over the 32-week study period. Randomisation was undertaken by one investigator based on ward parings and risk estimates provided by the rest of the study team.</P>
<P>General wards were either inpatient wards across hospitals or specifically surgical, medical or elderly patient wards in one hospital. A 'general ward' in both studies did not encompass ICUs, high dependency units, coronary care units, operating theatres, post-operative recovery areas or emergency departments that had intensive care specialist supervision. One study included all patients admitted to hospital and the other study included patients admitted to specific wards over the research period (excluding those who died on admission). The settings varied from a single non-teaching acute 800 bed hospital in England to a variety of urban and rural Australian hospitals which differed in size and organizational characteristics (stratified by teaching and non-teaching and blocked by number of hospital beds).</P>
<P>The intervention hospitals or wards in both studies introduced a standardised educational strategy to prepare for the introduction of outreach. This was the implementation period of the study. The educational strategy in both studies included information on the calling criteria (i.e., when to contact the outreach team), relevance of the criteria to at-risk patients, and when and how to call the outreach team. In one study, the educational process included training in care of the acutely ill patient for ward staff (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>) which was not a part of the educational process in the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>). The provision of outreach services in one study included practical advice and help with an emphasis on collaboration and sharing of skills (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>). The educational strategies utilised in one study included lectures, video, written information and visual reminders displayed on identification badges and posters throughout the hospitals (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The implementation period for MET was four months (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>) and four weeks for each pair of wards introducing outreach (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>). Both studies introduced MET or CCOT on a 24 hour, 7 day-a-week basis. The composition of the MET varied among participating hospitals but required a minimum inclusion of cardiac arrest team, one doctor, one ICU nurse or Accident and Emergency nurse (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>). The composition of the CCOT was led by a nurse consultant with a team of experienced nurses and medical support when required (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>). The early identification of deteriorating ward patients was assessed in both studies either through use of a PAR score or by the use specific MET calling criteria. The EWS tools differed in that the PAR score was a multiple parameter scoring system (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>) and the MET utilised a single parameter system to provide calling criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>) for a response to patient deterioration. Both studies utilised the objective criteria to trigger outreach but emphasised the importance of staff calling the outreach team if they had concerns regardless of the calling criteria.</P>
<P>The two studies introduced MET or CCOT in the intervention hospitals or wards and the control hospitals or wards continued standard practice of care. One study indicated that the cardiac arrest team was maintained as standard practice in control hospitals (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>) while it was not clear whether the cardiac arrest team was maintained as standard practice in the control wards during the implementation period of the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>). The control groups were either patients admitted to one of two paired wards (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>) or 11 matched hospitals and their patients (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>). The control hospitals and wards did not receive education in outreach calling criteria or education on identifying patients at risk.<BR/>
<BR/>The patient outcomes measured in the two studies varied. The primary outcome of the MERIT study (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>) was a composite score based upon the incidence of cardiac arrests without a pre-existing not-for-resuscitation order (NFR), unplanned ICU admissions and unexpected deaths (deaths without a pre-existing NFR order). These were reported as a rate of incidence per 1,000 admissions and adjusted P values to account for cluster and individual level differences. The items comprising the composite score were examined individually and treated as secondary outcomes. Hospital mortality and length of stay were the outcomes measured in the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>) and the findings were analysed and compared using multivariate logistic regression.</P>

<P>The methodological quality of included studies are summarised in the 'Characteristics of Included studies' table using Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions' criteria of adequate (A), unclear (B), inadequate (C) and not used (D). Quality was independently assessed by two review authors using a modified version of the EPOC Data Collection checklist (see METHODS USED IN REVIEWS under GROUP DETAILS in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). </P>
<P>Both studies matched and randomised either hospitals or wards to receive outreach or no outreach and adjusted for clustering of outcomes. One study undertook baseline measurements over a two-month period prior to the introduction of MET system (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>) while the other study included patient characteristics on admission as baseline data (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>). There was no loss to follow up in either study. Intention-to-treat analysis and a power calculation to detect clinically significant effects and sample size was undertaken in both studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>). Blinding of primary outcomes was not undertaken in either study as all outcomes were measured objectively. Reliable outcome measures were obtained from hospital databases in one study,(<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>) and the method of attaining outcome measures was unclear in the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>). Protection against contamination was controlled by institutional allocation in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>) and unclear in the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>). The studies were rated as medium risk of bias, as one criterion was scored as unclear in the MERIT study (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>) and two criteria were scored as either not done or unclear in the Priestley study (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>). </P>

In the Priestley study (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>), the mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II death probability estimate at baseline in the matched and randomised patients was slightly lower in the control wards (17.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 16.8 to 17.8) compared with the outreach wards (19.9; 95% CI 19.4 to 20.3).</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>In this systematic review we found that the evidence to determine the effectiveness of critical care outreach and EWS on reducing hospital mortality, unplanned ICU admissions and readmissions, length of hospital stay and adverse events is inconclusive. Only two RCTs met the inclusion criteria. The findings from these two RCTs showed either no significant difference in the incidence of composite outcomes between MET and control hospitals (adjusted P value 0.640; adjusted OR = 0.98; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16) (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>) or that outreach reduced in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.85) compared with wards with no outreach (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>). The increased length of stay (hazard ratio 0.91; 95% CI 0.84 to 0.99) found in the Priestley study was consistent with a reduction in hospital mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>), though additional analyses did not provide consistent support for this finding.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of these two studies was assessed as being a medium risk of bias. Comparison across studies was not possible due to heterogeneity in terms of interventions, settings, outcomes and study designs. In both studies the implementation and follow-up periods were relatively short and this may have influenced the findings. The overall strength of evidence to inform decisions regarding the implementation and funding of CCOS is inconclusive. </P>
<P>The findings from this systematic review are important as they demonstrate the need for further high quality research in the area before the widespread promotion of outreach can be recommended. The larger part of the available research evidence on outreach is based on before and after designs which either lack randomisation or use historical controls. Future RCTs should be multicentred hospital comparisons which measure standardised outcomes in order to facilitate comparison across studies. A broad range of process and outcome measures are recommended to evaluate the impact of outreach (<LINK REF="REF-DeVita-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeVita 2006</LINK>). Qualitative studies should address subjective end points (medical and nursing ward staff and management opinions) and the factors (communication, professional boundaries) which hinder or support the introduction of a complex healthcare intervention in practice. Measurement of alternative objective end-points (time to first assessment, records of action taken and follow-up) may provide evidence to support the decision-making of whether EWS are useful. </P>
<P>Comparison of these findings with those of a recent systematic review published on outreach (<LINK REF="REF-Esmonde-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esmonde 2006</LINK>) highlight similar issues of poor quality of research and a lack of evidence to support the benefits of outreach. The two systematic reviews differ in the quality of the inclusion criteria, which influenced the number of included studies. Esmonde included 23 studies of which 16 were uncontrolled before and after studies (<LINK REF="REF-Esmonde-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esmonde 2006</LINK>). The review concluded that the evidence in the review was weak as a result of the poor methodological quality of the included study designs. The strength of our study is the rigorous inclusion criteria which highlights evidence on the basis of two RCTs. </P>
<P>The limitations of our study should be noted; this review found only two good quality RCTs. The findings from one study are inconclusive with the other study finding a reduction in hospital mortality rates. As a result no strong recommendations can be made based on the available evidence currently available. It is hoped that the direction of future research in this area in the UK will be guided by recommendations following the conclusion of the ongoing evaluative research on outreach in England commissioned by the Service Delivery Organisation (<LINK REF="REF-SDO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">SDO 2004</LINK>) and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on caring for the acutely ill patient in hospital (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). </P>
<P>To date the evidence from the two studies highlight the different models of CCOS that predominate in the UK and Australia. The Australian MET model is doctor-led whilst in the UK the CCOT model is nurse-led. There is no evidence to suggest that there are any differences between a nurse-led or doctor-led outreach team, however, the research design by Priestley implemented outreach across 16 wards ensuring that the CCOT nurse visited every patient admitted within 24 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>). The frequent presence of the outreach nurse within the ward environment may have allowed relationships across the wards to be established as the role of outreach emphasises support and collaboration. This study also included staff training in the care of the acutely ill patient which may have had an impact on the ward nurses' decisions to utilise the calling criteria. In the MERIT study (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>) patients were not visited on admission and the MET teams were only in contact with ward staff when alerted via the calling criteria. The role of the MET team was not explicitly stated although the focus would appear to be patient intervention management. It could be that the follow up of patients, training in acute care and the introduction of specific calling criteria to help identify deteriorating ward patients had an impact on outcomes by breaking down traditional hierarchical organisational barriers which may impede the communication process. Clear terminology and guidelines in relation to each model are required to provide standardisation of practices which would allow for more robust comparisons between models. </P>
<P>The studies used both objective and subjective EWS assessment criteria to trigger outreach. The MET hospitals utilised a single-parameter system (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>), whereas the CCOT used a multiple-parameter system (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>). There is no evidence to suggest that one early warning tool is better than the other. It was assumed that all patients admitted to the intervention hospital or wards in both studies had an EWS chart to record physiological deterioration, however, documentation of the EWS charts in the 15-minute period before an event were absent or incomplete for 50% of unplanned ICU admissions and unexpected deaths (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>). This has serious implications for the total number of patients that can be identified as 'at risk' if the predetermined criteria for evaluating deterioration are not being recorded. Process data from the MERIT study found a significantly higher call rate prior to cardiac arrest or unplanned ICU admissions, and an increased mean number of calls not associated with a cardiac arrest or death in MET hospitals (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>). The increased number of calls may have been as a result of heightened awareness or issues of low EWS sensitivity in particular wards. </P>
<P>The short timeframe for the implementation and evaluation of outreach and the absence of an enforcement policy across both studies may have had an impact on the findings. The change process requires both time and reinforcement to ensure ownership of the change, however, in the Priestley study (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>), the critical care outreach nurse's presence may have been more prominent, and acted as a reinforcement policy, as each patient was visited within 24 hours of admission. Continued support and reinforcement from the investigators could have resulted in an increased number of calls from general ward staff on the intervention wards or hospitals. This is important as the low rate of MET calls preceding unplanned ICU admissions and unexpected deaths were evident in patients who had documented calling criteria in the MERIT study (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>). It suggests that even when EWS or calling criteria are met, nurses were reluctant to call for help. In future, in order to determine the effect of enforcement policies, or the reasons for a low rate of calls, the number of outreach calls needs to be audited. Information on the following points: who, predominately, made the calls; the response time; and intervention or action administered; as well as the patient outcome, would provide information on the process of outreach and not just patient outcomes. An understanding of the process is imperative in order to understand how the end point was reached. </P>
<P>The MERIT study had major limitations that may have resulted in the negative findings (<LINK REF="STD-Hillman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 2005</LINK>). The first of these was the risk of contamination between intervention and control hospitals as result of increased media attention in hospital quality and safety issues in Australia that highlighted the benefits of outreach. This may have increased staff awareness regarding the clinical signs of deterioration in patients and as a result they identified and responded to deteriorating patients earlier in the control hospitals. Secondly, MERIT investigators suggested that the cardiac arrest team in the control hospitals may have acted to some extent as MET teams, as 48% of cardiac calls in the control hospitals were not associated with a cardiac arrest or unexpected death. Thirdly, the study was underpowered for detection of a significant difference in the incidence of primary outcomes, and, finally, the inter-hospital variability was also higher than anticipated. Limitations of the Priestley study included possible contamination of the study wards similar to the MERIT study and limited generalisability (<LINK REF="STD-Priestley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Priestley 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>The limitations and findings of both these studies highlight that, to date, there is no evidence to suggest that the introduction of outreach contributes to improved patient outcomes. Equally, there is no evidence to suggest that outreach is associated with adverse healthcare events. We were unable to determine the economic implications of implementing outreach from either study. The cost may vary substantially, depending on the staffing, resources and content of the intervention implemented. Since outreach incurs opportunity costs, it is reasonable to suggest that healthcare funders and the public should expect that large numbers of reliable, well-designed, prospective studies should be conducted either before widespread implementation or alongside it. As a result, no recommendations for the introduction of outreach to improve patient outcomes can be made at this time. Further RCTs are required to demonstrate the value and benefit of outreach that is currently recognised by many who have participated in it, and who are reluctant to give it up without clear evidence to the contrary. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is minimal evidence at this time to recommend the adoption of outreach to support the identification and management of acutely ill patients in hospital. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for further prospective RCTs. The feasibility of these studies has been shown in two different RCT designs evaluating outreach. The poor quality of current research evidence and the heterogeneity across studies requires that planning of future RCTs should aim to standardise measures of outcomes to allow for comparisons across studies. There is a need to clarify similarities or differences in the role and intervention strategies of the MET and CCOT models and to undertake a subgroup analysis to indicate any differences between the two models. This would provide clarification on the implementation of outreach services to facilitate standardisation of practice so that comparisons can be made across studies. <BR/> <BR/>The use of EWS systems or MET calling criteria in the practice setting needs to be evaluated. This would provide an understanding of the factors associated with poor documentation of EWS charts and the reluctance of ward staff to utilize the calling criteria. <BR/> <BR/>Educational programmes which provide a basic understanding of patient assessment and immediate management of physiological derangements is imperative to empower ward staff to feel confident in managing critically ill patients. Evaluation of the ALERT<SUP>TM </SUP>course has shown beneficial effects on doctors' knowledge of acute care and increased confidence levels of healthcare staff to the recognition and management of acutely ill patients (<LINK REF="REF-Featherstone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Featherstone 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2004</LINK>). To date there is no evidence on the impact that these educational programmes have had on clinical practice or patient outcomes. It is recommended that the ALERT<SUP>TM</SUP> best practice guidelines should be utilised to evaluate the standard of practice in wards in relation to the appropriateness of interventions and the documentation of care following identification of an 'at risk' patient. </P>
<P>The implementation of any complex healthcare intervention will have certain factors supporting and hindering the change process. We suggest further research which focuses specifically on those barriers identified by McQuillan (<LINK REF="REF-McQuillan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuillan 1998</LINK>) as the reasons for suboptimal care. This area of research is important in order to identify and explain the complex processes and mechanisms within a hospital which support or hinder the change process in identifying and managing deteriorating patients on general hospital wards. </P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Prospective cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT).<BR/>Randomisation was concealed from the project investigators and participating hospitals.<BR/>2 month baseline period, 4 month implementation period and 6 month after period in both control and intervention hospitals.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>23 hospitals<BR/>General inpatient wards, coronary care units and high dependency units which were not under direct supervision of an intensive care unit specialist.<BR/>A general ward included any inpatient ward within the study hospitals. The study excluded events in patients &lt; 14 years, patients who died on arrival to hospital, or patients who had not been formally admitted to hospital.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>12 intervention hospitals introduced hospital-wide Medical Emergency Teams (MET). Standardised education and implementation strategy was used to introduce the MET. <BR/>11 control hospitals did not receive MET education. Cardiac arrest teams continued unchanged during implementation and study period.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary: composite outcome of the incidence (events divided by the number of eligible patients admitted to the hospital during the study period) of cardiac arrests without a pre-existing not for resuscitation order (NFR), unplanned ICU admission, and unexpected deaths (deaths without a pre-existing NFR).<BR/>Secondary outcomes: individual patient data (cardiac arrests without pre-existing NFR, unplanned ICU admissions, unexpected deaths and length of hospital stay). <BR/>
