<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>This review has been produced to assess the benefits and harms of the different surgical techniques in use for the removal of wisdom teeth from the lower jaw in order to reduce complications following surgery. The risks of surgery that are included in this review are: pain following surgery, swelling, infection, being unable to open the jaw fully (trismus), damage to the nerves supplying sensation to the tongue and skin of the lower lip and chin (lingual or inferior alveolar nerve damage) and fracture of the jaw.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>The removal of wisdom teeth from the lower jaw is one of the most common operations in dental surgery. Various techniques have been developed to enable the procedure to be carried out successfully. It is important to evaluate the best evidence about these techniques so that the risks and complications associated with the operation can be reduced and the patient experience improved.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review and the evidence on which it is based was up to date on 21 March 2014. Thirty-five studies with 2569 participants were included, but the quality of these studies was not ideal and unlikely to make surgeons change their practice.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>-Slight changes to the position of the cut into the gum may reduce dry socket and pain after surgery.</P>
<P>-It is possible to protect a nerve to the tongue from damage by the placement of a special surgical tool, however there were no good quality trials available to show that this reduces permanent nerve injury and the consequent loss of or altered sensations.</P>
<P>-Some surgeons will just remove the top part of the wisdom tooth and leave the root in place when the roots are very close to a nerve in the jaw (supplying feeling to the lower lip and skin of the chin). Although it would seem likely that this should reduce the risk of nerve injury the two trials available had unreliable data to show this. They did however find later movement of the root in 13% to 24% of the patients within two years.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the 35 included studies was variable. None were assessed as at low risk of bias in all domains so<I> </I>they were unlikely to make surgeons change their practice.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-07-22 11:45:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>The surgical removal of mandibular wisdom teeth is one of the most common operations undertaken in oral and maxillofacial surgery. The most common indication for surgery is infection about a partially erupted tooth that is impacted against bone or soft tissues. Other indications include unrestorable caries, pulpal and periapical pathology, fracture of the tooth and cyst development, amongst others. Most commonly the benefits of surgical removal of a wisdom tooth include alleviation of the symptoms and signs of pericoronitis and its potential consequences. However, surgery is frequently associated with postoperative pain, swelling and trismus. Less commonly complications include infection, including dry socket, trigeminal nerve injuries and rarely fracture of the mandible.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-07-27 21:09:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 21 March 2014), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (OVID) (1946 to 21 March 2014) and EMBASE (OVID) (1980 to 21 March 2014). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication in the electronic searches.</P>

</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-07-27 21:19:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>Two review authors conducted assessment of relevance, risk of bias and data extraction. Study authors were contacted for additional information. RRs were used for dichotomous data and MDs for continuous data, unless the event rate was very low and Peto ORs were used. The pairing of the split-mouth studies was taken into account in the analysis for both dichotomous and continuous outcomes, and parallel group and split-mouth studies were combined using the generic inverse variance method. Random-effects models were used provided there were more than three studies (fixed-effect models otherwise).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-07-27 21:16:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>A total of 35 trials (2569 patients) were included. The interventions under consideration fell into seven broad categories, with many comparisons including only a small number of trials. Twenty-one of the trials were assessed at high risk of bias, the remaining 14 as unclear. The results are described in the summary of findings tables.</P>
<P>Triangular flaps were associated with a 71% reduction in alveolar osteitis at one week (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.78; three trials, moderate quality) and reduction in pain at 24 hours (MD -0.21, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.10; two trials, moderate quality) compared with envelope flaps. There was no evidence of a difference in overall infection rates, in maximum mouth opening or in permanent sensation. However, there was some evidence that residual swelling after one week was slightly increased in the triangular flap groups compared to envelope flap types (MD 0.66 mm, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.07; two trials, low quality). We found no data on temporary sensation, or adverse events.</P>
<P>There was low quality evidence from two studies, looking at the use of a retractor during third molar surgery, to indicate more cases of temporary altered sensation (up to one month) when a retractor was used (Peto OR 5.19, 95% CI 1.38 to 19.49; two trials, low quality). One study reported that this did not persist for more than six months in either group. We found no data for use of a retractor on other primary outcomes or adverse effects (including fracture of the mandible).</P>
<P>Due to the small number of studies, the different comparisons evaluated, the variable outcomes reported and the paucity of useful data for all primary outcomes we were not able to draw any conclusions concerning bone removal in third molar surgery.</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence from single studies of very low quality on irrigation method (manual versus mechanical) or irrigation volume (low or high) to determine whether there were differences or not for the outcomes of alveolar osteitis or postoperative infection. We found no data for any of the other primary outcomes.</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence (low to very low quality) that any wound closure technique (primary versus secondary) was superior to another for the outcomes of alveolar osteitis, postoperative infection or maximum mouth opening achieved after seven days, or reactionary bleeding. There was evidence that secondary wound closure was associated with reduced pain at 24 hours (MD 0.79, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.24; four trials, moderate quality) and slightly reduced swelling after one week (MD 0.33, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.57; seven trials, moderate quality).We found no data on other primary outcomes.</P>
<P>There was some evidence that the use of a surgical drain was associated with less postoperative swelling (MD -0.90, 95% CI -1.62 to -0.19; five trials, moderate quality) and greater maximum mouth opening one week after surgery (MD 3.72 mm, 95% CI 2.84 to 4.59; two trials, moderate quality). There was insufficient evidence from a single study (low quality) to determine whether the presence of a drain made any difference to pain at 24 hours postoperation. There were no data for the other primary outcomes.</P>
<P>Although two RCTs compared coronectomy with complete extraction, flaws in the design and the unit of analysis of these studies meant that there were no reliable data available for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-07-27 21:09:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch">
<P>The thirty-five included trials looked at a range of different surgical techniques. The comparisons related to seven broad aspects of the surgical procedures for impacted mandibular third molars: type of surgical flap raised, use of retractors, techniques for bone removal, wound irrigation, wound closure, wound drainage, and complete/incomplete tooth removal. The quality of the body of evidence for each of these comparisons was very low to moderate due to the small number of trials and patients, and the majority of the trials being at high risk of bias (65%) with the remainder at unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>The evidence for making changes to surgical practice is therefore limited. However, it is useful to describe the state of the research evidence supporting practice so that surgeons can make an informed choice in adopting new techniques, or continuing with established techniques.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-07-22 12:20:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>Surgical removal of mandibular third molars (lower wisdom teeth) is one of the most common operations undertaken in oral and maxillofacial surgery. There are many indications for their removal but the most common reason is recurrent infection about the tooth as it attempts to erupt but is impacted against bone or soft tissues. Other indications include unrestorable caries, pulpal and periapical pathology, fracture of the tooth and cyst development, amongst others. Most commonly the benefits of surgical removal of a wisdom tooth include alleviation of the symptoms and signs of pericoronitis and its potential consequences. The symptoms of pericoronitis are pain, bad taste, swelling of the associated soft tissues about the tooth but also of the face and restricted mouth opening (trismus). Local infection may spread and be associated with lymphadenopathy, pyrexia and malaise. More rarely, swelling may threaten airway patency. Surgery is frequently associated with postoperative pain, swelling and restricted mouth opening (trismus). Less common complications include infection, including alveolar osteitis (dry socket), trigeminal nerve injuries (inferior alveolar, lingual and mylohyoid nerves) and, rarely, fracture of the mandible.</P>
<P>Patients requiring the surgical removal of wisdom teeth are frequently anxious about the anticipated postoperative pain, which may be severe. Such is the predictability of postoperative pain that this type of surgery is used as a model of pain for the clinical evaluation of novel analgesics. The severity of pain usually peaks within several hours after surgery and may last for several days or more. Facial swelling may also alarm patients and typically peaks at around one or two days before subsiding over the subsequent days. Restricted mouth opening results from inflammation of the muscles that move the jaw and may be described initially as having a protective function by encouraging the patient to rest the surgical site and permit healing. However, it may persist for more than a few days and exceed this function, causing concern and difficulty in eating for about two weeks or more.</P>
<P>Alveolar osteitis (dry socket) has a reported incidence of 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1985</LINK>) to 2.9% (<LINK REF="REF-Muhonen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muhonen 1997</LINK>). The socket has exposed bone which is extremely painful and sensitive to touch. This condition is difficult to manage and usually causes pain for up to two weeks. Less commonly an infection presents with pus in the surgical site and may be associated with signs such as lymphadenopathy or raised body temperature. Damage to the branches of the trigeminal nerve may arise because of their proximity to the mandibular third molar and consequent physical damage during surgery. Sensory disturbance may be temporary or permanent, and is usually described as temporary if recovery of normal sensation occurs within four to six months (<LINK REF="REF-Mason-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 1988</LINK>). The degree and description of altered sensation is variable and includes reduced sensation (hypoaesthesia), abnormal sensation (paraesthesia) and unpleasant painful sensation (dysaesthesia) (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1992</LINK>). The incidence of temporary and permanent nerve damage following the surgical removal of third molar teeth varies considerably between reports and may be related to a number of factors including the difficulty of surgery, surgical technique and the skill of the surgeon. The incidence of temporary lingual (tongue) nerve disturbance has been reported to be 0% (<LINK REF="REF-Chiapasco-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiapasco 1993</LINK>) to 15% (<LINK REF="REF-Rood-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rood 1983</LINK>) and that of permanent disturbance to be 0% (<LINK REF="REF-Schultze_x002d_Mosgau-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultze-Mosgau 1993</LINK>) to 2% (<LINK REF="REF-Rood-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rood 1992</LINK>). Inferior alveolar nerve damage has been reported to occur in about 5% (temporary) and 0.2% (permanent) of the patients (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1997</LINK>) and this affects the sensation of the skin of the lower lip and chin. Fracture of the mandible may occur during the surgery or postoperatively. The incidence of this rare complication has been estimated to be about 1 in 28,000 operations (<LINK REF="REF-Libersa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Libersa 2002</LINK>). Whilst this complication may be managed very effectively with techniques such as reduction and fixation with mini plates, the patient may experience significantly more pain and swelling.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-07-22 12:20:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>Various techniques have been developed in an attempt to permit the successful removal of the third molar whilst reducing the complications. Some surgeons gain surgical access to enable the removal of a wisdom tooth by raising only a soft tissue flap on the buccal aspect of the tooth. Others also raise a soft tissue flap lingual to the tooth that incorporates the lingual nerve so that this may be protected by special instruments. These different practices are in part geographic and related to the history of surgical development (<LINK REF="REF-Pell-1933" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pell 1933</LINK>). Another approach is to use different types of instruments placed beneath the periosteum to protect the lingual nerve in a reflected flap in an attempt to reduce damage (<LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1994</LINK>). Bone removal may be carried out using drills or chisels and the choice of surgical technique has been implicated in the incidence of nerve damage, and the severity of pain and swelling. The most common technique using a chisel is the 'lingual split bone technique' in which a section of bone about the wisdom tooth is fractured off to facilitate the removal of the impacted tooth. This technique in which the socket is saucerized was originally developed to reduce infection at a time when this was common and fatalities were not unknown. It was later modified when the surgical drill was introduced (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1956</LINK>).</P>
<P>Modifications of flap design and techniques for bone removal may be expected to change the outcome and experience for the patient. If a wisdom tooth has a particularly intimate relationship with the inferior alveolar nerve then injury is more likely and so some have advocated leaving a part of the tooth root in situ to reduce this risk. Some surgeons have advocated using larger volumes of solution to irrigate the surgical wound before closure to increase the chances of removing all bony debris and reduce the incidence of infection. Others have recommended placing a surgical drain to reduce the size of haematoma although in many countries this practice is rarely carried out. An alternative to the use of surgical drains is to allow drainage by not completely closing the surgical wound over the socket.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-07-22 12:22:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>Hospital Episode Statistics from the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK estimate that 77,000 patients underwent wisdom tooth removal during the year 2009 to 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-McArdle-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McArdle 2012</LINK>). World wide the number of surgical operations to remove wisdom teeth is huge. Research suggests that wisdom tooth removal has an immediate negative impact on patients' working and social lives. In one study patients took an average of 1.6 days off work, with over one third of patients stating that the surgery had affected their performance at work (<LINK REF="REF-Colorado_x002d_Bonnin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colorado-Bonnin 2006</LINK>); and participation in social activities, sports and other hobbies is also negatively affected (<LINK REF="REF-Conrad-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conrad 1999</LINK>). For some patients quality of life (QoL) is reduced for one to two weeks after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Savin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savin 1997</LINK>). For those who suffer nerve injury, then the effects may be present for considerably longer. It is important to summarise and present the best evidence so that every effort can be made to reduce the postoperative morbidity and improve the patient experience for this commonly performed surgical procedure.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-07-22 13:43:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>Assessment of risk of bias was done by using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool as described in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The tool addresses the following domains: sequence generation; allocation sequence concealment; blinding of patients, surgeons and assessors; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other bias. Blinding of patients was straightforward in some studies as they were under a general anaesthetic.</P>
<P>Each piece of information extracted for the risk of bias tool was recorded together with the precise source of this information. The review authors were not blinded to the names of the authors, institutions, journal or results of a study. The assessment of risk of bias was done independently by two review authors. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus, with the assistance of a third review author.</P>
<P>Risk of bias was tabulated for each included study (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>), along with a judgement of low, high or unclear risk of bias for each domain. A risk of bias summary is presented in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Overall risk of bias for each trial</HEADING>
<P>After taking into account the additional information provided by the authors of the trials, studies were grouped into the following categories.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias (plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the results) if all criteria were met.</LI>
<LI>Moderate risk of bias (plausible bias that raises some doubt about the results) if one or more criteria were partly met (these criteria were categorised as 'partly' in cases where authors had responded that they had made some attempt to conceal the allocation of patients, to blind the assessors or to give an explanation for withdrawals, but these attempts were not judged to be ideal).</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias (plausible bias that seriously weakens confidence in the results) if one or more criteria were not met as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</LI>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2014-07-22 14:08:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the estimate of effect of an intervention was expressed as risk ratios (RRs) together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, means and standard deviations were used to summarise the data for each trial using mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs. Peto odds ratios (ORs) were used when the event rate was very low.</P>
<P>For the split-mouth studies Stata was used to calculate the ln(RR) and standard error (SE) for the dichotomous data, unless there were zero events in one of the arms when the data were treated as parallel group data. When the continuous data were not reported as paired data an intra-patient correlation of 0.5 was assumed between the sites within patients.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-07-22 14:15:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>Patients in these studies had either one or two mandibular wisdom teeth and these were frequently presented as independent data, so the CIs were slightly narrower than they should be, and P values slightly less. If we were unable to obtain data taking the clustering of the teeth within patients into account, we used these data but were careful about the interpretation.</P>
<P>As expected many of these trials were split-mouth studies, where the teeth in each patient were surgically removed by different methods. The data from split mouth-studies were analysed according to <LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>.</P>

Outcomes listed in the methods section of a publication were compared against those with results reported. Where some indications of reporting bias were found, study authors were contacted for clarification.</P>
<P>If there were at least 10 studies included in a meta-analysis in the review, a funnel plot of effect estimates against their standard errors was planned to assess a possible between-study reporting bias.

Random-effects models were used as we expected heterogeneity between studies (fixed-effect models were to be used if there were fewer than four trials in any comparison).

<P>In the other five split-mouth studies there was an interval of either two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Baqain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Baqain 2012</LINK>), three weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Erdogan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Erdogan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldsmith-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Goldsmith 2012</LINK>), four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Rullo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Rullo 2013</LINK>) or two months (<LINK REF="STD-Rakprasitkul-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rakprasitkul 1997</LINK>) between the two extractions, which meant that pain and swelling had generally resolved prior to the extraction of the second tooth. However, the data in these studies were paired and this was accounted for in the analysis of the data from these studies.</P>

The modified triangular flap involved an incision from the distobuccal edge of the second molar dropping at a slight oblique angle and curving forward into the mandibular vestibule, and a second part was a relieving incision from the ramus to the distobuccal aspect of the second molar. The envelope flap involved a sulcular incision from the first to the second mandibular molar and a distal relieving incision along the external oblique ridge to the ramus. The <LINK REF="STD-Kirk-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kirk 2007</LINK> study used a split-mouth design in 32 patients who underwent surgery under local anaesthesia and intravenous conscious sedation.

<LINK REF="STD-Goldsmith-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Goldsmith 2012</LINK> compared a pedicle flap design with the envelope flap. For the pedicle flap an incision distal to the third molar was extended approximately 1 cm and then curved towards the buccal sulcus allowing for rotation of the flap and primary closure over sound bone. Prior to closure, the gingival papilla distal to the second molar was removed and the apex of the pedicle de-epithelialised. A lingual flap was raised in the subperiosteal plane irrespective of flap design and the lingual nerve protected using a Howarth retractor.

Before starting the comma shaped incision, the buccal vestibule below the adjacent second molar was stretched down as far as possible with the index finger or thumb of the hand not holding the scalpel to stretch the buccinator beyond its origin on the mandible. Starting from a point at the depth of this stretched vestibule reflection posterior to the distal aspect of the preceding second molar, the incision was made in an anterior direction. The incision was made to a point below the second molar, from where it was smoothly curved up to meet the gingival crest at the disto-buccal line angle of the second molar. The incision was continued around as a crevicular incision around the distal aspect of the second molar.

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Bone removal with lingual split with chisel versus bur (three trials)</HEADING>
<P>Distolingual bone obstructing the surgical removal of an impacted wisdom tooth may be removed with a chisel and surgical mallet in a 'distal split' technique or by using a surgical bur. Three studies compared these different surgical techniques (<LINK REF="STD-Absi-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Absi 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mocan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mocan 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Praveen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Praveen 2007</LINK>). The lingual split technique involves making a vertical cut in the buccal bone with a monobevel chisel distal to the second molar. A second horizontal cut is made to join the first posteriorly. The bone removed allows access to the mesio-buccal aspect of the impacted tooth and permits a point of application with an elevator. The bevel of the chisel is then turned lingually and a 'lingual split' is made, removing a distolingual piece of bone, which allows the tooth to be elevated. The depth is controlled by angling the chisel between vertical and 45° buccolingual during removal of the lingual cortex. When bone is removed with a bur, a rose-head bur or similar bur is electrically powered usually at a speed of 40,000 rpm and irrigation is used.

The pulp was then left in place after the crown had been levered off, and received no treatment other than a saline rinse and the re-apposition of the muco-periosteal flap. Coronectomy is designed to leave the apices of lower third molars intact if they are in immediate proximity to the inferior alveolar nerve as predicted by radiographic features.

<P>It is important to note that participant blinding was unrealistic in many of these studies due to the surgery being carried out under local anaesthetic or with only light sedation. We considered that the blinding of outcome assessment was both possible and important to reduce the risk of detection bias. Where trials were described as double blind we interpreted this as meaning that both the participant and outcome assessor were blinded to the allocated intervention. Where the person assessing the outcomes was the same surgeon who performed the procedure, or where blinded outcome assessment was not mentioned, we considered the risk of detection bias to be high.</P>
<P>In 24 studies (71%) participants were blinded to the allocated intervention or it was considered that lack of participant blinding was not associated with a risk of bias due to the nature of the intervention.

<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Rullo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Rullo 2013</LINK> was a split-mouth study with 52 participants comparing a piezoelectric bone removal device used in the removal of a mandibular third molar from one side of the mouth with the use of conventional rotative instruments used in a separate session to remove the other mandibular third molar. The data were not reported for each randomised group but were analysed according to whether the procedure was simple or complex. We were unsuccessful in obtaining usable data from the authors of this study.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Mocan-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mocan 1996</LINK> randomly allocated 20 participants to either lingual split or buccal bone removal. However, no data were reported for each group for the outcomes of pain, swelling or trismus and we were unable to obtain these data from the authors.

One split-mouth study performed the surgery in two sessions with a two-month period between surgeries (<LINK REF="STD-Rakprasitkul-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rakprasitkul 1997</LINK>).

Two of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cerqueira-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cerqueira 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Srinivas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivas 2006</LINK>) used a split-mouth design in which both mandibular third molars were extracted in the same operating session and a drain was inserted on one randomly chosen side. We considered that pain experienced by these patients could not be reliably attributed to the use of a drain or not, and so in this review we did not use pain data from split-mouth studies in which participants received both interventions during a single operative session.</P>

<P>The other five studies, all evaluating tube drains, took the sum of a horizontal and vertical measurement across the cheek and expressed swelling as the percentage difference compared to the preoperative measure.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Trismus (after seven days)</HEADING>
<P>The effect of the use of a surgical drain on trismus was assessed by comparing mean maximal mouth opening one week after surgery in each group.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">7. Coronectomy versus complete tooth removal (two trials)</HEADING>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Leung-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Renton-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Renton 2005</LINK>) included in this review set out to compare extraction of mandibular third molars with a coronectomy procedure in which only the top part of the impacted third molar was removed. Both studies were assessed at high risk of bias due to the high attrition in the coronectomy group and unit of analysis errors. Both studies included participants whose preoperative radiographs indicated proximity of the third molar root(s) to the inferior alveolar nerve. Some participants contributed two teeth to the study and some only one.</P>
<P>In both studies, in some of the third molars (9.4% and 38% in <LINK REF="STD-Leung-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2009 </LINK>and <LINK REF="STD-Renton-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Renton 2005</LINK>, respectively) randomly allocated to the coronectomy, the roots were inadvertently mobilised and were therefore completely removed. Also in both studies the analysis did not take account of the pairing of the data (two teeth from a single participant were incorrectly assumed to have the same independence as two teeth from two different participants). We considered that the data from these studies were not sufficiently reliable to include in this review.</P>
<P>However, both studies suggested that in patients where third molar roots were very close to the nerve canal, it was likely that coronectomy was associated with a reduction in nerve damage and no increase in alveolar osteitis, infection or pain in the short term.</P>
<P>The adverse effect of migration of the root segments occurred following coronectomy in 13% of those evaluated at 13 months in the <LINK REF="STD-Renton-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Renton 2005</LINK> study, but extraction was not required. The proportion of participants with root migration at 12 months was 24% in <LINK REF="STD-Leung-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2009</LINK> and two patients in the coronectomy group experienced root exposure. The mean follow-up in <LINK REF="STD-Leung-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2009</LINK> was less than one year and in <LINK REF="STD-Renton-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Renton 2005</LINK> follow-up was only two years, so that neither study was long enough to reliably assess whether there were any long-term adverse effects associated with coronectomy.</P>

<P>The evidence included in this review is from 35 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating different aspects of the surgical removal of mandibular third molars. However, due to the number of different comparisons evaluated and the overall poor quality of the research these trials provide moderate to very low quality evidence, which means that further research may change the estimates and the confidence intervals presented. The overall results for the seven broad categories are summarised below.</P>
<UL>
<LI>There is moderate quality evidence that triangular flaps are associated with a reduction in alveolar osteitis at one week and pain at 24 hours compared to envelope flaps. There is low quality evidence of no difference in overall infection rates and maximum mouth opening. However, there is low quality evidence that residual swelling after one week is slightly increased in the triangular flap groups compared to envelope flap types.</LI>
<LI>There is low quality evidence from two studies that the use of a retractor during third molar extraction leads to more cases of temporary altered tongue, lip or chin skin sensation (up to one month). One study reported this altered sensation did not persist for more than six months in either group.</LI>
<LI>Due to the small number of studies, the different comparisons evaluated, the variable outcomes reported and the paucity of useful data we are not able to draw any conclusions concerning bone removal in third molar surgery.</LI>
<LI>There is insufficient evidence (very low quality) from single studies on irrigation method (manual versus mechanical) or irrigation volume (low or high) to determine whether there were differences or not for the outcomes of alveolar osteitis or postoperative infection.</LI>
<LI>There is insufficient evidence (low to very low quality) that any wound closure technique (primary versus secondary) is superior to another for the outcomes of alveolar osteitis, postoperative infection, maximum mouth opening achieved after seven days, or reactionary bleeding. There is moderate quality evidence that secondary wound closure is associated with reduced pain at 24 hours and slightly reduced swelling after one week.</LI>
<LI>There is moderate quality evidence that the use of a surgical drain is associated with less postoperative swelling and greater maximum mouth opening one week after surgery. There is insufficient evidence from a single study (low quality) to determine whether or not there is a difference in pain at 24 hours postoperation.</LI>
<LI>Although two RCTs compared coronectomy with complete extraction, flaws in the design and unit of analysis of these studies mean that there is no reliable data available for inclusion in this review. It seems likely that when the third molar root(s) are close to the nerve canal, coronectomy and complete extraction are comparable in terms of the outcomes of alveolar osteitis, infection and pain, and coronectomy is associated with fewer cases of short term nerve disturbances. However, within the relatively short-term follow-up (one to two years) root migration was observed in a substantial proportion (13% to 24%) of coronectomy patients, with root exposure in 1% of patients after 12 months.</LI>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-07-22 15:41:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>Although there are 35 trials included in this review, these describe comparisons related to seven aspects of the surgical procedures for extracting impacted mandibular third molars: type of surgical flap raised, use of retractor, techniques for bone removal, wound irrigation, wound closure, wound drainage, and complete or incomplete tooth removal. There may be only one or two trials evaluating a given aspect of the surgery or a specific comparison. Also, many trials only reported some of the primary and secondary outcomes of interest to this review. None of the trials reported the primary outcome, fracture of the mandible.</P>
<P>More than half of the RCTs included in this review used a split-mouth design in which one tooth was allocated to the intervention and the other to control. While this design may be efficient, if both teeth are treated in the same operative session (as was the case for most of these trials) it may be difficult to attribute outcomes such as pain or trismus to intervention or control. However, we recognise that it may also be undesirable to require participants to undergo two separate procedures, some weeks apart, in order to ascertain the effect of the intervention on these outcomes. Furthermore, the paired nature of the outcome data from split-mouth trials should be recognised in the analysis, and whether or not this was done was not always clear in the published papers.</P>
<P>It is unclear to what extent trials undertaken more than 25 years ago remain relevant to contemporary practice.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-07-22 15:41:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>The body of evidence for most of the comparisons that were included were at moderate to very low quality. This was because most of the comparisons were based on a small number of trials and participants, and the trials were at high (65%) or unclear (35%) risk of bias. Although it was possible in many trials to undertake a blinded outcome assessment this was only done in about 30%.</P>
<P>The follow-up period of the trial, especially for coronectomy, should be much longer in order to ensure that undertaking a quicker simpler surgical procedure is not followed by later complications such as root migration and root exposure requiring further surgery, and compromising the integrity of the individual's remaining molars.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-07-25 16:45:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used contemporary methodology and comprehensive search strategies covering multiple databases. We made some assumptions when undertaking the analysis of the split-mouth trials, when the data were not reported, but felt this would introduce less bias than omitting the data from these trials. More up-to-date methods were used for quality assessment that specified in the protocol but we do not feel this should have caused any bias. </P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-07-22 15:42:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>A systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Carrasco_x002d_Labra-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carrasco-Labra 2012</LINK>) on primary versus secondary wound closure has been published and the results do not support a preference for either approach, which is in disagreement with this review. Another systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Long-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Long 2012</LINK>) compared coronectomy versus total removal, and included four trials (two RCTs and two controlled clinical trials). The authors conclude that coronectomy is preferable to total removal of a wisdom tooth. This disagrees with the finding of this Cochrane review, which was unable to extract the same data. Lingual split with chisel versus bur for bone removal was the focus of another systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Steel-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steel 2012</LINK>) which included five studies. The tentative conclusions were of no difference between postoperative pain and swelling, and some evidence of less trismus, for the lingual split technique. This was similar to findings of our review although we did not find a difference for trismus. A further systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Pichler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pichler 2001</LINK>) looked at lingual flap retraction and prevention of lingual nerve damage associated with third molar surgery. The authors compared eight studies, seven were prospective clinical series and one was described as an RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1996</LINK>), which was excluded from our Cochrane review due to the high number of protocol violations resulting in unquantifiable biases. They concluded that the use of a lingual nerve retractor during third molar surgery was associated with an increased incidence of temporary nerve damage and was neither protective nor detrimental with respect to the incidence of permanent nerve damage. We agree with their findings.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-07-22 15:43:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>Thirty-five trials were included in this review looking at a range of different surgical techniques. The comparisons in the trials related to seven broad aspects of the surgical procedures for impacted mandibular third molar removal: type of surgical flap raised, use of retractor, techniques for bone removal, wound irrigation, wound closure, wound drainage, and complete or incomplete tooth removal. The quality of the body of evidence for each of these comparisons was very low to moderate due to the small number of trials and patients, and the majority of the trials being at either high risk of bias (65%) or unclear risk of bias (35%).</P>
<P>Recommending changes to surgical practice must therefore be limited. However, it is useful to describe the state of the research evidence supporting practice so that surgeons can make an informed choice in adopting new techniques, or continuing with established techniques.

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-07-22 15:44:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa Fdez Mauleffinch">
<P>The risk of bias for the included studies was at high risk of bias (65%), or unclear. More consistent use of the CONSORT statement for reporting of randomised controlled clinical trials would increase the value of research.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Detailed reporting of methods, such as generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, and numbers and reasons for withdrawals and exclusions.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of outcome assessment if possible.</LI>
<LI>Full reporting of methods used to measure facial swelling.</LI>
<LI>Reporting of adverse effects of interventions.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Studies of a split-mouth design may be appropriate for comparing different surgical techniques for third molar removal but trialists need to consider which outcomes are appropriate and the design and analysis of these studies. It would be helpful to have a consensus agreement on the criteria for the measurement of facial swelling. There is a need for trials looking at coronectomy versus complete tooth removal, with a long-term follow-up so any adverse events such as root migration and root exposure requiring further surgery can be determined.</P>

<P>During the preparation of this review it was decided to exclude studies of germectomy as this procedure is fundamentally different from the extraction of impacted mandibular third molars. We also excluded studies looking at 'periodontal outcomes relating to the second permanent molar from the review', although this was not specified in the protocol.</P>
<P>There have been some changes to the prespecified outcomes and prioritisation of outcomes.</P>
<P>The protocol was published in 2003 and new methods have been applied for: quality assessment, inclusion of Summary of Findings tables and GRADE.</P>

<P>The author notes that the low incidence of sensory disturbance in this study may be related to the fact that the procedures were performed under local anaesthetic. Previous studies may indicate that procedures performed under general anaesthetic are associated with higher levels of sensory disturbances, but as the author rightly points out: "the choice of general anaesthesia [...] may also be related to the degree of difficulty when removing the third molar".

<P>The study compared removal of wisdom teeth with or without lingual flap retraction. Prior to operation the operator was allocated the random group procedure. The authors found significant differences for the grades of surgical difficulty between the 2 groups. On investigation some of the operators had deviated from the protocol. In an unknown number of easier surgical cases the lingual flap was not raised when it should have been. We are unable to quantify the bias caused by this protocol violation</P>
