<DESCRIPTION>
<P>New studies found and included or excluded: 25 April 2007.</P>
<P>The literature search as described in the search strategy sections was updated on 25 April 2007. The time frame used was from the April 2007 back to 1999. Fifteen publications were identified that had not been previously included, apparently dealing with the various therapeutic options for management of late radiation proctitis. Initial examination confirmed that 10 were case reports or case series, two were reviews, one was a phase II study, and one was a systematic review containing an as yet unpublished RCT of hyberbaric oxygen in the management of late radiotherapy proctitis. The other reports were excluded, leaving the phase II prospective series and one possible randomised comparative trial.<BR/>
<BR/>Hence seven controlled studies are currently reported: three compared different rectal steroid preparations and anti-inflammatory agents versus rectal sucralfate, and were not placebo controlled; two evaluated short chain fatty acid enemas and were placebo controlled but of different designs; one compared the effect of bipolar electrocoagulation versus the heater probe; one unpublished study examined the effect of hyberbaric oxygen versus placebo; another reported a double-blind placebo RCT using vitamin A; and lastly a phase II series was included on people who had received WF10 therapy.<BR/>
<BR/>As in the original review, all the sections describe different interventions and outcome parameters so that they cannot be compared and a summary statistic cannot be derived.</P>

<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Radiotherapy is often used to treat cancer in the pelvic area. Several organs in the pelvis, such as the anus, rectum, bladder, prostate, gynaecological organs (womb, ovaries, cervix, and vagina), small bowel, and pelvic bones may be exposed to the effects of radiotherapy, which can lead to pelvic radiation disease. Symptoms from pelvic radiation disease may occur around the time of treatment (early effects) or over a period of time, often many years after treatment (late effects) due to long-term changes secondary to scarring (fibrosis), narrowing (stenosis), and bleeding due to new blood vessel formation (telangiectasia). Damage to the rectum (radiation proctopathy) is the most often investigated late radiation effect to the pelvis, which affects a small but but still important group of people who undergo pelvic radiotherapy. The common symptoms are rectal urgency, rectal incontinence, pain, mucus discharge, and rectal bleeding.</P>
<P>
<B>The aim of the review</B>
</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to assess the effect of non-surgical treatments on late rectal damage.</P>
<P>
<B>Main Findings</B>
</P>
<P>We found 16 (quasi) randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including 993 participants that assessed non-surgical treatments for radiation proctopathy. Although some treatments look promising (including rectal sucralfate, adding metronidazole to an anti-inflammatory regimen, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy), the quality of evidence was low to very low. Furthermore, outcomes important to people with cancer, including quality of life (QoL), and long-term effects were often not addressed in these studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Although some interventions for late radiation rectal damage are promising, the evidence was of low quality and we can draw no firm conclusions. We could not combine data from the studies to compare different treatments, since the trial designs and outcome measures differed. The episodic and variable nature of late radiation rectal damage requires larger RCTs to establish whether treatments are effective. Future studies should address the possibility of associated injury to other pelvic structures, collectively known as pelvic radiation disease. Ideally outcome measures should be standardised across studies and include QoL evaluations and other outcomes important to people with cancer .</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for the majority of outcomes was low or very low, mainly due to the small size of most studies and study limitations. </P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-02-25 10:08:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11, 2015); MEDLINE (Ovid); EMBASE (Ovid); CANCERCD; Science Citation Index; and CINAHL from inception to November 2015.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-02-25 10:31:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing non-surgical interventions for the management of late radiation proctopathy in people with cancer who have undergone pelvic radiotherapy for cancer. Primary outcomes considered were: episodes of bowel activity, bleeding, pain, tenesmus, urgency, and sphincter dysfunction.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-02-25 10:09:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and data extraction were performed in duplicate, and any disagreements were resolved by involving a third review author.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-18 15:50:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We identified 1221 unique references and 16 studies including 993 participants that met our inclusion criteria. One study found through the last update was moved to the 'Studies awaiting classification' section. We did not pool outcomes for a meta-analysis due to variation in study characteristics and endpoints across included studies.</P>
<P>Since radiation proctopathy is a condition with various symptoms or combinations of symptoms, the studies were heterogeneous in their intended effect. Some studies investigated treatments targeted at bleeding only (group 1), some investigated treatments targeted at a combination of anorectal symptoms, but not a single treatment (group 2). The third group focused on the treatment of the collection of symptoms referred to as pelvic radiation disease. In order to enable some comparison of this heterogeneous collection of studies, we describe the effects in these three groups separately.</P>
<P>Nine studies assessed treatments for rectal bleeding and were unclear or at high risk of bias. The only treatments that made a significant difference on primary outcomes were argon plasma coagulation (APC) followed by oral sucralfate versus APC with placebo (endoscopic score 6 to 9 in favour of APC with placebo, risk ratio (RR) 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 4.55; 1 study, 122 participants, low- to moderate-quality evidence); formalin dab treatment (4%) versus sucralfate steroid retention enema (symptom score after treatment graded by the Radiation Proctopathy System Assessments Scale (RPSAS) and sigmoidoscopic score in favour of formalin (P = 0.001, effect not quantified, 1 study, 102 participants, very low- to low-quality evidence), and colonic irrigation plus ciprofloxacin and metronidazole versus formalin application (4%) (bleeding (P = 0.007, effect not quantified), urgency (P = 0.0004, effect not quantified), and diarrhoea (P = 0.007, effect not quantified) in favour of colonic irrigation (1 study, 50 participants, low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Three studies, of unclear and high risk of bias, assessed treatments targeted at something very localised but not a single pathology. We identified no significant differences on our primary outcomes. We graded all studies as very low-quality evidence due to unclear risk of bias and very serious imprecision.</P>
<P>Four studies, of unclear and high risk of bias, assessed treatments targeted at more than one symptom yet confined to the anorectal region. Studies that demonstrated an effect on symptoms included: gastroenterologist-led algorithm-based treatment versus usual care (detailed self help booklet) (significant difference in favour of gastroenterologist-led algorithm-based treatment on change in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire&#8211;Bowel (IBDQ-B) score at six months, mean difference (MD) 5.47, 95% CI 1.14 to 9.81) and nurse-led algorithm-based treatment versus usual care (significant difference in favour of the nurse-led algorithm-based treatment on change in IBDQ-B score at six months, MD 4.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 8.19) (1 study, 218 participants, low-quality evidence); hyperbaric oxygen therapy (at 2.0 atmospheres absolute) versus placebo (improvement of Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic - Late Effects of Normal Tissue (SOMA-LENT) score in favour of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), P = 0.0019) (1 study, 150 participants, moderate-quality evidence, retinol palmitate versus placebo (improvement in RPSAS in favour of retinol palmitate, P = 0.01) (1 study, 19 participants, low-quality evidence) and integrated Chinese traditional plus Western medicine versus Western medicine (grade 0 to 1 radio-proctopathy after treatment in favour of integrated Chinese traditional medicine, RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.30 to 5.02) (1 study, 58 participants, low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>The level of evidence for the majority of outcomes was downgraded using GRADE to low or very low, mainly due to imprecision and study limitations. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-02-25 10:32:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Although some interventions for late radiation proctopathy look promising (including rectal sucralfate, metronidazole added to an anti-inflammatory regimen, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy), single small studies provide limited evidence. Furthermore, outcomes important to people with cancer, including quality of life (QoL) and long-term effects, were not well recorded. The episodic and variable nature of late radiation proctopathy requires large multi-centre placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) to establish whether treatments are effective. Future studies should address the possibility of associated injury to other gastro-intestinal, urinary, or sexual organs, known as pelvic radiation disease. The interventions, as well as the outcome parameters, should be broader and include those important to people with cancer, such as QoL evaluations.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-20 09:02:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>This review is an update of the previously published Cochrane review 'Non-surgical interventions for late radiation proctopathy in people who have received radical radiotherapy to the pelvis' (<LINK REF="REF-Denton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denton 2002</LINK>), which was last updated in 2007.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-04-18 15:41:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Radiotherapy is often used to treat cancer in the pelvic area. It can be used as single therapy or in combination with chemotherapy, as primary treatment or before or after surgery. Examples of cancer in the pelvis that can be treated with radiotherapy include prostate, bladder, cervix, endometrial, vaginal, rectal, and anal cancer. One drawback of radiotherapy is the development of late radiation toxicity. Several organs in the pelvis, including the anus, rectum, bladder, prostate, gynaecological organs, pelvic bones, and sometimes small bowel may be exposed to the effects of radiotherapy, which can lead to a variety of symptoms. The term 'pelvic radiation disease' has been proposed, defined as &#8220;transient or long term problems, ranging from mild to severe, arising in non-cancerous tissues resulting from radiotherapy treatment to a tumour of pelvic origin&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Andreyev-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreyev 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Denham-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denham 2002</LINK>). If symptoms are confined to the rectum or the anorectal complex, we tend to speak of radiation-associated proctopathy, or radiation-induced proctopathy, formerly referred to as late radiation proctopathy. The current review, which is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2002 and subsequently assessed as up to date in 2008, about the treatment of late radiation proctopathy is mainly focused on late radiation-associated proctopathy, further referred to as radiation proctopathy, although more recent studies may examine treatment for pelvic radiation disease (<LINK REF="STD-Andreyev-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Andreyev 2013</LINK>). Radiation proctopathy is the most often investigated late-radiation effect to the pelvis. The common symptoms are rectal urgency, rectal incontinence, pain, strictures, mucus discharge, and rectal bleeding.</P>
<P>There have been extensive investigations into the association between rectal dose and the occurrence of late radiation proctopathy when treating the prostate gland (<LINK REF="REF-Boersma-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boersma 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peeters-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peeters 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pollack-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollack 2002</LINK>). Since several dose-escalation studies found an improved biochemical control for prostate cancer at higher radiation doses, the standard care for treatment is a prescribed dose of at least 75 Gy (<LINK REF="REF-Peeters-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peeters 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pollack-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollack 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zietman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zietman 2005</LINK>). However, in these dose-escalation studies, an increase of radiation proctopathy was found with higher doses to the prostate (and therefore also to the rectum). It is reasonable to assume that the risk of radiation proctopathy also applies to other cancer sites in the same region that are being radiated. Toxic effects of radiotherapy are often graded according to the Radiotherapy Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Schema on a scale of 0 to 5 (<A HREF="http://www.rtog.org">www.rtog.org</A>, <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and other adjusted local scorings schemas are also often used. Radiation proctopathy greater than grade 2 has been reported in 20% to 35% of men treated for prostate cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Mamgani-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Mamgani 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pollack-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollack 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zietman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zietman 2005</LINK>). However, these are physician-reported outcomes. Patient-reported outcomes (outcomes derived directly from people about how they function or feel in relation to a health condition and its therapy, without interpretation of the patient&#8217;s responses by a clinician) could be very different, and thus these toxicity outcomes could be underestimated (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pathophysiology and symptomatology of radiation proctopathy are rather complex because different anorectal subregions can be involved (<LINK REF="REF-Heemsbergen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heemsbergen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smeenk-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeenk 2012b</LINK>). For example, rectal incontinence and urgency are caused by reduced rectal capacity and tissue compliance resulting in impaired anal sphincter function (<LINK REF="REF-Kushwaha-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kushwaha 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smeenk-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeenk 2012b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yeoh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeoh 2009</LINK>). Incontinence and urgency symptomatology originates from different muscle groups of the anorectal sphincter complex (<LINK REF="REF-Smeenk-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeenk 2012</LINK>). However, in this patient group incontinence can also be induced by loose stool consistency and speed of transit through the small bowel (<LINK REF="REF-Putta-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Putta 2005</LINK>). Rectal bleeding is usually the result of vulnerable mucosa combined with loss of submucosal capillaries, leading to new, but abnormal, blood vessels formation (teleangiectasia) in the rectal wall.</P>
<P>With modern radiotherapy techniques such as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), higher conformal dose distribution to the prostate gland is reached with consequently lower doses to the anorectal complex. Yet, even with IMRT radiation, proctopathy incidence is 5% to 65% (<LINK REF="REF-Bekelman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bekelman 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Meerleer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Meerleer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zelefsky-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zelefsky 2008</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-04-18 13:25:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The medical treatment of radiation proctopathy is not clearly defined and in the absence of recommendations, management is often unsatisfactory. This is due in part to difficulties in recognising and establishing the diagnosis and also because a proportion of the biological changes are not reversible. At present there is no 'best' treatment for this clinical scenario, and the outcomes of both medical and surgical management can be disappointing. The literature suggests a number of treatment options, including low-residue or elemental diets, pain control, and replacement transfusion. Other therapies are reported to be of variable benefit in controlling symptoms, with the option of surgery if medical management fails or is inappropriate (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=9794636582E26AA200EE8874C64106AB&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Babb-1996">Babb 1996</A>).</P>
<P>Current non-surgical treatment options include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Aminosalicylic acid derivatives: Anti-inflammatory agents in this group, such as sulfasalazine and mesalazine, have been reported to have a role in the management of this condition (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=9793424582E26AA200EE88747E87EC99&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Baum-1989">Baum 1989</A>). Another agent with anti-inflammatory properties is WF10 (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=9793424582E26AA200EE88747E87EC99&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Veerasarn-2006">Veerasarn 2006</A>).</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Sulfasalazine is a prodrug that is composed of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and sulfapyridine. In the colon, sulfasalazine is divided by the bacterial enzyme azoreductase into the two components. 5-ASA (mesalazine), the active component, is poorly absorbed from the colon and is largely secreted in the stool. Sulfapyridine is largely absorbed in the colon and is associated with many side effects. Sulfasalazine is available as an oral and as a topical (rectal) compound. Intake is distributed in two to three times over day. At the beginning of therapy, a dose of 2 g to 4 g a day is given, which can be lowered to 1 g to 2 g a day for maintainance. Sulfazalasine, 5-ASA (mesalazine), is the active component against inflammatory bowel disease. The precise mechanism of action is not known, but is mainly attributed to anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. The considered mechanisms of action are: inhibition of cytokine synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Bantel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bantel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rousseaux-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rousseaux 2005</LINK>), inhibition of prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkey-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkey 1985</LINK>), free radical scavenging (<LINK REF="REF-Ahnfelt_x002d_Ronne-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahnfelt-Ronne 1990</LINK>), immunosuppressive activity by inhibition of T-cell and B-cell activation (<LINK REF="REF-MacDermott-1989a" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDermott 1989a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 1995</LINK>), and impairement of white cell adhesion and function (<LINK REF="REF-Neal-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neal 1987</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Mesalazine is the active component of sulfasalazine. It is rapidly absorbed in the jejunum. Several compounds are on the market with delayed release of mesalazine to increase the availability for the colon.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Short chain fatty acid (SCFA) preparations: SCFA enema is a solution of sodium acetate, sodium propionate, sodium n-butyrate with additional sodium chloride. As butyrate is the most effective SCFA for colonic regeneration, an only-butyrate enema as a 80 mmol solution is also effective (<LINK REF="REF-Hille-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hille 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vernia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Vernia 2000</LINK>). This solution is placed endorectally once or twice a day. Vernia et al. found that an application course of three weeks or more is needed for optimal result (<LINK REF="STD-Vernia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Vernia 2000</LINK>). An improvement can be observed after four to six weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1998</LINK>). SCFAs are organic fatty acids that are produced by colonic bacterial metabolism. SFCAs are produced predominantly in the colon by anaerobic bacterial fermentation of non-absorbed carbohydrates. The majority is absorbed in the colon. When SCFA is absorbed by colonocytes, sodium and water absorption is stimulated. Besides this, SCFA dilates resistance arteries, increase mucosal blood flow and oxygen uptake, reduces mucosal permeability, and enhances production and release of mucus (<LINK REF="REF-Kvietys-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kvietys 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mortensen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mortensen 1990</LINK>). SCFAs are necessary for optimal growth of the colonic mucosa and stimulate cell proliferation.</LI>
<LI>Sucralfate preparations: Sucralfate is an aluminium salt of sucrose octasulfate. It can be used twice a day in a 1 g to 2 g enema as a 10% suspension in water (<LINK REF="STD-Kochhar-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kochhar 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McElvanna-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">McElvanna 2014</LINK>). Relief of symptoms can be expected after one to two weeks. Other possible suspensions are in propylcellulose or glycerine. The dose varies from 1 g to 10 g (<LINK REF="REF-Carling-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carling 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kochhar-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kochhar 1988</LINK>). Sucralfate works by a cytoprotective effect because of an adherent complex binding to tissue proteins of the mucosa and protecting the colonic mucosa. There is evidence for promoting angiogenesis and reduction of microvascular injury (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-1997" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 1997</LINK>). Another possible mechanism is because of lowering of prostaglandin-E2 levels (<LINK REF="REF-Zahavi-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zahavi 1989</LINK>).</LI>

<LI>Coagulation therapy:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Bipolar electrocoagulation: Coagulation is achieved with a probe by heating the contact tissue. Direct contact of the probe with the treated tissue is necessary. At the tip of the probe positive and negative electrodes are located that pass electricity through the tissue. Coagulation depth is controlled by probe size, duration of heating, and choice of energy. The applied current is locally between the electrodes of the probe. The coagulation is aimed at bleeding telangiectatic areas. At 70ºC tissue coagulation will occur and bleeding is stopped. Once the tissue is desiccated, tissue resistance increases and prevents deep coagulation. Bipolar electrocoagulation is effective for superficial lesions. Penetration depth can be regulated by the probe size, applied energy level, and pressure of the probe on tissue.</LI>
<LI>Thermal coagulation therapy: The heater probe is a thermocouple to heat up the exposed tissue by cauterisation. At the tip of the probe there is a heat-generating device that converts electric energy to heat energy (<LINK REF="REF-Protell-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Protell 1978</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Argon plasma coagulation uses ionised argon gas for a thermal reaction. A probe is introduced to the treatment area, and argon gas, which itself is non-flammable, is sprayed on the surface to be treated and ionised by 6000 volts via electric wires in the probe. A high-frequency current develops between the electrode and the underlying tissue, resulting in coagulation and desiccation. Desiccated tissue loses electric conductivity, prohibiting deep devitalization of the treated tissue. Coagulation is achieved by heating up the treated tissue. Heating is not influenced by tissue resistance, making deep coagulation possible. The mechanism of coagulation and desiccation of the treated tissue is by direct heat transfer.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Corticosteroids: Several steroid enemas are available for radiation proctopathy treatment. Hydrocortisone, prednisolone, and betamethasone were used in this review. The enema is introduced into the rectum for several minutes once a day. The treatment can be continued for 2 to 4 weeks. Hydrocortisone is available as, for example, 100 mg in a 60 ml aqueous solution. Betamethasone, which has a more powerful action than hydrocortisone, is available as, for example, 5 mg in a 100 ml aqueous solution. The working mechanism of topical corticosteroid application (steroid enema) is an anti-inflammatory effect with the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Formalin applications: Formalin is applied topically in a 4% to 10% solution on the affected rectal mucosa. The application can be either by irrigation of the rectum or direct application with a soaked gauze. Formalin acts by hydrolysing proteins leading to chemical cauterisation. Another mechanism is by coagulation of the tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leiper-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leiper 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parikh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parikh 2003</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Pentoxyfilline: Pentoxyfilline is a xanthine derivative. It is almost completely resorbed by oral admission. It is also used for intermittent claudication and administered orally three times a day 400 mg. Pentoxifylline increases the deformability of erythrocytes, inhibits the aggregation of thrombocytes, and reduces fibrinogen level in plasma. In this way microvascular blood flow is enhanced.</LI>
<LI>Antibiotic treatment: Metronidazole is an antibiotic that is especially useful in the treatment of anaerobic infections. Metronidazole is effective against obligate anaerobes and against facultative anaerobes such as <I>Helicobacter pylori</I> and <I>Gardnerella vaginalis</I>. It is orally well absorbed and distributed evenly into body tissues. The dosage is dependent on the indication for treatment. Usual oral administration is 1 g to 2 g distributed in one to four intakes. The working mechanism of metronidazole is by its anti-inflammatory action to improve mucosal healing in combination with other therapeutic measures.</LI>
<LI>Hyperbaric oxygen: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is performed in specially designed chambers. One or more people are treated in the chamber with 100% oxygen. Pressure is increased to 25 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> to 30 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> Pa. Treatment duration is approximately 60 to 90 minutes, 5 to 7 days a week. Number of treatments varies with the degree of severity and response effect, usually 30 to 40 treatments. Plasma oxygen level increases by inhalation of 100% high-pressure oxygen. As a result, tissue oxygenation will improve. Hyperbaric oxygen facilitates fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis, and wound healing (<LINK REF="REF-Marx-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marx 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roth-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wattel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wattel 1998</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Retinol palmitate: Retinol palmitate, or vitamin A, is completely absorbed via the bowel. The recommended daily allowance for an adult male is 3000 IU (900 micrograms) and for an adult female 2300 IU (700 micrograms). Therapeutic dosage for retinol in case of deficiency is 25,000 to 50,000 IU per day for a limited period. The prophylactic dosage is 2500 to 5000 IU per day. Retinol palmitate increases fibroblast secretion of mucopolysaccharide and collagen and increases fibronectin synthesis. These mechanisms assist in wound healing (<LINK REF="REF-Hein-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hein 1984</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Chinese traditional medicine in combination with Western medicine: consists of Shen Ling Bai Zhu powders (herbal ingredients) and Western medicine (smectite powder 6 g, dexamethasone 5 mg, levofloxacin hydrochloride 0.2 g, anisodamine 10 mg, and physiological saline 100 ml).</LI>

<P>As described above, late radiation proctopathy is common, with incidence rates of 5% to 65% (<LINK REF="REF-Bekelman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bekelman 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Meerleer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Meerleer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zelefsky-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zelefsky 2008</LINK>), and potentially a major burden to people with cancer. The medical treatment of radiation proctopathy is not clearly defined, and in the absence of recommendations, management of the condition is often unsatisfactory. While the literature suggests a number of treatment options, there is no 'best' treatment choice. We are therefore assessing the effectiveness of various non-surgical treatment options in managing late radiation proctopathy in this review.</P>

We considered the risk of bias of this study to be unclear. Severe bleeding episodes, defined as a bleeding that provoked an unscheduled hospital assessment, occurred in 33% (3/12) of the bipolar probe group and in 11% (1/9) of the heater probe group (RR 2.25, 95% CI 0.28 to 18.22) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).

Mean units of blood transfused after one year was greater for the heater probe group, however the MD was not estimable (<LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>). No major complications occurred. Participants all expressed an improvement in their general health as a result of their controlled bleeding, which the study authors considered to be an informal quality of life assessment. During follow-up endoscopy there was resolution of the telangiectasia, scarring, or epithelial replacement in all cases in both groups.

We considered the risk of bias of this study to be unclear. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to rectal bleeding.

In a per-protocol analysis, these results were 92.3% and 93.3% respectively (P = 1.000). There was no difference between the groups with regard to mean number of sessions needed for eradication (APC 3.7 (standard deviation (SD) 1.7), BEC 2.9 (1.9); P = 0.313). Minor complications were recorded in 5 to 15 in the APC group and 10 to 15 in the BEC group (RR 0.50, 95 % CI 0.22 to 1.11) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>), and major haemorrhagic complications in 1 and 5, respectively (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.51) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>).

We considered the risk of bias of this study to be high. Over the four weeks of treatment, the endoscopic appearance improved more in the hydrocortisone group (12/16) than in the betamethasone group (5/14) (RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.98 to 4.48) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>). The degree of bleeding was reduced in 6 out of 16 in the hydrocortisone group and in 3 out of 14 of the betamethasone group, but this did not show a significant difference (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.53 to 5.73) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>). The duration of this response was only reported for the four-week follow-up period and not thereafter. Potential reasons for the difference in effect may be the more aggressive grade of disease in the betamethasone group at baseline, which would have been less likely to respond to any treatment, and also the fact that the betamethasone enema was poorly tolerated in 10/14 participants compared with 2/16 in the hydrocortisone group (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.67 in favour of the hydrocortisone group) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.3</LINK>).</P>

In spite of having a higher median symptom score (graded by the Radiation Proctopathy System Assessments Scale) before treatment, participants treated with formalin dab demonstrated a marked decrease in symptom score after treatment compared with participants treated with sucralfate retention enema, and the difference once again was statistically significant (P = 0.001). Similarly, the median sigmoidoscopic grade was significantly lower for participants in group 1 compared with participants in group 2 after treatment (P = 0.000). There were no specific treatment-related complications in either group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Formalin application versus colonic irrigation and oral antibiotics</HEADING>
<P>Another study randomised 50 participants with haemorrhagic radiation proctopathy to either 4% formalin application or colonic irrigation and oral antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Sahakitrungruang-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sahakitrungruang 2012</LINK>). We considered the risk of bias of this study to be high. The study revealed greater improvement in rectal bleeding, urgency, and diarrhoea in the irrigation group. Twenty out of 24 participants in the irrigation group were satisfied with the treatment compared to ten out of 23 participants in the formalin group (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.16). </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pentoxifylline in addition to standard therapy</HEADING>
<P>In one study, 40 participants were randomised to either local standard therapies (including blood transfusion, analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, dietary modification, local steroids applications, or sucralfate enemas) or identical therapies plus oral pentoxifylline 400 mg three times daily for six months (study group) (<LINK REF="STD-Venkitaraman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Venkitaraman 2008</LINK>). We considered the risk of bias of this study to be high. Sixteen participants in the pentoxifylline group and 12 in the control group had cessation of rectal bleeding for a week or more (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.03) (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>). The median time to cessation of bleeding was 22 days (range 1 to 119 days) in the study group and 95 days (range 13 to 172) in the control group (P = 0.12). At least one episode of recurrent bleeding occurred in 14 of the 16 participants in the study group and in all the 12 participants who had cessation of bleeding in the control group. The median duration of freedom from bleeding was 12 days (range 8 to 290) in the study group and 11 days (range 7 to 133) in the control group. There was an overall trend of a reduction of rectal bleeding episodes with time in both groups, as judged by the proportion of days in which one or more rectal bleeding episode was reported. This study could not show a statistically significant advantage with six months of pentoxifylline compared with the used standard measures for late radiation-induced rectal bleeding.</P>

<P>One study included 32 participants with radiation-induced proctosigmoidopathy (<LINK REF="STD-Kochhar-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kochhar 1991</LINK>). Participants were randomised to either oral sulfasalazine 500 mg and rectal prednisolone 20 mg or oral placebo and rectal sucralfate suspension. We considered the risk of bias of this study to be unclear. Eight out of 15 participants in the sulfasalazine/steroid group showed a clinical improvement compared to 16/17 in the sucralfate group (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.92) (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>).

<P>The first study was a prospective randomised, double-blind, cross-over pilot study that randomised 15 participants with late radiation proctopathy, to either a normal saline placebo enema or a SCFA enema, which was 60 ml in volume and administered twice a day (<LINK REF="STD-Talley-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Talley 1997</LINK>). It contained 40 mM of butyrate in the Harig preparation, used for two weeks with a one-week wash-out period before giving the alternate enema. We considered the risk of bias of this study to be unclear. The total symptom score at baseline ranged from 2 to 11 (median 5.5). Symptom scores improved slightly on the active treatment (median score 3.5 (range 3 to 5) compared with 4.5 median score (range 3 to 6) for those receiving placebo. Neither changes in the symptom score nor changes in the individual symptoms were statistically significant.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Topical formalin versus argon plasma coagulation</HEADING>
<P>The second study compared the effect of topical formalin and argon plasma coagulation (APC) for intractable rectal bleeding and anorectal dysfunction associated with late radiation proctopathy (<LINK REF="STD-Yeoh-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Yeoh 2013</LINK>). Thirty men with intractable rectal bleeding (defined as one per week or more or requiring blood transfusions, or both) after radiotherapy for prostate carcinoma were randomised to treatment with APC or topical formalin. We considered this study to be at high risk of bias. Control of rectal bleeding was achieved in 100% of the topical formalin group and 94% of the APC group after a median of two sessions of the respective treatment. No significant differences in efficacy and durability of rectal bleeding between the two groups (rectal bleeding scores, median (range): 1 (0 to 2) versus 1 (0 to 2); visual analogue scale for rectal bleeding (mm), median (range): 13 (0 to 25) versus 14 (0 to 34)) were found. There were no differences between topical formalin and APC for anorectal symptoms and function, nor for anal sphincteric morphology. The treatments were well tolerated. No skin toxicity was noted in participants who needed more than one formalin treatment session.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Metronidazole in addition to mesalazine and betamethasone</HEADING>
<P>In the third study participants with rectal bleeding and diarrhoea were randomly allocated to either metronidazole (3 x 400 mg orally per day), mesalazine (3 x 1 g orally per day), and betamethasone enema (once a day) or to the same doses of mesalazine and betamethasone enema, but without metronidazole (<LINK REF="STD-Cavcic-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cavcic 2000</LINK>). We considered the risk of bias of this study to be high. The incidence of rectal bleeding and mucosal ulcers was significantly lower in the metronidazole group at 4 weeks (P = 0.009), 3 months (P = 0.031), and 12 months (P = 0.029). There was also a significant decrease in diarrhoea and oedema in the metronidazole group at 4 weeks (P = 0.044), 3 months (P = 0.045), and 12 months (P = 0.034) after treatment. One year after treatment, 22/24 participants in the metronidazole group had demonstrated a reduction in the grade of their rectal bleeding compared to 5/12 in the group treated with mesalazine and betamethasone (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.57) (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>). Similarly, 23 out of 24 participants in the metronidazole group compared to 8/12 in the control group had experienced reduction in their diarrhoea and rectal erythema (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.16) (<LINK REF="CMP-008.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-008.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.3</LINK>). The degree of rectal ulceration at 1 year had decreased in 22/24 participants in the metronidazole group compared with 7/12 of the group treated with anti-inflammatories alone (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.57) (<LINK REF="CMP-008.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.4</LINK>).</P>

<U>)</U>. The sham participants were subsequently crossed to group 1 (however, only the results before the cross-over are reported here). We considered this study to be at unclear risk of bias. A decrease (improvement) of the Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic - Late Effects of Normal Tissue (SOMA-LENT) score of 5.00 points occurred in the intervention group, and a decrease of 2.61 points in the sham group. The decrease was significantly larger in the intervention group than in the sham group (P = 0.0019). The proportion of responders (healed, significant improvement, or modest improvement versus no improvement) in the intervention group was higher than in the sham group (88.9% versus 62.5%, respectively; RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.77) (<LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>). Based on a repeated measures logistic model, the odds ratio for improvement was 5.93 (95% CI 2.04 to 17.24), of which a risk difference was derived of 0.32 (32%) resulting in a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 3. With respect to bowel-specific QoL marked improvement was noted for the intervention group after treatment but not for the sham group (14% for bowel bother and 9% for bowel function versus 5% and 6%, respectively).</P>

We considered this study to be at unclear risk of bias. Response was defined as a reduction in two or more symptoms by at least two Radiation Proctopathy System Assessments Scale (RPSAS) points.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Gastroenterologist-led algorithm-based treatment versus nurse-led algorithm-based treatment versus usual care</HEADING>

The algorithm provided a step-by-step approach along a care pathway from initial identification of symptoms to long-term management. The study randomised 218 participants (18 years of age and older) with new-onset gastrointestinal symptoms persisting 6 months after pelvic radiotherapy were randomised to one of the three arms. We considered the risk of bias of this study to be high. The primary endpoint was change in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire&#8211;Bowel subset score (IBDQ-B) at six months, on which the following pair-wise mean differences in change in IBDQ-B score between groups were recorded: nurse versus booklet 4.12 (95% CI 0.04 to 8.19), gastroenterologist versus booklet 5.47 (1.14 to 9.81). Outcomes in the nurse group were not inferior to outcomes in the gastroenterologist group (MD 1.36, one-sided 95% CI &#8211;1.48). When considering IBDQ-B at six months, a MD of 4.80 (95% CI -0.52 to 10.12) was found for the gastroenterologist versus booklet group; a MD of 4.50 (95% CI -0.99 to 9.99) for the nurse versus booklet group; and a MD of 0.30 (95% CI -2.99 to 3.59) for the gastroenterologist versus nurse group (<LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK>).

Of these, five studies compared different active interventions with each other, three studies assessed the effect of the addition of one intervention to another intervention, and one study was placebo controlled. We only found significant differences in our primary outcomes for the studies that assessed argon plasma coagulation (APC) followed by oral sucralfate versus APC with placebo (significant difference in endoscopic score 6 to 9 at week 8 in favour of APC with placebo) (<LINK REF="STD-Chruscielewska-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chruscielewska 2012</LINK>); formalin dab treatment (4%) versus sucralfate steroid retention enema (significant difference in favour of formalin on symptom score after treatment (graded by the Radiation Proctopathy System Assessments Scale and sigmoidoscopic score)) (<LINK REF="STD-Nelamangala-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nelamangala 2012</LINK>); colonic irrigation plus ciprofloxacin and metronidazole versus formalin application (4%) (significant difference in favour of colonic irrigation on the outcomes bleeding, urgency, and diarrhoea) (<LINK REF="STD-Sahakitrungruang-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sahakitrungruang 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three studies assessed treatments targeted at more than one symptom, yet confined to the anorectal region, of which one was at unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Talley-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Talley 1997</LINK>), and two were at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Cavcic-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cavcic 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeoh-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Yeoh 2013</LINK>).

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-03-31 07:37:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Well-conducted randomised trials investigating non-surgical interventions for late radiation proctopathy are scarce. All included RCTs reported our primary outcome 'response of the presenting symptoms as recorded with diaries and scoring systems'. Interpretation and applicability of the evidence was limited, since many of the reported trials tended to focus mainly on rectal bleeding, whereas radiation-associated proctopathy is more complex, and in itself only one aspect of what may be labelled pelvic radiation disease (<LINK REF="REF-Andreyev-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreyev 2010</LINK>). A number of studies have explicitly examined rectal bleeding, which may be a very dominant and well-measurable symptom of radiation proctopathy. Though the results from these studies only relate to the reduction of rectal bleeding, they are still relevant. One of the treatments often used in clinical practice to reduce rectal bleeding is argon plasma coagulation. We found no placebo-controlled trials investigating the effect of this treatment. However, it is remarkable that the studies comparing this treatment to other forms of coagulation or formalin showed no significant differences, but very high effect rates on rectal bleeding in both treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lenz-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lenz 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeoh-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Yeoh 2013</LINK>). Other studies also investigated the improvement of other clinical symptoms, but used different scales to score this, so comparison is difficult.</P>
<P>Some interventions showed a significant improvement of symptoms, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy, retinol palmitate, and adding metronidazole to the anti-inflammatory regimen. Chinese traditional medicine improved colonoscopic results. Some treatments were significantly better than others, suggesting at least some efficacy (such as rectal sucralfate suspension, colonic irrigation, and formalin dab). Since there is no common standard for the treatment of late radiation proctopathy, these results are even more difficult to interpret or compare. We could not compare the largest study in this review, <LINK REF="STD-Andreyev-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Andreyev 2013</LINK>, with 218 participants, to any of the other studies because the study investigates the logistic application of an algorithm (by medical specialist, nurse, or a self help booklet), in which a number of the aforementioned treatments are represented as 'standard', dependent of the symptoms of the participants.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-02-25 11:49:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Using GRADE we downgraded the level of evidence for the majority of outcomes to low or very low, mainly due to imprecision and study limitations. Most included studies had small sample sizes. Only 4 out of 16 studies included more than 100 participants, and 9 of 16 fewer than 40 participants. Eight studies compared two active interventions against each other without a placebo-controlled group, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the results of these studies. The best evidence for the effectiveness were the placebo-controlled studies. Of the two placebo-controlled studies with a positive result, the study investigating hyperbaric oxygen therapy has the highest level of evidence given the sample size (150 participants), but had an uncertain risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2008</LINK>). The other positive placebo-controlled study (retinol palmitate) had a low risk of bias, but included only 19 participants.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-04-18 13:43:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-04-18 13:41:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>One of the most commonly used treatments against rectal bleeding is argon plasma coagulation (APC). Though APC is very effective against rectal blood loss and considered standard, to our knowledge it had never been tested in a randomised fashion. APC works to reduce rectal blood loss but not other symptoms. The treatments tested in addition to APC showed no benefit. The significant results of formalin dab treatment (4%) versus sucralfate steroid retention enema and colonic irrigation plus ciprofloxacin and metronidazole versus formalin application (4%) are hampered by the fact that they were not compared to APC and may only be indicated in case of contraindications to APC. The same applies to the three studies investigating a broader spectrum of anorectal symptoms, one of which showed an advantage of adding metronidazole to mesalazine and betamethasone enema (only for the symptom rectal blood loss). The remaining four studies focused on the entire symptom complex that may be described as pelvic radiation disease. One of these (the largest) showed that specialistic care in the form of a gastroenterologist- or nurse-led algorithm is better then a self help booklet. The remaining three studies showed a benefit from the investigated treatment, but two of these were very small. Only hyperbaric oxygen showed an advantage over placebo in a reasonably sized randomised study, hence this was the most convincing evidence.</P>
<P>Overall, we conclude for general practice that radiation proctopathy is more complex than rectal blood loss, which many studies focussed upon. The studies focusing only or mainly on rectal blood loss are hampered by the fact that the treatment considered standard for this condition was never investigated in a randomised manner. The broader radiation proctopathy and pelvic radiation disease likely require specialistic care, for instance in the form of a gastroenterologist-led algorithm. The most convincing evidence for improvement of the symptom complex of radiation proctopathy was shown for hyperbaric oxygen therapy.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-04-18 13:43:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The evidence for the effectiveness of non-surgical interventions for late radiation proctopathy is limited and hampered by a lack of common standards. Although certain interventions look promising, single small studies (even if well conducted) provide limited evidence. Some commonly used treatments have not been investigated in RCTs. This review is furthermore hampered by the inability to compare the different studies.</P>
<P>Pelvic radiation disease is often not confined to one organ, and symptomatology is based on physiological disorders. Radiation proctopathy, which was the focus of this review, is but one aspect of pelvic radiation disease. The true incidence of the disease is not clear. Before setting up future trials, a widely used uniform definition of this disorder is warranted to serve as a basis. Secondly, there is an urgent need to clearly define the endpoints to investigate and to use a unified grading system by which these endpoints can be categorised, such as the CTCAE or the LENT-SOMA for late radiation effects, to our knowledge the most widely used and well-validated classification system of (late) toxicity symptoms, which however is not as sensitive as some other scales (<LINK REF="REF-Khalid-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khalid 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olopade-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olopade 2005</LINK>). Without such a system, it is unlikely that meaningful randomised studies can be designed. Future RCTs should also include major important patient-reported outcome measures&#8217;, such as long-term effects and quality of life evaluations.</P>

<P>We changed the title to make it more explicit. We discussed interventions according to symptoms or combinations of symptoms (treatments targeted at bleeding only (group 1), treatments targeted at a combination of anorectal symptoms, but not a single treatment (group 2), or treatment of the collection of symptoms referred to as pelvic radiation disease (group 3)) rather than according to intervention. We added safety considerations to Objectives. Unlike in the previous version, we included only (quasi) randomised trials. Due to developments in Cochrane methodology since the review was completed and last updated, the risk of bias was assessed using the new Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and the GRADE approach was used to assess of the overall quality of evidence for each outcome (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2014</LINK>).</P>

<P>Methods:</P>
<P>People with persistent rectal bleeding due to CRP were randomised to receive either APC or topical formalin. Anorectal symptoms (including rectal bleeding) were assessed by questionnaire (modified SOMA-LENT questionnaire); rectal bleeding before and after treatment was also assessed by a VAS (cross-over to the other treatment was allowed if the study endpoint of a reduction in rectal bleeding to 1x/month or better or to a VAS of 25 mm or less, or both, was not reached after 4 treatment sessions). Anorectal motor and sensory function (anorectal manometry with sleeve sensor and graded balloon distension) and anal sphincteric morphology (endoanal ultrasound) were also evaluated before and after APC and topical formalin treatment. Data were compared before and after treatment and between the treatment groups (paired and unpaired t tests, respectively).</P>

<P>During a randomised double-blind controlled trial of antioxidants in the treatment of RP, we obtained rectal and/or sigmoid biopsies with limited sigmoidoscopy, before and after 8 weeks of vitamin E (400 IU tid) and vitamin C (500 mg tid) from some of the participants treated for symptomatic RP. The biopsies were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen in the endoscopy suite as soon as procurement. They were analysed for tissue nitration and oxidation by measurement of protein nitrotyrosine and carbonyl levels, respectively, using a quantitative slot immunoblot. Monoclonal rabbit anti-nitrotyrosine (1:10000) and rabbit anti-carbonyl antibodies (1:2000) were used and relative levels of oxidized proteins were quantified by measuring the optical density of the bands corresponding to anti-nitrotyrosine and anti-carbonyl immunoreactivity with a laser densitometer</P>

</CHAR_STUDY_NAME>
<CHAR_METHODS MODIFIED="2016-02-25 12:36:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>15 treatment-naive people (13M, median age 74 (38 to 83) years) with proven radiation proctopathy and significant daily bleeding were randomised to receive day-case APC or 4% topical formalin. A VAS was used to assess rectal bleeding (0 to 10; 0 = no bleeding, 10 = severe bleeding) and well-being (0 to 10; 0 = very unwell, 10 = very well). Anorectal function (urgency, incontinence) was assessed with the modified Wexner/Cleveland Clinic Continence Score (0 to 24; 0 = normal anorectal function, 24 = complete incontinence with severe urgency). Haemoglobin and transfusion requirements were recorded. Treatment was given at 6-weekly intervals until rectal bleeding had improved to VAS &#8804; 2.5</P>

<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2016-02-25 12:36:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Median follow-up was 51 weeks (19 to 114). The effect of APC and topical formalin was similar, with significant improvement in rectal bleeding after a median of 2 (1 to 3) treatment sessions. Haemoglobin increased in participants treated with APC. 4 participants were transfusion-dependent before treatment, all of whom did not require transfusions after treatment (3 APC, 1 formalin). Participant well-being and continence score did not change significantly after treatment. 2 participants treated with APC developed minor rectal strictures, which were readily treated with dilatation</P>
