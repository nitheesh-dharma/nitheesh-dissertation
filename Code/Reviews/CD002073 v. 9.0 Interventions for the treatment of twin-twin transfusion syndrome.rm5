<P>The original review did not contain any data from completed trials. We updated the search in February 2007 and added the data from two trials now published (<LINK REF="STD-Eurofetus-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Eurofetus 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moise-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moise 2005</LINK>). We updated the search in October 2007 just before submission for publication and identified a published report for the NIHCD 2007a ongoing study. The outcomes from this trial have not been included in this review but the study is awaiting assessment pending further communication with authors.<BR/>
<BR/>The results of the review cannot be conclusive as the included trials are small and no meta-analysis is available at the moment. The findings would, however, support the use of endoscopic laser coagulation in the treatment of twin-twin transfusion syndrome to improve perinatal outcome. There does not appear to be a difference in perinatal outcome between amnioreduction and septostomy.</P>

<P>Limited evidence suggests the best way to improve survival without neurological impairment in children with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is to perform laser treatment to the placenta.</P>
<P>Identical twins occur in about one in 320 pregnancies. Sometimes identical twins share the same placenta and blood flow, and the proportion of blood shared between the twins is usually equal. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome happens when the blood flow is uneven and passes from one twin (the donor) to the other (the recipient). This can happen when the placenta has deep artery-to-vein connections. The donor twin usually has very little amniotic fluid, and frequently does not grow well and is very small. The recipient twin has excessive amniotic fluid, and often has a distended bladder and other medical problems. The risk of death for both twins is high, around 80% if there is no treatment. There is also risk of physical or neurological damage to both twins if they survive. Various options for treatment exist. These include (1) the repeated removal of excessive amniotic fluid (amnioreduction); (2) laser treatment of the abnormal vessels in the placenta (endoscopic laser surgery); (3) puncture of the membrane between the twins (septostomy); and (4) the selective ending of one twin's life (selective feticide). The review found three trials, involving 253 women and 506 babies. There were no studies on laser treatment versus puncturing the membrane, nor on selective feticide. The evidence showed that laser treatment was associated with more babies being alive without a neurological abnormality when compared to removing the excess amniotic fluid. However, where there is insufficient expertise to perform laser surgery or when the pregnancy is beyond 26 weeks, amnioreduction remains the treatment of choice. Further research is needed on the best treatment for mild and very severe forms of the problem.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>

<P>The objective of this review was to evaluate the impact of treatment modalities in twin-twin transfusion syndrome.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-01 14:08:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Three studies (253 women and 506 babies) were included. All three trials were judged to be of moderate quality. One study compared amnioreduction with septostomy (71 women), whilst the other two studies compared amnioreduction with endoscopic laser coagulation (182 women). Not all trials provided outcome data that could be included in all meta-analyses.</P>
<P>
<B>Amnioreduction compared with laser coagulation</B>
<BR/>Although there was no difference in overall death between amnioreduction and laser coagulation (average risk ratio (RR) 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.38 adjusted for clustering, two trials) or death of at least one infant per pregnancy (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.09, two trials), or death of both infants per pregnancy (average RR 0.76; 95% 0.27 to 2.10, two trials), more babies were alive without neurological abnormality at the age of six years in the laser group than in the amnioreduction groups (RR 1.57; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.34 adjusted for clustering, one trial). There were no significant differences in the babies alive at six years with major neurological abnormality treated by laser coagulation or amnioreduction (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.34 to 2.77 adjusted for clustering, one trial). Outcomes for death in this 2013 update are different from the previous 2008 update, where improvements in perinatal death and death of both infants per pregnancy were shown in the laser intervention arm. The NIHCD trial included in this update exerts an opposite direction of effects to the Eurofetus study, which was previously the only included laser study, hence the difference in outcome.</P>

<P>There are no differences in overall death (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.47, adjusted for clustering, one trial), death of at least one infant per pregnancy (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.35, one trial), or death of both infants per pregnancy (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.37 to 2.22, one trial) or gestational age at birth (RR 1.20; 95% CI -0.81 to 3.21, one trial) between amnioreduction and septostomy.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-12-03 11:08:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a condition that affects identical twin pregnancies. The diagnosis requires the ultrasound demonstration of excessive fluid (hydramnios) around one twin (the recipient) and little or no fluid (oligohydramnios) around the other twin (the donor) with the separating membrane completely covering this fetus. Both twins should be structurally normal. The recipient twin is usually appropriately grown for gestational age, has a large distended bladder and may, if severely compromised, show tricuspid regurgitation or hydrops fetalis. The donor twin on the other hand, is frequently severely growth restricted with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler waveforms.</P>
<P>The condition is now graded by the Quintero staging system (<LINK REF="REF-Quintero-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quintero 1996</LINK>) as follows.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Stage 1: abnormal amniotic fluid levels along with bladder filling in the donor.</LI>
<LI>Stage 2: collapsed bladder in the donor.</LI>
<LI>Stage 3: abnormal Doppler flow in the umbilical artery or ductus venosus of either twin.</LI>
<LI>Stage 4: hydrops in either twin.</LI>
<LI>Stage 5: intrauterine death of either twin.</LI>
</UL>
<P>These clinical features are associated with the death of one or both fetuses in more than 80% of untreated pregnancies, particularly if problems develop before 28 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Saunders-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Urig-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urig 1990</LINK>). The risks are those of spontaneous miscarriage, preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, preterm labour and growth retardation. Although twin-twin transfusion is usually a gradual process, it can happen suddenly with the death of one twin, usually the recipient. This can lead to the death of the co-twin or neurological handicap in the survivor (<LINK REF="REF-Fusi-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fusi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Heteren-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Heteren 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Identical twin gestations occur in one in 320 pregnancies. Depending on when the embryos implant, the placenta will be dichorionic diamniotic, monochorionic diamniotic or monochorionic monoamniotic, a description of the pattern of membranes. Seventy-five per cent of identical twin pregnancies are monochorionic, diamniotic. Vascular connections, called anastomoses, are common in monochorionic placentas. These can be superficial artery-to-artery or vein-to-vein connections or deep artery-to-vein anastomoses. Balanced blood flow across these connections occurs in most monochorionic twins. Unbalanced transfusion from the donor to the recipient can occur in those placentas that have deep artery-to-vein connections, causing TTTS (<LINK REF="REF-Denbow-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denbow 1998</LINK>). This is associated with a high risk of death and damage to twins and accounts for 15% to 17% of the overall perinatal mortality in twins (<LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 1990</LINK>). The poor outcome of untreated TTTS leads to the introduction of a number of treatments, namely:<BR/>

<LI>amniotic septostomy;</LI>

</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-12-01 14:09:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Serial amnioreduction, the repeated removal of excessive amniotic fluid by amniocenteses, is the most established method of treatment. It was introduced initially as a treatment for hydramnios in the recipient sac, to try to prevent preterm labour or prelabour rupture of membranes, or both, but may have beneficial effects on the disease condition (<LINK REF="REF-Montan-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montan 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1985</LINK>). Colour-flow Doppler waveforms of the uterine artery, a test of wellbeing of the fetus, have shown improvement following amnioreduction (<LINK REF="REF-Bower-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bower 1995</LINK>). Other authors have reported a reduction in the rate of fluid accumulation following serial amnioreduction and therefore a lengthening of the interval between reductions (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Urig-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urig 1990</LINK>). They postulate that hydramnios compresses the placenta and increases the rate of transfusion to the recipient twin and that relieving this pressure with amnioreduction reverses this phenomenon (<LINK REF="REF-Urig-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urig 1990</LINK>). On the other hand, the increase in fetoplacental blood volume with increasing gestation may reduce the effects of anastomoses therefore, showing an improvement in the condition (<LINK REF="REF-Saunders-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 1991</LINK>). Whatever the actual physiology behind the procedure, amnioreduction appears to prolong pregnancy and thereby improves fetal survival. The survival rate following serial amnioreduction has been quoted at 37% to 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Saunders-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trespidi-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trespidi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Urig-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urig 1990</LINK>) and the risk of neurological damage at 17% to 33%. Some papers have quoted very high survival rates at around 79% (<LINK REF="REF-Elliot-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliot 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahony-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahony 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reisner-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reisner 1993</LINK>) but the results are debatable because non-identical twin pregnancies and pregnancies with fetuses with structural abnormality were not excluded (<I>see</I> definition of TTTS). The cohort studies included mild cases of TTTS, and this could be the explanation for the better outcomes. Serial amnioreduction does not require special equipment and can be performed by most obstetricians specialised in fetal medicine. Procedure-related complications occur with serial amnioreduction in the order of around 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Mahony-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahony 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saunders-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 1991</LINK>). This is mostly fetal death within 48 hours of the procedure or spontaneous abortion. Abruptio placentae has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Mahony-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahony 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reisner-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reisner 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Laser coagulation of the superficial blood vessels that cross the separating membrane of the placenta has been advocated as another method of managing TTTS (<LINK REF="REF-De-Lia-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Lia 1990</LINK>). Theoretically, it has the advantage of solving the underlying mechanism that causes unbalanced twin-twin transfusion. Controversy surrounds this theory because it has been shown that in TTTS, the anastomoses are more likely to be deep rather than superficial (<LINK REF="REF-Bajoria-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bajoria 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Machin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Machin 1996</LINK>). The coagulation of superficial vessels therefore should not have any effect on the pathophysiology of TTTS but might indeed be cutting off some normal placental vessels with inherent fetal risks (<LINK REF="REF-De-Lia-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Lia 1995</LINK>). Published series have however shown a 55% to 73% survival rate with a 4.2% neurological handicap rate (<LINK REF="REF-De-Lia-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Lia 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ville-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ville 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ville-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ville 1998</LINK>). These authors argue that irrespective of the depth of the individual anastomoses, their afferent and efferent branches are superficial and can be seen on the placental surface. Systematic coagulation of all these vessels should include the branches of these anastomoses and currently this remains the only method that can prevent transfusion between the placentas. Endoscopic laser ablation requires fetoscopic skills and currently can only be performed in a small number of centres. It is a far more invasive procedure than amnioreduction. Maternal morbidity may be much higher than with amniocentesis-related procedures and bleeding from the placental vessels is consistently reported (<LINK REF="REF-De-Lia-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Lia 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hecher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hecher 1999</LINK>). Further interventions such as amnioreduction are required in around 20% of cases.</P>
<P>The deliberate creation of a puncture in the inter twin membrane, 'septostomy', has been described by Saade et al (<LINK REF="REF-Saade-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saade 1998</LINK>). They hypothesised that the improvement in amniotic fluid dynamics in some TTTS pregnancies may be due to an inadvertent puncturing of the inter twin membrane. Survival rates as high as 83% were achieved but no figures for neurological outcome are available (<LINK REF="REF-Saade-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saade 1998</LINK>). The mechanism is thought to be an equalisation of the pressure in the two sacs, thus relieving the pressure on the placenta (<LINK REF="REF-Garry-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garry 1998</LINK>). Septostomy may be a relatively safe procedure which does not require special equipment. The major risk associated with amniotic septostomy is cord entanglement, as the procedure is effectively creating a monoamniotic pregnancy within a single sac (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Selective feticide, the deliberate ending of one twin's life, has been reported as a therapeutic option. In the event of the death of one twin, approximately 50% of surviving twins will experience mortality or neurological handicap (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Heteren-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Heteren 1998</LINK>). Feticide, using a technique which does not affect the circulation of the surviving twin, may prevent neurological injury to the survivor. Techniques such as fetoscopic cord ligation and ultrasound guided vascular embolisation have been described (<LINK REF="REF-Crombleholme-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crombleholme 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deprest-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deprest 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Donner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quintero-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quintero 1996</LINK>). These procedures are performed through the skin (percutaneous) for uterine access. The number of women treated by this method is very small, as the procedure is usually only performed where the demise of the co-twin is certain. The numbers are therefore too small to provide valid neurological outcomes for the surviving twin in these pregnancies and the survival rate by definition can at best be only 50%. Selective feticide has relative risks associated with the technique used.</P>
<P>Maternal digoxin therapy, used in conjunction with either serial amnioreduction or laser thermocoagulation, has been anecdotally reported (<LINK REF="REF-Arabin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arabin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Lia-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Lia 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roman 1995</LINK>). Fetal heart and blood dynamics, however, suggest that it should not work and it has been abandoned. Indomethacin for reduction of hydramnios in the recipient sac has been described (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1993</LINK>) but the results were not encouraging and the authors concluded that it does not prevent perinatal mortality in TTTS. Indomethacin can have potentially adverse renal effects on the donor twin.</P>

<P>We did not include cluster-randomised trials in this review. In future updates, if high-quality cluster-randomised trials are identified, we will consider including them in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> Section 16.3.4 using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>The analysis in this review involves multiple pregnancies, therefore, wherever possible, analyses were adjusted for clustering to take into account the non-independence of babies from the same pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Gates-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2004</LINK>). Treating babies from multiple pregnancies as if they are independent, when they are more likely to have similar outcomes than babies from different pregnancies, will overestimate the sample size and give confidence intervals that are too narrow. Each woman can be considered a cluster in a multiple pregnancy, with the number of individuals in the cluster being equal to the number of fetuses in her pregnancy. Analysis using cluster trial methods allows calculation of relative risk and adjustment of confidence intervals. Usually this will mean that the confidence intervals get wider. Although this may make little difference to the conclusion of a trial, it avoids misleading results in those trials where the difference may be substantial. We have used the inverse variance method for adjusted analyses, as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>All three trials were stopped early on the basis of interim analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Eurofetus-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Eurofetus 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moise-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moise 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NIHCD-2007" TYPE="STUDY">NIHCD 2007</LINK>).

In the septostomy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Moise-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moise 2005</LINK>), the recruitment rate to the trial was slower than predicted and it was felt that the primary end point would not be achieved. The included endoscopic laser surgery trial (<LINK REF="STD-Eurofetus-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Eurofetus 2004</LINK>) was stopped after the second interim analysis showed a higher rate of survival of at least one twin in the laser arm. The <LINK REF="STD-NIHCD-2007" TYPE="STUDY">NIHCD 2007</LINK> trial was stopped at the request of the investigators after recruiting only a quarter of the sample size (42 pregnancies) in five years. The study authors cited the unwillingness of referring centres to refer to units where laser photocoagulation was only available within the trial and a statistical trend in adverse outcomes affecting the recipient twin in one treatment arm. The results cannot be conclusive, particularly if many eligible participants were not referred. All trials quoted the O'Brien-Fleming rule for stopping.</P>

<P>Two included studies presented analyses that were adjusted for clustering but did not present estimates of the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) (<LINK REF="STD-Eurofetus-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Eurofetus 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moise-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moise 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Eurofetus-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Eurofetus 2004</LINK> contained enough information to deduce the values of ICC that were used for adjustments for two outcomes; all deaths (0.29) and need for blood transfusion within 48 hours. The analysis of mechanical ventilation was not adjusted for clustering because the ICC was negative.</P>
<P>For other outcomes, we used the most appropriate ICC for the adjustment; the value derived from all deaths (0.29) for outcomes that involved death, and an ICC of 0.29 for survival with and without major neurological complications at six years.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Moise-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moise 2005</LINK> did not present any estimates of the ICC but the report contained sufficient information to calculate an ICC estimate for fetal death (0.47). This was used to adjust the analyses of overall death.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-12-01 14:12:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-12-01 14:12:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review includes three studies (involving 253 women and 506 babies). The results of this review cannot be conclusive as the included trials are small and there are only meta-analyses for four outcomes in the review at the moment. The findings would however, support the use of endoscopic laser coagulation in the treatment of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in the child. This update does not show any apparent difference in overall death or any secondary death outcomes between endoscopic laser coagulation and amnioreduction. It should be noted that the two trials analysed appear to have opposite directions of effect on these outcomes. There does not appear to be a difference in perinatal outcomes between amnioreduction and septostomy.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-12-01 14:12:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The comparisons for the primary outcome represent the best available current evidence on interventions for twin-twin transfusion syndrome. The ongoing Solomon study (<LINK REF="STD-Slaghekke-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Slaghekke 2008</LINK>) aims to recruit 274 participants to a trial comparing two different methods of endoscopic laser coagulation. The composite primary outcome includes perinatal death, the recurrence of TTTS and another condition called twin anaemia-polycythaemia sequence (TAPS). The Solomon study will have two-year neurodevelopmental outcomes as well as data on mortality. Many factors affect the outcome in TTTS, one of which is the Quintero stage of the disease when the intervention is performed.</P>
<P>The trials included in this review enrolled fetuses with largely Quintero stage 2 to 3 disease. There were only two fetuses enrolled with Quintero stage 4 disease in <LINK REF="STD-Eurofetus-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Eurofetus 2004</LINK>, three in <LINK REF="STD-NIHCD-2007" TYPE="STUDY">NIHCD 2007</LINK> and two in the septostomy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Moise-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moise 2005</LINK>), so the numbers are too small to reach any conclusions in this group of fetuses. There is insufficient evidence for this review to comment on either the primary or secondary outcomes by Quintero stage. The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Eurofetus-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Eurofetus 2004</LINK> suggest that staging should not influence the choice of treatment. This is supported by the findings of Quintero et al in a cohort study, where the relationship between perinatal mortality and stage was shown to be less apparent in pregnancies treated with laser photocoagulation than amnioreduction (<LINK REF="REF-Quintero-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quintero 2003</LINK>). The authors of <LINK REF="STD-NIHCD-2007" TYPE="STUDY">NIHCD 2007</LINK> suggest that the presence of TTTS cardiomyopathy has a significant impact on recipient twin mortality.</P>
<P>Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Eurofetus-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Eurofetus 2004</LINK>) analysed developmental outcomes at age two and beyond. The data for survival with and without neurological complications at six years have now been added to the review for this 2013 update. The six-year follow-up included 256 of the 284 infants recruited to the trial, and consistent with the overall trial results, more children had died by six years in the amnioreduction group (73/120, 60.8%) than the laser group (63/136, 46.3%). More babies were alive without neurological abnormality at the age of six years in the laser group (60/132) than in the amnioreduction group (33/114); but the proportion of children alive at six years with neurological abnormality was very similar in the two groups (laser 9/136 (6.6%); amnioreduction 8/114 (7.0%). It is usual for Cochrane reviews to exclude trials with an attrition rate greater than 20%. However, these data have been included as the attrition is secondary to death not loss to follow-up. Neither the septostomy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Moise-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moise 2005</LINK>) nor <LINK REF="STD-NIHCD-2007" TYPE="STUDY">NIHCD 2007</LINK> has plans to follow up survivors.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-12-01 14:12:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The analyses in this review have been adjusted for clustering for those outcomes in which it was possible to do so. This reduces the risk of bias due to non-independence between twins. Confidence intervals become wider with cluster analysis suggesting that the true effect lies over a wider upper and lower value, i.e. that the true sample size is smaller than we think because of the inclusion of multiple pregnancies, making the estimate of effect less precise than by unadjusted analysis. The results of the adjusted analysis do not alter the conclusions in this review but may do if more pregnancies are added in the future.</P>
<P>All three trials included in this review were stopped early. All trials can be criticised for stopping early. This is because chance can lead to surprisingly large differences early in a trial, which disappear or reverse over time (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 2004</LINK>). The process for stopping trials due to internal reasons is well recognised and has statistical methodology (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 2000</LINK>). Two included studies were stopped by independent analysts: 1) an industrial partner, not involved in the study design or analysis of the data, in the case of the laser coagulation study (<LINK REF="STD-Eurofetus-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Eurofetus 2004</LINK>) and 2) a Data Monitoring Safety (DMS) Officer in the septostomy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Moise-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moise 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no formal Data Monitoring Committee mentioned for <LINK REF="STD-Eurofetus-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Eurofetus 2004</LINK>. There was a higher rate of survival of at least one twin in the laser arm with a P value of 0.002, so the trial was stopped according to the O'Brien-Fleming rule, with adjustment for multiple evaluations of the data (the rule states that at the second analysis the P value should be less than .015 in order to consider early termination). However, whatever method is used, the estimate of treatment effect will still be biased if a trial is stopped early.</P>
<P>The septostomy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Moise-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moise 2005</LINK>) was stopped by the DMS Officer when an interim analysis showed no difference in outcome suggesting that the primary endpoint would not be reached. Data monitoring committees would also take into account other considerations, such as meta-analyses of data from comparable trials, other existing evidence external to the trial and the nature of the condition and its alternative treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Doll-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doll 2001</LINK>). It is unclear whether these were considered in either trial. These trials remain, however, the best evidence for the treatment of TTTS currently available.</P>
<P>The NIH-sponsored trial (<LINK REF="STD-NIHCD-2007" TYPE="STUDY">NIHCD 2007</LINK>) was stopped at the request of the investigators after recruiting only a quarter of the sample size (42 of 146 pregnancies required) in five years. The authors cited the unwillingness of referring centres to refer to units where laser photocoagulation was only available within the trial. The authors also state that the Trial Oversight Committee noted a statistical trend in adverse outcome affecting the recipient twin in one treatment arm and made a recommendation to the Data Monitoring Committee to stop the trial with which the latter agreed. The results cannot be conclusive, particularly if many eligible participants were not referred and had laser coagulation performed elsewhere.</P>

<P>We are aware that the review process itself may introduce bias. We took various steps to reduce bias; at least two review authors independently carried out data extraction and assessed risk of bias.

<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Location: 6 countries, 122 women from France, 13 from Belgium, 3 from the Netherlands, 2 from Switzerland, 1 from Italy and 1 from the United States. Timeframe: January 1999 to March 2002. Inclusion criteria: women presenting between 15 and 26 weeks with polyuric polyhydramnios in the recipient twin, with a vertical pool of 8 cm at or before 20 weeks or 10 cm after 20 weeks with a distended fetal bladder. Oliguric oligohydramnios in the donor twin with a deepest pool measuring 2 cm. Exclusion criteria: fetal death, major fetal anomaly, ruptured membranes, maternal condition requiring delivery, and any previous invasive therapy for the syndrome. Total recruited: 142 women and 284 fetuses in both arms.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2013-12-01 10:47:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fetoscopic laser coagulation of vessels crossing the membranes. Amniotic fluid was drained through the cannula until the deepest pool was 5-6 cm on ultrasonography. Amnioreduction of the polyhydramniotic sac under local analgesia, with an 18-gauge needle and either syringe aspiration or wall suction. Amniotic fluid was drained until the deepest pool was 5-6 cm. Amnioreduction was repeated whenever polyhydramnios recurred.<BR/>Prophylactic tocolytics and antibiotics administered prophylactically. Women kept in hospital for 24-48 hours after the procedure, then seen weekly for ultrasound follow-up.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary outcomes: perinatal survival of at least 1 twin, survival of at least 1 twin to 7-12 months and neurologic complications at 7-12 months of age. Other outcomes: maternal complications (placental abruption, intra-abdominal haemorrhage, or leakage of amniotic fluid with peritoneal irritation, chorioamnionitis, amniotic fluid embolus) and fetal complications.</P>

<P>Interim analyses: 2 planned (after the inclusion of 72 and 144 women) to evaluate the rates of survival of at least one twin to discharge from NICU - an end point considered more clinically relevant than survival at 28 days. First interim analysis did not reveal any differences between the groups. The second showed a significantly higher rate of survival of at least one twin to discharge from NICU, so the trial was stopped according to the O'Brien-Fleming stopping rule for discontinuing enrolment.</P>

<P>Purposeful perforation of the inter twin membrane under ultrasound guidance with a 22-gauge needle, from the donor sac into the recipient twin's amniotic cavity. Repeat septostomy, with or without amnioreduction was performed if re-accumulation of the amniotic fluid in the donor twin's amniotic cavity did not occur. Cross-over to amnioreduction arm was allowed if oligohydramnios had not resolved in the donor twin's sac or if the deepest vertical pool in the recipient twin's sac had increased by 30% over baseline value. Salvage amnioreduction at the time of septostomy was performed if maternal symptoms were present.</P>
<P>Amnioreduction of the recipient amniotic sac using a 18-gauge needle, connected either to wall suction or a syringe attached to extension tubing. Fluid was removed until the deepest pool was less than or equal to 6 cm or 5 L was removed. Amnioreduction was repeated if there was excessive uterine activity, maternal respiratory compromise or polyhydramnios recurred.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group&#8217;s Trials Register by contacting the Trials Search Co-ordinator (January 2008).</P>
<P>The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group&#8217;s Trials Register is maintained by the Trials Search Co-ordinator and contains trials identified from:</P>
<OL>
<LI>quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);</LI>
<LI>weekly searches of MEDLINE;</LI>
<LI>handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences;</LI>
<LI>weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Details of the search strategies for CENTRAL and MEDLINE, the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service can be found in the &#8216;Specialized Register&#8217; section within the editorial information about the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PREG/frame.html">Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group</A>.</P>
<P>Trials identified through the searching activities described above are each assigned to a review topic (or topics). The Trials Search Co-ordinator searches the register for each review using the topic list rather than keywords. </P>
<P>In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2007, Issue 4) using the following search strategy:</P>
<P>We did not apply any language restrictions.</P>
