<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>This review aimed to assess whether use of different wound dressings (or leaving a wound exposed without a dressing) has an impact on the number of people who get wound infections following surgery where the wound is closed with stitches, staples, clips or glue. We also investigated whether different dressings resulted in less pain, less scarring or were more acceptable to patients and health professionals.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Millions of surgical procedures are conducted globally each year. The majority of procedures result in wounds in which the edges are brought together to heal using stitches, staples, clips or glue; this is called 'healing by primary intention'. Afterwards, wounds are often covered with a dressing that acts as a barrier between it and the outside environment. One possible advantage of a dressing may be to protect the wound from infection (surgical site infection). Many different dressing types are available for use on surgical wounds. However, it is not clear whether one type of dressing is better than any other in preventing surgical site infection, or, indeed, whether it is better not to use a dressing at all.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We conducted a review of all available, relevant evidence about the impact of dressings on the prevention of surgical site infections in surgical wounds healing by primary intention. This review examined data from 29 randomised controlled trials (which provide the most reliable evidence). These investigated the use of dressings in surgery that had a low risk of surgical site infection (clean surgery) and surgery with a higher risk (potentially contaminated surgery).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results </B>
</P>
<P>We found no clear evidence to suggest that one dressing type was better than any other at reducing the risk of surgical site infection, nor that covering wounds with any dressing at all reduced the risk of surgical site infection. Additionally, there was no clear evidence that any dressing type improves scarring, pain control, patient acceptability or ease of removal. Currently decision makers may opt to make decisions about whether and how to dress a wound based on patient and clinician preferences and dressing costs.</P>
<P>
<B>Certainty of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>It is important to note that many trials in this review were small and the evidence was of low or very low certainty meaning that current information is uncertain.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-07 08:40:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgical wounds (incisions) heal by primary intention when the wound edges are brought together and secured, often with sutures, staples, or clips. Wound dressings applied after wound closure may provide physical support, protection and absorb exudate. There are many different types of wound dressings available and wounds can also be left uncovered (exposed). Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common complication of wounds and this may be associated with using (or not using) dressings, or different types of dressing.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-15 14:12:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>We included 29 trials (5718 participants). All studies except one were at an unclear or high risk of bias. Studies were small, reported low numbers of SSI events and were often not clearly reported. There were 16 trials that included people with wounds resulting from surgical procedures with a 'clean' classification, five trials that included people undergoing what was considered 'clean/contaminated' surgery, with the remaining studies including people undergoing a variety of surgical procedures with different contamination classifications. Four trials compared wound dressings with no wound dressing (wound exposure); the remaining 25 studies compared alternative dressing types, with the majority comparing a basic wound contact dressing with film dressings, silver dressings or hydrocolloid dressings. The review contains 11 comparisons in total.</P>
<P>
<B>Primary outcome: SSI</B>
</P>
<P>It is uncertain whether wound exposure or any dressing reduces or increases the risk of SSI compared with alternative options investigated: we assessed the certainty of evidence as very low for most comparisons (and low for others), with downgrading (according to GRADE criteria) largely due to risk of bias and imprecision. We summarise the results of comparisons with meta-analysed data below:</P>
<P>- film dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following clean surgery (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.55), <I>very low certainty</I> <I>evidence downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision.</I>
</P>
<P>- hydrocolloid dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following clean surgery (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.78), <I>very low certainty evidence downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision.</I>
</P>
<P>- hydrocolloid dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following potentially contaminated surgery (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.51), <I>very low certainty evidence downgraded twice for risk of bias and twice for imprecision</I>.</P>
<P>- silver-containing dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following clean surgery (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.62), <I>very low certainty evidence downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision.</I>
</P>
<P>- silver-containing dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings following potentially contaminated surgery (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.37), <I>very low certainty evidence downgraded twice for risk of bias and twice for imprecision</I>.</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>There was limited and low or very low certainty evidence on secondary outcomes such as scarring, acceptability of dressing and ease of removal, and uncertainty whether wound dressings influenced these outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-12-06 17:11:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is uncertain whether covering surgical wounds healing by primary intention with wound dressings reduces the risk of SSI, or whether any particular wound dressing is more effective than others in reducing the risk of SSI, improving scarring, reducing pain, improving acceptability to patients, or is easier to remove. Most studies in this review were small and at a high or unclear risk of bias. Based on the current evidence, decision makers may wish to base decisions about how to dress a wound following surgery on dressing costs as well as patient preference.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-12-15 14:20:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-12-15 14:20:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>Millions of surgical procedures are conducted around the world each year. The majority of procedures result in surgical wounds that will heal by primary intention. This is where wound edges are re-approximated using sutures, staples, clips or glue, either alone, or in combination. Following wound closure, surgical wounds commonly leak fluid or blood within the first 24 hours and they are frequently covered with different types of dressing - including glue-as-a-dressing (tissue glue applied over a wound that has already been closed) - to manage the exudate, provide wound protection and prevent possible external contamination that might lead to surgical site infection (SSI) and delayed healing. A study in the USA found that in over 750,000 episodes of surgical hospitalisation, 1% resulted in an SSI (<LINK REF="REF-de-Lissovoy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Lissovoy 2009</LINK>), and similar estimates have been found in France (<LINK REF="REF-Astagneau-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Astagneau 2009</LINK>). However, such values are known to underestimate the levels of SSI by not considering those that develop outside hospitals (<LINK REF="REF-Bruce-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruce 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gibbons-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbons 2011</LINK>). In the UK it has been estimated that 4% to 5% of patients undergoing a surgical procedure contract an SSI (<LINK REF="REF-Health-Protection-Agency-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Health Protection Agency 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2008</LINK>), but this percentage varies greatly depending on the circumstances. Whilst various patient factors can predict the likelihood of SSI, the type of surgical procedure performed exerts a major influence on risk. Surgical procedures involving 'clean' body cavities have much lower numbers of infection, around 3% to 5%, compared with procedures involving body cavities with infected, necrotic or dirty tissue, for example, colorectal surgery, which have surgical infection figures of around 10% to 30% (<LINK REF="REF-McLaws-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaws 2000</LINK>). A widely used definition that describes the contamination classification of surgical procedures is given below:</P>
<P>Clean: non-infective operative wounds in which no inflammation is encountered, and neither the respiratory, alimentary, genitourinary tract nor the oro-pharyngeal cavity is entered. In addition these cases are elective, primarily closed, and drained with closed drainage system when required.</P>
<P>Clean/contaminated: operative wounds in which the respiratory, alimentary, genital or urinary tract is entered under controlled conditions and without unusual contamination. Specifically, operations involving the biliary tract, appendix, vagina and oropharynx are included in this category, provided no evidence of infection or a major break in sterile technique is encountered.</P>
<P>Contaminated: fresh, accidental wounds, operations with major breaks in sterile technique or gross spillage from the gastrointestinal tract, and incisions in which acute, non-purulent inflammation is encountered.</P>
<P>Dirty: old traumatic wounds with retained devitalised tissue and those that involve existing clinical infection or perforated viscera. This definition suggests that organisms causing postoperative infection were present in the operative field before the operation.</P>
<P>SSIs not only cause considerable patient morbidity, but also increase the consumption of healthcare resources. In the UK, the mean additional cost of treating an infected surgical wound (compared with a non-infected wound) was estimated at GBP 1618 (<LINK REF="REF-Plowman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plowman 2001</LINK>), with much of this extra cost attributable to an increased length of hospital stay (mean increase of 6.5 days) (<LINK REF="REF-Plowman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plowman 2001</LINK>). In the USA, <LINK REF="REF-de-Lissovoy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Lissovoy 2009</LINK> estimated that the extended length of stay and increased treatment costs associated with SSIs over a one-year period led to approximately 1 million additional inpatient-days, costing an additional USD 1.6 billion.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Whilst SSIs can be difficult to define (one review identified 41 different definitions and 13 grading scales of SSI (<LINK REF="REF-Bruce-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruce 2001</LINK>)), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have published the following guidelines defining superficial and deep incisional SSIs (<LINK REF="REF-Horan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horan 2008</LINK>). A superficial SSI is defined as: an infection occurring within 30 days after the operation, that only involves the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the incision, and is associated with at least one of the following:<BR/>

<P>Dressing products have evolved considerably in the last few decades, and now fall into broad, widely-recognised categories, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>basic wound contact dressings such as gauze or cotton absorbents;</LI>
<LI>'advanced' dressings such as hydrogels, hydrocolloids and films;</LI>
<LI>antimicrobial and other specialist dressings; and, more recently</LI>
<LI>topical skin adhesives, which can be used to cover an already closed wound - 'glue-as-a-dressing'.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Within these groups there are many hundreds of dressing types available. For ease of comparison in this review, dressings have been classified into groups according to the British National Formulary (BNF) (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2016</LINK>). However, it is important to note that the distributors of dressings may vary from country to country, and that dressing names may also vary. Below we summarise key dressing groups as well as noting wound exposure where no dressing is used to cover a wound.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Wound exposure</HEADING>
<P>In some cases wounds may be left uncovered following surgery. They may have no dressing at all applied or a simple pad placed on the closed wound to absorb leakage which is removed shortly after.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Basic wound contact dressings</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Absorbent dressings and surgical absorbents</HEADING>
<P>Absorbent dressings are applied directly to the wound. Surgical absorbents may be used as secondary absorbent layers in the management of heavily-exuding wounds. Examples include Primapore® (Smith &amp; Nephew), Mepore® (Mölnlycke), and absorbent cotton gauze, BP 1988.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Low-adherence dressings and wound contact materials</HEADING>
<P>Low adherence dressings and wound contact materials are usually cotton pads that are placed directly in contact with the wound. They are either non-medicated (e.g. paraffin gauze dressing), or medicated (e.g. containing povidone iodine or chlorhexidine). Examples include paraffin gauze dressing, BP 1993, Xeroform Dressing® - a non-adherent petrolatum blend with 3% bismuth tribromophenate on fine mesh gauze.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Advanced dressings</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Vapour-permeable films</HEADING>
<P>Vapour-permeable films are permeable to water vapour and oxygen, but not to water or micro-organisms. They are normally transparent. Examples include OpSite® (Smith &amp; Nephew) and Tegaderm® (3M).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Hydrocolloid dressings</HEADING>
<P>Hydrocolloid dressings are occlusive dressings composed of a hydrocolloid matrix attached to a base (possibly film or foam). Fluid absorbed from the wound causes the hydrocolloid to liquefy. Examples include Comfeel® (Coloplast) and DuoDerm® (ConvaTec, UK).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Fibrous hydrocolloid dressing (hydrofibre, spun hydrocolloid dressings)</HEADING>
<P>Fibrous hydrocolloid dressings are composed of sodium carboxymethylcellulose which forms a gel when it comes into contact with fluid. Examples include Aquacel® (ConvaTec, UK).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Polyurethane matrix hydrocolloid dressing</HEADING>
<P>Polyurethane matrix hydrocolloid dressings consist of two layers - a polyurethane gel matrix and a waterproof polyurethane top-film designed to act as a bacterial barrier. There is only one dressing of this type listed in the BNF: Cutinova® Hydro (Smith &amp; Nephew).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antimicrobial dressings</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Polyhexametylene biguanide (PHMB) dressing</HEADING>
<P>PHMB dressings are impregnated with the antimicrobial agent polyhexanide.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Topical skin adhesives (glue-as-dressing)</HEADING>
<P>Skin tissue adhesives are currently described in the BNF as being indicated for closure of minor skin wounds and for additional suture support. However, they can be used on an already closed wound as a dressing without an additional covering. They act as a barrier, are sterile before application and contain enbucrilate or octyl 2-cyanoacrylate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-12-15 12:58:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current practice for some surgical wounds healing by primary intention involves placement of a dressing over the closed wound before the patient leaves the clean environment of the operating theatre. This practice assumes that the risk of SSIs may be reduced by providing a barrier to environmental contamination. Furthermore, dressings may have additional roles in managing wound exudate, protecting wounds and their staples or sutures, and meeting patients' expectations by 'hiding' the wound, or, alternatively, when transparent dressings are used, facilitating health professionals' observation of the wound. Conversely, in other practices (e.g. paediatric surgery) it is usual not to use a dressing. This practice assumes that the risk of SSIs may be reduced by allowing the wound to dry. When wounds are covered by 'glue-as-a-dressing' it is also assumed that this acts as a barrier that may reduce external infection.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-12-07 08:55:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgical wounds healing by primary intention are commonplace within all elective and emergency surgical practice. It is important to assess whether wound dressings have a potential role in reducing the risk of SSI. Such information could inform allocation of resources to appropriate treatments. Currently these decisions are made with limited review data. In the UK, a government-funded guideline reviewed the data from five trials that are relevant to this review, and concluded that existing studies did not show convincing differences in dressing effectiveness in terms of reducing SSI (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). Whilst the review methods were robust, the search date was September 2007, and so studies published after this date were not assessed. Recent World Health Organisation guidelines have been published which assess one group of dressings, advanced dressings, compared with standard dressings (<LINK REF="REF-Allegranzi-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allegranzi 2016</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed each included study for risk of bias. Assessment was undertaken using the Cochrane `Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool considers six domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, freedom from selective reporting, and other issues (i.e. serious baseline imbalance). A `Risk of bias' table was completed for each eligible study; these data were combined into a `Risk of bias' summary figure where we have tabulated judgements for each domain by study.</P>

<P>We presented results with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-12-15 14:25:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>When we located three-armed trials where only two of the arms were relevant to the review, we did not extract data for the non-relevant arm. When three-armed studies had two arms randomised to receive different brands of the same dressing, we combined these into one group and treated the trial as a two-armed trial. We did not combine arms in three-armed trials when all the arms received different, relevant interventions, in those cases we included all relevant comparisons.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2016-12-15 14:26:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>We did not consider the issue of missing data in the protocol for this review. The problem of missing data is common in trials, especially those of poor quality. Excluding participants from the analysis after randomisation, or ignoring participants lost to follow-up can, in effect, undo the process of randomisation, and thus, potentially, introduce bias into the trial. For our primary outcome, SSI, we assumed that where randomised participants were not included in an analysis, they did not have an SSI (that is they were considered in the denominator but not the numerator). Given the relatively small number of SSI events anticipated, this seemed the most appropriate assumption. When a trial did not specify participant group numbers prior to drop out, we presented only complete case data. We present data for all secondary outcomes as complete case analysis.</P>
</MISSING_DATA>
<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-12-15 14:26:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>Our assessment of heterogeneity comprised an initial assessment of clinical and methodological heterogeneity and the appropriateness of combining study results: that is the degree to which the included studies varied in terms of participant, intervention, outcome and characteristics such as length of follow-up. We supplemented this assessment of clinical and methodological heterogeneity with information regarding statistical heterogeneity of the results - assessed using the Chi² test (we considered that a significance level of P &lt; 0.10 indicated statistically significant heterogeneity) in conjunction with the I² measure (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). I² examines the percentage of total variation across RCTs that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). In general I² values of 25%, or less, may mean a low level of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>), and values of 75%, or more, indicate very high heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>). We also examined the variability of the point estimates and the overlap of the confidence intervals, when I² values were less than 50%. Where there was evidence of high heterogeneity we explored this further: see <LINK TAG="DATA_SYNTHESIS" TYPE="SECTION">Data synthesis</LINK>.</P>
</HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT>
<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-12-07 09:15:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results. Publication bias, an across-study reporting bias, is one of a number of possible causes of 'small study effects', that is, a tendency for estimates of the intervention effect to appear to be more beneficial in smaller RCTs. Funnel plots allow a visual assessment of whether small study effects may be present in a meta-analysis. A funnel plot is a simple scatter plot of the effect estimates from individual RCTs against some measure of trial size or precision (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2011</LINK>). If we had meta-analyses that included 10 or more RCTs, we would have presented funnel plots using Cochrane Review Manager 5 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). However, we did not have sufficient studies for this.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-12-15 14:28:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>We combined details of included studies in a narrative review according to dressing type and stratified by surgical contamination level. We explored both clinical and statistical heterogeneity. Where appropriate, we pooled data using meta-analysis (conducted using RevMan 5), that is, where studies were considered similar in terms of intervention type, duration, and outcomes. We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the Chi² test (we considered that a significance level of P value less than 0.1 indicated heterogeneity), and the I² test (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). In the absence of clinical heterogeneity, and in the presence of statistical heterogeneity (I² over 50%), we used a random-effects model. Where there was no clinical or statistical heterogeneity, we applied a fixed-effect model.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">GRADE assessment and 'Summary of findings' tables</HEADING>
<P>We presented the main results of the review in 'Summary of findings&#8217; tables for the following comparisons:</P>
<UL>
<LI>basic wound contact dressings compared with exposed wounds;</LI>
<LI>specific advanced dressings compared with exposed wounds;</LI>
<LI>basic wound dressings compared with specific advanced dressings e.g. film, hydrocolloid;</LI>
<LI>basic wound contact dressings compared with antimicrobial dressings.</LI>
</UL>
<P>These tables present key information concerning the certainty of the evidence, the magnitude of the effects of the interventions examined, and the sum of available data for the main outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011a</LINK>). The 'Summary of findings&#8217; tables also include an overall grading of the evidence related to each of the main outcomes using the GRADE approach. This defines the certainty of a body of evidence as the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association is close to the true quantity of specific interest. The certainty of a body of evidence involves consideration of within-trial risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimates and risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011b</LINK>). We present the following outcomes in the 'Summary of findings&#8217; tables:</P>
<UL>
<LI>SSI;</LI>
<LI>scarring;</LI>
<LI>acceptability of dressing to patient;</LI>
<LI>ease of dressing removal.</LI>
</UL>
<P>For relevant outcomes reported for comparisons not listed above we have presented GRADE assessments without a 'Summary of findings' table.</P>
<P>In terms of the GRADE assessment, when making decisions for the risk of bias domain we downgraded only when we had classed studies as being at high risk of bias for one or more domains and/or they were classed as being at unclear risk of bias for both domains that contribute to selection bias. In assessing the precision of effect estimates for SSI we followed GRADE guidance (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2013</LINK>), and calculated an optimal information size (OIS) using conventional sample size calculation methods. We used the OIS, along with the size of 95% CIs - in terms of whether they spanned estimates of benefit and harm - to assess for downgrading. We calculated the OIS based on GRADE guidance of using a relative risk reduction of between 20% and 30%. The OIS is summarised below <B>but should not be treated as optimal sample sizes for any future research. </B>Within a GRADE assessment the OIS is used to assess the stability of CIs rather than to assess the appropriateness of a sample size to detect a difference.</P>
<P>Our calculation was: reduction in SSI from 14% to 10% (80% power; alpha 5%) = 2070 participants.</P>
<P>We also followed GRADE guidance and downgraded twice for imprecision when there were very few events and CIs around effects included both appreciable benefit and appreciate harm.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-15 15:18:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>The primary aim of this systematic review was to present and appraise all existing evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of various surgical dressings, including not using a dressing, and using glue as a dressing, on the risk of developing surgical site infections (SSIs) in surgical wounds that are healing by primary intention. We found insufficient evidence that covering surgical wounds with any dressing compared with leaving them exposed influences the subsequent risk of SSI. Similarly there was insufficient evidence on which to base solid conclusions regarding whether any single type of dressing reduces risk of SSIs in wounds resulting from surgery. GRADE assessments of the evidence resulted predominantly in judgements of very low certainty. The studies included in the analyses were small and had low numbers of events. This means that the available evidence had low statistical power and that for most comparisons we could not exclude the possibility that there might be differences in effectiveness; currently, there is not enough information of a high enough certainty to be sure. Some studies were at a high risk of bias and were lacking important details in reports about trial populations or how outcomes were defined and when outcome data were collected.</P>
<P>We included a range of contamination levels for the many trials that investigated 'non clean' surgery, and it was not possible to draw conclusions for each.</P>
<P>For secondary outcomes, there is again uncertainty due to the certainty of the evidence being low or very low. The results of <LINK REF="STD-Moshakis-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Moshakis 1984</LINK> suggested that film dressings might be less painful for patients than other basic wound contact dressings. However, we judged this trial to be at high risk of bias due to inadequate allocation concealment, and the absence of evidence that appropriate statistical procedures had been employed to accommodate the inclusion of some participants as their own controls (bilateral excisions). <LINK REF="STD-Wikblad-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wikblad 1995</LINK> reported that basic wound contact dressings were significantly less painful on removal than hydrocolloid dressings. However, a large amount of data were missing from this analysis, and we deemed it, too, to be at a high risk of bias. A number of trials suggested that advanced dressings were more expensive than basic wound contact dressings. However, all cost evaluations were very limited, and did not capture all relevant resource-use data, or consider the costs versus the benefits of treatments - which is best practice in economic evaluation. In short the economic data included in these studies did not lend themselves to decision making.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-12-06 20:52:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are many different dressing options to use postoperatively on surgical wounds. We identified 29 studies to include in this review, these assessed several dressing types, as well as leaving wounds exposed. There are no studies that evaluated glue-as-dressing. The included studies reported limited outcome data, even for the primary outcome of SSI. Where SSI was reported, the process used to define infection was often not reported, nor was it clear over what follow-up period data collection took place. Outcomes for other important patient outcomes such as scarring were also poorly reported, with a range of measures used for assessment, which were sometimes unclear. Frequently, studies were very small in terms of number of participants and outcome events, which meant most included studies were very underpowered. Paradoxically the small, underpowered nature of studies means, that as well as being at risk of type 2 errors (that is missing important differences), they are at increased risk of type I errors as statistically significant findings are more likely to be spurious (<LINK REF="REF-Button-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Button 2010</LINK>). Overall, the limited methodological reporting, the small sample sizes and the limited quality of outcome data collection, results in an insufficient volume of potentially biased evidence, which may be selectively reported.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-12-15 15:20:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>In general, the quality of the studies was very low and difficult to assess due to the lack of methodological detail reported. The majority of the included studies were more than 10 years old and did not follow current trial conduct and reporting guidelines, i.e. CONSORT (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>). Key areas of good practice include the robust generation of a randomisation sequence (e.g. by a computer-generated randomisation schedule); robust allocation concealment (e.g. through the use of a telephone randomisation service); and blinded outcome assessment where this is possible. Blinded outcome assessment is also crucial for assessment of outcomes such as SSI where there may be a subjective element in decision making, as non-blinded assessment can introduce detection/observer bias (<LINK REF="REF-Hr_x00f3_bjartsson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hróbjartsson 2012</LINK>), however, blinded assessment was not implemented in six studies, and not clearly reported in 20 more.</P>
<P>Key methodological information should be included in the trial report. In terms of analysis, data from all participants should be included in the analysis whenever possible, i.e. an intention-to-treat analysis should be conducted. Steps should be taken during a trial to minimise missing data as far as possible. Where missing data were an issue, imputation methods should be considered and clearly reported when implemented. When studies plan to evaluate more than one wound per person, or use participants as their own controls, or both, they should consult a statistician regarding both the trial design, sample size issues and the more advanced type of analysis that is required and, where possible, robust economic data should be collected. A number of trials included multiple surgical procedures with different levels of potential contamination; since they did not report data for each type separately, this limited the value of the data for analysis.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-12-06 20:52:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted a comprehensive search that included trial registries, and obtained translations as required, so we do not believe that language bias is an issue. We were not able to explore publication bias using the studies we had, so the potential for bias for that is unknown. We did not deviate from the prepublished protocol, so do not believe bias has been introduced in terms of selective outcome reporting on our part.</P>
<P>It is noteworthy that we found four studies reported on a trial register (one of these trials was reported on two registers) which we are unable to link to published data. We contacted trial contacts to try to obtain any data we did not have. Where unpublished data exist and are not included in a review, there is an increase in the risk of publication bias.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-12-15 12:59:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We are not aware of any other published systematic reviews of dressings for surgical wounds that are healing by primary intention. Another review, however, regarding the use of wound dressings on surgical wounds was conducted as part of the development of a set of UK clinical guidelines addressing the prevention and treatment of SSIs (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). This review generally reached similar conclusions to this systematic review. We would like to note, however, that the conclusions of this Cochrane Review are based on additional trials that were not included in the NICE review.</P>
<P>Our review does differ from the NICE review with regard to our use of healing data from <LINK REF="STD-Wikblad-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wikblad 1995</LINK>. We did not utilise the limited infection data that were provided solely in the text of this three-arm trial (which reported that 11 participants were treated with antibiotics postoperatively; eight had infections in the sternum: five were from the basic wound contact dressing group, but group(s) for the remaining three participants were not specified). The NICE review merged two of the three trial arms (a hydrocolloid-dressed arm and a film-dressed arm), and, as we cannot replicate their analysis, its authors may have obtained additional data (they reported six SSIs in the basic wound contact group and two in the merged hydrocolloid/film group). With regard to this trial, the NICE review concluded that: "there is limited evidence to suggest that there is a difference favouring the use of hydrocolloids or 'hydroactive' (film) dressings against the use of absorbent dressings in the prevention of SSI". Our review does not agree with this finding; however, the overall conclusions of the NICE review regarding wound dressings were limited to: "Cover surgical incisions with an appropriate interactive dressing at the end of the operation". The NICE report also conducted its own costing exercise, given that there were no data from the studies that could be used. They concluded that it is important to take into account the additional costs of changing dressings, as well as the initial price of each dressing type, when choosing dressings to use (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The recent World Health Organisation guideline is supported by a systematic review containing 19 trials - all included here. The review had a narrower remit comparing advanced dressings with standard dressings. The review reports advanced dressings as: Hydrocolloid; Silver-impregnated Hydroactive and PHMB. The review also reports very low quality evidence for each of these comparisons (<LINK REF="REF-Allegranzi-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allegranzi 2016</LINK>). The guideline recommendation, suggests not using advanced dressings in preference to standard dressings on primarily closed surgical wounds for the purpose of preventing SSI and rates the evidence as low quality.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-12-06 20:55:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether covering surgical wounds that are healing by primary intention with wound dressings reduces the risk of surgical site infections (SSIs), or whether any particular type of wound dressing reduces the risk of infections more than another. Our review also failed to demonstrate any clear advantage of one dressing type over another (or wound exposure) for improved scarring, pain control, patient acceptability or ease of removal. It is important to note that many trials in this review were small and of poor quality, and at high or unclear risk of bias. Given the current evidence, decision makers may wish to make wound dressing choices on costs and clinician and patient preference. Additional steps to prevent SSIs can be based on other existing evidence and guidelines, for example the use of hand decontamination and antibiotic prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-06 20:47:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a lack of high quality research evidence regarding whether choice of wound dressing (or indeed use of wound dressings at all) affects the risk of SSIs in people whose surgical wounds are healing by primary intention. Whilst uncertainty remains regarding the best approach to dressing these surgical wounds, any investment in future research must maximise its value to decision-makers. Given both the large number of dressing options and surgical procedures, the design of future trials should focus on those surgical procedures at highest risk of SSI, as well as evaluating the dressings or approaches that health professionals use most widely. In addition, as SSIs can be relatively rare events, very large trials are needed in terms of participant numbers. Such epidemiological information is vital to inform dressing trials and will become available through robust, routine data collection. Additionally, there may be value in asking decision-makers (including patients) what they feel are the most pressing issues, e.g. type of dressing, or duration that a dressing remains in situ, as well as which outcomes are most important, including the ability of different dressings to manage specific symptoms such as absorption of exudate. Such planning means that research resources can be focused to address priorities. Where trials are conducted, good practice guidelines must be followed in their design, implementation and reporting.</P>

<P>All discharged patients were routinely given a 2-week appointment to see their surgeon, who was blinded to the trial, for a wound assessment. On the 30th postoperative day, the ward staff nurses,who were also blinded to the trial, were given a CDC criteria checklist and phoned the patients to assess for SSI. Patients who were unable to describe their surgical site condition over the phone were asked to return to the clinic to have their surgical sites assessed by an advanced nurse practitioner, who was also blinded to the trial."</P>

<SUP>5</SUP>This was a split-site study with half of a wound treated with one dressing and half with the other. The authors assessed scar colour, texture and colour on a 3-point scale; the lack of independence seems to have been considered by authors, but they only present P values (favouring the hydrocolloid dressing). We have not reproduced the analysis, so given the lack of precision data and the small number of wounds in the study, have downgraded twice for imprecision.</P>
<P>
<SUP>6 </SUP>Whilst the study resulted in precise estimates, data are available from just one study with a relatively small number of participants. Further data from more participants would add to certainty. Downgraded once for imprecision. Scarring can also be assessed in a number of ways with width being just one measure, use of a validated tool would be a more useful for decision making. Downgraded once for indirectness.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process provided to permit a judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: use of an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes without appropriate safeguards (e.g. envelopes were unsealed, non-opaque, or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information provided to permit a judgement of low or high risk of bias. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described, or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement, for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>

<LI>No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Reason for missing outcome data are likely to be related to the true outcome, with either an imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with the observed event risk is enough to induce clinically relevant bias in the intervention effect estimate.</LI>

<P>Any one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Not all of the study&#8217;s prespecified primary outcomes have been reported.</LI>
<LI>One or more primary outcomes is/are reported using measurements, analysis methods, or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not prespecified.</LI>
