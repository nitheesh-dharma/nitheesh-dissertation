<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Stents are placed in arteries around the heart (coronary arteries) to keep formerly blocked arteries open. A blood clot (thrombus) may form in the coronary artery after stenting and cause acute myocardial infarction (fatal or non-fatal) or more surgery. Blood thinners must be given for a short time to prevent clotting. Ticlopidine plus aspirin reduce the risk of complications after coronary stenting with less bleeding when compared to standard treatment (oral anticoagulants). Ticlopidine plus aspirin have other side effects such as bone marrow toxicity. Strict monitoring of blood-cell counts is recommended during treatment.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing ticlopidine plus aspirin versus oral anticoagulants (either with or without aspirin) after elective or bail out coronary stenting.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Three reviewers assessed trial quality and compiled data on outcomes including: total mortality, non fatal myocardial infarction and revascularization occurring within the first 30 days after hospitalization, stent thrombosis on angiography, major and minor bleeding, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-29 16:26:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four trials (n = 2436 patients) were included. Ticlopidine plus aspirin compared to oral anticoagulants significantly reduced the risk of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction and revascularization at 30 days, combined negative events (mortality, myocardial infarction, revascularization at 30 days) (RR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.69; NNT for 30 days: 22; 95% CI: 14 to 45), and major bleeding (RR in high quality studies: 0.24 ; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.79). Ticlopidine plus aspirin compared to oral anticoagulants significantly increased the risk of eutropenia,thrombocytopenia and neutropenia (RR 5; 95% CI: 1.08 to 13.07; NNT for 30 days: 142; 95% CI: 76 to 1000). Ticlopidine plus aspirin versus oral anticoagulation did not affect all cause mortality. Ticlopidine plus aspirin significantly reduced the risk of stent thrombosis (angiography) which was seen only on studies with blinded outcome assessment (RR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.60; NNT for 30 days: 33; 95% CI:16 to 166). Minor bleeding was reported only in one study and no studies recorded thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Ticlopidine plus aspirin after coronary stenting is effective in reducing the risk of the revascularization, non fatal myocardial infarction and bleeding complications when compared with oral anticoagulants. No effect is observed on total mortality. However, the haematological side effects of ticlopidine are still a matter of concern, and strict monitoring of blood-cell counts is recommended. Physicians should also be aware of the possibility of rare although potentially life-threatening complications such as TTP</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-29 16:33:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Coronary stenting has been proven highly effective in treating acute or subacute vessel closure after balloon angioplasty (<LINK REF="REF-Sigwart--1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sigwart 1987</LINK>) and in preventing restenosis in de novo lesions and vein grafts (<LINK REF="REF-Fischman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Serruys-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serruys 1994</LINK>). Its clinical use was initially limited by two major drawbacks: the risk of stent thrombosis and the complications associated with an aggressive anticoagulation treatment. The inherent thrombogenicity of the metallic stent was in fact initially considered crucial in the development of stent thrombosis (and subsequent vessel closure), warranting aggressive antiplatelet/antithrombotic treatment with aspirin, dipyridamole, dextran, heparin and warfarin. This regimen, however, did not completely prevent stent thrombosis (and associated clinical sequelae such as myocardial infarction, need for emergency percutaneous or surgical revascularization or death) (<LINK REF="REF-Fischman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Serruys-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serruys 1994</LINK>). Moreover this regimen was shown to be accompanied by bleeding and/or vascular complications which can seriously limit the benefits of coronary stenting. </P>
<P>More recently, anticoagulants were substituted by a pure antiplatelet treatment with ticlopidine for four weeks and aspirin indefinitely (<LINK REF="REF-Colombo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colombo 1995</LINK>). This regimen, now representing the gold standard after coronary stenting, is considered to be effective in reducing both the thrombotic occlusion of the stented vessel (and the associated clinical events) and the hemorrhagic and peripheral vascular complications (<LINK REF="REF-Leon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leon 1998</LINK>). It is estimated that more than 1 million patients worldwide had a percutaneous coronary intervention in 1998 with 50-60% of the cases involving a coronary stent (<LINK REF="REF-Steinhubl-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinhubl 1999</LINK>). It is estimated that the percentage of patients receiving stent implantation after angioplasty is now almost 80-90% (<LINK REF="REF-GISE-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">GISE 2000</LINK>). Currently, nearly all patients undergoing coronary stenting receive 2 to 4 weeks of ticlopidine plus aspirin after the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Steinhubl-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinhubl 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Recently, several case-reports and case-series have suggested that ticlopidine plus aspirin treatment after coronary stenting could be associated with an increased incidence of a potentially fatal complication, that is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinhubl-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinhubl 1999</LINK>). Before these reports, TTP due to ticlopidine treatment was considered a very rare adverse event. Case-reports and case-series can alert clinicians to potentially severe adverse drug reactions, but they cannot firmly establish the causal relationship between ticlopidine plus aspirin and TTP. Randomised clinical trials cannot evaluate the incidence of rare adverse events because their sample size is too small and calculated on the basis of the expected frequency of the primary outcomes. A sample size of several thousand patients would be necessary to evaluate the incidence of rare adverse events. Post-marketing surveillance systems might partly address this issue. </P>
<P>The purpose of this review is to evaluate the evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of the use of ticlopidine plus aspirin after coronary stenting.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of ticlopidine and aspirin vs. anticoagulants (either with or without aspirin ) in the prevention of unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, mortality, necessity of re intervention or coronary bypass grafting within 30 days after elective or bail-out coronary stenting. </P>
<P>We wish to test the following a priori hypothesis:<BR/>a) main comparison: the association of ticlopidine and aspirin is as efficacious as anticoagulants in the prevention of unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, mortality, necessity of re intervention or coronary bypass grafting within 30 days after elective or emergency coronary stenting.</P>

<P>Criteria for considering studies for this review:<BR/>a) randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that is those trials with a randomised generation of allocation sequences such as the use of random number tables or computer random number generator .<BR/>b) quasi-randomised controlled trials that is those trials with quasi randomised generation of allocation according to date of birth or case record number (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Priority was given to double blind trials in which patients, care providers and outcome assessors were unaware of treatment allocation. Thus bias due to patient suggestion should be minimized (<LINK REF="REF-Waller-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waller 1989</LINK>). If double blind studies were not available, priority was given to studies with blinded outcome assessment. For the principal analysis, a trial was regarded as double blind if the word " double blind" is used to describe the trial or if it was stated that outcome assessors, care providers and patients were blinded to treatment allocation (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>).

<P>Two reviewers (CC, MM) selected potentially eligible articles for inclusion in the review. A study was considered potentially eligible if it was a prospective trial with at least two concurrent comparison groups, in which patients undergoing coronary stenting were allocated to a regimen with anticoagulant drugs (as defined above) or ticlopidine plus aspirin. Exclusion criteria were the following: studies with retrospective design, prospective non randomised studies. In order to assure clinical relevance of article selection, an expert of the content area (AR) independently determined eligibility as well.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of internal validity of trials</HEADING>
<P>Internal validity reflects the degree to which the results of the trial are free of random error (due to chance) and systematic error (bias) (<LINK REF="REF-Fletcher-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fletcher 1988</LINK>).<BR/>The methodological quality of each trial was assessed independently by each reviewer using the following scales as suggested by the Cochrane Collaborative Review Group.<BR/>1) A validated scale developed by (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) (which includes appropriateness of randomization and double blinding, a description of drop-outs and withdrawals). The Jadad scale includes three items with a maximum score of five points (two point each for randomization and double blinding, one point for withdrawals and drop-outs), however, it assesses neither concealment of allocation nor proportion and handling of drop-outs and withdrawals. Three or more points are required for a trial to be judged as high quality (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>2) Items identified by Schulz et al (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) (allocation concealment and double-blinding). Quality score was assessed according to the criteria suggested by the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>). Each trial was given an allocation score of A (clearly concealed), B (unclear if concealed) or C (clearly not concealed) and a summary score of A (low risk of bias), B (moderate risk of bias) or C (high risk of bias). Trials scoring A were included and those scoring C were excluded in sensitivity analysis. For trials scoring B, an attempt was made to obtain more information by contacting the author. If no or insufficient information was provided on a given component, no credit was given until further information can be obtained from primary authors. Assessment was done independently by three reviewers (CC, MM, AR). with the fourth reviewer (BC) independently cross-checking and solving disagreement.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analyses</HEADING>
<P>Our measure of effect for each study was the relative risk (RR). Approximate chi-square tests for heterogeneity were used to assess outcome data for compatibility with the assumption of a uniform relative risk (p &gt;0.10). A random effects model was used to combine outcomes across studies. The weighting factor for each study is the inverse of the within study variance plus a between study variance component. Thus all pooled estimates are DerSimonian-Laird type random effect estimators. Pooled risk differences obtained from Der Simonian Laird (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) random effect model are converted to numbers needed to treat with the formula NNT=1/risk difference. NNT are the number of patients who must be treated to prevent one adverse outcome. The 95% confidence interval for NNT were computed as a simple inverse of the upper and lower values of the 95% confidence interval for risk difference.</P>
<P>To test for robustness of results, several sensitivity analyses were performed.<BR/>This included:<BR/>(i) analysing by both fixed effect and random effect models (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>);<BR/>(ii) including only high quality trials as defined for the two quality assessment scales by Schulz et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) and Jadad et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>); trials with a Jadad score equal or greater than 3 were analysed separately from trials with a Jadad score lower than 3;<BR/>(iii) including only RCTs with clearly adequate random generation of allocation sequences, adequate concealment of treatment allocation schedule, and adequate double-blinding and adequate follow-up, assessed as described above; trials without an adequate allocation concealment were analysed separately ;<BR/>(iv) exclusion of unpublished trials, and trials published only in abstract form;<BR/>(vi) we used a random effects regression model to examine sources of heterogeneity with respect of major bleeding. Different intensities of oral anticoagulation may account for the heterogeneity of bleeding outcomes among studies.</P>
<P>All of the analyses were based on the intention-to-treat data from the individual clinical trials. Treatment effects were defined as the proportion of patients experiencing the main and secondary outcomes in the ticlopidine and aspirin group when compared with the proportion of patients experiencing the same outcomes in the anticoagulation group. Analyses were also conducted in defined sub-group of patients : a) those undergoing elective stenting and b) those undergoing bail-out stenting. To examine the effect of binary outcomes, such as mortality, odds ratios were computed using a random effects model. Funnel plots were examined (<LINK REF="REF-Light-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Light 1984</LINK>), possible asymmetry of the plots assessed adopting a regression approach by Egger et al (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). Although of limited power, a chi-square-test was used to assess heterogeneity of trials (<LINK REF="REF-Hedges-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hedges 1985</LINK>) with the significance level set at p = 0.1.</P>
<P>We choose the internal validity score as an independent variable because there is evidence that lower internal validity is associated with an overestimation of treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Sample size is considered because of its relation to publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Berlin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlin 1989</LINK>) and other reasons for asymmetrical funnel plots (<LINK REF="REF-Gotzsche-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotzsche 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).<BR/>Furthermore, the contribution of each trial to the overall statistics for heterogeneity was computed (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1993</LINK>). Trials contributing most were further examined for possible sources of heterogeneity. Pre discussion agreement between reviewers regarding identification of potentially eligible trials, and definitive article selection was determined using the kappa coefficient (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1960</LINK>). Pre discussion agreement regarding internal validity assessments was determined using the intra class correlation coefficient (<LINK REF="REF-Shrout-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shrout 1979</LINK>). Values above 0.60 were regarded as substantial (<LINK REF="REF-Landis-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landis 1977</LINK>).</P>

<P>Eight randomised controlled trials were identified as eligible. The kappa coefficients regarding identification of potentially eligible trials and definite article selection were 0.42 and 0.28, respectively. </P>
<P>Four studies were excluded from the analysis for the following reasons; one study compared ticlopidine plus ASA plus enoxaparin versus anticoagulation (<LINK REF="STD-ENTICES" TYPE="STUDY">ENTICES</LINK>); one study was a double report of the Entices trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zidar-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zidar 1998</LINK>); one study was excluded because it reported a sub-group analysis of a previous trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schulen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schulen 1997</LINK>); one study was excluded because it considered the 6-month follow-up of a previous trial with the end-point of vessel restenosis (<LINK REF="STD-ISAR-II" TYPE="STUDY">ISAR II</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>None of the trials employed double blinding, however blinded outcome assessment of all end-points was employed in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-MATTIS" TYPE="STUDY">MATTIS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STARS" TYPE="STUDY">STARS</LINK>) , while in one study (<LINK REF="STD-ISAR" TYPE="STUDY">ISAR</LINK>) only angiographic analyses and surveillance of the access site for bleeding were evaluated by blinded outcome assessors. Thus all trials were scored B on a Schulz scale, while on a Jadad score three studies scored 3 and 1 scored 2 (<LINK REF="STD-STARS" TYPE="STUDY">STARS</LINK>). An attempt to contact the primary author of the latter study was unsuccessful. The kappa coefficient for methodological quality of the studies was 0.90.

We observed homogeneity across studies with respect to all outcomes except for stent thrombosis on angiography and major bleeding. No difference in relative risk was observed when calculated according to a fixed or a random effect model except for stent thrombosis on angiography, major bleeding and bleeding from the vascular access site. The funnel plots showed that studies of different size seemed equally scattered around the pooled estimate. The existence of a relevant publication/retrieval bias, however, cannot be excluded due to the low number of trials evaluated.</P>

The combined results of the four trials indicated a RR of 0.36 (95% CI: 0.14 to 1.02) with a significant heterogeneity between studies (p = 0.01). This was due to the STARS trial in which the rate of bleeding events was the same in ticlopidine plus aspirin and anticoagulation groups (<LINK REF="STD-STARS" TYPE="STUDY">STARS</LINK>). When only studies with blinded outcome assessment were considered (<LINK REF="STD-MATTIS" TYPE="STUDY">MATTIS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STARS" TYPE="STUDY">STARS</LINK>) the RR was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.15 to 1.05; 30 days NNT = 37; 95% CI: 14 to 55), with significant heterogeneity between studies. When only studies with a Jadad score &gt; 3 were considered and thus the STARS trial was excluded from the analysis, the RR was 0.24 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.79; 30 days NNT = 18; 95% CI:13 to 30) in favour of ticlopidine plus aspirin with no significant heterogeneity between studies. The intensity of anticoagulation (high INR range-3.5-4.5- ISAR and low INR range -2.0-3.0- in FANTASTIC and STARS) did not explain the heterogeneity among studies (<LINK REF="STD-ISAR" TYPE="STUDY">ISAR</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FANTASTIC" TYPE="STUDY">FANTASTIC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STARS" TYPE="STUDY">STARS</LINK>).</P>

When all studies were analysed for this outcome, the RR was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.19 to 0.88; 30 days NNT = 16; 95% CI:8 to 250) in favour of ticlopidine plus aspirin with a significant heterogeneity between studies (p = 0.03). This heterogeneity might be due to the different intensity of peri-procedural anticoagulation, which however was difficult to quantify because of the different regimens adopted in the studies. In particular, the STARS trial reported an equal number of complications in the anticoagulation and ticlopidine plus aspirin group (<LINK REF="STD-STARS" TYPE="STUDY">STARS</LINK>).

<P>Studies included patients with different degrees of disease severity, different stenting procedures and also different peri-procedural treatment. No benefit was observed on the outcome of total mortality, while a significant benefit was observed on non-fatal acute myocardial infarction and revascularization at 30 days. When the total composite outcome of total mortality, non fatal acute myocardial infarction and revascularization at 30 days was considered, a significant benefit of ticlopidine plus aspirin was observed when compared to oral anticoagulants in all the analyses performed. ISAR and STARS included only patients with successful stent implantation whereas FANTASTIC and MATTIS have also included "bail out" procedures i.e. higher risk patients. These two studies are closer to the common practice which may explain the different rates of major cardiac events (<LINK REF="STD-ISAR" TYPE="STUDY">ISAR</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STARS" TYPE="STUDY">STARS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FANTASTIC" TYPE="STUDY">FANTASTIC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MATTIS" TYPE="STUDY">MATTIS</LINK>).</P>
<P>When stent thrombosis on angiography was considered no significant effect of ticlopidine plus aspirin was observed, except when only studies with blinded outcome assessment were considered. In this case no heterogeneity among studies was observed and the RR was 0.14 (95% CI:0.03 to 0.60) in favour of ticlopidine plus aspirin. Only one study evaluated acute stent thrombosis (&lt; 24 hour) separately from subacute stent thrombosis (&gt; 24 hours). The intensity of oral anticoagulation did not seem to influence the rate of stent thrombosis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Safety </HEADING>
<P>When adverse events were considered, a significant increase in the risk of major bleeding was observed in the group treated with anticoagulants only in high quality studies. These data should be interpreted with caution because the criteria for classification of the severity of bleeding were heterogeneous between studies. The intensity of oral anticoagulant treatment was different among studies, with three studies employing a low INR range and one study employing a high INR range. The intensity of anticoagulation did not influence the risk of bleeding.</P>
<P>A significant effect of ticlopidine plus aspirin in reducing the risk of complications at the vascular access site was observed in high quality studies.<BR/>Minor bleeding was reported only in one study and a non significant difference was observed between ticlopidine plus aspirin and anticoagulation. When haematological side effects were considered, the events were rare, however ticlopidine plus aspirin increased significantly the risk of these complications when compared to anticoagulation. The assessment criteria and schedule for haematological side-effects were not consistently defined in all studies. As a result some cases may have been missed especially after hospital discharge.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>Data could not be analyzed separately for subgroups of patients, as planned, such as patients receiving different types of stents or those undergoing elective versus bailout stenting. The exception was the FANTASTIC trial in which a subgroup analysis indicated that ticlopidine plus aspirin was significantly effective in reducing the risk of the total primary outcome in patients undergoing elective stenting when compared to oral anticoagulation and no effect was reported on those patients undergoing unplanned stenting (<LINK REF="STD-FANTASTIC" TYPE="STUDY">FANTASTIC</LINK>). Caution must be exercised in the interpretation of these data due to the lack of blinded outcome assessment in this trial.</P>

Among these studies, only one (<LINK REF="REF-Steinhubl-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinhubl 1999</LINK>) reported 9 cases of TTP after the retrospective evaluation of 43322 patients who were treated with ticlopidine plus aspirin after coronary stenting in the USA. The incidence of TTP resulted to be 0.02% (95% CI: 0.04% to 0.009%). The schedule and criteria for assessment of haematological side-effects were widely heterogeneous among these studies. Case reports or case-series were found for a total of 79 cases of TTP (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jamar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jamar 1998</LINK>). The Uppsala WHO Monitoring centre did not report any cases of TTP related to ticlopidine plus aspirin after coronary stenting.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The benefits of ticlopidine plus aspirin when compared with oral anticoagulants after coronary stenting are significant on the composite outcome of total mortality, revascularization and non fatal myocardial reinfarction, due to the effect on the reduction of the two latter outcomes. The association of ticlopidine plus aspirin has replaced oral anticoagulants and it is now the standard treatment after coronary stenting in many countries. The haemorrhagic events are significantly reduced by ticlopidine plus aspirin when compared to oral anticoagulants. The haematological side effects of ticlopidine are still a matter of concern, and strict monitoring of blood-cell counts is recommended . </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Ticlopidine is an effective antithrombotic drug, however, the risk of potentially serious adverse events has prompted the development of potentially safer alternatives. This field is rapidly evolving and most likely additional studies using ticlopidine and its analogues will be reported in the future. This may include studies with clopidogrel, a thienopirydine analogue of ticlopidine which has been tested in a large phase III RCTs trial in the prevention of cardiovascular events in high risk patients (<LINK REF="REF-CAPRIE-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAPRIE 1996</LINK>). It has also been evaluated in RCTs in association with aspirin after coronary stenting. Although the RCTs indicated a lower incidence of haematological toxicity of clopidogrel when compared to ticlopidine, recently, a case series of 11 patients with TTP after clopidogrel has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2000</LINK>). Our preliminary data also indicate that a greater effort should be made to monitor the drug related adverse events in the post-marketing surveillance systems. </P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>In this meta-analysis of noninferiority RCTs, the control group, ASA plus a vitamin K inhibitor, has never been shown to improve clinical outcomes for people with coronary stenting. Therefore, this meta-analysis cannot determine the effectiveness and safety of the use of ticlopidine plus aspirin after coronary stenting. </P>
<P>ASA plus warfarin may well do clinical harm due to rebound hypercoagulability [1-4] bleeding (3% rate of major hemorrhage the first month falling to 0.3% per month after the first year) [5] and hypercoagulability associated with initiation of vitamin K inhibition of vitamin K inhibition. A study from Italian anticoagulation clinics showed that, in 2111 patient-years on vitamin K inhibitors, 34/70 thromboses occurred within the first 90 days of treatment (OR of &lt; or =90 days versus &gt;90 = 20.6, CI 12.7-33.5; p &lt;0.0001). These investigators found that the risk of thrombotic events when the INR is less than 1.5 is 7.6 times the risk when the INR is 2.0-2.99 in patients taking warfarin for various indications. [6] </P>
<P>The most relevant comparison would be between ASA and ASA plus ticlopidine. In this regard, Hall and colleagues published an informative RCT of ASA alone versus ASA + ticlopidine after stent placement, concluding, "At 1 month, there was no difference in the incidence of stent thrombosis or other clinical end points between the two poststent antiplatelet regimens." [7] Without evidence of efficacy of combination antiplatelet therapy over ASA alone, the 2-2.5% incidence of idiopathic bone marrow suppression and 0.8% incidence of severe neutropenia requiring prolonged hospitalization and antibiotics [7,8] make ticlopidine an unlikely candidate as part of the standard of care. </P>
<P>Since the safety of ticlopidine, regarding bone marrow suppression, is a major consideration in the overall risk/benefit ratio of ASA plus ticlopidine, large retrospective or prospective observational studies should have been included.</P>
<P>This Cochrane review references a 1998 RCT by Leon and colleagues justifying combination ASA plus ticlopidine thromboprophylaxis: "This regimen, now representing the gold standard after coronary stenting, is considered to be effective in reducing both the thrombotic occlusion of the stented vessel (and the associated clinical events) and the hemorrhagic and peripheral vascular complications." [9 ] The Leon trial comparing ASA alone, ASA plus ticlopidine and ASA plus warfarin had a peculiar arrangement of endpoints. Data relating to the primary endpoint, a composite of (1) death, (2) revascularization of the target lesion, (3) angiographically evident thrombosis, and (4) myocardial infarction within 30 days favored ASA plus ticlopidine (ASA alone =20/557 versus ASA plus ticlopidine =3/546, P &lt; 0.001). The secondary endpoints were (1) procedure related myocardial infarction, (2) hemorrhagic complications, (3) vascular surgical complications, (4) neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, and (5) cerebrovascular accident. ASA plus ticlopidine caused more hemorrhagic complications (P &lt; 0.001) and vascular surgical complications (P &lt; 0.02) compared with the ASA alone. Indeed, when all primary and secondary clinical events combined are compared, ASA alone has a borderline statistical advantage (ASA alone 51/557 versus ASA plus ticlopidine 70/546, RR 0.69, 0.47 - 1.00). Leon and colleagues biased the interpretation of this RCT to favor ticlopidine plus ASA. </P>
<P>Consequently, the conclusion of this Cochrane review, "Ticlopidine plus aspirin after coronary stenting is effective in reducing the risk of the revascularization, non fatal myocardial infarction and bleeding complications when compared with oral anticoagulants" is not justified.</P>
<P>The review should be updated to reflect the late thrombosis risks of drug eluting stents [10] and that electively done percutaneous coronary interventions (angioplasties with or without stents) are evidence based not to improve clinical outcomes. [11] In this regard, it is notable that all deaths in the ASA plus ticlopidine group of this review (6/1223) were procedure complication related. </P>

</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>The aim of the review was to compare ASA plus ticlopidine versus ASA plus vitamin K antagonists after coronary stenting and not the efficacy and safety of ASA plus ticlopidine per se. The review included trials performed mostly in the 1990s with bare metal stents and mostly after elective stents. Dual antiplatelet treatment seemed at least as effective as ASA plus vitamin K antagonists. Since then dual antiplatelet treatment with ASA plus ticlopidine or clopidogrel has become the standard treatment after coronary stenting. The comparison of ASA alone versus dual antiplatelet agents would entail an entirely different and new meta-analysis. </P>
<P>The meta-analysis of ASA plus ticlopidine versus ASA plus vitamin K antagonists should probably be considered historical as nowadays the relevant comparison would be the effectiveness and safety of ASA plus ticlopidine versus ASA plus clopidogrel after coronary stenting and thus, again, an entirely different question. Moreover nowadays drug-eluting stents should be considered as well primary angioplasty with stenting and therefore a different and new meta-analysis would be required. The original authorship team is no longer active and consequently not currently in a position to plan new meta-analyses.</P>
