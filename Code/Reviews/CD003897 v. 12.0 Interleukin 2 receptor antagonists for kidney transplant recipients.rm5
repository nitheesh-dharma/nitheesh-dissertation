<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-12 11:44:29 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Acute rejection is a major problem in the early period following kidney transplantation. Immunosuppressive drugs are used to prevent this. IL2Ra, a newer antibody therapy, can be added to a patient's existing immunosuppression to further reduce the risk of rejection. This review found that adding IL2Ra reduced the risk of graft loss or death with a functioning transplant, acute rejection, and early malignancy, but did not improve patient survival. Compared to ATG, another possible antibody option, IL2Ra treatment caused less CMV disease and malignancy and had fewer side effects, but although there was no difference in clinically diagnosed acute rejection, IL2Ra treatment resulted in more biopsy proven rejection at 1 year.</P>

<P>Interleukin 2 receptor antagonists (IL2Ra) are used as induction therapy for prophylaxis against acute rejection in kidney transplant recipients. Use of IL2Ra has increased steadily since their introduction, but the proportion of new transplant recipients receiving IL2Ra differs around the globe, with 27% of new kidney transplant recipients in the United States, and 70<B>%</B> in Australasia receiving IL2Ra in 2007.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-02-18 10:50:35 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 71 studies (306 reports, 10,520 participants). Where IL2Ra were compared with placebo (32 studies; 5,854 patients) graft loss including death with a functioning graft was reduced by 25% at six months (16 studies: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98) and one year (24 studies: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.90), but not beyond this. At one year biopsy-proven acute rejection was reduced by 28% (14 studies: RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.81), and there was a 19% reduction in CMV disease (13 studies: RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.97). There was a 64% reduction in early malignancy within six months (8 studies: RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.86), and creatinine was lower (7 studies: MD -8.18 µmol/L 95% CI -14.28 to -2.09) but these differences were not sustained.</P>
<P>When IL2Ra were compared to ATG (18 studies, 1,844 participants), there was no difference in graft loss at any time point, or for acute rejection diagnosed clinically, but the was benefit of ATG therapy over IL2Ra for biopsy-proven acute rejection at one year (8 studies:, RR 1.30 95% CI 1.01 to 1.67), but at the cost of a 75% increase in malignancy (7 studies: RR 0.25 95% CI 0.07 to 0.87) and a 32% increase in CMV disease (13 studies: RR 0.68 95% CI 0.50 to 0.93). Serum creatinine was significantly lower for IL2Ra treated patients at six months (4 studies: MD -11.20 µmol/L 95% CI -19.94 to -2.09). ATG patients experienced significantly more fever, cytokine release syndrome and other adverse reactions to drug administration and more leucopenia but not thrombocytopenia. There were no significant differences in outcomes according to cyclosporine or tacrolimus use, azathioprine or mycophenolate, or to the study populations baseline risk for acute rejection. There was no evidence that effects were different according to whether equine or rabbit ATG was used.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-11-12 17:14:24 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Given a 38% risk of rejection, per 100 recipients compared with no treatment, nine recipients would need treatment with IL2Ra to prevent one recipient having rejection, 42 to prevent one graft loss, and 38 to prevent one having CMV disease over the first year post-transplantation. Compared with ATG treatment, ATG may prevent some experiencing acute rejection, but 16 recipients would need IL2Ra to prevent one having CMV, but 58 would need IL2Ra to prevent one having malignancy. There are no apparent differences between basiliximab and daclizumab. IL2Ra are as effective as other antibody therapies and with significantly fewer side effects.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-05-02 11:05:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-02-18 15:56:03 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). In the developed world there are approximately 280 patients per million population (pmp) with a functioning kidney transplant. The transplant rate is around 30 pmp and between 30-50% of transplanted organs come from living donors. Graft survival beyond five years has remained unchanged since the 1970s, with an average annual decline of approximately 5%. Waiting lists for transplantation continue to grow, demand exceeding organ availability. Strategies to increase donor organ availability and to prolong kidney allograft survival have become priorities in kidney transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-ANZDATA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZDATA 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-OPTN_x002f_SRTR-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">OPTN/SRTR 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UK-National-Transplant-Database-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK National Transplant Database 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UK-Renal-Registry-report-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK Renal Registry report 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Transplant outcome is influenced by many factors. In the absence of immunosuppression, transplanted organs undergo progressive immune mediated injury (rejection). Standard immunosuppressive therapy consists of initial induction and then maintenance regimens to prevent rejection, with short courses of more intensive immunosuppressive therapy to treat episodes of acute rejection. Standard protocols in use typically involve three drug groups each directed to a site in the T-cell activation and proliferation cascade which is central to the rejection process: calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporin, tacrolimus), anti-proliferative agents (e.g. azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) and steroids (prednisolone) (<LINK REF="REF-Hong-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hong 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Short-term graft survival is related to control of the acute rejection process. The risk of graft rejection is greatest in the immediate post-transplant period, and immunosuppression is therefore initiated at high levels. This is either by using higher doses of the agents used in maintenance therapy, or by adding an additional immunosuppressive induction agent. The potential induction agents are an anti-T cell antibody preparation, either a polyclonal anti-lymphocyte antibody (e.g. anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)) or a monoclonal antibody (e.g. muromonab-CD3), or an interleukin 2 receptor antibody (IL2Ra, also sometimes called anti-CD25 antibodies).</P>
<P>IL2Ra are humanised or chimeric (murine/human) IgG monoclonal antibodies to the alpha subunit of the IL2 receptor present only on activated T lymphocytes. The binding of IL2 to its receptor induces second messenger signals to stimulate the T cell to enter the cell cycle and proliferate, resulting in clonal expansion and differentiation. IL2Ra inhibit this IL2 mediated activation. The rationale for use of IL2Ra has been as induction agents in combination with standard agents to try to prevent acute rejection, or to minimise exposure to the calcineurin inhibitors (particularly in recipients deemed at high risk of delayed initial graft function) thereby ameliorating their short and long-term nephrotoxic side effects (so called calcineurin inhibitor sparing regimes) (<LINK REF="REF-Cibrik-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cibrik 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goebel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goebel 2000</LINK>)</P>
<P>Current opinion favours minimising early graft injury by using induction therapy (including IL2Ra) to prevent acute rejection, particularly in patients at high risk of early acute rejection . High-risk groups include young adults and children, recipients of kidney with pancreas transplant, African-Americans, and immunologically 'sensitised' patients. Sensitised patients are those with high titres of preformed circulating anti-HLA antibodies, which can be estimated by testing Panel Reactive Antibodies (PRA) and other related tests. These circulating anti-HLA antibodies may come about as a result of underlying illness, previous transplantation, previous pregnancy or blood transfusion. However there is no evidence that a decrease in early rejection rates translates into a uniform increase in long-term graft survival for all. There is concern that newer drugs or combinations of drugs, whilst apparently improving early graft outcome by reducing early acute rejection episodes, may in fact increase the risk of malignant or cardiovascular disease in the medium and longer term, thereby curtailing patient survival (i.e. increasing death with a functioning allograft). (<LINK REF="REF-Pascual-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascual 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vanrenterghem-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanrenterghem 2001</LINK>)</P>
<P>There is considerable variability in the use of immunosuppressive agents both geographically and within patient groups. There is also variation in terms of the combinations of agents chosen and the dosage regimens employed. This variation is partly, but not completely, explained by different perceptions of the relative potency and specificity of different immunosuppressive regimens. In the Unites States in 2007, 27% of new kidney recipients received an IL2Ra as induction therapy, and 45% received an ATG preparation, whereas in Australia 70% received an IL2Ra and only 5% an ATG preparation (<LINK REF="REF-ANZDATA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZDATA 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-OPTN_x002f_SRTR-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">OPTN/SRTR 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>We originally reviewed the randomised control trial (RCT) evidence of benefits and harms of IL2Ra, compared with no treatment, or compared with another immunosuppressive strategy, in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Webster-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 2004</LINK>). The aim of this review was to update the short and longer-term benefits and harms of IL2Ra in kidney transplant recipients with new evidence from RCTs.</P>

<P>Results can be found in comparison 1, Analyses 1.1 to 1.21. In general, all effects were homogeneous across all outcomes.</P>
<P>There was no difference in mortality, but graft loss including death with a functioning graft (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) was reduced by 25% at six months (16 studies, 3017 participants: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98) and at one year after transplantation (24 studies, 4672 participants: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.90). Graft loss censored for death with function showed similar significant reduction favouring IL2Ra (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) at 6 months and 1 year. Beyond one year, there were fewer studies reporting graft loss outcomes, and so there was uncertainty whether the reduction was sustained beyond the first post-transplant year (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection was reduced by 69% at three months, 32% at six months, and 28% at one year post-transplantation for those treated with an IL2Ra (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>: at 3 months (2 studies): RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.68; at 6 months (15 studies): RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.76; at one year (14 studies): RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.81). This advantage was similar for clinically suspected acute rejection (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Treatment with an IL2Ra showed a pronounced effect in preventing early steroid-resistant rejection, reducing incidence at six months by 48% (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK> (9 studies, 1928 participants): RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.68).</P>
<P>Use of IL2Ra resulted in a 64% reduction in early malignancy within six months of transplantation (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK> (8 studies, 1878 participants): RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.86), but the effect was not sustained beyond six months. CMV infection was reduced in IL2Ra treated patients at three and six months, but not significantly so (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). At one year, when more studies reported CMV outcomes, there was a 19% reduction in CMV disease for IL2Ra treated recipients (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK> (13 studies, 3169 participants): RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.97).</P>
<P>Serum creatinine was significantly lower for IL2Ra treated patients at one, three and six months post-transplantation (<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>: at 1 month (4 studies, 646 participants) MD -21.45 µmol/L 95% CI -33.03 to -9.38; at 3 months, (7 studies, 820 participants) MD -7.33 µmol/L 95% CI -13.58 to -1.08; and at 6 months (7 studies, 1231 participants) MD -8.18 µmol/L 95% CI -14.28 to -2.09), but this effect was not sustained at one year (<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK> (8 studies, 1135 participants): MD -5.31 µmol/L 95% CI -13.90 to 3.28) or beyond, where there was no difference in creatinine. Few studies reported GFR, and there was no evidence of difference for IL2Ra or placebo (<LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>). Data was sparse for other outcomes, and there was no difference demonstrated for PTDM (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>), total serious infections (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>) or for adverse reaction to drug administration (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no significant heterogeneity of effects for any outcomes when IL2Ra was compared with placebo/no treatment. We performed sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of studies methodology (whether intention-to-treat analysis was used, or not) and publication status (whether the study results were published in a peer-reviewed journal, or not) on the outcomes death, graft loss censored for death, acute rejection (diagnosed clinically or by biopsy), CMV and malignancy, using data from studies reporting these outcomes at any time within the first post-transplant year. Results are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. There was no evidence to suggest difference in estimates of effect for studies that did not use intention-to-treat analysis or were unclear in how they analysed data. For studies published in non-peer reviewed journals or as conference abstracts, there was a greater benefit in reduction of graft loss using IL2Ra (10 studies, RR 0.36 95% CI 0.18 to 0.71) than for those studies published in peer reviewed journals (19 studies, RR 0.81 95%CI 0.66 to 1.01 (P for difference 0.02), but no significant difference for other outcomes. <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> shows the funnel plot for graft loss within the first year post-transplantation.</P>
<P>To investigate the effect of calcineurin inhibitor and antimetabolite co-intervention, and the study population background risk for acute rejection, we performed subgroup analysis using the same outcomes. The results are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> (forest plots not shown). There was no evidence that effects of IL2Ra were different for any outcome when used with either cyclosporin or tacrolimus, or when used with azathioprine or mycophenolate, except for the outcome CMV disease. For CMV disease, there was more evidence of benefit for reducing CMV disease when used with mycophenolate (7 studies, RR 0.78 95% CI 0.60 to 1.02) than when used with azathioprine (5 studies, RR 1.18 95% CI 0.84 to 1.65) (P for difference 0.05). There was no evidence that the effects of IL2Ra were different depending on the study population baseline risk for acute rejection for death, graft loss, CMV or malignancy, but there was some evidence that higher risk populations benefited more in reduction of acute rejection than those at lower baseline risk (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, respectively 2 studies RR 0.25 95% CI 0.11 to 0.56 and 11 studies RR 0.68 95% CI 0.60 to 0.76; P for difference 0.02)</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">IL2Ra versus ATG</HEADING>
<P>When IL2Ra were compared to ATG, there was no evidence of a difference in death (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>), graft loss whether including death with function (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>) or censored for death (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>), at any time point post-transplantation. There was no difference for acute rejection diagnosed clinically at any time point (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>), at any time within the first year (15 studies, 1571 participants: RR 1.12 95% CI 0.93 to 1.33) or for biopsy-proven rejection at three or six months (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>), but there was benefit of ATG therapy over IL2Ra for biopsy-proven acute rejection at one year, where there was a 30% increase in those treated with IL2Ra (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK> 8 studies, 1106 participants: RR 1.30 95% CI 1.01 to 1.67). This effect was not seen for steroid-resistant rejection and any time point, although fewer studies reported this outcome (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>). Recipients treated with IL2Ra showed a 75% reduction in malignancy at one year compared with ATG treated (<LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK> 7 studies, 1067 participants: RR 0.25 95% CI 0.07 to 0.87), although not at other time points. CMV disease was reduced, but not significantly so, for IL2Ra treated recipients at three and six months and one year (<LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>). When considering CMV disease occurring at any time within the first year post-transplant, IL2Ra treated recipients showed a 32% reduction compared to the ATG treated (<LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK> 13 studies, 1647 participants: RR 0.68 95% CI 0.50 to 0.93). Serum creatinine was significantly lower for IL2Ra treated patients at six months and one year post-transplantation (<LINK REF="CMP-002.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.15</LINK>, respectively 4 studies, 244 participants: MD -11.20 µmol/L 95% CI -19.94 to -2.09; and 6 studies, 586 participants: MD -8.84 µmol/L 95% CI -17.23 to -0.45) but this effect was not certain at other time points where there was no difference demonstrated in mean creatinine. Few studies reported GFR, and there was no evidence of difference for IL2Ra or ATG (<LINK REF="CMP-002.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.16</LINK>). Compared with IL2Ra, ATG patients experienced significantly more fever, cytokine release syndrome and other adverse reactions to drug administration (<LINK REF="CMP-002.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.12</LINK>), and more leucopenia but not thrombocytopenia (<LINK REF="CMP-002.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.13</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, effects among studies were homogeneous. However, as in the original version of the review, significant heterogeneity was demonstrated for the outcome of CMV disease at six months (5 studies: RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.10; Chi² = 14.33, df = 4; P = 0.006, I² =72%) and similarly at one year (5 studies: RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.10; Chi² = 14.33, df = 4; P = 0.006, I² =72%) or at any time point within the first year (13 studies: RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.93; Chi² = 24.17, df = 11; P = 0.01, I² =54%). As in the original review, heterogeneous results were largely attributable to one study (<LINK REF="STD-Brennan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brennan 2006</LINK>). Sensitivity analysis, by removal of this study from each analysis, showed more homogeneous results strongly favouring IL2Ra (at six months: RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.77; P = 0.13; I² = 46%; at any time within the first year: RR 0.62 95% CI 0.49 to 0.77; P = 0.34; I² = 11%). Sensitivity analysis for outcomes death, graft loss censored for death, acute rejection, CMV disease and malignancy (all reported within the first post-transplant year), demonstrated no differences of effect for intention-to-treat analysis or for publication status (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). There were also no significant differences for the same outcomes, between subgroup analyses when stratified according to whether the studies used cyclosporin or tacrolimus, or azathioprine or mycophenolate, or according to the study population baseline risk for acute rejection (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>; forest plots not shown). When comparing the effects of IL2Ra with ATG, there was no evidence that effects were different according to the formulation of ATG used, specifically whether equine or rabbit (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-02-18 13:59:38 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of an IL2Ra in addition to standard calcineurin inhibitor-based dual or triple therapy significantly reduces graft loss, acute rejection and CMV disease within the first year post-transplantation. At six months IL2Ra reduce early malignancy and improve graft function. This is a class effect, as there was no evidence that the effects of basiliximab and daclizumab were different. The use of an IL2Ra in place of ATG showed no difference in graft loss or in clinically diagnosed acute rejection, but did show an increase in biopsy-proven acute rejection at one year (but not at other time points). Compared with ATG, IL2Ra use reduced incidence of CMV disease and malignancy, and improved mean serum creatinine. Recipients receiving ATG had more adverse reactions to drug administration. There was no evidence that the effects differed dependent on immunosuppressive co-interventions, or whether the ATG was raised in horses or in rabbits. The lack of consistent outcome definitions and varied time of outcome reporting among studies hampered many more meaningful comparisons that could potentially be made.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Strengths and limitations</HEADING>
<P>This meta-analysis was undertaken with deliberately broad inclusion criteria, to better explore the totality of evidence available, and to make pragmatic comparisons that related to common clinical practice decisions. We undertook an extensive literature search, and sought data from all reports of each study we identified. This update re-organised data comparisons from their presentation in the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Webster-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 2004</LINK>), by splitting ATG comparisons away from those with other mono- or polyclonal antibodies. We added a succinct exploration of subgroup effects to explore potential differences that might results from other study design features or settings such as co-interventions or population baseline immunological risk. We also added new outcomes relating to transplant function (serum creatinine and GFR). The results demonstrated a remarkable consistency and homogeneity of effect for IL2Ra over a large number of diverse outcomes. The review update was able to confirm differences in effect for important clinical outcomes that were hinted at, but not proven, in the original review. An example is graft loss which moved from 14 studies showing RR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.04) in the original review, to 24 studies showing RR of 0.75 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.90). Hence, new findings include a significant reduction in graft loss, and in CMV disease and malignancy for those treated with IL2Ra compared to placebo/no treatment. Similarly, with new evidence, the comparison of IL2Ra with ATG was more informative.</P>
<P>Despite these strengths, there was still insufficient power to show definite reduction in some important outcomes through all time points, and inconsistent reporting of important outcomes hampered interpretation. Although 16 studies with 2,211 participants compared IL2Ra with ATG, only 10 studies reported acute rejection diagnosed clinically or by biopsy at one year, only eight studies reported biopsy-proven rejection, and only six studies reported steroid-resistant rejection. Hence, we cannot be sure what outcomes were experienced by participants in the studies that provided no data. Although we believe this is the most comprehensive evidence summary on this topic, use of these results must acknowledge the evident limitations of the data available from this study cohort.</P>
<P>As in the original review, the applicability of the meta-analysis results to other populations and settings may be limited by the circumstances of the constituent studies. This update included more data for recipients at higher baseline risk of acute rejection than the original review, but many studies included participants of mixed immunological risk and did not provide stratified results, so power to investigate potential differences was thus reduced. One possible way to clarify these residual doubts and uncertainties, would be through increased access to transparent study outcome dataset, and by use of standardised outcome definitions. Individual patient data meta-analysis would likely be informative. However, the high level of homogeneity of results among RCTs for the majority of outcomes, particularly the primary outcomes of graft loss and acute rejection, suggests that the results are likely to be generalisable to populations of greater and lesser risk. The relative under-reporting of treatment harms compared with treatment benefits, and the incomplete data presented is not a problem peculiar to this review, and is widely recognised as common to many RCTs and systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Cuervo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuervo 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In an attempt to minimise publication bias, this meta-analysis included both unpublished data and data from conference abstracts. We also made strenuous efforts to include non-English language sources. In the update, 25/189 (13.2%) new reports came from handsearching conference proceedings over and above those already searched by the specialised register of the Cochrane Renal Group. We examined funnel plots of the key outcomes (mortality, graft loss censored for death, acute rejection, CMV disease and malignancy) for asymmetry that might suggest potential publication bias (not all included other than <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> because of size and complexity constraints on the review as a whole). This was done in recognition that confining a meta-analysis to published data or English language alone has been demonstrated to over-estimate positive treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The internal validity of the design, conduct and analysis of the included RCTs was difficult to assess because of the omission of important methodological details in the study reports. No single study adequately reported all domains of the risk of bias assessment (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>), despite using information from many data sources and attempting author contact to try to clarify these details. Thus it is impossible to exclude the possibility that elements of internal biases may be present in the results of the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>IL2Ra show significant benefit in reducing acute rejection, graft loss, CMV disease and early malignancy, but not mortality in kidney transplant recipients when added to standard calcineurin-based therapy. IL2Ra compared with ATG reduce CMV disease, malignancy and cause significantly fewer side effects, with no differences in graft loss or clinically diagnosed or steroid-resistant rejection, but an increase at one year of biopsy-proven rejection. Basiliximab and daclizumab are equally effective. Thus, the benefits and harms of adding IL2Ra use outweigh standard therapy alone, but choice of IL2Ra over ATG may be different for different patients. The applicability of the findings of this updated review are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>, which demonstrates that in adding IL2Ra to standard calcineurin based therapy, for every 100 people treated, within the first year, two fewer will loose their graft, 11 fewer will experience acute rejection, and two fewer will experience CMV disease. The number needed to treat with IL2Ra to prevent one person losing their graft is 42, nine for acute rejection, and 38 for CMV disease.</P>
<P>In using IL2Ra over ATG, when treating 100 people, there will be no difference in graft loss or overall rejection, but eight fewer with CMV disease (number needed to treat to prevent one case is 16). However, although differences in malignancy are significantly different, within the first year the absolute risk of early malignancy is small, so per 100 people treated there will be no a difference of two, and the number needed to treat to prevent one case of cancer is 58.</P>
<P>In using these relative and absolute measures of effect it is clear that different treatment decisions may be appropriate for different patients.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-12 16:07:01 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The updated review findings will permit a further economic evaluation, using more recent and precise evidence than was previously possible <LINK REF="REF-Morton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morton 2009</LINK>.</P>
<P>Despite the homogeneity of results across the populations of the pooled studies, there was under representation of high risk participants and in particular of children. The availability of the full study datasets would permit individual patient data meta-analysis, and would be an economical way of using existing data more effectively. Failing this, future studies involving younger patients, and those at higher baseline risk of acute rejection would enhance certainty of benefit in this subgroup. The importance of follow-up prolonged beyond one year cannot be over emphasised, particularly to clarify the risks and eventual outcome of harms from differing immunosuppressive treatment strategies. Where this cannot be achieved in an RCT, inclusion of information that could form a linkage key, would permit a hybrid design of RCT with an observational cohort, allowing later linkage with longer term follow-up data, perhaps from a registry or from administrative hospital records. This is an under-exploited method to gain valuable medium and longer term data that would otherwise be unknown.</P>
<P>Many of the uncertainties of the meta-analysis might be clarified if meta-analysis of individual patient data were possible. This would increase the statistical power of the analysis, and thus might clarify the estimates of effect which approach, but do not reach, statistical significance, and clarify subgroups effects are consistent with overall findings. Individual data analysis would also allow time-to-event data to be incorporated more easily, and allow more flexible analysis of patient subgroups and outcomes. However, if complete data were not available from all RCTs, then analysis of only selected data would obviously risk the introduction of bias to the estimates (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2001</LINK>).</P>
