<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-10-06 21:28:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is not enough evidence to show the best fluid replacement to use during and following surgery on the abdominal aorta. Surgery on the abdominal aorta is a major surgical procedure with a mortality of 1.5% in elective patients and up to 5% in emergency surgery. Fluid replacement is needed to replace tissue fluids lost during surgery. Blood products, non-blood products, or combinations including crystalloid solutions and colloids are used. Combination therapy is most common. The review of trials found that although 38 randomised trials involving 1589 patients were identified, there was not enough evidence on the benefits of any particular individual or combination fluid therapy. No single fluid affected any outcome measure significantly more than another fluid across a range of outcomes. The trials used many different fluid replacement comparisons so that few results could be pooled. Important outcomes are the need for allogenic blood transfusion, complications of organ failure, and length of stay in both the intensive care unit and hospital.</P>

<P>Surgery on the abdominal aorta to treat aneurysms or occlusive disease is a major undertaking which requires intensive physiological support and fluid management. Blood products are often used but the main fluid replacement is with crystalloids or colloids.

<P>Thirty-eight trials involving 1589 patients were included. Patients undergoing aortic surgery had various physiological parameters measured before and after their operation (these were cardiac, respiratory, haematological, and biochemical). Patients were randomised to a fluid type. This review demonstrated that no single fluid affects any outcome measure significantly more than another fluid across a range of outcomes. The death rate in these studies was 2.45% (39 patients).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-10-03 12:29:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the confirmed beneficial effects of colloids in this review, further studies are still required. There are no studies examining the effects of combination fluid therapy. The primary research outcome was death, for which results were limited; therefore, future studies should pay more attention to short-term outcomes such as minimising the need for allogenic blood transfusion, complications (organ failure), and length of stay in both the intensive care unit and hospital.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-10-03 13:00:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-10-03 12:57:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgery on the abdominal aorta is most commonly performed for the following reasons. Firstly, aneurysm of the abdominal aorta. This has an estimated prevalence of between 2% and 5% in people over 60 years of age, with a male to female ratio of approximately 4:1 (<LINK REF="REF-Gratama-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gratama 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shirani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shirani 2009</LINK>). The prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm is higher in people with atherosclerosis, where men over 59 years of age have an abdominal aortic aneurysm prevalence of 11.1%, which is twice as high as for men over 65 years old in the general population. Surgery using an open approach necessitates cross-clamping of the abdominal aorta during graft insertion and anastomosis. The second reason is for atherosclerotic disease. In the USA this affects 10% of the population over the age of 70 years (<LINK REF="REF-US-Dept-of-Com-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">US Dept of Com 1984</LINK>). A proportion of these people will require surgery on the abdominal aorta to improve lower limb blood flow.</P>
<P>Surgery which involves cross-clamping of the abdominal aorta results in a reduction in plasma volume that leads to severe hypotensive episodes on releasing the clamp, especially in aneurysm patients. In patients with aorto-occlusive disease the haemodynamic effects from aortic cross-clamping do not cause as much volatility because of the collateral circulation that has formed. Compensatory effects, such as vasoconstriction and an increase in heart rate, can maintain blood pressure for losses of blood up to around 40%, or two litres.</P>
<P>Loss of fluid is due to blood loss at the site of surgery, which averages one to three litres during aneurysm surgery; extracellular losses due to the development of oedema in the tissues as a result of increased microvascular permeability, typically one litre per hour during surgery and continuing into the immediate postoperative period; evaporation from the open peritoneal cavity during the operation. In addition, at clamp release blood is released into a vasodilated ischaemic periphery, which leads to a loss of filling pressure as a result of the loss of afterload resistance. This has the same physiological effect as acutely decreasing the plasma volume. Therefore, there is an apparent reduction in plasma volume at clamp release although the circulating volume has not actually changed.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-10-03 12:59:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The plasma volume reduction is corrected at the time of surgery and in the early postoperative period with blood products and various crystalloid and colloid solutions. Examples of fluids include 0.9% (normal) saline, 1.8% (hypertonic) saline, starch solutions, gelatins and dextran solutions. There are various factors either in favour of or against each of the individual fluids. These include persistence within the circulatory system, effects on renal function, effects on electrolyte balance, alteration of blood coagulation, changes in plasma oncotic pressure (that is the element of colloid osmotic pressure which is due to the plasma colloids) and risk of development of acute (formerly adult) respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</P>

<P>There were 47 reports for 38 included studies. Nineteen of these reports related to16 studies included in previous versions of this review. Details are given in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>All studies focused on a small group of patients undergoing a specific surgery. The study designs were similar in that all involved the administration of a given fluid during and after an operation, itself a standardised procedure. Patients needing surgical repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) tend to have a comparable age range and health status, so it was reasonable to assume that there was clinical homogeneity across these types of included studies. Patients requiring bypass because of aorto-iliac occlusive disease are often younger, with a higher proportion of women, compared to patients requiring surgery for AAA. It was reasonable to assume that there was clinical homogeneity across the included studies involving patients with aorto-iliac occlusive disease.The diversity of fluids used and outcome measures assessed can be seen in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. This table includes details of the age of patients, sex ratios, methods of randomisation, interventions, outcome measures and the overall numbers in each study. Each of the trials studied the effects of different solutions on different outcome measures. The <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table presents the available data in a concise and comprehensive way and the main results of each trial are summarised with specific reference to the key outcome measures.</P>
<P>The aim of each study was to determine which fluid was optimal for the preoperative and postoperative management of patients. All of the studies used standard protocols for replacing blood lost with 'bank blood'. Replacement of other losses and maintenance of plasma volume has to be tailored to the needs of each individual patient. In order to compare the effects of such fluids a protocol is necessary to ensure that each patient receives their requirement, not more or less. The issue of balanced fluid replacement was addressed in a number of ways, as follows.</P>
<P>Bomberger (<LINK REF="STD-Bomberger-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bomberger 1986</LINK>) titrated fluid infusion rates to maintain urine output at 50 to100 ml/hour. Diuretics were administered where patients developed fluid overload, although there was no stated protocol for this.</P>
<P>Eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boutros-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Boutros 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Virgilio-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Virgilio 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shackford-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Shackford 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hankeln-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hankeln 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawidson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dawidson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waters-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Waters 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruegger-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bruegger 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soskic-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soskic 2005</LINK>) used the preoperative pulmonary artery wedge pressure to define a baseline 'normal' level for each patient, and titrated the fluid infusion to maintain this within defined limits. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Shimada-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Shimada 2005</LINK>) used the central venous pressure. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Virgilio-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Virgilio 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shackford-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Shackford 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahmood-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmood 2007</LINK>) additionally maintained urine output within defined limits.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Welch-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Welch 1993</LINK> examined the effects of isovolemic haemodilution with dextran 70 on renal function. An 'index of renal function' was determined by expressing mean postoperative creatinine clearance as a fraction of the mean preoperative creatinine clearance.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Catoire-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Catoire 1992</LINK> used preoperative normovolaemic haemodilution (PNH) in order to improve segmental myocardial wall motion in patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery.

<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kasper-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kasper 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kasper-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kasper 1998</LINK>) looked at the effects of a bovine haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOC-201).

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pull-Ter-Gunne-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pull Ter Gunne 1990</LINK> examined the effects of preoperative 'optimal' hydration, as determined by plotting Starling curves, on haemodynamics during aortic cross-clamping.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Marik-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Marik 1997</LINK> randomised patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in order to examine gastric intramucosal pH changes, a surrogate marker of tissue oxygenation, and volume replacement with HES or crystalloids. Intraoperative use of gastric intramucosal pH was also studied by <LINK REF="STD-Rittoo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rittoo 2002</LINK>.</P>
<P>The aim of the <LINK REF="STD-Ragaller-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ragaller 2000</LINK> study was to determine whether a reduction in the amount of applied fluid after aortic declamping was possible in order to maintain optimal wedge pressure (PCWP)/cardiac index (CI). The triallists used either hypertonic hydroxyethyl starch (HES 6%, 7.2% NaCl) or isotonic hydroxyethyl starch solution (HES 6%, 0.9% NaCl). The individual optimised PCWP/CI was determined using Frank-Starling curves after induction of anaesthesia and on declamping. <LINK REF="STD-Younes-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Younes 1988</LINK> reported changes in haemodynamic parameters (mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, plasma sodium, serum osmolarity, haematocrit, and plasma albumin) after the infusion of 7.5% NaCl compared with giving 0.9% NaCl two minutes before the release of the aortic clamp.</P>
<P>There were studies that randomised patients after they were transferred to the surgical intensive care unit. <LINK REF="STD-Bloomfield-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bloomfield 2004</LINK> studied the effects of diaspirin crosslink haemoglobin on haemodynamics and haemoglobin levels. <LINK REF="STD-Pargger-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pargger 1998</LINK> randomised patients to receive fluid management, according to the intragastric mucosal pH; and <LINK REF="STD-Verheij-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Verheij 2006</LINK> studied four different fluids on haemodynamic and respiratory parameters, in the surgical intensive care unit.

<BR/>Adjustment of fluid infusion rates to meet predefined criteria introduced a large potential bias into studies where the staff were not blinded to fluid type. This is discussed further under <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>All the studies examined the effects of a given fluid on outcome measures in the immediate postoperative period. Most studies continued to examine effects into the first and second postoperative days. <LINK REF="STD-Shackford-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Shackford 1983</LINK> presented data until the third postoperative day, although those data were not included in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Godet-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Godet 2008</LINK> studied the renal safety parameters (maximum increase in creatinine levels until sixth postoperative day and minimum creatinine clearance), incidence of oliguria, and the adverse events related to renal complications until hospital discharge. Of note was the disparity in choice of outcome measure. For example, two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boutros-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Boutros 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bomberger-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bomberger 1986</LINK>) examined the effects of administration of 5% dextrose in 0.45% normal saline and yet the only common outcome measure was pulmonary artery wedge pressure, which was used for fluid titration in the <LINK REF="STD-Boutros-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Boutros 1979</LINK> study and was therefore not valid. All of the studies referred to one or more outcome measures which were either not included in this review or were presented with insufficient data to permit inclusion. All relevant outcomes and other useful information are presented in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1991</LINK> appeared to present the same data in marginally different formats in four papers.

<P>See <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>. All the included studies randomised participants into treatment groups. Random number tables were used by three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Virgilio-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Virgilio 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shackford-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Shackford 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 1996</LINK>), deck of cards by two (<LINK REF="STD-Dawidson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dawidson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sobczynski-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sobczynski 1997</LINK>) and <LINK REF="STD-Marik-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Marik 1997</LINK> used a number generator. Concealment of allocation was described as using sealed envelopes in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-LaMuraglia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">LaMuraglia 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bloomfield-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bloomfield 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ridler 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rittoo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rittoo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verheij-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Verheij 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Godet-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Godet 2008</LINK>). It would appear that in all of the studies, patients were randomised consecutively after fulfilling any inclusion criteria. This was essential to reduce bias at the allocation stage.</P>
<P>Data on inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. None of the studies reported any patient exclusions after randomisation, although <LINK REF="STD-Skillman-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Skillman 1975</LINK> observed that three patients had a deviation from the protocol. Their results were excluded from any analysis but were presented separately within the paper.</P>
<P>The study fluid in each case was a standard fluid used routinely for replacement purposes in major surgical procedures throughout the world. There is no index standard and therefore it was valid to compare any given fluid with one or more other fluids, as in these studies.</P>
<P>All of the continuous outcome measures were calculated or derived from pre-calibrated laboratory or bedside analysers. This minimised error in the measurement of such parameters and eliminated observer bias or the tendency to round off numerical results.</P>
<P>The determination of an appropriate volume when replacing fluids during and after an operation is perhaps more of an art than a science. In an attempt to provide uniformity of treatment, many of the studies identified one of the outcome measures as an indicator of whether intravascular filling was sufficient (in most cases this was the pulmonary artery wedge pressure). Only <LINK REF="STD-Gold-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gold 1990</LINK> blinded the staff who were administering the fluid; therefore all of the other studies had a great potential for bias. Although the measurement of outcome measures was non-biased, there was potential to influence these measures with the volume and type of fluid administered. <LINK REF="STD-Mahmood-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmood 2007</LINK> reported that the statistical analysis performed in their study was carried out blind.</P>
<P>It was likely that the patients in these studies were blinded to the types of fluids given intraoperatively. There were three studies in which the interventions were performed in the surgical intensive care unit but, since these patients were likely to have received postoperative ventilator support with sedation and analgesia during the study period, patients would have been unaware of their fluid infusions. In either case, the outcome measures were unlikely to have been affected by patient awareness of fluid type. Therefore, patient blinding would not have improved the quality of any of these studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Cardiac</HEADING>
<P>Heart rate showed an increase postoperatively. Pulmonary artery wedge pressure did not change with any fluid but central venous pressure was elevated in two measured groups (3 cm at one hour in the Ringer's lactate group and 1.7 cm in the dextran 60 group). Several of the studies stated that central venous or pulmonary artery wedge pressures were used to assess fluid infusion volumes and were, therefore, maintained within a narrow range, it was likely that similar titration of fluid volume to maintain central venous or pulmonary artery wedge pressures was used in the studies where it was not stated. A rise of 2 to 3 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O in central venous pressure is unlikely to be of clinical significance. Mean arterial pressure remained stable in all groups, whereas cardiac output increased across the board over the 24 hours following surgery although it was unchanged immediately postoperatively. Systemic vascular resistance decreased postoperatively as is expected with rewarming of the patient and with maintained cardiac filling pressures (titrated to pulmonary artery wedge pressure). This explains the increase in cardiac output. </P>
<P>The mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance index could be increased by the infusion of fluids that contained haemoglobin derivatives. The measurement of intragastic mucosal pH (pHi) has shown that patients with a lower pHi in the intensive care unit require more colloid infusion for replacement, and may be used for early detection of immediate complications in the surgical intensive care unit. Mixed venous saturation was utilised to assess intraoperative tissue perfusion and it was better in patients who received colloid compared to those with 0.9% saline.</P>

<P>Most parameters varied little between fluid types. Oxygen consumption increased markedly after the operation, and especially so at 24 hours in those receiving 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline or 5% dextrose in Ringer's lactate (49, 50 ml/min respectively). With less than 10 patients in each group this may be a non-significant difference. Left-right shunt tended to increase by 4% to 8% during the 24 hours after surgery. Arterial-alveolar oxygen difference increased with time for the three fluids where this was measured, 92.5 mm Hg in patients receiving 5% dextrose in Ringer's lactate, 66 mm Hg in those receiving 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline, and 23 mm Hg in patients receiving 5% dextrose in albumin. There were no clinically significant changes in venous-arterial oxygen difference. The oxygen tension gradient was higher with the infusion of normal saline while it was lower when hypertonic dextran was given. When lung compliance was measured after the administration of fluids, the colloid types (gelatin, hydroxyethyl starch, and albumin) were associated with a reduction in lung compliance compared with normal saline.</P>

<P>Serum sodium increased in patients receiving hypertonic saline, by 14 mEq/l at the end of the operation, but in all other patients it fell by 2 to 4 mEq/l.

Plasma glucose levels increased by 9.3 mmol/l in patients receiving 5% dextrose. Serum lactate increased but this was to be expected as lactate is produced during the oxidation of glucose and the anaerobic glycolysis of glycogen. Cross-clamping of the aorta with subsequent reduced oxygen delivery to the legs leads to a decrease in the uptake of lactate by the already paralysed skeletal muscle.</P>
<P>Albumin levels showed a small, non-significant increase in studies where albumin was given and a small decrease where it was not. Colloid osmotic pressure decreased by 7 to 8 mm Hg where patients were given hypertonic saline and Ringer's lactate but remained unchanged in those given human albumin in Ringer's lactate. Serum oncotic pressure followed a similar pattern. Plasma osmolarity decreased with 5% dextrose in albumin or 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline and human albumin solution but increased (26 mOsm/l) in the early postoperative period in patients given hypertonic saline. Urine osmolarity increased in all patients in the first 48 hours postoperatively, 251 to 254 mOsm/l in the crystalloid patients and 149 mOsm/l in the colloid patients.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-10-18 16:38:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One of the major drawbacks of the reviewed literature is that the individual studies involved very small numbers of patients and each study considered only a limited number of outcome measures. Several of the studies failed to fully discuss their protocols, for example the use of diuretics to prevent fluid overload (<LINK REF="STD-Bomberger-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bomberger 1986</LINK>). Nor did they explain how the amount of fluids required was determined. For this review, it has been assumed that management was based on central venous and pulmonary artery wedge pressures as is standard procedure in intensive care units. There was little mention of weight gain after the operation, or the time required for weight to return to normal. This measure would be confounded somewhat by the hypercatabolic state after major abdominal surgery and variability in the use of supplementary nutrition. There was only one report about fluid responsiveness and tissue perfusion, by the value of mixed venous oxygenation (<LINK REF="STD-Soskic-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soskic 2005</LINK>); and two reports about the value of intragastric mucosal pH (<LINK REF="STD-Pargger-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pargger 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rittoo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rittoo 2002</LINK>). Future studies, both in the operating theatres and intensive care area, may focus on this area. The central venous saturation may be examined instead of the mixed venous saturation in the era of less pulmonary artery catheter insertion. In modern society, cost data are important, although the cost of a few litres of fluid is likely to be insignificant compared with a day or two on an intensive care unit. However, a delay in discharge from intensive care would have significant cost implications.</P>
<P>The data available on non-blood fluid replacement in aortic surgery over a range of outcome measures does not show a significant benefit for any one fluid. There are certainly changes in electrolyte and protein concentrations and minor changes in haematological parameters but these are corrected by the body in a short period of time. Postoperative lung function, however, does appear to be affected significantly by the fluid type used, as shown by the arterial-alveolar oxygen difference measurements. The arterial-alveolar oxygen difference is a reflection of the distance between the alveolar lumen and the capillary blood stream. This is increased as the volume of interstitial water increases, leading to pulmonary oedema. In general the lungs are well protected from oedema formation, even with a reducing colloid osmotic pressure in the plasma. The interstitial fluid protein concentration in the lungs is as high as 70% to 80% of that in the plasma (<LINK REF="REF-Zarins-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zarins 1978</LINK>) so that the colloid osmotic pressure gradient is small. Any leakage of protein into the interstitium is, therefore, less significant than in the peripheral tissues. Formation of oedema is more proportionally related to the hydrostatic pressure.</P>
<P>Lung function was measured in the studies by examining the arterio-alveolar oxygen difference, as an indication of excess interstitial water increasing diffusion distance. However, there is evidence that this can be affected by changes in cardiac output as much as by changes in pulmonary function (<LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1977</LINK>). It was proposed (<LINK REF="STD-Virgilio-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Virgilio 1979</LINK>) that the higher arterio-alveolar difference in the crystalloid group represented an underfilling of the vascular system because of a decreased cardiac output, and not an increase in interstitial lung water. Correction of the filling deficit would abolish the differences between these patients and those receiving colloids. Furthermore, the authors proposed that the colloid osmotic pressure was of little significance provided that pulmonary artery wedge pressure was within normal range. Therefore, colloids or crystalloids were of equal value provided that pulmonary artery wedge pressure was maintained.</P>
<P>In colloid fluid infusion interventions, patients who receive intraoperative colloid may require less overall fluid replacement compared with patients who do not receive such fluids. The lower fluid requirement would affect the patients' clinical pathways in the perioperative period, both in the surgical ICU and the convalescence period. However, the link with less fluid replacement and the shorter duration of ICU length of stay cannot be confirmed from this review. This possible outcome requires further study. The effect of hypertonic solutions (both hypertonic saline and hypertonic hyperoncotic) results in less fluid requirement during the intraoperative period. In this review the combined effect was not studied because the study designs were so different.</P>
<P>Mortality did not differ between patients who received acute normovolaemic haemodilution and those in the control group who did not, however the pooled effect was only from two studies. The beneficial effect of avoiding allogenic transfusion after acute normovolaemic haemodilution cannot be confirmed in this review because of the limited data available.</P>
<P>Thus, with all fluids there was an alteration of physiological parameters after the operation. This happened regardless of which fluid was used. The aim of all the investigators was to determine which fluid would minimise that disruption. The body has a remarkable ability to maintain homeostasis and we do not know to what extent certain physiological changes are less harmful than others. Indeed, suppression of some of the changes may in fact be harmful where those changes are part of a normal response to the trauma of surgery and are required to ensure healing and regeneration. Until there is a more thorough understanding of such matters, it will be difficult to express a benefit of one fluid over another; all that clinicians can do is observe and report what they see. The total amount of fluids required to maintain stable haemodynamics both intraoperatively, especially at the time of aortic cross-clamp release, and in the surgical ICU have been reported to be less in patients receiving colloids compared to crystalloids. This was reported in only 10% of patients in this review. It may not improve patient outcomes since the ventilator support time and surgical ICU length of stay did not differ with the types of fluids given. Besides, the colloid type may affect respiratory compliance more than crystalloid fluids.</P>
<P>Although we found no overwhelming evidence in favour of the preferential use of any one type of fluid, concerns regarding individual fluids, such as an observed excess mortality in patients given albumin (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>), are likely to result in a change in patterns of use.

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-10-04 13:15:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgery on the aorta is a major undertaking and requires specialised anaesthetic and surgical staff to optimise patient outcomes. There has been much controversy over the most appropriate single or combination fluid to use to minimise morbidity and mortality. Numerous studies have been performed but with little co-ordination. There remains insufficient evidence to draw any firm conclusions and until studies with a suitable statistical power are planned and underway that situation is unlikely to change.</P>
<P>There is no evidence here of the effects of combination fluid therapy, that is colloid and crystalloid combined. This is the management of choice (anecdotally) of most anaesthetists and perhaps, with the lack of evidence for any specific advantage to either alone, the most rational.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-10-04 13:25:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review demonstrates the urgent need for greater co-ordination in medical research with more emphasis on research based on existing evidence and designed appropriately to maximise the efficient use of scarce resources. This review covers work produced over a period of 30 to 40 years. Despite hundreds of 'man' years of research, no definite benefit of one fluid over another is seen from the included studies. Fluid management in open aortic surgery can be adapted and varied by anaesthetic staff. It is possible that many choices of fluid supplementation for these high risk patients are available. Further studies in the near future need very well planned and clear objectives in order to obtain important results or create a paradigm shift. In the field of a restrictive fluid regimen using hypertonic saline or colloid solution more information on patient safety is needed.</P>
<P>Many aspects of patient care and management during aortic surgery have changed since many of the studies were carried out, especially within the last 10 years. There have been changes in anaesthetic drugs and techniques with increasing use of adjunctive epidural anaesthesia. Surgical techniques are developing, especially with the increasing use of endovascular approaches to aneurysm repair, with much less physiological insult to the patient. Future researchers may find it is more difficult to recruit surgical patients into their studies.
<BR/>

<BR/>The choice of fluid for a given patient can only be based on the evidence available, and the best evidence comes from randomised controlled trials. However, it is currently impossible to measure the clinical significance of the changes seen in the many outcome measures that have been assessed. It will only be through the collection of prospective observational data on the many thousands of aneurysm operations that take place each year that greater understanding will be gained of the importance of any physiological changes. Armed with this knowledge, future researchers will be able to design randomised controlled trials to specifically examine those outcome measures of clinical and physiological importance. Future research may focus on short-term patient outcomes as the primary research outcomes. These include major complications in organ systems, myocardial injury, acute renal failure, the alleviation of requirements for vasopressors, shorter duration of ventilation support, lower allogenic blood transfusion requirements in the immediate perioperative period, and economical issues especially time in the surgical ICU and hospital. As the need for evidence in surgery grows ever stronger the development of large prospective multi-centred studies will enable current practices to be justified.</P>

<P>Data on postoperative values were presented graphically in this paper with no stated standard error of the mean for each outcome. Preoperative measurements were quoted with standard errors and therefore the review authors estimated the standard error for each outcome as a percentage of the result based on the percentage error reported for the preoperative value. Whilst this can only give an approximate value, these measurements are based on machine-generated figures which can be assumed (with modern engineering tolerances) to run repeatedly within their standard error, and therefore are valid for these comparisons. The use of one of the study fluids in all cases during the operation tends to reduce the credibility of any subsequent results.</P>
