<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-22 12:10:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-08-22 12:10:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L Henderson">
<P>Chlorioamnionitis is an inflammatory reaction of the placental tissues in response to organism invasion. The incidence of chorioamnionitis occurs in eight to 12 women for every 1000 live births and 96% of the cases of chorioamnionitis are due to an ascending infection (<LINK REF="REF-Monif-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monif 1993</LINK>). Following spontaneous vaginal delivery, 1% to 4% of women develop postpartum endometritis (<LINK REF="REF-Monif-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monif 1993</LINK>). Although uterine infections are relatively uncommon following uncomplicated vaginal delivery, they continue to be a major problem in women delivered by caesarean section. Vaginal examinations increase the risk of inoculation and colonization of lower uterine incisions and laceration and therefore increase the risk of postpartum endometritis in women delivered by caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bacterial infection is an important cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. A prospective study from Pakistan reported a prevalence of blood culture proven bacterial sepsis to be 5.6 per 1000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Bhutta-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhutta 1997</LINK>). Septicemia accounted for 11% to 30.4% of all neonatal deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Boo-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boo 1994</LINK>). Other forms of infection include ophthalmia neonatorum; neonatal pneumonia and neonatal meningitis. Maternal vaginal bacteria are the main agents for these infections.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-08-12 10:02:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>It is reasonable to speculate that prevention of maternal and neonatal infections might be possible by washing the vagina and cervix with an antibacterial agent in women during labour. Vaginal and cervical washing is usually performed by gently introducing a catheter attached to a 50 to 60 mL syringe up to the cervix. The cervical area is flushed with 50 to 60 mL of the solution. The syringe is then refilled without removing the catheter, and a second flushing with the same amount of the solution is performed while slowly withdrawing the catheter (<LINK REF="REF-Gaillard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaillard 2001</LINK>). This procedure can be performed within a few minutes and would not interfere with women's labour when they wish to move and adopt a position which they feel is right for them. To be clinically useful, such an agent would need to possess antimicrobial activity against a broad range of bacteria that have been implicated in peripartal infection, be non-toxic and non-irritating for mother and fetus/neonate. Ideally, the agent would be inexpensive and commercially available. Chlorhexidine, a widely used medical disinfectant, satisfies these requirements.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-08-12 10:07:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Chlorhexidine belongs to the class of compounds known as the bis-biguanides. Because of its high cationic nature, it has a strong affinity for the cell wall of micro-organisms, to which it binds, disrupting osmotic equilibrium. The disrupted cytoplasmic membrane precipitates intracellularly, preventing repair of the cell wall and eventually resulting in cell death (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1973</LINK>). These actions endow chlorhexidine with antibacterial action against a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including those implicated in peripartal infections (<LINK REF="REF-Emilson-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emilson 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hennessey-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hennessey 1973</LINK>). This antibacterial action is achieved at a very low concentration: typical minimum inhibitory concentrations are in microgram (mcg) per millilitre (mL), whereas clinically used concentrations are in milligram (mg) per mL. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that vaginal douching with chlorhexidine during labour can significantly reduce maternal and early neonatal (including group B streptococcal) infection (<LINK REF="REF-Stray_x002d_Pedersen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stray-Pedersen 1999</LINK>). Finally, complete resistance to chlorhexidine rarely emerges even after long-term use (<LINK REF="REF-Ferretti-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferretti 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The allergic and toxic potential of chlorhexidine is very low. For many decades, chlorhexidine has been the major medical skin and the mucous membrane disinfectant in use. Despite its widespread use, only individual cases of anaphylactic or even mild allergic reactions in exposed medical personnel have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Bergqvist_x002d_Karlsson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergqvist-Karlsson 1988</LINK>). Chlorhexidine tends not to be absorbed by human skin and mucous membrane barrier (<LINK REF="REF-Johnsson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnsson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 1989</LINK>). A long-term human oral safety trial did not show any systemic or serious local side effects after two years of continuous use (<LINK REF="REF-Johnsson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnsson 1987</LINK>). In contrast to povidone-iodine, vaginally applied chlorhexidine was not absorbed in measurable amounts into the blood stream (<LINK REF="REF-Vorherr-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vorherr 1984</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-08-12 10:07:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Maternal and neonatal infections occur commonly and have serious ramifications for both mothers and newborns. Vaginal chlorhexidine douching may offer a safe, inexpensive, and theoretically sound approach to prevent maternal and neonatal infections. Vaginal disinfection during labour for reducing the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV infection is addressed in one Cochrane review which indicated that there was no evidence of an effect of vaginal disinfection on MTCT of HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Wiysonge-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiysonge 2005</LINK>). Another Cochrane review also does not support the use of vaginal chlorhexidine during labour to prevent early-onset neonatal group B streptococcal infection (<LINK REF="REF-Stade-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stade 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>We used the following updated methods to assess the risk of bias and assess the quality of already included studies using the GRADE approach. The following methods section of this review is based on a standard template used by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.</P>
<P>Two review authors (PL and JT) independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We resolved any disagreement by discussion or by involving the third review author (JET).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4"> (2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence and determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias. </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding unlikely to affect results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;</LI>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We classified blinding as 'high risk of bias' if the blinding status of a trial was unclear or the trial was open.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods used to blind outcome assessment as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertook.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; &#8216;as treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomization);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We used a cut-off point of less than 20% of missing data to assess that a study is adequate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by (1) to (5) above)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1212181516253162684622876719716&amp;format=REVMAN_GRAPHS#REF-Higgins-2011">Higgins 2011</A>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we planned to assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings. In future updates, we will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see</I> <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1212181516253162684622876719716&amp;format=REVMAN_GRAPHS#SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS">Sensitivity analysis</A>.</P>
<P>For this update, the quality of the evidence was re-assessed using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>) in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following key outcomes for the main comparison between intervention (chlorhexidine vaginal wash) and control groups.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Chorioamnionitis</LI>
<LI>Postpartum endometritis</LI>
<LI>Neonatal sepsis</LI>
<LI>Blood culture confirming sepsis</LI>
</OL>
<P>The GRADEprofiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2008</LINK>) was used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; tables. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>We included three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rouse-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2003</LINK>) involving 3012 women in this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Eriksen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksen 1997,</LINK> from the USA, reported the effectiveness of chlorhexidine vaginal wash during labour to prevent neonatal infection. The data on peripartum infections of this study were reported in the other paper (<LINK REF="REF-Sweeten-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeten 1997</LINK>). As they are both reports of the same trial we listed them under <LINK REF="STD-Eriksen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksen 1997</LINK>. Participants at 36 or more weeks' gestation in labour, excluding preterm labour, fetal distress, malpresentation, intra-amniotic infection, cervical dilatation greater than 6 cm and known allergy to chlorhexidine were eligible for the study. Informed consent was obtained from 1024 women who were eligible. Of these, 77 were excluded from the analysis because of incomplete records (71, 38 in the control and 33 in the study group); three participants were enrolled and subsequently discharged home; the vaginal wash was not given to two women; and there was one infant with anencephaly. Of the remaining 947 participants, 481 were randomized to the study arm and 466 served as controls. A computer software program was used to generate a random block allocation sequence to assign participants to either group. The randomization assignments were contained in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed packets that were made up independent of the physicians managing the participants. The authors chose not to blind the study because the syringe containing chlorhexidine solution was pink and the investigators could not reproduce the colour artificially in the syringe containing the sterile water. For maternal outcomes, it is not very clear whether the intention-to-treat analysis was performed because it was not stated that 77 women were excluded before or after randomization. For neonatal outcomes, intention-to-treat analysis was not done because 24 neonatal charts in the chlorhexidine group and 13 in the control group were unavailable for review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rouse-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 1997</LINK>, from the USA, reported a double-blinded clinical trial to determine whether chlorhexidine vaginal irrigation prevents maternal peripartal infection. Participants were eligible if they were admitted for delivery at or beyond 24 weeks' gestation. Exclusion criteria included a contra-indication for cervical digital examination, active genital herpes, chorioamnionitis and known or suspected allergy to chlorhexidine. The chlorhexidine and placebo bottles were randomly ordered with a computer-generated list and sequentially numbered with a peel-off study label. The active and placebo solutions were clinically indistinguishable. Among 3234 eligible participants, 1024 were randomized, 508 in chlorhexidine and 516 in placebo groups respectively. Because of incomplete or contradictory data, treatment allocation could not be determined for additional 10 women and these women were not included in the analysis. Trial analysis was restricted to 1024 women and 1030 infants (six sets of twins).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2003</LINK>, from the USA, reported a clinical trial of chlorhexidine vaginal irrigation to prevent peripartal infection in nulliparas. The study was conducted in two hospitals serving predominantly publicly funded patients. Women were eligible if they were nulliparous and admitted for delivery at or beyond 32 weeks' gestation. Exclusion criteria included a contra-indication to digital cervical examination, active genital herpes, chorioamnionitis and allergy to chlorhexidine. The chlorhexidine and placebo bottles were sequentially numbered (in groups of four) and randomly ordered based on a computer-generated list (one for each hospital). Each study bottle contained a peel-off label which, after use, was used to link participants to the correct study group. The chlorhexidine and placebo preparations were clinically indistinguishable. Four women (two women in each group) were enrolled but actually did not undergo irrigation. They are included in the intention-to-treat analysis.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-08-12 10:20:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Although all three included trials are of high quality, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksen 1997</LINK>) used only 20 mL of chlorhexidine or sterile water for vaginal irrigation, while the other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Rouse-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rouse-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rouse 2003</LINK>) used 200 mL of chlorhexidine or sterile saline solution. The effectiveness of vaginal chlorhexidine might also depend on the volume of the solution used for irrigation. Since chlorhexidine solution is quite safe, not expensive and vaginal irrigation is not difficult to perform, there is a need for a well-designed randomized controlled trial with adequate sample size to evaluate this simple intervention. However, the investigators of future trials must use the appropriate concentration and volume of vaginal chlorhexidine irrigation solution. We have identified two ongoing studies from the trial registration website www.clinicaltrials.gov (<LINK REF="STD-Madhi--2006" TYPE="STUDY">Madhi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moss-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2006</LINK>) since the review was first published.</P>

<P>All three included studies were of overall low risk of bias; however, only 3012 women were included in total. This review might not have enough power to detect small effect size. Assessment of the quality of the evidence using GRADE indicated that the levels of evidence for all primary outcomes and one important secondary outcome were low to moderate due to wide confidence interval crossing the line of no effect with few events (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>One Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Stade-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stade 2008</LINK>) has evaluated the effectiveness of vaginal chlorhexidine during labour for preventing early-onset group B streptococcal infection in newborn infants. Although there was a significant reduction in group B streptococcal colonization in neonates, there were no significant reductions in early-onset group B streptococcal sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis and mortality. One randomized controlled trial, involving 8011 women and their 8129 newborns, evaluated the effectiveness of chlorhexidine intravaginally and neonatal wipes for preventing early-onset neonatal sepsis (<LINK REF="STD-Cutland-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cutland 2009</LINK>). There was no significant reductions in either early-onset neonatal sepsis nor colonization of group B streptococcal. Another trial, involving 5008 women and their neonates, reported that chlorhexidine vaginal wipes during labour together with neonatal chlorhexidine wipes did not prevent neonatal sepsis, maternal and perinatal mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Saleem-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Saleem 2010</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection and analysis</HEADING>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors will independently assess for inclusion all the potential studies we identify as a result of the search strategy. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third author.</P>
<P>We will create a study flow diagram to map out the number of records identified, included and excluded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>We will design a form to extract data. For eligible studies, at least two review authors will extract the data using the agreed form. We will resolve discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third author. We will enter data into Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) and check for accuracy.</P>
<P>When information regarding any of the above is unclear, we will attempt to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors will independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We will resolve any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We will assess the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and will assess whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will consider that studies are at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judge that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to affect results. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;</LI>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess methods used to blind outcome assessment as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We will state whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information is reported, or can be supplied by the trial authors, we will re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertake.</P>
<P>We will assess methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; &#8216;as treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomization);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by (1) to (5) above)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study any important concerns we have about other possible sources of bias.</P>
<P>We will assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of other bias;</LI>
<LI>high risk of other bias;</LI>
<LI>unclear whether there is risk of other bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We will make explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we will assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings. We will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see </I>Sensitivity analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we will present results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data, we will use the mean difference if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials. We will use the standardized mean difference to combine trials that measure the same outcome, but use different methods.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomized trials</HEADING>
<P>We will include cluster-randomized trials in the analyses along with individually-randomized trials. We will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> [Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6] using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomized trials and individually-randomized trials, we plan to synthesize the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomization unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomization unit and perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the randomization unit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>We determined that it was not possible to include cross-over trials in this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>For included studies, we will note levels of attrition. We will explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we will carry out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we will attempt to include all participants randomized to each group in the analyses, and all participants will be analyzed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial will be the number randomized minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be missing.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We will assess statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau², I² and Chi² statistics. We will regard heterogeneity as substantial if an I² is greater than 30% and either a Tau² is greater than zero, or there is a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity. 
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>If there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We will carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We will use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it is reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials are examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods are judged sufficiently similar. If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary will be treated as the average of the range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful, we will not combine trials.</P>
<P>If we use random-effects analyses, the results will be presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau² and I².</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We plan to carry out the following subgroup analyses for primary outcomes:</P>
<OL>
<LI>concentration of chlorhexidine (less than 0.4% versus 0.4% or higher);</LI>
<LI>volume of chlorhexidine solution (less than 200 mL versus 200 mL or more).</LI>
</OL>
<P>We will assess subgroup differences by interaction tests available within RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We will report the results of subgroup analyses quoting the Chi² statistic and P value, and the interaction test I² value.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We plan to perform sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of study quality relating to the 'Risk of bias' items including allocation concealment, incomplete data collection to assess for any substantive difference to the overall result. If cluster-randomized trials are included in the review, we aim to apply other sensitivity analysis incorporating an estimate of the ICC taken from a different study, to see what the effect of different values of the ICC on the results of the analysis would be.</P>
