<TITLE>Blood-clot promoting drugs for acute traumatic injury</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-04-22 00:15:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of an existing Cochrane review, the last version was published in 2012.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Injury is the second leading cause of death for people aged five to 45 years. Over four million people worldwide die of injuries every year, often because of extensive blood loss. Antifibrinolytic drugs promote blood clotting by preventing blood clots from breaking down. Some examples of antifibrinolytic drugs are aprotinin, tranexamic acid (TXA), epsilon-aminocaproic acid and aminomethylbenzoic acid. Doctors sometimes give these drugs to patients having surgery to prevent blood loss. These drugs might also stop blood loss in seriously injured patients and, as a result, save lives.</P>
<P>The authors of this review searched for randomised trials assessing the effects of antifibrinolytics in trauma patients.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence in this review is current to January 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found three randomised trials which met inclusion criteria and included well data from over 20,000 patients recruited in 40 countries.</P>
<P>Of these, one small trial (n = 77) looked at the effect of aprotinin in patients aged 12 and older who had suffered trauma involving broken bones and shock.</P>
<P>Two trials assessed the effect of TXA in patients aged 16 and over. The largest (n = 20,211) involved patients suffering from a variety of types of trauma, and the other (n = 240) only those who had suffered traumatic brain injury.</P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
</P>
<P>The trial assessing the effect of aprotinin was too small to provide reliable data.</P>
<P>Results for TXA suggest that, when given early, TXA reduces the risk of death compared to patients who do not receive TXA without increasing the risk of side effects.</P>
<P>However, there is still some uncertainty about the effect of TXA in patients who have bleeding inside the brain from a head injury, but are not bleeding from injuries elsewhere. It is possible that the effects of TXA are different in this specific patient group.</P>
<P>We have found two ongoing trials that are trying to answer this question.</P>
<P>The authors of this review conclude that TXA can safely reduce death in trauma patients with bleeding and should be given as soon as possible after injury. However, they cannot conclude whether or not TXA is also effective in patients with traumatic brain injury with no other trauma, until the ongoing trials have been completed.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Evidence for important outcomes including mortality, need for further surgery and blood transfusion, came from high-quality evidence, meaning we have confidence in the findings. There was moderate-quality evidence for important adverse events including vascular occlusive events (including heart attacks, deep vein thrombosis, stroke and pulmonary embolism).</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-04-10 11:42:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We ran the most recent search in January 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, The Cochrane Library, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), Embase Classic+Embase (OvidSP), PubMed and clinical trials registries.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-04-09 17:13:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Randomised controlled trials of antifibrinolytic agents (aprotinin, tranexamic acid [TXA], epsilon-aminocaproic acid and aminomethylbenzoic acid) following acute traumatic injury.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-04-09 17:23:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>From the results of the screened electronic searches, bibliographic searches, and contacts with experts, two authors independently selected trials meeting the inclusion criteria, and extracted data. One review author assessed the risk of bias for key domains.</P>
<P>Outcome measures included: mortality at end of follow-up (all-cause); adverse events (specifically vascular occlusive events [myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism] and renal failure); number of patients undergoing surgical intervention or receiving blood transfusion; volume of blood transfused; volume of intracranial bleeding; brain ischaemic lesions; death or disability.</P>
<P>We rated the quality of the evidence as 'high', 'moderate', 'low' or 'very low' according to the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-09 17:23:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Three trials met the inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Two trials (n = 20,451) assessed the effect of TXA. The larger of these (CRASH-2, n = 20,211) was conducted in 40 countries and included patients with a variety of types of trauma; the other (n = 240) restricted itself to those with traumatic brain injury (TBI) only.</P>
<P>One trial (n = 77) assessed aprotinin in participants with major bony trauma and shock.</P>
<P>The pooled data show that antifibrinolytic drugs reduce the risk of death from any cause by 10% (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.96; P = 0.002) (quality of evidence: high). This estimate is based primarily on data from the CRASH-2 trial of TXA, which contributed 99% of the data.</P>
<P>There is no evidence that antifibrinolytics have an effect on the risk of vascular occlusive events (quality of evidence: moderate), need for surgical intervention or receipt of blood transfusion (quality of evidence: high). There is no evidence for a difference in the effect by type of antifibrinolytic (TXA versus aprotinin) however, as the pooled analyses were based predominantly on trial data concerning the effects of TXA, the results can only be confidently applied to the effects of TXA. The effects of aprotinin in this patient group remain uncertain.</P>
<P>There is some evidence from pooling data from one study (n = 240) and a subset of data from CRASH-2 (n = 270) in patients with TBI which suggest that TXA may reduce mortality although the estimates are imprecise, the quality of evidence is low, and uncertainty remains. Stronger evidence exists for the possibility of TXA reducing intracranial bleeding in this population.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-04-09 17:23:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>TXA safely reduces mortality in trauma patients with bleeding without increasing the risk of adverse events.  TXA should be given as early as possible and within three hours of injury, as further analysis of the CRASH-2 trial showed that treatment later than this is unlikely to be effective and may be harmful. Although there is some promising evidence for the effect of TXA in patients with TBI, substantial uncertainty remains.</P>
<P>Two ongoing trials being conducted in patients with isolated TBI should resolve these remaining uncertainties.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-04-20 09:55:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-04-20 09:55:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For people aged five to 45 years, trauma is second only to HIV/AIDS as a cause of death. Each year, worldwide, about four million people die as a result of traumatic injuries and violence (<LINK REF="REF-GBD-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">GBD 2013</LINK>). Approximately 1.6 million of these deaths occur in hospital and about one third of these deaths (480,000) are from haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Ker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ker 2012</LINK>). Among trauma patients who do survive to reach hospital, exsanguination is a common cause of death, accounting for nearly half of in-hospital trauma deaths in some settings (<LINK REF="REF-Sauaia-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sauaia 1995</LINK>). Central nervous system injury and multi-organ failure account for most of the remainder, both of which can be exacerbated by severe bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-BTF-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTF 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clotting helps to maintain the integrity of the circulatory system after vascular injury, whether traumatic or surgical in origin (<LINK REF="REF-Lawson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawson 2004</LINK>). Major surgery and trauma trigger similar haemostatic responses and the consequent massive blood loss presents an extreme challenge to the coagulation system. Part of the response to surgery and trauma in any patient, is stimulation of clot breakdown (fibrinolysis) which may become pathological (hyper-fibrinolysis) in some cases. Antifibrinolytic agents have been shown to reduce blood loss in patients with both normal and exaggerated fibrinolytic responses to surgery, without apparently increasing the risk of post-operative complications.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-04-09 17:24:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Antifibrinolytic agents are widely used in major surgery to prevent fibrinolysis (lysis of a blood clot or thrombus) and reduce surgical blood loss.</P>
<P>Antifibrinolytic agents considered within this review include aprotinin, tranexamic acid (TXA), epsilon-aminocaproic acid and aminomethylbenzoic acid.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-04-02 17:45:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antifibrinolytic agents work by preventing blood clots from breaking down. The blood clots help to reduce excessive bleeding. Fewer people die from blood loss, or from there being too little blood in the circulatory system to keep the heart functioning normally.</P>
<P>Because the coagulation abnormalities that occur after injury are similar to those after surgery, it is possible that antifibrinolytic agents might also reduce blood loss and mortality following trauma.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-04-09 17:24:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>A simple and widely practicable intervention that reduced blood loss following trauma might prevent tens of thousands of premature deaths. A reduction in the need for transfusion would also have important public health implications. Blood is a scarce and expensive resource and major concerns remain about the risk of transfusion-transmitted infection. Trauma is particularly common in parts of the world where the safety of blood transfusion cannot be assured. A study in Uganda estimated the population-attributable fraction of HIV acquisition as a result of blood transfusion to be around two per cent (<LINK REF="REF-Kiwanuka-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiwanuka 2004</LINK>), although some estimates are much higher (<LINK REF="REF-Heymann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heymann 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 2011</LINK>) of randomised controlled trials of antifibrinolytics (mainly aprotinin or TXA) in elective surgical patients showed that antifibrinolytics reduced the numbers receiving transfusion by one third, reduced the volume needed per transfusion by one unit, and halved the need for further surgery to control bleeding. These differences were all statistically significant at the P &lt; 0.01 level. Specifically, aprotinin reduced the rate of blood transfusion by 34% (relative risk [RR] = 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60 to 0.72) and TXA by 39% (RR = 0.61; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.70). Aprotinin use saved 1.02 units of red blood cells (RBCs) (95% CI 0.79 to 1.26) in those requiring transfusion, and TXA use saved 0.87 units (95% CI 0.53 to 1.20). There was a non-significant reduction in mortality with both aprotinin (RR = 0.81; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.06) and TXA (RR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.33 to 1.10).</P>
<P>This review is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Coats-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coats 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2004</LINK>) and was updated in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The review considers a different population group (trauma patients only) than the review conducted by Henry et al described above.</P>
<P>In the 2012 update, we concluded that TXA safely reduces mortality in bleeding trauma patients without increasing the risk of adverse events; and that it should be given as early as possible and within three hours of injury, as treatment later than this is unlikely to be effective.</P>
<P>Trauma is one of the leading causes of injury and death worldwide. This review will continue to be updated since antifibrinolytic agents are being given to patients and it is important that patients are given treatments based on current research evidence, and to respond to methodological advances in the analysis of evidence identified previously. The review will be updated again in the future as new research is published.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-22 00:15:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. One trial of aprotinin was too small to provide reliable evidence. The conclusions of this review, therefore, concern the effect of tranexamic acid (TXA) and are based primarily on the results of the <LINK REF="STD-CRASH_x002d_2-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CRASH-2 2010</LINK> trial which contributes &gt; 98% of the evidence.</P>
<P>The results shows that TXA reduces all-cause mortality and death due to bleeding in trauma patients, with no apparent increase in the risk of vascular occlusive events. Although not a prespecified subgroup analysis of this review, subsequent analysis of the trial data (<LINK REF="REF-CRASH_x002d_2-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRASH-2 2011</LINK>) shows that TXA should be given as early as possible and within three hours of injury, as treatment later than this is unlikely to be effective and may be harmful.</P>
<P>Data from two trials, one of which was a substudy of the <LINK REF="STD-CRASH_x002d_2-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CRASH-2 2010</LINK>, suggest that there is some evidence that TXA reduces the risk of death in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), however, the estimate is imprecise and is compatible with the play of chance.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-04-20 09:53:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The large numbers of patients in a wide range of different healthcare settings around the world studied in the <LINK REF="STD-CRASH_x002d_2-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CRASH-2 2010</LINK> trial help the result to be widely generalised. The treatment is effective in patients with blunt and penetrating trauma. Because TXA is inexpensive and easy to administer, it could readily be added to the normal medical and surgical management of trauma patients with bleeding in hospitals around the world (<LINK REF="REF-Guerriero-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guerriero 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Each year, worldwide, about four million people die as a result of traumatic injuries and violence (<LINK REF="REF-GBD-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">GBD 2013</LINK>).  Approximately 1.6 million of these deaths occur in hospital and about one third of these deaths (480,000) are from haemorrhage. The <LINK REF="STD-CRASH_x002d_2-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CRASH-2 2010</LINK> trial has shown that TXA reduces mortality from haemorrhage by about one sixth. If this widely practicable intervention was used worldwide in the treatment of trauma patients with bleeding, it could prevent over 100,000 deaths each year (<LINK REF="REF-Ker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ker 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many trauma patients suffer a brain injury. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is commonly accompanied by intracranial bleeding which can develop or worsen after hospital admission. Traumatic intracranial haemorrhage is associated with an increased risk of death and disability, and regardless of location, haemorrhage size is strongly correlated with outcome. If TXA reduced intracranial bleeding after isolated TBI then this could improve patient outcomes. Although, many of the trauma patients with bleeding included in the <LINK REF="STD-CRASH_x002d_2-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CRASH-2 2010</LINK> trial also suffered a brain injury, it is possible that the effects of TXA may differ in patients with isolated TBI. The results of the <LINK REF="STD-CRASH_x002d_2-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CRASH-2 2010</LINK> TBI substudy and the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Yutthakasemsunt-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Yutthakasemsunt 2013</LINK> provides some promising evidence for the beneficial effect of TXA mortality in patients with TBI. However, the confidence interval is very wide and considering the small size of the trials this could easily be a chance finding. If TXA reduced the risk of death by 15% (RR = 0.85), the same relative risk reduction that was observed for death due to bleeding in the <LINK REF="STD-CRASH_x002d_2-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CRASH-2 2010</LINK>, then about 10,000 patients with TBI would need to be included in clinical trials to have 90% power to detect a relative risk reduction of this magnitude. This suggests that although our pooled estimate for mortality is statistically significant, this could easily be a false positive result. The two ongoing trials (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01402882" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01402882</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01990768" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01990768</LINK>) with a combined sample size of 11,002, should therefore be able to reliably determine the effect of TXA in this patient population.</P>

<P>The quality of the evidence supporting the use of TXA for extracranial trauma is high. The findings of this review are based primarily on the results of the <LINK REF="STD-CRASH_x002d_2-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CRASH-2 2010</LINK> trial. This was a large, high quality randomised trial with low risk of bias. Sequence generation was appropriately randomised, allocation was concealed, and participants, trial personnel and outcome assessors were all blinded. Furthermore, there were minimal missing data with over 99% of patients followed up. </P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-03-04 16:26:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A systematic review of randomised trials assessing the effects of TXA in patients undergoing elective surgery has been conducted (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 2011</LINK>). This review found that compared to control, TXA reduced the need for blood transfusion without any apparent increase in the risk of adverse events. Unlike the <LINK REF="REF-Henry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 2011</LINK> review, we found no evidence of any substantial reduction in the receipt of a blood transfusion or the amount of blood transfused in trauma patients. One possible explanation is that in the <LINK REF="STD-CRASH_x002d_2-2010" TYPE="STUDY">CRASH-2 2010</LINK> trial, following the loading dose, TXA was infused over a period of eight hours, whereas decisions about transfusion are made very soon after hospital admission. The absence of any large effect on blood transfusion may also reflect the difficulty of accurately estimating blood loss in trauma patients when assessing the need for transfusion. Finally, the absence of any substantial reduction in transfusion requirements in patients treated with TXA may reflect the fact that there were fewer deaths in patients allocated to TXA acid than to placebo and patients who survive as a result of TXA administration would have had a greater opportunity to receive a blood transfusion (competing risks).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-04-09 17:31:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Tranexamic acid (TXA) safely reduces mortality in trauma patients with bleeding. As there is evidence that the effect on death due to bleeding depends on the time interval between the injury and treatment, TXA should be given as early as possible and within three hours of the injury as treatment later than this is unlikely to be effective and may be harmful.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-01-14 14:40:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The knowledge that TXA safely reduces the risk of death from traumatic bleeding raises the possibility that it might also be effective in other situations where bleeding can be life threatening or disabling and further research is warranted to explore this potential. Randomised trials involving patients with isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) that assess both mortality and disability outcomes are required before TXA can be recommended for use in these patients. The ongoing <LINK REF="STD-NCT01402882" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01402882</LINK> trial with a planned sample size of 10,000 patients with TBI and the planned trial of prehospital TXA in TBI (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01990768" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01990768</LINK>), will contribute to resolving the uncertainty about the effects of TXA in this group.</P>
