</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Research suggests adherence to treatment recommendations is low. In type 2 diabetes, which is a chronic condition slowly leading to serious vascular, nephrologic, neurologic and ophthalmological complications, it can be assumed that enhancing adherence to treatment recommendations may lead to a reduction of complications. Treatment regimens in type 2 diabetes are complicated, encompassing life-style adaptations and medication intake. <BR/> </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of interventions for improving adherence to treatment recommendations in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. <BR/> </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Studies were obtained from searches of multiple electronic bibliographic databases supplemented with hand searches of references. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled and controlled clinical trials, before-after studies and epidemiological studies, assessing changes in adherence to treatment recommendations, as defined in the objectives section, were included.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two teams of reviewers independently assessed the trials identified for inclusion. Three teams of two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data. The analysis for the narrative part was performed by one reviewer (EV), the meta-analysis by two reviewers (EV, JW). </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-one studies assessing interventions aiming at improving adherence to treatment recommendations, not to diet or exercise recommendations, in people living with type 2 diabetes in primary care, outpatient settings, community and hospital settings, were included. Outcomes evaluated in these studies were heterogeneous, there was a variety of adherence measurement instruments. Nurse led interventions, home aids, diabetes education, pharmacy led interventions, adaptation of dosing and frequency of medication taking showed a small effect on a variety of outcomes including HbA1c. No data on mortality and morbidity, nor on quality of life could be found.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Current efforts to improve or to facilitate adherence of people with type 2 diabetes to treatment recommendations do not show significant effects nor harms. The question whether any intervention enhances adherence to treatment recommendations in type 2 diabetes effectively, thus still remains unanswered. </P>

<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (see 'About', 'Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs)'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main glossary in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<P>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic diseases. The number of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus is continuously increasing worldwide. Six percent of the population of the world suffers from this disease, and only half of them have been diagnosed (<LINK REF="REF-Amos-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amos 1997</LINK>). Strict metabolic control (for micro-vascular related outcomes) and blood pressure control (for micro- and macrovascular related outcomes) seem to be of importance in order to prevent vascular complications: macro- and micro-vascular disease being the most substantial diabetes-related causes of morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Kinmonth-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinmonth 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-33-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 33 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-34-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 34 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-34-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 34 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-38-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 38 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vermeire-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermeire 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wens-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wens 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The potential benefits of any adequate treatment though are not similar for all cases. The risk of micro-vascular complications increases with the plasma glucose concentration and the duration of diabetes, while the risk of macro-vascular disease depends on age, gender, genetic factors, and life-style (for example nutrition, exercise, smoking), as well as hyperglycaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Goyder-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goyder 1998</LINK>). Once diabetes has been diagnosed, diabetes patients are confronted with the need for life-style adaptation, for example, weight reduction, adapted nutrition and more exercise. A treatment with oral hypoglycaemic agents or insulin is often unavoidable. In order to reduce diabetes-related complications, blood pressure and blood lipids control as well as foot care are necessary. All this requires a substantial degree of treatment adherence from patients. Patient compliance or patient adherence to treatment has been acknowledged, irrespective of the type of disease, to be a major problem in health care, involving consumers and health care providers equally. Not one in two patients adheres to treatment to health care recommendations as proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Vermeire-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermeire 2001</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Low compliance</HEADING>
<P>Low compliance to prescribed medical interventions is an ever present and complex problem, especially for patients with a chronic illness. With increasing numbers of medications and other medical interventions shown to do more good than harm when taken or implemented as prescribed, low compliance is a major problem in health care. Three decades have passed since the start of compliance research. The enormous amount of quantitative research undertaken is of variable methodological quality, with no gold standard for the measurement of compliance and it is often not clear which type of non-compliance is being studied. Medical non-compliance imposes a considerable financial burden upon modern health care systems. This burden is estimated to be 100 billion dollars each year in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Donovan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donovan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Donovan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donovan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morris-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1992</LINK>). Compliance to treatment is a key link between process and outcome in medical care. Therefore poor compliance may have a major impact on clinical outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">From compliance to concordance</HEADING>
<P>Compliance is a word with negative connotations. It suggests yielding and submission to prescriptions of doctors. In the context of health care, compliance has been defined as the extent to which a person's behaviour in terms of taking medication, following diets, or executing life-style changes coincided with medical or health advice. Compliance can also be viewed in terms of the results of taking medication: the number of doses not taken or taken incorrectly that jeopardize the therapeutic outcome or the point below which the desired therapeutic result is unlikely to be achieved. These are process-oriented definitions. Outcome-oriented definitions differ from them because the emphasis is on the end-result.</P>
<P>The process of seeking, receiving and following treatment and advice has many stages and many opportunities for non-compliance. Different types of non-compliance include: delay in seeking care, non-participation in health programmes, breaking of appointments and failure to follow doctors' advice. Other types can be distinguished: receiving a prescription, but not having it picked up at a pharmacy, taking an incorrect dose, taking the medication at wrong times, forgetting one or more doses of the medication or stopping the treatment too soon. Furthermore, compliance may be intentional or unintentional. There is something morally and psychologically flawed in the very concept of compliance. Perhaps non-compliance may be no more deviant than compliance. Non-compliance can be defined as a person's informed decision not to adhere to a therapeutic treatment. The backbone of the concordance model is the patient as a decision maker, and a cornerstone is professional empathy. Concordance indicates the extent to which what the patient thinks about what is asked from him matches what the health care-giver thinks the patient actually does. The term adherence has been proposed as an alternative to compliance and is growing in popularity. It is suggested that this term incorporates the broader notions of concordance, cooperation and partnership.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Compliance research</HEADING>
<P>The lack of a valid method for measuring compliance has itself been a major barrier to compliance research. There are a number of traditional measures of patients' compliance in taking medication, including both direct and indirect measures. Direct measures involve the detection of a chemical in a body fluid. However, these are not available for all medications. In addition, they may not account for the variability of pharmacokinetic factors of medications and individuals. Direct observation is only possible in restricted situations. Indirect measures are more frequently used. They include process measures such as interviews, diaries, tablet counts, electronic devices, prescription filling dates and therapeutic and preventive outcome measures. Each of these has drawbacks. Patients can improve for reasons other than following the prescribed regimen and a person's condition can deteriorate or remain stable even when the medications are taken as prescribed.</P>
<P>To date, none of the suggested explanations of compliance or non-compliance has accounted for more than a modest part of the observed variation in compliance. Almost 200 different doctor-, patient- and encounter-related variables have been studied but none of them has been found to be consistently related to compliance or to be fully predictive. Researchers designing clinical trials to evaluate a medical therapy may do so under two different settings: (i) under ideal experimental circumstances with treatments taken in the manner prescribed, or (ii) under the circumstances pertaining to usual medical practice. However, a true difference in efficacy may be diluted by differential compliance between treatment groups. The difficulty in measuring compliance hinders attempts to evaluate methods for enhancing compliance. Methods that have been investigated include short-term regimens, fewer doses per day, lower medication costs, easy-to-use packaging, reminders, tailoring information for the individual patient, patient education, and patient satisfaction measurement. It is also important to assess the impact of side-effects on compliance to that particular treatment. Non-compliance with scheduled appointments may also have important effects on health outcomes. In order to enhance this type of compliance, different patient-related, medical-encounter-related and care delivery system interventions have been assessed. Because one of the most commonly advocated ways to enhance compliance is the improvement of the doctor-patient relationship, different aspects have been highlighted and assessed (<LINK REF="REF-Vermeire-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermeire 2001</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Other issues that have to be addressed are self-management and self-care. These terms focus on the fact that the patient himself takes care of a series of aspects of the medical treatment, in this case of the diabetes treatment. These can be, for example, the self-monitoring of blood glucose and the adaptation of medication dosage to self-measured glucose levels.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Enhancing adherence</HEADING>
<P>On the theme of adherence-enhancing interventions there exist two systematic reviews. One (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1997</LINK>) summarises the results of randomised controlled trials of interventions to help patients follow prescriptions for medication, focusing on those trials that measured both adherence and intervention outcomes. The authors' conclusion is that although adherence and treatment outcomes can be improved by certain - usually complex - interventions, full benefits of medication cannot be realised at currently achievable levels of adherence. No study on diabetes was included. The second systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Roter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roter 1998</LINK>) assesses the effectiveness of interventions, educational, behavioural and affective categories, to improve patient compliance with medical regimens and concludes that no simple strategy or programmatic focus showed any clear advantage with another. Comprehensive interventions combining different of the studied components were more effective than single-focus interventions. There is also a Cochrane protocol on adherence to medication for controlling blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 2002</LINK>). With respect to diabetes, two Cochrane Review protocols plan the assessment of the effect of exercise, psychological and lifestyle interventions on the development of future diabetic complications (<LINK REF="REF-Boul_x00e9_-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulé 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ismail-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ismail 2001</LINK>). A recent review (<LINK REF="REF-Renders-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renders 2001</LINK>) concludes that multifaceted professional interventions can enhance the performance of health professionals in managing patients with diabetes. Organisational interventions that improve regular prompted recall and review of patients can also improve diabetes management. The addition of patient-oriented education, can lead to improved patient health outcomes.</P>
<P>Abundant research has pointed at low patient adherence with treatment and life-style recommendations especially in the case of chronic diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Vermeire-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermeire 2001</LINK>). The management of diabetes is a complex, lifelong process requiring a great deal of effort on the part of the patient. The patient, more than any health care provider, is the key to successful management. Poor management can result in a number of serious complications. Therefore, non-adherence with therapeutic regimens among diabetes patients has been a continuing problem for health care providers (<LINK REF="REF-Nagasawa-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagasawa 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vermeire-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermeire 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment goals</HEADING>
<P>The screening for diabetes, the strict treatment, the follow-up, the self-care and the self-management, and also the efforts to enhance adherence to treatment are to be considered equally important interventions, with the aim of preventing micro- and macro-vascular complications and hence to improve the diabetes patients' quality of life.<BR/>

<P>To determine the studies to be assessed, two teams of independent researchers (EV and JW, PVR and YB) reviewed the titles, abstract sections and keywords of every record retrieved using a score list. The study was included if the information given suggested that the study:</P>
<UL>
<LI>included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus;</LI>

<P>If there was any doubt regarding these criteria from the information given in the title and abstract, or if the abstract was absent or not clear enough to draw conclusions, the full article was retrieved for clarification. Studies were eliminated if both reviewers agreed that the study did not meet the criteria for considering studies for the review. Inter-rater agreement was calculated using Cohen's kappa (<LINK REF="REF-Fleiss-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleiss 1981</LINK>) (kappa &gt;0.7 (good agreement), between &gt;0.5 and &lt;0.7 (moderate agreement) and &lt;0.5 (bad agreement)).

Differences in data extraction at item level were resolved by discussion and if consensus could not be reached, a referee (PVR) took a final decision.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-10-28 12:28:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The risk of bias of included studies was assessed independently by three teams of two reviewers (EV and JW, PVR and YB, HH and AL).</P>
<P>To keep up with this process of including and excluding studies a minute description was kept in a log-book. This resulted in a tree structure representation of this process (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Observational studies are more prone to bias and confounding than experimental trials. Therefore, the methodological evaluation of observational research is not clear cut (<LINK REF="REF-Friedenreich-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedenreich 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laupacis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laupacis 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levine-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levine 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoup-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoup 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>A set of criteria has been defined for case-control and cohort study designs (<LINK REF="REF-Borhouts-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borhouts 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harris-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Offringa-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Offringa 2000</LINK>). Based on these criteria a 3-category rating of 'good,' 'fair,' and 'poor' was applied. In general, a good study is one that meets all criteria well. A fair study is one that does not meet (or it is not clear that it meets) at least one criterion but that has no important limitation that could invalidate its results. A poor study has important limitations. These specifications are not meant to be rigid rules but rather are intended to be general guidelines, and individual exceptions, when explicitly explained and justified, can be made.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-07-03 12:07:46 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We dealt with clinical and methodological heterogeneity to answer the question whether the combination of the different studies was meaningful.</P>
<P>Statistical heterogeneity was estimated by the visual appraisal of the forest plots. Heterogeneity was also tested by using the Z score and the Chi square statistic with significance set at P &lt; 0.1. Statistical homogeneity was assessed using the I² test where I² values over 50% indicate moderate to high heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If there was significant heterogeneity we had to decide whether the combination of the data was appropriate. If heterogeneity was important, more emphasis should be placed on the results of a random effects model, although use of this model does not overcome the problem of heterogeneity. Another way to handle this issue was to explore possible sources of heterogeneity by subgroup and sensitivity analyses or by employing meta-regression.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-07-01 11:21:40 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If there was a reasonable number of studies, a funnel plot would have been drawn to examine the possibility of small study bias. A funnel plot is a graphical display of sample size plotted against effect size. A gap on one side of the wide part of the funnel indicates that some studies have not been published or located or that another type of small study bias has arisen (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because the name 'funnel plot' is based on the fact that the precision in the estimation of the underlying treatment effect will increase as the sample size of component studies increases, effect estimates from small studies will therefore scatter more widely at the bottom of the graph, with the spread narrowing among larger studies. In the absence of bias, the plot will resemble a symmetrical inverted funnel (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2001</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-10-19 17:06:38 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>We undertook a descriptive review of all studies. Data would have been summarised statistically if they were available, of sufficient quality and sufficiently similar. We only would have pooled the effect size of trials with comparable interventions. If not, qualitative synthesis was performed.</P>
<P>We expected both event (dichotomous) data and continuous data. Dichotomous data would have been be expressed as odds ratios (OR). The relative risk (RR) would have been used as an alternative to the OR as interpretation is easier, especially if the outcome is a negative event.

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-10-19 17:10:09 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The search resulted in 4,665 abstracts. EMBASE contributed 2,640 articles, MEDLINE 1,684, and 341 other studies were added by searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the National Library of Medicine Gateway and Sociological Abstracts (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Internet search engines identified hundreds of hits that were informative on the subject, but not useful for the purpose of this review. On initial abstract review, the first apparent reason for exclusion was not meeting the most important inclusion criterion: only studies that assessed interventions aimed at improving the adherence to medical treatment recommendations were accepted. In a large number of studies the precise aim of the study appeared not to be explained clearly at all by the authors. Moreover, in a majority of articles, although adherence was mentioned to be the topic of interest, diabetes care in general or self-care in particular were the core issues of the research reported on. This forced reviewers to careful consideration and led consequently to interrater agreements that improved, and were more consistent, as the selection process went on. Indeed, in many studies interventions aimed at influencing some aspects of diabetes care were, mistakenly and even misleadingly, called enhancing adherence concomitantly.</P>
<P>One team of reviewers (PVR and YB) assessed MEDLINE searches and then other team (EV and JW) assessed EMBASE and the other search results. For the purpose of the inclusion, quality assessment and data-extraction of studies an electronic grid was used. It was adapted from a grid originally designed by the Cochrane Metabolic Diseases and Endocrine Disorders Collaborative Review Group.</P>
<P>The interobserver agreement of the first team (PVR and YB) expressed as a kappa was 0.54 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.70), that of the second team (EV and JW) 0.83 (95% CI: 0.76 to 0.89). We identified 74 studies from which in a final round with the full text at hand 52 were excluded, and another one at the time of the analysis. The main reason for their exclusion was that, though authors mentioned in the abstract that the study was about adherence to medical treatment recommendations in type 2 diabetes, no adherence enhancing intervention was performed nor were changes in adherence to treatment recommendation measured properly.</P>
<P>Of the 21 included articles 13 were found in EMBASE, 12 in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> and eight in MEDLINE. Four studies were retrieved in EMBASE alone, seven only in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> and three uniquely in MEDLINE. Two articles were found in EMBASE, as well as in MEDLINE and in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>

<BR/>'Nurse interventions' </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mease-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mease 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piette-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Piette 2001</LINK>) compared nurse-led interventions, mostly a telephone follow-up, with usual care. In these studies a variety of outcomes were evaluated, but unfortunately they were heterogenous in the different studies: HbA1c, weight, diabetes related symptoms, appointment keeping, changes in medication taking, changes in uses of preventive services, and self-care behaviour.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>'Home aides'</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Hopper-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hopper 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1986</LINK>) are mailed educational materials, appointment reminders or home health aides visits versus usual care, evaluating appointment keeping, prescription refill, screening percentage, eye clinic attendance and negative utilisation of services (emergency room visit, missed scheduled visits).<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>'Diabetes education programmes'</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Bradshaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bradshaw 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Krier 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-1986" TYPE="STUDY">White 1986</LINK>) assessed the effect of a variety of education programmes on HbA1c, different metabolic parameters, blood pressure and self-reported compliance.<BR/>

<P>Besides these created categories there remain four <I>solitary comparisons</I>: standard consultation versus a patient participation programme (<LINK REF="STD-Rachmani-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rachmani 2002</LINK>), oral chlorpropamide intake versus insulin injections (<LINK REF="STD-Diehl-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Diehl 1985</LINK>), fundus photography shown and explained versus not shown nor explained (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenkranz-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenkranz 1996</LINK>), and finally a nurse-led education and counseling intervention on smoking cessation (<LINK REF="STD-Canga-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Canga 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>We pooled the studies assessing educational interventions: those facilitating adherence (<LINK REF="STD-Krier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Krier 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piette-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Piette 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rachmani-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rachmani 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simmons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Simmons 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-1986" TYPE="STUDY">White 1986</LINK>) and those offering diabetes education (<LINK REF="STD-Coast_x002d_Senior-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Coast-Senior 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1999</LINK>) versus usual care or a control. In all these studies HbA1c was a common outcome measure.</P>
<P>The results of the 21 included studies are reported narratively, though some of the comparisons fit for the calculation of pooled weighted mean differences. Because within each of these trials methods, patients and many other characteristics are unlikely to be identical, as would be implied by the use of a fixed effect meta-analysis model, a random effects model was used. The educational intervention trials were pooled. The studies offering diabetes education with outcome measure HbA1c could not be used in a meta-analysis because these studies were controlled before and after trials.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Nurse led interventions</HEADING>
<P>The comparison of the effectiveness of education classes plus weekly nurse telemedicine 'home visit' versus usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Mease-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mease 2000</LINK>) , over a period of three months, shows a statistically significant reduction in mean HbA1c level of 0.4%. The mean weight reduction is limited to a non significant 4%. Furthermore there were no significant changes on a Diabetes Quality of Life scale nor on the Medical Outcome Health Survey SF-36 scale. Some metabolic parameters such as microalbuminuria, serum creatinine and serum lipids did not improve during the study period. Physicians and case managers considered telemedicine to have a high benefit, but technological problems were a major obstacle.</P>
<P>A 12 months telephone nurse-led follow-up intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Piette-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Piette 2001</LINK>) in which a nurse called patients weekly to talk about self-care, medication adherence and symptoms, showed a small but statistically significant (P = 0.04) lowering of HbA1c. Moreover patients in the intervention group reported fewer (-10%) diabetes related symptoms, while these increased with the same proportion in the control group.</P>
<P>Another 12 months telephone calls programme (<LINK REF="STD-Clarke-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Clarke 2002</LINK>) focused on improving participants' understanding of their disease and the crucial importance of adhering to standards of care while providing support in helping patients to change their behaviour and lifestyle. Authors assessed subjective reports of adherence and measured utilisation of medical services. There were no differences in the mean change score of medicine taking, of taking recommended medical tests nor in the use of preventive health services. Patients in the intervention group had more frequently testing of HbA1c, low density lipoproteins, microalbuminuria and diabetic retinopathy.</P>

<P>Appointment keeping and prescription refills were the outcome measures of a 12 months' study of the effectiveness of mailed packets (physician phone numbers, visiting hours, list of early warning signs), a booklet on management of diabetes, appointment reminders, accompanied by an intense follow-up of visit failures versus usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1986</LINK>). After one year the intervention group averaged 12% more total contacts than the control group (5.8 versus 5.2, P = 0.01), due largely to an increase in kept scheduled visits (4.1 versus 3.6, P = 0.006). Visit failures were mainly reduced in high-risk patients and those patients at higher risk of hospitalisation. The effect of the intervention did not diminish during the year of the study.</P>
<P>The impact of home health aides visits on diabetic control and health care utilisation was assessed on fasting blood glucose, eye clinic attendance and negative utilisation of medical services (<LINK REF="STD-Hopper-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hopper 1984</LINK>). Fasting blood glucose declined when compared to control group (10.1 mg/dl versus an increase of 5.1 mg/ dl). Missed clinic appointments and attendance of emergency room decreased slightly in the intervention group, and eye clinic attendance increased significantly ((1.3 versus 0.7, representing a change of 0.4 (95%CI 0.1 to 0.7) versus -0.02 (95%CI -0.3 to 0.3)).</P>

<P>A nine months study comparing quarterly visits of a diabetes educator versus usual care, assessed changes in HbA1c, weight and self-reported medical compliance on a 4-point Lickert scale (<LINK REF="STD-Krier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Krier 1999</LINK>). Neither group showed any statistical significant change in their HbA1c. Weight increased in both intervention and control groups. There was a small increase in self-reported medical compliance in both intervention and control groups.</P>
<P>Another RCT compared group management with an advice-educational technique on its effect on HbA1c (<LINK REF="STD-White-1986" TYPE="STUDY">White 1986</LINK>). There was a 10% decline in HbA1c levels (P &lt; 0.05) in the first three months of the study in both groups, However, little change occurred during the final three months of the study.</P>
<P>The effect of a five-section education program during four months was compared to a basic course, and evaluated by measurement of fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure and body weight (<LINK REF="STD-Jiang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 1999</LINK>). In both experimental and control groups the decline in HbA1c levels was statistically significant (9.4% to 8.7%, versus 9.3% to 9.0%). In the experimental group the decline in systolic blood pressure and body weight was statistically significant.</P>
<P>The effect of three structured educational programs (traditional, video, educator) assessed HbA1c, weight and mean change in levels of knowledge (<LINK REF="STD-Bradshaw-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bradshaw 1999</LINK>). The authors indicate that there was no effect on the levels of HbA1c or weight, but data are missing.

<P>During a four months intervention comparing adherence data from a medication event monitoring system (MEMS) with pill counts in assisting pharmacists in making recommendations regarding diabetes therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Matsuyama-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Matsuyama 1993</LINK>) did not show any significant change in metabolic control. There were no significant changes in non-adherence in both groups. In the MEMS group, 47% of the recommendations regarding diabetes therapy made by pharmacists were related to patient education compared to 12% in the control group.</P>
<P>In a four month period, a comprehensive pharmacist care model was compared to usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Jaber-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 1996</LINK>). Patients in the intervention group were offered diabetes education, medication counseling, and evaluation plus adjustment of their hypoglycaemic regimen. Significant improvement of HbA1c levels was obtained (P = 0.003) in the intervention group. No significant changes in blood pressure control, lipid profile, renal function parameters, weight, or quality of life measures was noted between groups.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of mailed prescription-refill reminders, specialised packaging, or a combination was assessed versus usual care in a one year study on the medication possession ratio (number of days' supply of medication obtained throughout 360 days of the trial) (<LINK REF="STD-Skaer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Skaer 1993</LINK>). Patients receiving mailed prescription-refill reminders, unit-of-use packaging, or a combination of both interventions achieved a significant (P &lt; 0.05) increase in the medication possession rate for sulphonylurea therapy relative to controls. No significant difference was discerned between groups receiving reminders or special packaging. Patients receiving both interventions experienced a significant decrease in the use of physician, laboratory and hospital services reaching 68 US dollars decrease per capita compared to the 3-month time frame prior to the study. In the experimental group however, much more hypoglycaemic episodes occurred than in the control group (17 versus 2). The authors indicate that the systolic blood pressure improved, but the article does not allow to discern whether within or between group data are presented. HbA1c declined within and between groups. There was a higher decline in persons with a higher start level. There were no changes in body weight, serum lipids and renal function between or within groups. There were no data on self-reported adherence to medication. There were also no changes in scores on validated Health Status and quality of life questionnaires.</P>
<P>The effect of a one year pharmacist treatment adjustments versus standard physician led care on HbA1c, appointment keeping, eye examination and refusal to make recommended medication adjustments was studied (<LINK REF="STD-Davidson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Davidson 2000</LINK>). The HbA1c levels fell significantly (-0.8% versus -0.05%) in the intervention group more than in the control group (P = 0.03). In this study compared groups were not clearly defined and there are no data on losses to follow-up.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of pharmacists initiating insulin treatment on HbA1c was evaluated after one year (<LINK REF="STD-Coast_x002d_Senior-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Coast-Senior 1998</LINK>). HbA1c levels decreased by 22% (P &lt; 0.05). On the contrary symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in 35% of patients.</P>

Adherence to treatment was evaluated as the percentage of expected tablets or insulin used. There were no differences in adherence with the two medications in terms of percent of prescription used, proportion taking at least 80% of prescribed medication, self-report of medication or diet compliance, or protocol dropout rates.

Inadequate compliance was defined as either interview evidence of having missed some study tablets, a value for compliance by tablet count less than 85%, or a phenobarbital level dose ratio less than 85%. Mean compliance for once daily dosing was significantly higher than for twice a day (P &lt; 0.05) or three times a day (P &lt; 0.05).</P>
<P>HbA1c and blood pressure were evaluated after four and eight months in patients receiving calendar blister pack compared to the usual delivery of tablets (<LINK REF="STD-Simmons-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Simmons 2000</LINK>). HbA1c was reduced by 0.95 ±0.22% in the calendar group and 0.15 ±0.25% in the control group (P = 0.026).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-03 12:08:36 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this review was to identify effective interventions or strategies to enhance adherence to treatment recommendations in people with type 2 diabetes in primary care, outpatient settings, community and hospital settings.<BR/>
<BR/>A large number of studies was identified, but only 21 articles were included in the review. This is mainly due to the fact that though many authors stated that their study was about compliance or adherence the core issue was self-care or some aspect of diabetes management. Many authors do not feel the need to define adherence, nor do they discuss in which way and to what extent the outcome measures used really reflect adherence! Only a few articles measured adherence directly or indirectly using questionnaires. For these reasons we had to adapt one of the inclusion criteria from 'assessment of an intervention to enhance adherence' in 'assessment of an intervention aimed at improving adherence'. Many studies seem to report on 'black box" research: doing an intervention and measuring HbA1c at the end of the study period. In many studies it remains unclear what really happened in those participants, what made metabolic parameters change or what made them remain unchanged? Besides, what way does adherence play a role if an outcome changes?<BR/>Therefore it was not an easy task for the reviewers to decide on inclusion or exclusion. Moreover, this process was very time consuming.</P>
<P>The studies included in the review are heterogeneous in terms of interventions, participants, settings, countries and outcomes. The majority of studies used a set of outcome measures which do not lead to consistent and homogeneous results. Even interventions aimed at improving diabetes care in general do not result in homogeneous results for different aspects. It is clear that a rather 'simple' intervention as a diabetes education programme is not able do have consistent and homogeneous effects in a complex disease, as is the case for diabetes mellitus. It is indeed imaginable to conclude that an effective adherence enhancing intervention does not lead to satisfactory declining HbA1c values. Diabetes management is indeed much more than taking medication alone. Moreover, an effective intervention may lower some metabolic parameters, without affecting other parameters such as weight, blood pressure or renal function. Indeed, did UKPDS not confront researchers first with the paradox that tight glycaemic control induced an increase in HbA1c values and second with the conclusion that tight blood pressure control was more effective than tight glycaemic control in hypertensive diabetic persons in reducing diabetes related morbidity and mortality? Therefore, there is a need for better research discerning between adherence enhancing strategies and their effect on diabetes related outcomes.</P>
<P>The methodological quality was often limited. Besides the criteria for quality that are presented in the table with the characteristics of included studies, more remarks can be made. The most important question remains that of the validity of the studies because of low numbers of participants, lack of power calculations, poor or absent definition of adherence and the assumption that metabolic parameters such as HbA1c adequately reflect adherence. Moreover, regarding the educational interventions concerned, these were so poorly described that it was not possible to discern differences or similarities between programmes.<BR/>In a majority of articles the quality of the reporting in the written articles was incomplete and inaccurate such as missing data, incomplete figures or tables and the absence of confidence intervals or standard deviations.</P>
<P>Therefore, it is difficult to draw general conclusions from this review. In general most results float around the zero line, which may be interpreted by saying that there are no effective interventions or, by saying that the quality of the research was so poor that it was not able to reveal any significant effect. HbA1c declined slightly in most of the studies, furthermore positive effects could be noted on appointment keeping, eye clinic attendance, improved knowledge of diabetes, and prescription refill adherence. Once daily dosing appeared to be effective in increasing oral medication intake.</P>
<P>Our conclusions on the effectiveness of educational interventions on metabolic control are concordant with those of a UK Health Technology Assessment systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Loveman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loveman 2003</LINK>). These authors conclude that education as part of intensification of treatment produces improvement in diabetic control in type 1 diabetes. In type 2 diabetes they find mixed results which means that no clear classification is possible as to what features of education may be beneficial. A diversity of educational programmes did not yield consistent results on measures of metabolic control, with studies of lower quality producing significant effects. Economic evaluations comparing education with usual care or other educational interventions in type 2 diabetes mellitus were not identified. A recent review on dietary advice was not able to find any effectivity, though the adoption of exercise appeared to improve glycated haemoglobin at six and twelve months (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2004</LINK>). Psychological interventions showed improvements in long-term glycaemic control but not in weight control or blood glucose concentration. The pooled mean difference in HbA1c was -0.3 (95% CI -0.6 to 0.1) (<LINK REF="REF-Ismail-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ismail 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review illustrates the necessity that all relevant databases should be consulted. MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register contributed almost equally to the included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Wens-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wens 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The majority of the authors drew positive conclusions while presenting statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups. In contrast, it is crucial to notice that those results were probably not very clinically relevant.</P>
<P>Because almost all HbA1c values floated around the zero line we decided not to perform sensitivity analyses in order to explore the influence on a number of factors on the overall effect size.</P>
<P>The problems encountered are not typical for this review. Recently, a systematic review was published on adherence improving to blood pressure lowering medication, in which authors described exactly the same problems and pitfalls. They were not able to draw general conclusions, only but the assumption that reducing the number of daily doses appears to be effective in enhancing adherence in ambulatory care (<LINK REF="REF-Schroeder-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroeder 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Regarding to the fact that there we just a few studies available, the funnel plot was not performed due to the lack of reliability in this case.</P>
<P>The results of this review are concordant with an earlier Cochrane Review that summarised the results of RCTs of interventions to help patients, without any specific medical condition, follow prescriptions for medication, focusing on those trials that measured both adherence and outcomes. No effective interventions were identified.<BR/>
<BR/>The conclusions of an earlier narrative review of the compliance/adherence literature (<LINK REF="REF-Vermeire-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermeire 2001</LINK>) are concordant with those of this systematic review: though every health care professional considers adherence to be an crucial element in health care, though everyone recognises non-adherence as a major health care problem, though every scientist ascertains that diabetes mellitus may be considered a new epidemic in the decades to come, the evidence base on adherence to treatment recommendations in diabetes is almost inexistent.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-07-03 12:08:45 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Current efforts to improve or facilitate adherence of people with type 2 diabetes to treatment recommendations do not show significant effects nor harms. The question whether any intervention enhances adherence to treatment recommendations in type 2 diabetes effectively, thus still remains unanswered. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-07-03 12:08:45 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In research on the effectiveness of interventions a number of, generally accepted but not generally applied, rules ought to be respected. With regard to adherence research methodological flaws mainly refer to the research question, the definition of and measure instruments for adherence. Quite often the research question is not clearly formulated, neither is adherence defined properly. If adherence is not well defined in the first place, how is it possible then to operationalise enhancement of adherence in the second place?</P>
<P>Besides, the measurement instruments for adherence should be apt to measure adherence. Mostly adherence is assessed indirectly, leaving the reader with the question how valid this research was.</P>
<P>This type of flawed and biased research does not appear to be very conclusive. In addition, different study findings cannot be compared easily. The question whether any intervention enhances adherence to treatment recommendations in type 2 diabetes effectively, thus still remains unanswered.<BR/>Adherence should be defined explicitely, the measurement instruments should be as direct as possible, assuring that the established changes really reflect effects of the intervention on adherence itself. Indeed, researchers studying adherence should be careful not to be biased too easily by the results of 'black box' research in which any measured effect is assigned to an intervention that has being taken place before. There may not doubt about the causal relationship between the intervention and the outcome.</P>
<P>Next the encountered variety of educational interventions that has been tested, in the many excluded studies as well, reflects that the choice of components of education programmes is often not based on a theoretical or empirical rationale. Many authors say that education is the cornerstone of diabetes management, they study a programme they designed, leaving everyone in a state of uncertainty about which aspect of the education, hence which combination of components, and which duration are determinants for better adherence. Finally there is a need to know whether interventions have an effect on the short term, a long acting effect, or whether they need to be repeated periodically. In adherence research, evidence based economical evaluations are missing. When effective interventions will be revealed in the future, their impact on human and financial resources merits prime attention.<BR/>
<BR/>In recent years attention is being paid to a shift from compliance to concordance and shared-decision making. The quality of the health care provider - patient encounter takes into consideration the patient's health beliefs, medication and treatment recommendations review. In concordance, the treatment regimen is tailored to what is manageable and attainable for this particular person. A robust research evidence based on this topic needs to be built in future research projects.<BR/>
