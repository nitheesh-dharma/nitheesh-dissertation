<P>Fifty-one studies with more than 1.6 million participants, mainly of observational nature were included in this systematic review. Studies looked for an association between green tea consumption and cancer of the digestive tract, gynecological cancer including breast cancer, urological cancer including prostate cancer, lung cancer and cancer of the oral cavity. The majority of included studies were of medium to high methodological quality. The evidence that the consumption of green tea might reduce the risk of cancer was conflicting. This means, that drinking green tea remains unproven in cancer prevention, but appears to be safe at moderate, regular and habitual use.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-12 12:09:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Tea is one of the most commonly consumed beverages worldwide. Teas from the plant Camellia sinensis can be grouped into green, black and oolong tea. Cross-culturally tea drinking habits vary. Camellia sinensis contains the active ingredient polyphenol, which has a subgroup known as catechins. Catechins are powerful antioxidants. It has been suggested that green tea polyphenol may inhibit cell proliferation and observational studies have suggested that green tea may have cancer-preventative effects.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-05-05 14:35:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>To critically assess any associations between green tea consumption and the risk of cancer incidence and mortality.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-05-05 14:37:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We searched eligible studies up to January 2009 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Amed, CancerLit, Psych INFO and Phytobase and reference lists of previous reviews and included studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-04-17 15:32:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all prospective, controlled interventional studies and observational studies, which either assessed the associations between green tea consumption and risk of cancer incidence or that reported on cancer mortality.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-05-05 14:37:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>At least two review authors independently applied the study criteria, extracted data and assessed methodological quality of studies. Due to the nature of included studies, which were mainly epidemiological, results were summarised descriptively according to cancer diagnosis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-12 12:29:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Fifty-one studies with more than 1.6 million participants were included. Twenty-seven of them were case-control studies, 23 cohort studies and one randomised controlled trial (RCT).</P>
<P>Twenty-seven studies tried to establish an association between green tea consumption and cancer of the digestive tract, mainly of the upper gastrointestinal tract, five with breast cancer, five with prostate cancer, three with lung cancer, two with ovarian cancer, two with urinary bladder cancer one with oral cancer, three further studies included patients with various cancer diagnoses.</P>
<P>The methodological quality was measured with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). The 9 nested case-control studies within prospective cohorts were of high methodological quality, 13 of medium, and 1 of low. One retrospective case-control study was of high methodological quality and 21 of medium and 5 of low.</P>
<P>Results from studies assessing associations between green tea and risk of digestive tract cancer incidence were highly contradictory. There was limited evidence that green tea could reduce the incidence of liver cancer. The evidence for esophageal, gastric, colon, rectum, and pancreatic cancer was conflicting. In prostate cancer, observational studies with higher methodological quality and the only included RCT suggested a decreased risk in men consuming higher quantities green tea or green tea extracts. However, there was limited to moderate evidence that the consumption of green tea reduced the risk of lung cancer, especially in men, and urinary bladder cancer or that it could even increase the risk of the latter. There was moderate to strong evidence that green tea consumption does not decrease the risk of dying from gastric cancer. There was limited moderate to strong evidence for lung, pancreatic and colorectal cancer.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-05-12 12:27:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>There is insufficient and conflicting evidence to give any firm recommendations regarding green tea consumption for cancer prevention. The results of this review, including its trends of associations, need to be interpreted with caution and their generalisability is questionable, as the majority of included studies were carried out in Asia (n = 47) where the tea drinking culture is pronounced. Desirable green tea intake is 3 to 5 cups per day (up to 1200 ml/day), providing a minimum of 250 mg/day catechins. If not exceeding the daily recommended allowance, those who enjoy a cup of green tea should continue its consumption. Drinking green tea appears to be safe at moderate, regular and habitual use.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-12 12:22:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>A United States Department of Agriculture continuing survey of food intakes by individuals indicated that the mean annual consumption of all teas, including green tea in the USA for people older than 2 years was 397 grams and at the 95th percentile 930.3 grams (<LINK REF="REF-USDA-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDA 1996</LINK>). In a recent Canadian report green tea was the most commonly used product for self-treating breast cancer survivors (<LINK REF="REF-Boon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boon 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Brewed tea from the leaves of the plant Camellia sinensis is the second most common beverage consumed worldwide next to water (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weisburger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisburger 1997</LINK>) and is particularly popular in Asian countries. Teas from this plant can be grouped into green, black or oolong tea. Approximately 20% of the world's Camellia sinensis consumption is in the form of green tea; the other 80% are consumed in black and oolong tea (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 1992</LINK>). After fermentation from green to black tea about 15% of catechins remain unchanged. The rest of catechins are converted to theaflavins, which are polyphenol pigments and thearubigins (<LINK REF="REF-Blumenthal-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumenthal 2003</LINK>). Green teas are usually produced as either white, yellow or green tea, the latter being less fermented through a process called wilting. Green tea has a high vitamin and mineral content and 5 cups of green tea will provide 5 to 10% of the daily requirements of riboflavin, niacin, folic acid and pantothenic acid and also about 5% of the daily requirement of magnesium, 25% of potassium and 45% of the requirement for manganese (<LINK REF="REF-Shukla-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shukla 2007</LINK>). A single cup also provides about 0.1 mg of fluoride. Green tea is available commercially in form of dried tea leaves but also as a powder extract or in tablets.</P>
<P>In a randomised controlled trial (RCT) green tea has been shown to significantly decrease total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the green tea group after treatment of 150mg green tea catechins a day and 150 mg of other tea polyphenols for 3 months (<LINK REF="REF-Maron-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maron 2003</LINK>). A meta-analysis concluded that an increase in tea consumption of three cups (711 ml/day) decreases the risk of myocardial infarction by 11% (<LINK REF="REF-Peters-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 2001</LINK>). However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rejected a petition filed by a Japanese company and its US subsidiary, claiming on product labels that green tea has cardiovascular benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Schneeman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneeman 2006</LINK>). Based on two phase III clinical trials conducted in Europe, USA, Argentina, Chile, Columbia, Mexico and Peru with more than 1000 patients suffering from genital warts, the FDA approved of a new drug application of a green tea-based ointment Polyphenol ® E (<LINK REF="REF-Melville-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melville 2007</LINK>). The FDA further concluded that existing evidence does not support qualified health claims for green tea consumption and a reduced risk of any type of cancer. Desirable green tea intake is 3 to 5 cups per day (up to 1200ml/day), providing a minimum of 250 mg/day catechins.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Pharmacology of Camellia Sinensis</HEADING>
<P>The active ingredients of green tea contain polyphenols i.e. flavanols, which are also known as catechins, which account for 30 to 40% of the extractable solids of dried green tea leaves, alkaloids (such as caffeine and theobromine), carbohydrates, tannins and minerals (such as fluoride and aluminium) (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmad-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmad 1999</LINK>). Green tea contains higher amounts of catechins than black tea. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a powerful antioxidant believed to be an important determinant in the therapeutic qualities of green tea. EGCG has been suggested to work by suppressing the formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis) and regulating their permeability, thereby cutting off the blood supply to cancerous cells (<LINK REF="REF-Demeule-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demeule 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maiti-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maiti 2003</LINK>). In in-vitro and in vivo animal models EGCG have been shown to be potent chemo-preventative agents (<LINK REF="REF-Liao-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liao 2001</LINK>). Green tea catechins have also shown to decrease plasma lipid peroxide and malondialdehyde concentrations, increased plasma ascorbide concentrations, decrease nonheme iron absorption and increase the resistance of LDL to oxidation (<LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2005</LINK>). After oral intake concentrations of tea catechins can be detected in blood, urine and faeces and are thus absorbed and spread through the human or animal body (<LINK REF="REF-He-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 1994</LINK>). Catechins may exert their actions directly at the tissue and at cellular level (<LINK REF="REF-He-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been recognised that most classes of catechins are sufficiently absorbed to have the potential to exert biological effects as they cross the intestinal barrier and reach concentrations in the blood stream that have been shown to exert effects in-vitro (<LINK REF="REF-Liao-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liao 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manach-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manach 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scalbert-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scalbert 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Possible anti-cancer effects of Camellia Sinensis</HEADING>
<P>Green tea polyphenols inhibit cell proliferation and exert a strong antioxidant activity (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 1997</LINK>). Polyphenols, specifically EGCG, have been shown to increase the activity of antioxidation in a variety of mouse organs and thus, enhancing the overall chemo-preventative effect of antioxidants in those organs (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 1992</LINK>). Polyphenols, particularly catechins, may enhance gap junctional communication between cells and thus protect cells from tumour development (<LINK REF="REF-Sigler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sigler 1993</LINK>). The experimental studies suggest an effect on compounds of green tea extract, which may block the promotion of tumour growth by sealing receptors in the affected cells (<LINK REF="REF-Komori-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Komori 1993</LINK>). Another possible mechanism indicates that EGCG may facilitate direct binding to certain carcinogens (<LINK REF="REF-Hayatsu-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayatsu 1992</LINK>). It has also been suggested that polyphenols assist the inhibition of tumour genesis in a variety of organs including skin, lung, oral cavity, oesophagus, forestomach, stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, pancreas, ovary and mammary gland (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmad-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmad 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jankun-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jankun 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Su-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>). Green tea polyphenols have been shown to induce apoptosis in human lymphoid leukaemia cells (<LINK REF="REF-Hibasami-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hibasami 1996</LINK>) and human prostate cancer cells (<LINK REF="REF-Kazi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazi 2002</LINK>). It has been suggested that decaffeinated teas were inactive or less active in inhibiting tumour formation (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1994</LINK>), therefore, a 3% caffeine content in green tea extract is recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Fujiki-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fujiki 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the growing body of research demonstrating the important role of polyphenols as antioxidants with anticarcinogenic properties, a full understanding of the effects of green tea is far from complete. This justifies the need for a systematic review on this topic.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Theories of mechanism of action of polyphenols</HEADING>
<P>There are a number of proposed theories of the preventive activities of EGCG (<LINK REF="REF-Fujiki-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fujiki 1999</LINK>). The first theory suggests an anticarcinogenic effect: anti-promotion, including tumour growth, invasion, metastasis and cell transformation. The second theory proposes a sealing effect in that EGCG inhibits the interaction of tumour promoters, hormones and various growth factors with their receptors. The third theory claims an antimicrobial inhibition, involving oncogene expression (c-myc, c-H-ras, c-raf), lipid peroxidation, angiogenesis, free radicals, ornithine decarboxylase, urokinase, protein kinase, lipo-oxygenase, cyclo-oxygenase, 5 a-reductase, nitric oxide synthase, telomerase, tumour necrosis factor a gene expression, tumour necrosis factor a release, and interleukin-1 gene expression. Thus, tea polyphenols seem to have many functions and are very different from an enzyme inhibitor, which has a specific function.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Data from epidemiological studies</HEADING>
<P>Numerous epidemiological studies and very few clinical trials have been performed to test whether Camellia sinensis possesses chemo-preventive or curative activity on cancer development. Results have been contradictory, as some epidemiological studies comparing tea-drinkers to non tea-drinkers were claiming that drinking tea protects against the development of cancer, whereas others did not support this claim. This may be due to numerous confounding variables, such as diet and population differences that limit the ability of epidemiological studies to detect an effect (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2002</LINK>). Two studies reported an association between green tea consumption and decreased cancer morbidity. One of these studies involved a total of 18,000 men and reported that people who were drinking either black or green tea were half as likely to develop stomach or oesophageal cancer compared to men who drank no or only little tea, even after demographics were adjusted according to smoking and other dietary factors (<LINK REF="STD-Sun-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2002</LINK>). Another study involving 250 skin cancer patients showed that patients consuming 3g of green tea (about 2 cups) per day reduced the size and proliferation of leukoplakia (<LINK REF="REF-Hakim-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hakim 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>A study assessing the effect of increased black and green tea consumption on oxidative DNA damage was carried out including 143 heavy smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Hakim-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hakim 2003</LINK>). Results showed that in the green tea group plasma and urinary catechins levels rose significantly and it has been suggested that regular green tea drinking might protect smokers from oxidative damages and could thus reduce cancer risks.</P>

<P>The consumption of green tea - whether as part of an intervention study or measured in an epidemiological study - was the type of intervention the reviewers were interested in. The assessment variable was the consumption of green tea or green tea extract (only mono preparations for oral consumption in liquid, powder or tablet form). Green tea was defined as non-fermented tea leaves and studies must mention that green tea, non-fermented tea or 'matsu-cha', as it is called in Asia, has been consumed. Any method of quantifying this variable (e.g. direct measurement, questionnaire) was considered. Studies that did not distinguish the type of tea (e.g. black tea versus green tea) or did not report quantitative data of at least two different amounts or frequency of green tea consumption were excluded. Pharmokinetic-type studies were also excluded because they were unlikely to contribute useful data on long-term effects of green tea consumption. Only studies which explicitly or implicitly stated the duration of green tea consumption in their research summary were included.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2009-04-23 11:21:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>To be included, studies had to report on the consumption of green tea, non-fermented tea or 'matsu-cha' as it is called in some parts of Asia. Studies identified by the searchers were checked by two review authors. Articles were only included on initial screen if the review authors could determine from the abstract that the article was a report of either an intervention or epidemiological study. When a title or abstract could not be rejected with certainty, the full text article was obtained for further evaluation.</P>
<P>The full text of all studies of possible relevance was obtained and analysed for independent assessment by two review authors. Reasons for excluding any trials have been stated. The review authors will know the author's name, institution and the source of publication. All disagreements were resolved by discussion between the two review authors. If any data were missing from the trial reports attempts were made to obtain that data by contacting the authors.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2009-05-05 14:02:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Data extraction was performed independently by means of pre-tested data extraction forms. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Studies were categorised into RCT, nested case-control studies within prospective cohort studies ('cohort studies' in the following), and retrospective case-control studies ('case-control studies' in the following). Data were grouped according to study design and cancer type. Articles published in languages other than English were translated in-house by native speakers of, for instance, Japanese or Chinese, as some of the articles were written in an Asian language.</P>
<P>Data were entered into Review Manager 5 and double-checked by two review authors. Some authors of included studies were contacted for clarification of study methodology and results.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of risk of bias and methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>The assessment of risk of bias in interventional studies and of methodological quality of observational studies was independently performed by two review authors.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventional studies</HEADING>
<P>The risk of bias in the included RCT was assessed by using the approach of the Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).The criteria relate to the following domains:</P>
<UL>
<LI>generation sequence and concealment of allocation,</LI>
<LI>blinding of caregivers, participants and outcome assessors,</LI>
<LI>incomplete outcomes,</LI>
<LI>selective reporting.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Studies, which were assessed as 'adequate' in all main domains, were considered to be of low risk of bias. Studies in which there was no clear judgment concerning the procedures in one or more key domains were considered to be at least of medium risk of bias. Studies with clearly inadequate procedures in one or more of the key domains were considered to be of high risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Observational studies</HEADING>
<P>The Newcastle-Ottawa assessment scale (NOS-scale) was used for assessing the methodological quality of epidemiological studies (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2001</LINK>). This tool contains two forms, one for cohort (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>) and one for case-control studies (<LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>), with which they are being judged on three domains:</P>
<UL>
<LI>selection of study groups,</LI>
<LI>comparability of the groups,</LI>
<LI>ascertainment of exposure/outcome of interest.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If all criteria of methodological quality are fulfilled within the domains, points ('stars') are assigned to the respective study. The NOS-scale was adapted for the purpose of this review and a cohort study could receive a maximum of 16 points (nine for the cohort assessment and seven for the assessment of the case-control part) and a case-control study could receive a maximum of nine points. Cohort studies with eight or less points were arbitrarily considered as being of low, with 9 to 12 points of medium and with more than 12 points of high methodological quality. Case-control studies with five or less points were also arbitrarily considered as being of low, 6 to 7 points as of medium and 8 to 9 points as of high methodological quality.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>We did not carry out a meta-analysis due to the clinical and methodological heterogeneity of the included studies. The findings of the review are being presented as a descriptive synthesis.</P>
<P>A modified rating system, previously developed by van Tulder was used to make statements about the level of evidence (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>):</P>
<UL>
<LI>Strong evidence - consistent findings among multiple high quality studies,</LI>

<P>A total of 675 hits were retrieved from the literature searches. Thereof 586 clearly did not match our inclusion criteria and were excluded by title and abstract.

Of the remaining 89 papers, we retrieved the full articles and assessed them according to the inclusion criteria provided in the protocol. Thirty-eight of them did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. The main reasons for exclusion were: no distinction between green and black tea, other endpoints than cancer, amount of frequency of green tea consumption not specified or double publications.

At the end of the study in one patient of the treatment group, the pre-malignant lesion was progressed into prostate cancer (3%), whereas this was the case in nine patients of the control group (30%), suggesting a 90% chemoprevention efficacy of green tea catechins in men subjected to high risk for developing prostate cancer (p &lt; 0.01).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-06 11:43:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The aims of this review were to examine the possible association between green tea consumption and the risk of cancer incidence and mortality. The review includes data from 50 observational studies and one RCT.</P>
<P>Generally, there was a lack of consistency in the results of the observational studies assessing the effect of green tea on the incidence of cancer. This was especially the case for cancer of the digestive tract. With the exception of liver cancer, for which there was limited evidence of a preventive effect of green tea consumption, for all other entities - esophageal, gastric, colon, rectum, and pancreatic cancer - the evidence was conflicting. Conflicting evidence was also found with regard to the incidence of prostate and breast cancer. However, in prostate cancer, observational studies with higher methodological quality and the only included RCT suggested a decreased risk in men consuming higher amounts of green tea or green tea extracts whereas in breast cancer, all nested case-control studies within prospective cohorts suggested no influence of green tea consumption on the risk of breast cancer. Limited evidence was found in regard to the consumption of green tea and a decrease of the incidence of ovarian cancer and oral cancer in women. In contrast, there was limited to moderate evidence that the consumption of green tea did not have any preventative effects on lung cancer, especially in men, and urinary bladder cancer or that it could even increase the risk of the latter.<BR/>There is moderate to strong evidence that the consumption of green tea does not decrease the risk of dying from gastric cancer and limited to moderate evidence that this is also the case for lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer. </P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other systematic reviews</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Borrelli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borrelli 2004</LINK> only included studies investigating the association between green tea consumption and gastrointestinal cancer. The authors decided to include precancerous conditions such as adenomatous polyps, atrophic gastritis e.t.c. in their review<I>.</I> The conclusion reads that green tea seems to be protective for these precancerous conditions but that there is no clear evidence that green tea could prevent gastric and other intestinal cancer.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2006</LINK> investigated the effect of green and black tea consumption on colorectal cancer and carried out a meta-analysis. This meta-analysis contained eight studies also included in this review and found that there was a 18% reduction in risk of colorectal cancer with high green tea consumption. However, the authors found an increased risk of cancer morbidity with increased green tea consumption in case-control but not in cohort studies. There was some suggestion for a publication bias. Additionally, six studies were of Japanese origin, the other two of Chinese. </P>
<P>Finally, <LINK REF="REF-Seely-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seely 2005</LINK> published a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between green tea and breast cancer, in which seven studies were included. They concluded that the consumption of at least five cups of green tea per day leads to a decrease in the risk of developing breast cancer, albeit this effect was statistically not significant. The reviewers also suggested that green tea consumption may prevent from recurrence in early stages of the disease. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>This review holds certain limitations. First of all, the methodological quality of included observational studies varied; specifically that of cohort studies and case-control studies. Thus, there was no reliable evidence from cohort and weak evidence from case-control studies to confirm the suggestion of an association between green tea consumption and a decreased risk of cancer.</P>
<P>Secondly, review authors can only make limited statements regarding associations between green tea intake and cancer incidence or cancer mortality based on the included studies, as the majority of included studies was carried out in Asia, where green tea drinking is more of a culturally-based tradition than in other parts of the world. The majority of studies was carried out in Japan (n = 32), followed by China (n = 13), the USA (n = 3), Singapore (n = 2) and Italy (n = 1). Apart from one case-control study (<LINK REF="STD-Bonner-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bonner 2005</LINK>) all other epidemiological studies carried out in China suggested a positive association. Eleven of all 20 cohort studies carried out in Japan found no association between green tea consumption and risk of cancer incidence for neither male nor female participants and three found no association investigating women only. Only two of the 20 Japanese cohort studies found a positive association for male participants (<LINK REF="STD-Kurahashi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kurahashi 2007</LINK>) and a trend of a positive association for female participants (<LINK REF="STD-Sasazuki-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sasazuki 2004</LINK>). Two of the three studies carried out in the USA detected a positive associations between increased green tea consumption and a decreased risk of cancer incidence for women (<LINK REF="STD-Song-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2003</LINK>) and one showed a negative association for men and none for women (<LINK REF="STD-Galanis-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Galanis 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Apart from a possible location bias, which was not further investigated in this review, observational studies are affected by a great number of confounding variables and this may explain their controversial results. </P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sample size</HEADING>
<P>Sample sizes should be large in epidemiological studies in order to reduce random error, which can effect measurement in an inconsistent manner. Sample sizes in our included epidemiological studies ranged from 213 (<LINK REF="STD-Goto-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Goto 1990</LINK>) to 488,989 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Key-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Key 1999</LINK>) with a median of 11,907 for cohort studies and 1043 for case-control studies. However, the majority of studies (n = 36) included less than 10,000 participants and n = 11 studies less than 1000 participants.</P>
<P>Many studies have too small a sample size for their findings to be conclusive. In a paper on the empirical evaluation of the Chinese literature in genetic epidemiology researchers reported a literature bias showing that Chinese studies were, on average, smaller in sample size that non-Chinese studies and, in general, reported a stronger gene-disease association and more frequently statistically significant results (<LINK REF="REF-Pan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pan 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Inferences from observational studies</HEADING>
<P>It must be noted that the inferences that can be drawn from case-control and cohort studies are no more than of suggestive or moderately firm nature (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2003</LINK>). However, these types of studies are often used to answer questions regarding the prevention of a disease, prognosis and the aetiology or harm of an intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Therapeutic effect and bias</HEADING>
<P>In our view, the possibility of measuring the therapeutic effect of green tea based on isolated case-control or cohort studies is not very likely as other confounding variables come into place. Even if studies are age and gender-matched and statistically control for certain lifestyle factors, such as, for instance, smoking or family history of cancer; study results are likely to be affected by different types of bias (selection bias, publication bias).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Choice of control group</HEADING>
<P>The choice of control group is also very important when discussing epidemiological studies. Random sampling should always be part of the planning of an epidemiological study. Studies included in this review are mainly hospital- or population-controlled. Hospital controls are often convenient and can be low-cost, and patients might be more motivated to participate in a study at the hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Grimes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 2005</LINK>). However, the background rate of exposure might not be equal to the sample under investigation and admission rate at hospitals might also bias the representativeness of a hospital control group (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1979</LINK>). Additionally, there is the argument that hospital controls may resemble cases more than population controls and possible differences in weight, smoking patterns and burden of illness can bias the results of a study with hospital controls (<LINK REF="REF-Olson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olson 1994</LINK>). Population controls, on the other hand, have an advantage in that they are recruited by random sampling and should thus be representative. However, participants of a population control group could be less motivated to participate in research or there is the possibility that a substantial number of control participants cannot be reached (<LINK REF="REF-Wacholder-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wacholder 2007</LINK>).  </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Variation in risks</HEADING>
<P>Many factors may contribute to the variation in the RR estimates across the included studies, such as the genetic make-up of the population under investigation (albeit mostly of Asian cultures), the type of patients included, the selection of controls and the methodological quality of the study design. All these factors could lead to an over- or under-estimation of the true risks.</P>
<P>Furthermore, other confounding variables influencing the heterogeneity in green tea research are quality of product, quantity of consumption, duration of drinking, diet and the general environment. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Safety</HEADING>
<P>Green tea (Camellia sinensis) is currently attracting the media and the public with news of its cancer-protective effects and green tea extracts are offered widely across many countries. Therefore some safety issues should be raised and discussed.</P>
<P>Different green tea drinking cultures have been observed cross-culturally between continents as well as between two countries on the same continent, such as, for instance, Japan and China. Green tea is often consumed in Asian cultures and has not been associated with any significant adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Nemecz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nemecz 2000</LINK>). However, since it is widely consumed the researchers dedicate one abstract to the safety of Camellia sinensis. When used orally in moderate amounts studies have shown that green tea is likely to be safe (<LINK REF="STD-Inoue-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Inoue 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ji-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ji 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kono-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kono 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitscher-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitscher 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nemecz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nemecz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tajima-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Tajima 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2002</LINK>). Green tea extract containing 7% caffeine has been used safely for six months (<LINK REF="STD-Pisters-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pisters 2001</LINK>) when used topically and appropriately (<LINK REF="REF-Ahn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Katiyar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katiyar 2000</LINK>). However, green tea consumption is possibly unsafe when used orally, long-term and in high doses. Doses greater than 250 to 300 mg per day have been associated with tachyarrhythmia and sleep disturbances (<LINK REF="REF-IOM-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOM 2001</LINK>). This is due to the caffeine contained in the standard green tea products but would not apply for decaffeinated green tea.</P>
<P>Orally, green tea can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating and pain, dyspepsia, flatulence and diarrhoea. It can also affect the central nervous system and cause adverse reactions such as dizziness, insomnia, fatigue, agitation, tremors, restlessness and confusion. These types of adverse events have been observed with higher doses of green tea (5 to 6 litres per day) (<LINK REF="STD-Jatoi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jatoi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pisters-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pisters 2001</LINK>). One case report exists of a female otherwise healthy patient who had been taking six capsules of Green Lite Polyphenon per day used for weight loss (<LINK REF="REF-Gloro-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gloro 2005</LINK>). Her hepatic biopsy result was reported as "toxic hepatitis" and a liver transplant was performed.</P>
<P>The World Health Organisation (WHO) database of adverse events in Uppsala was searched for case reports. Forty-nine case reports were found, of which 40 occurred with Camellia sinensis as an additional ingredient to other weight loss products: Tealine Arkomedika and Exolise Arkopharmaka. These products are advertised as weight loss products. Adverse events reported for these two products, which mainly stem from France and Spain, included hepatitis (n = 12), jaundice (n = 6), vomiting (n = 4), supraventricular tachycardia (n = 2), pulmonary hypertension (n = 1) and atrial fibrillation (n = 1). An end-of-the-year report from Arkopharma in 2002 stated that the sales of Exilose and Tealine had experienced a steep fall.</P>
<P>The Department of Health and Human Services issued a statement saying that "the relevance of these findings to Polyphenon E, in any, is not clear". However, the Committee of Medicine Security of Human Use has reviewed the data of security of the pharmaceutical specialties with green tea extract as a result of the notification of four cases in Spain and nine in France of hepatitis adverse reactions related to Exolise. As a result, Exolise is no longer marketed in at least two European countries (France &amp; Spain). Only nine of the WHO reports were from the sole consumption of Camellia sinensis. These come from Spain (n = 5), Brazil (n = 3) and Canada (n = 1). In these cases, green tea was mainly consumed for weight loss. Adverse events reported from sole consumption of green tea included hepatitis (n = 2), nervousness (n = 2), insomnia (n = 2), hypertension (n = 2), jaundice (n = 1) and euphoria (n = 1). In a small pilot study with 102 healthy volunteers who were asked to consume 10 Japanese sized cups of green tea daily (about 2.5 g green tea extract) 50% of volunteers experienced very mild temporary disorders, such as abdominal bloating, heartburn, and insomnia due to the caffeine in green tea extract (<LINK REF="REF-Fujiki-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fujiki 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>As so often when researchers of systematic review are faced only with data from observational studies, the assessment of their methodological quality varies greatly.<BR/>
<BR/>There should be no expectation that drinking green tea regularly will reduce the risk of GI, uro-genital tract, breast, lung, prostate and liver cancer. However, those people who enjoy a cup of green tea as a beverage can continue to drink it if recommended daily dosages are not exceeded. The consumption of green tea appears to be safe at moderate, regular, and habitual use and can be seen as a healthy addition to the human diet.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-05-06 11:45:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The body of literature is generally contradictory due to the type of research studies assessing cancer-preventative effects of green tea. This systematic review showed that evidence for green tea preventing cancer incidence is sparse and highly conflicting. RCTs are almost non-existent in this topic area. The available epidemiological studies were of medium to high methodological quality. The researchers are not in a position to draw any valid conclusions about the associations of green tea consumption in cancer incidence and mortality. Future research should follow the example of the RCT and design clinical trials assessing green tea (in capsule and/or liquid form) as a preventative option for cancer occurrence. Furthermore, multi-center trials with random allocation of patients in which patients, clinicians and examiners are both blinded, involving patients at high cancer risk of the same cancer type are recommended.</P>
<P>Outcomes of RCTs should preferably be measured over a longer period to assess whether apparent preventative effects of interventions are maintained over time. However, should RCTs not be managable due to various reasons (e.g. expenses) a large, well-designed prospective cohort study with adequate green tea consumption levels is highly recommended by the reviewers. Therefore, in order to make an informed recommendation for a possible association between the consumption of green tea and a reduced cancer mortality more cohort studies and large RCTs are needed.</P>
<P>Evidence-based-medicine has changed preventative practice and has produced a lasting need of more RCTs as well as systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We need to aim at creating high level evidence in this much talked about but little researched topic area. Funding and infrastructure for clinical trials remain major challenges for the future.</P>
