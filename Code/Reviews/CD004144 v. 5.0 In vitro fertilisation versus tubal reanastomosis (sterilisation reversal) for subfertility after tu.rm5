<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-04 13:45:34 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-11-04 13:45:34 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Tubal sterilisation is the most popular contraceptive method in the world (<LINK REF="REF-Chi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chi 1994</LINK>). Approximately 138 million women of reproductive age have had tubal sterilisations and there is evidence that increasingly younger women are being sterilized. With such large numbers of women choosing this option of birth control, it is clear that even if a small percentage of women later regret the decision, large numbers of women will seek counselling regarding reversal from their physicians (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Voorhis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Voorhis 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of post sterilisation regret has been reported to range between 2.1 to 26% i (<LINK REF="REF-Chi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chi 1994</LINK>). However, only a small proportion of women experiencing regret actually request a reversal of the procedure. The incidence of reversal has been reported to be between 1to 13% of sterilized women, but in most studies it is only reported as being between 1 to 2% (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Voorhis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Voorhis 2000</LINK>) .</P>
<P>Major risk factors for subsequent regret of sterilisation include young maternal age ( that is, younger than 30 years of age ) and marital status change after the sterilisation (<LINK REF="REF-Wilcox-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilcox 1990</LINK>). Other risk factors include death of a child, lower socioeconomic status, and lower educational attainment.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-05-19 12:54:46 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>Surgical reversal of sterilisation has been carried out since 1970s with the procedure performed through laparotomy, mini-laparotomy, or laparoscopy.</P>
<P>Different studies reported tubal patency, total pregnancy, intrauterine pregnancy, or delivery rates. Studies were largely retrospective and reported on different participants' populations and different surgical techniques, and many included only small numbers of women.</P>
<P>The largest studies reported delivery rates of 45 to 82% after ligation reversal by laparotomy, and 25 to73% after laparoscopic reversal, with ectopic pregnancy rates between 1 and 7% (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Voorhis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Voorhis 2000</LINK>). A successful outcome after surgical sterilisation reversal is influenced mainly by age of the woman and the preoperative length of the fallopian tubes (<LINK REF="REF-Rouzi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rouzi 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Results from IVF studies do not report separately on women with previous tubal sterilisation. However, the cumulative live birth rate in women who had undergone IVF for tubal disease was reported to be 55.8% (<LINK REF="REF-Witsenburg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witsenburg 2005</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-05-19 12:54:17 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>Studies report success rates for reversal of tubal sterilisation ranging between 25 to 82% (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Voorhis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Voorhis 2000</LINK>). This wide variation is attributed to many factors and the definition of 'success' varies between studies.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-11-04 13:34:07 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>The development of assisted reproduction techniques, mainly IVF-ET provides an alternative to the surgical approach. This review aimed to compare the surgical intervention with IVF.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to compare the efficacy, in terms of live birth rates, of surgical tubal reanastomosis and in vitro fertilisation. The morbidity and cost-effectiveness of both techniques was to be also compared.</P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>There are currently no randomised controlled studies comparing the efficacy of either surgical reversal or IVF in restoring fertility following tubal sterilisation. Given the enthusiasm of many of the clinicians towards one procedure or the other, and the possible success or cost implications, there is a need for well-designed trials randomised controlled trials in this area.</P>
