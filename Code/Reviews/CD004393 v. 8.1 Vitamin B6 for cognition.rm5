<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Micronutrient status can affect cognitive function at all ages. Vitamin deficiencies could influence memory function and might contribute to age-associated cognitive impairment and dementia. Vitamin B6 is involved in the regulation of mental function and mood and in the metabolism of homocysteine, a risk factor for vascular disease. Two trials of vitamin B6 supplements for healthy elderly people qualified for this review, with no beneficial effects on mood or mental function detectable. Homocysteine levels were not assessed. No ill effects of vitamin B6 were observed. No trials studying effects of vitamin B6 treatment for people with dementia or cognitive impairment were identified. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-04-03 10:20:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Micronutrient status can affect cognitive function at all ages. Vitamin deficiencies could influence memory function and might contribute to age-associated cognitive impairment and dementia. Vitamin B6, comprising three chemically distinct compounds, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxine, is involved in the regulation of mental function and mood. Vitamin B6 is also an essential homocysteine re-methylation cofactor, and deficiency is associated with an increase in blood homocysteine levels. Homocysteine is a risk factor for cerebrovascular disease and may also have directly toxic effects on neurons of the central nervous system. Neuropsychiatric disorders including seizures, migraine, chronic pain and depression have been linked to vitamin B6 deficiency. Epidemiological studies indicate that poor vitamin B6 status is common among older people. Hyperhomocysteinaemia has been suggested as a cause or mechanism in the development Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Supplementation with B vitamins including vitamin B6 has been shown to reduce blood homocysteine levels.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy of vitamin B6 supplementation in reducing the risk of developing cognitive impairment by older healthy people, or improving cognitive functioning of people with cognitive decline and dementia, whether or not vitamin B6 deficiency has been diagnosed.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-04-03 10:21:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 16 March 2008 using the terms: B6, "B 6", B-6, pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal. The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All unconfounded, double-blind randomized controlled trials in which the intervention with vitamin B6 was compared with placebo for healthy older people or people with cognitive decline or dementia. The primary outcome of interest was the efficacy of vitamin B6 supplementation on cognitive function.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The two reviewers independently evaluated all studies identified as possibly meeting the criteria for inclusion. One reviewer independently extracted the data. Studies were rated for their overall quality. The weighted mean differences between treatment and placebo groups, with 95% confidence intervals, were calculated for each outcome. Review Manager version 4.2 was used to analyse the variance.<BR/> </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-04-03 10:22:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>No trials of vitamin B6 involving people with cognitive impairment or dementia were found.</P>
<P>The two trials included in the review (Bryan 2002; Deijen 1992) used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design and involved 109 healthy older people. One trial restricted enrolment to women and the other to men.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Vitamin B6 supplementation and healthy older women:</P>
<P>Bryan 2002, enrolled 211 healthy women from various age groups into a five-week study. The trial was of multifactorial design with folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin B6 and placebo in its four arms. Twelve healthy women aged 65 to 92 years received 75 mg vitamin B6 orally per day and were compared with 21 healthy women who were allocated to placebo. No statistically significant benefits from vitamin B6 on mood or cognition were observed.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Vitamin B6 supplementation and healthy older men:</P>
<P>Deijen 1992, recruited 76 healthy men aged 70 to 79 years. They were divided into 38 matched pairs, one member of each pair randomly allocated to 20 mg of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) per day for 12 weeks the other to placebo. No statistically significant differences between treatment and placebo were found in their effects on cognition or mood.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Effect of vitamin B6 supplementation on vitamin B6 status:</P>
<P>Deijen 1992, reported that 20 mg of pyridoxine hydrochloride per day for 12 weeks increased blood vitamin B6 activity as assessed as by plasma pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (WMD 238, 95%CI 211.58 to 264.42, P&lt;0.00001) and erythrocyte enzyme asparate aminotransferase (WMD 0.43, 95%CI 0.30 to 0.56, P&lt;0.00001)<BR/>
</P>
<P>Effect of vitamin B6 supplementation on blood homocysteine concentration:</P>
<P>Neither of the included trials measured homocysteine levels.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Drop-outs:</P>
<P>All participants allocated to vitamin B6 or placebo completed the trial protocol.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Adverse events:</P>
<P>No adverse effects were reported.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Effect of vitamin B6 on carer burden, care costs and institutionalization rate:</P>
<P>We found no trials in which these outcomes were assessed.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-04-03 10:22:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>This review found no evidence for short-term benefit from vitamin B6 in improving mood (depression, fatigue and tension symptoms) or cognitive functions. For the older people included in one of the two trials included in the review, oral vitamin B6 supplements improved biochemical indices of vitamin B6 status, but potential effects on blood homocysteine levels were not assessed in either study.<BR/>
</P>
<P>This review found evidence that there is scope for increasing some biochemical indices of vitamin B6 status among older people. More randomized controlled trials are needed to explore possible benefits from vitamin B6 supplementation for healthy older people and for those with cognitive impairment or dementia.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-03-26 15:55:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-04-03 10:23:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Dementia is characterized by progressive intellectual deterioration that is sufficiently severe to interfere with social or occupational functions (<LINK REF="REF-Rowland-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowland 2000</LINK>). Dementia is a worldwide and serious public health problem (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1999</LINK>). Age is a recognized risk factor (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1997</LINK>) in that the prevalence and incidence of the disease increases with advancing age (<LINK REF="REF-Callahan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callahan 1995</LINK>). There are many causes of dementia, the two pathologically distinct types that comprise the majority of cases are Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disorder with memory loss and progressive decline in cognitive functions (<LINK REF="REF-Knopman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knopman 1998</LINK>). Half of the population aged over 85 suffers from the disease (<LINK REF="REF-White-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1996</LINK>). The economic cost of Alzheimer's disease is higher than that of heart disease and cancer together (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1990</LINK>). Vascular dementia is the second most frequent type of dementia accounting for 20 to 30% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Fabbender-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fabbender 1999</LINK>), and stroke is a major cause (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Genetic and non-genetic factors, such as head trauma, education, stress, and nutrition, interact with the biology of the ageing brain in the development of dementia. Recently greater attention has been paid to non-genetic factors, in the hope of establishing a basis for preventing dementia or altering its course particularly in the early stages. Nutrition is a modifiable lifestyle factor, and may be relevant to the pathogenesis of dementia. About 30% of healthy older people have subclinical malnutrition of one or more dietary components, such as vitamins (<LINK REF="REF-Blumberg-1944" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumberg 1944</LINK>). Correction of such deficiencies might have a role in preventing or retarding cognitive decline in later life.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-04-03 10:24:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Vitamin B6 is water-soluble, and occurs in three closely related compounds with similar physiological actions, pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine. The first is found in large quantities in plant sources and the other two in animal tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2002</LINK>). Liver, whole grain cereals, peanuts, and bananas are rich in vitamin B6. A significant increase in vitamin B6 status has been noted after the consumption of moderate amounts of alcohol (<LINK REF="REF-Walmusley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walmusley 1999</LINK>). In humans, vitamin B6 is synthesized by microorganisms of the large gut, but the amount utilized by the human host is uncertain. Adult requirements are about 2 mg/day (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2002</LINK>). Pharmacological doses of vitamin B6 have been used in treatment for autism syndromes and in the hope of improving speech and language functions of some children with learning difficulties. It is also used as an over-the-counter medication for premenstrual syndromes and for vomiting in pregnancy.</P>
<P>Features of vitamin B6 deficiency include convulsions, peripheral neuropathy and skin diseases (dermatitis, cheilosis, glossitis and angular stomatitis) (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2002</LINK>). Some drugs such as isoniazid, hydralazine and penicillamine which act as chemical antagonists to B6 may induce deficiency. Heavy overdoses (200 mg/day or more) of vitamin B6 for several weeks may cause a peripheral sensory neuropathy.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-04-03 10:25:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>The vitamin participates in an important coenzyme system in protein synthesis and is involved in fat and carbohydrate metabolism. Vitamin B6 deficiency has a serious effect on brain function (<LINK REF="REF-McCormick-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 2001</LINK>), as the vitamin plays a pivotal role in the synthesis of several neurotransmitters including, serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid. Lack of these neurotransmitters may be linked to the development of some neuropsychological disorders such as parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia and depression. Vitamin B6 affects immune function (<LINK REF="REF-Talbott-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talbott 1987</LINK>), and deficiency results in impaired cell-mediated immunity and reduced antibody responses.</P>
<P>The biologically active form of the vitamin, pyridoxal phosphate, is available for use by tissues; 4-pyridoxic acid is an inactive form and represents a major vitamin B6 catabolite, excreted in the urine. Vitamin B6 is required as an essential cofactor in homocysteine metabolism through a trans-sulphuration pathway. Particularly the active form of vitamin B6 plays a key role as a coenzyme of cystathionine synthase and cystathioninelyase. Both enzymes are required for the metabolism of homocysteine to cysteine.</P>
<P>Elevated total homocysteine levels have been recognized as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Bots-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bots 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bostom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bostom 1999</LINK>), carotid atherosclerosis (<LINK REF="REF-Selhub-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selhub 1995</LINK>), and stroke. Therefore, several studies have postulated the role of hyperhomocysteinaemia in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCddon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCddon 1998</LINK>). Evidence from observational studies has demonstrated that plasma homocysteine levels are influenced by several B-vitamins, including vitamin B6 (<LINK REF="REF-Joosten-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joosten 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Riggs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riggs 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>An inverse relationship between plasma pyridoxal concentration and age has been documented in several studies (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joosten-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joosten 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pannemans-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pannemans 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bates-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bates 1999</LINK>). Poor vitamin B6 status and low dietary vitamin B6 intakes and other necessary nutrients have been observed in older people (<LINK REF="REF-Rose-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rose 1976</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kant-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kant 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lowik-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowik 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Riggs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riggs 1996</LINK>), with approximately 20% of aged people having inadequate vitamin B6 status (<LINK REF="REF-Selhub-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selhub 1993</LINK>). The prevalence of deficiency is higher in people who are institutionalized than in those living in their own homes (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lowik-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowik 1992</LINK>). The prevailing hypothesis for the possible downward trend of vitamin B6 status in later life involves low intake, less efficient retention, and increased catabolism of the vitamin (<LINK REF="REF-Kant-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kant 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lowik-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowik 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Bates-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bates 1999</LINK>). A correlation between blood levels of B vitamins and cognitive function has been documented in several studies (<LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-La-Rue-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">La Rue 1997</LINK>). In the Boston Normative Aging Study, high vitamin B6 concentration has been correlated with better performance in memorization tests (<LINK REF="REF-Riggs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riggs 1996</LINK>). In another experimental study, a 2 mg daily supplement of vitamin B6 for one year was associated with a significant effect on responses to the visual reproduction battery test (<LINK REF="REF-Tolonen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tolonen 1988</LINK>). It has been reported that patients with Alzheimer's disease are more likely than controls to have low plasma pyridoxal-5-phosphate concentrations (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2002</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-04-03 10:34:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>
<B>Selection of studies</B>
<BR/>Abstracts of the references retrieved by the search were read by one reviewer who discarded any that were clearly not eligible for inclusion. If the article could possibly be relevant, it was retrieved for further assessment. Both reviewers independently selected the trials for inclusion in the review from the citation list. Disagreements were to be resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality assessment</B>
</P>
<P>The reviewers assessed the methodological quality of each trial, using the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>):<BR/>Grade A: Adequate concealment is where the report describe the allocation of treatment by: (i) some centralised randomized scheme, when the trial provides details of an enrolment of the participants by phone; or (ii) some form of randomization scheme controlled by a pharmacy; (iii) numbered or coded containers in which capsules form identical-looking numbered bottles are administrated in order participants; (iv) coded computer system in which confirms that the allocations were in locked unreadable file; or (v) if the envelopes were used for assignment the report should declare that they were sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes.</P>
<P>Grade B: Uncertain concealment, is where the allocation of treatment was described by: (i) use a "list" of "table" to allocate assignments; (ii) use of "envelopes" or sealed envelopes; (iii) stating the study as "randomized" without any further dentails of the method of randomization.</P>
<P>Grade C: Inadequate concealment, where the report describes allocation of treatment by: (i) alternation; (ii) using date of birth, gender, day of week, or any other approach; (iii) the allocation strategy is entirely transparent before assignment.</P>
<P>Empirical research has shown that lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with bias. Trials with unclear concealment measures have been shown to yield more pronounced estimates of treatment effects than trials that have taken adequate measures to conceal allocation schedules, but less pronounced than inadequately concealed trials (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>). Trials were included if they conformed to categories A or B, and those falling into category C were excluded.</P>
<P>
<B>Data collection</B>
<BR/>Data were extracted from the published reports. The summary statistics required for each trial and each outcome for continuous data were the mean change from baseline, the standard error of the mean change, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each assessment. Where changes from baseline were not reported, the mean, standard deviation and the number of people for each treatment group at each time point were extracted if available.</P>
<P>For binary data the numbers in each treatment group and the numbers experiencing the outcome of interest were sought.</P>
<P>The baseline assessment was defined as the latest available assessment prior to randomization, but no longer than two months before.<BR/>
</P>
<P>For each outcome measure, data were sought on every person assessed. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the data would be sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the person was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. If intention-to-treat data are not available in the publications, "on-treatment" or the data of those who completed the trial were to be sought and indicated as such.</P>
<P>Data from 'open-label' follow-on phases after the randomized study were not used to assess safety or efficacy because patients were usually not randomized, nor were treatments concealed.</P>
<P>
<B>Data analysis</B>
<BR/>The outcomes measured in trials of dementia and cognitive impairment often arise from ordinal rating scales. Where the rating scales used in the trials have a reasonably large number of categories (more than 10) the data can be treated as continuous outcomes arising from a normal distribution.</P>
<P>Summary statistics (n, mean, and standard deviation) were required for each rating scale at each assessment time for each treatment group in each trial for change from baseline. When change from baseline results were not reported, the required summary statistics were calculated from the baseline and assessment time treatment group means and standard deviations. In this case a zero correlation between the measurements at baseline and assessment time was assumed. This method overestimates the standard deviation of the change from baseline, but this conservative approach is considered to be preferable in a meta-analysis.<BR/>The meta-analysis requires the combination of data from trials that may not use the same rating scale to assess an outcome. The measure of the treatment difference for any outcome is the weighted mean difference when the pooled trials used the same rating scale or test, and the standardized mean difference (the absolute mean difference divided by the pooled standard deviation) when they used different rating scales or tests.</P>
<P>For binary outcomes, such as improvement or no improvement, the odds ratio is used to measure treatment effect. A weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials is calculated.</P>
<P>Overall estimates of the treatment difference are presented. In all cases the overall estimate from a fixed-effects model is presented and a test for heterogeneity using a standard chi-square statistic performed. If there is evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials then either only homogeneous results are pooled, or a random-effects model used (in which case the confidence intervals would be broader than those of a fixed-effects model).</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analysis</B>
<BR/>Where relevant, and where data were available, subgroup analysis includes age, sex, whether B6 deficiency was present, duration of treatment and whether cognitive impairment was present at baseline.</P>

<P>No randomized controlled trials of the impact of B6 on cognitive impairment of people with dementia were found. The two studies that fulfilled the randomization criteria for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Deijen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Deijen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bryan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bryan 2002</LINK>) were concerned with the effect of vitamin B6 intervention on healthy older people.<BR/>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Bryan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bryan 2002</LINK>, studied the action of vitamin supplements on mood and cognitive performance of healthy women across the life span. Two hundred and eleven healthy Australian women were enrolled; recruitment criteria were: good health, non-smokers, not taking hormone replacement therapy or any medication that might affect mental status. Participants were also required to have English as mother language or to be proficient in English as many assessments were language-dependent. Participants were assigned into three age groups: younger, middle and older. The trial used a multifactorial design with participants randomly assigned to one of four treatment arms providing daily doses of 750 &#956;g of folic acid, or 15 &#956;g of vitamin B12, or 75 mg of vitamin B6, or placebo. Twelve women aged 65 to 92 received 75 mg of vitamin B6 orally per day for five weeks and 21 were on placebo. Standardized measures of cognition and were applied at baseline and at the end of the trial. Mood questionnaires were administered at the end of the intervention period. Background dietary intakes were estimated from a self-completed questionnaire.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Deijen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Deijen 1992</LINK> restricted enrolment to healthy men aged 70 to 79 years and with scores above 80 on a condensed version of the Groninger Intelligence Test. The required entry criteria were: good health, limited alcohol consumption, not using medication interacting with vitamin B6 or using supplementation within the period of three months before the trial. Seventy six men were divided into 38 pairs matched for age, vitamin B6 status and Intelligent quotient. By random allocation one member of each pair received 20 mg of pyridoxine hydrochloride orally a day for 12 weeks and the other received placebo. Seveneteen percent of the participants were marginally B6 deficient as defined by levels of plasma pyridoxal-5-phosphate and erythrocyte enzyme asparate aminotransferase. Nine of these were in the placebo and four in the supplement group.</P>

<LI>The Boxes Test (<LINK REF="REF-Earles-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Earles 1995</LINK>): a paper-and pencil test that measures sensory-motor speed. It consists of 100 open boxes and participants are asked to draw lines to complete each box. The score is the total number of boxes completed in 30 seconds.</LI>
<LI>Digit Symbol Coding (<LINK REF="REF-Wechsler-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wechsler 1997</LINK>), a measure of perceptual speed, requires participants to substitute symbols for 133 digits on a printed sheet. The score is the number of correct substitutions completed in 120 seconds.</LI>
<LI>Symbol Search Task (<LINK REF="REF-Wechsler-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wechsler 1997</LINK>): is a subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III and measures perceptual speed. Two columns of symbols are presented and participants required to scan the columns and indicate if a symbol in one column appears also in the other. Final score is the number of symbols identified correctly in 60 seconds.</LI>

<P>
<BR/>2-Working Memory:<BR/>Digit Span Backwards Test (<LINK REF="REF-Wechsler-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wechsler 1997</LINK>): The is the digit span test used in the intelligence and memory scales of the Wechsler batteries as a measure immediate verbal recall. It involves a range of different mental activities including auditory attention and short-term retention. The test consists of two trials for each span length, each string consists of two to eight random number sequences that the examiner read aloud at the rate of one number per second. The participants are required to repeat the number strings in reverse sequence. One point is awarded for each string was recalled correctly; if neither list is repeated successfully, a score of zero is given and the test ended. Average scores on this task decrease about one point during the seventh decade (<LINK REF="REF-Lezak-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lezak 1995</LINK>).<BR/>

<UL>
<LI>The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) (<LINK REF="REF-Rey-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rey 1964</LINK>) is an easily administered test lasting 10 to 15 minutes, that allows comparison between retrieval efficacy and learning. It measures immediate memory span and both short term and longer term retention of a five times presented 15-word list following interpolated activity. that allows a comparison between retrieval efficacy and learning. Scores were range from 1 to 5.</LI>
<LI>Symbol Recall requires recall of symbol-digit pairs from the Digit Symbol Coding test after completing the task.</LI>
<LI>Activity Recall tests ability to remember information that was not explicitly presented as part of a memory task. A recall memory task required the participants to rename the 13 tasks that they had been exposed to and one point was given for each name recalled correctly according to order.</LI>

<LI>Stroop Test (<LINK REF="REF-Dodrill-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodrill 1978</LINK>): this test based on the finding that it takes longer to call out a colour name than to read a word and even longer to read printed colour names printed in a colour different from that named by the word (<LINK REF="REF-Dyer-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyer 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1966</LINK>). Dodrill's format of the Stroop test consists of one sheet containing 176 colour names ("red", "orange", "green" and "blue") printed in a random order and in assorted colours. In phase one of the task the participants are required to read the printed word. The requirement in phase two is to report the colour of each word. The scorer was evaluated as the total time for phase one and the difference in time between phase one and two.</LI>
<LI>Self-Ordered Pointing Task (<LINK REF="REF-Bryan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryan 2001</LINK>). This assesses planning and organizing ability as it relies on self-initiated responses (<LINK REF="REF-Petrides-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrides 1982</LINK>). The task presents arrays of stimulus items, usually abstract designs, in different random-ordered arrays on as many pages as there are items. Participants are required to point at one item per page without repeating an item already pointes at. The participants need to remember each item they have selected and to develop a policy for cumulatively pointing to all the items in the trial.</LI>
<LI>The Common Objects Uses Task (<LINK REF="REF-Getzels-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Getzels 1962</LINK>) requires participants to suggest uses for objects that normally have a single stereotyped function associated with them. Scores are based on the number and originality of the uses proposed.</LI>
<LI>The Trail Making Test (<LINK REF="REF-Reitan-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reitan 1985</LINK>) is a test of visual concept and visuomotor tracking in two parts. In part A participants are given a printed sheet with 1 to 25 randomly printed numbers and the requirement is to draw lines to connect the numbers consecutively. Scores are the times in seconds taken to complete the task. In part B, participants are presented with a sheet with numbers 1-13 and letters A-L printed randomly. The requirement is to connect the numbers and letters in alphabetical and numerical order. Scores are based on the time spent in completing the task.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CESD) (<LINK REF="REF-Radloff-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radloff 1977</LINK>) is a short self-report test designed to assess depressive symptomatology in the general population. The components of the scale include depressive mood, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbance. Each of 20 times is scored 1 to 4 point with higher scores indicating more symptoms of depressed mood.</LI>
<LI>The Profile of Mood States questionnaire (POMS) (<LINK REF="REF-McNair-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNair 1971</LINK>) is an assessment of six aspects of mood: tension and anxiety, depression and dejection, anger and hostility, vigour and activity, fatigue and inertia, and confusion.

<BR/>2-Memory:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Sperling whole report task (<LINK REF="REF-Sperling-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sperling 1960</LINK>). Whole reports are usually called immediate-memory reports.The span of immediate memory is a span of apprehension for particular stimulus material under stated observation conditions as assessed by the maximum number of items an individual can report. Thirty slides of 12 letters are presented for a very short time of 250, 150 and 50 ms within the same overall presentation time. The requirement is to report as many letters as possible in 6 s.</LI>
<LI>As a measure of short-term verbal memory the Associated Learning Task (<LINK REF="REF-Emmen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emmen 1988</LINK>) was applied. Participants undergo three trials in which nine pairs of names and occupations appear on a computer screen at rate of one pair every three seconds. After this presentation, participants are presented with nine slides each showing one name with the nine alternative occupations. Participants press a keyboard digit to identify the appropriate matching occupation. The score is the number of associations correctly identified.</LI>
<LI>Long term verbal memory: The Associated Recognition Task is used to evaluate long term verbal memory. The Associated Learning Task was applied after a delay for one hour. The requirement is to remember as much as possible of the associated learning task. The number of correct response is a measure of long term memory.</LI>
<LI>Long term memory storage: The "forget score" for each participant was calculated as his Associated Learning Test score minus his Associated Recognition Task score. Higher sores indicated poorer long-term memory storage.</LI>
<LI>Long term visual memory. Participants were presented for 15 seconds with a slide of nine pictures. They were then presented with 15 pictures required to decide which had been on the original slide. There was no time limit to performing this task. The score was the number of correct identifications.</LI>
<LI>Attention and performance: The cognition computer program (<LINK REF="REF-Klemenjak-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klemenjak 1983</LINK>) was used to assess attention, perception and concentration. The participants were presented with five display fields, four at the top of the computer screen and one at the bottom. The requirement is to decide whether the figure at the bottom is matched by one of those at the top. Scores reflect the number of correct responses and the time needed to complete the task.</LI>
<LI>Perceptual motor skill: The Vienna Determination Unit was used to assess perceptual-motor skills. This requires different motor responses to a range of stimuli, visual and auditory, presented simultaneously.</LI>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-04-03 10:43:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Conclusions from this review are necessarily limited. There were no data on the effects of vitamin B6 on older people with dementia, and there have been no long-term studies. The trials reviewed involved small numbers of healthy participants over a short period of intervention of 5 to 12 weeks. The two studies enrolled participants of different sexes, used varied doses of vitamin B6, different trial period and different rating scales to assess the outcomes. Some cognitive differences between the sexes have been documented. For example, women tend to outperform men in psychomotor speed and accuracy (<LINK REF="REF-Majeres-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majeres 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Majeres-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majeres 1990</LINK>), while men score better in visuospatial tests (<LINK REF="REF-Karnovsky-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karnovsky 1974</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bryan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bryan 2002</LINK> assessed cognition and mood performance on a set of scales that correlate significantly with the educational background of the participants and task repetition had affected the time of completion of the performance on cognition batteries of both placebo and supplement groups.The treatment interaction effects of supplementation was significant in the vitamin B6 and placebo groups.</P>
<P>This review provides some evidence that 20 mg of vitamin B6 daily has an impact on vitamin B6 levels as measured biochemically in healthy older healthy men. Although no overall effects on cognition or mood were observed in the study groups as a whole and in the short term, this cannot exclude the possibility of longer term benefit for a subgroup of older people with vitamin B6 deficiency. A further possible complication is that high doses of vitamin B6 may actually impair memorization (<LINK REF="REF-Molimard-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molimard 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>At present there is no evidence to support the use of vitamin B6 supplements for improving cognitive function or mood of older people.<BR/>
</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence that vitamin B6 supplementation has any effect an mood or cognitive functions of older people. Vitamin B6 supplementation improves biochemical indices of vitamin B6 status in older men, suggesting that some may be deficient in the vitamin.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further randomized controlled studies are needed to evaluate the effects of vitamin B6 in reducing the risk of developing cognitive decline in the general population and in improving the cognitive and mood functions in people with dementia. Studies need to be long term and to be designed to permit subgroup analysis restricted to individuals with biochemical evidence of vitamin B6 deficiency. </P>
