<P>The efficacy of galantamine has been tested in two randomised controlled trials for the treatment of vascular dementia and for a mixed population of Alzheimer's disease patients with evidence of cerebrovascular disease on scanning. The rationale behind its use is to correct the cholinergic deficit seen in vascular dementia. This review found evidence of benefit for galantamine compared with placebo in measures of cognition in both studies. Both studies indicated higher rates of nausea and vomiting in patients taking galantamine compared with placebo.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-02-25 14:48:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline Birks">
<P>Vascular dementia represents the second most common type of dementia after that caused by Alzheimer's disease. Particularly in older patients, the combination of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease is common and is referred to as mixed dementia. The classification of vascular dementia broadly follows three clinico-pathological processes: multi-infarct dementia, single strategic infarct dementia and subcortical dementia. Not all patients fulfil strict criteria for dementia and may be significantly cognitively impaired without memory loss and the term vascular cognitive impairment is more useful. Currently, no established standard treatment for vascular cognitive impairment exists. Reductions in acetylcholine and acetyltransferase activity are common to both Alzheimer's disease and vascular cognitive impairment raising the possibility that cholinesterase inhibitors such as galantamine may be beneficial for the latter.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-02-25 14:49:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials were identified from a search of ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group&#8217;s Specialized Register on 12 January 2013. The register contains information on trials identified from frequent searches of a number of major healthcare and medical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS) as well as from a number of international and national trial registries and grey literature sources. The terms used were: galantamine, galanthamine, Reminyl, Razadyne, Nivalin.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-01-04 17:03:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline Birks">
<P>All unconfounded randomised double-blind trials comparing galantamine with placebo were eligible for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-02-25 14:49:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline Birks">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted the data from included studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-03-11 11:59:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline Birks">
<P>Two trials, 1378 participants, employing randomised, double-blind, parallel-group methodology were included. Both trials were of six months duration and were testing a galantamine dose of 16-24 mg/day in two divided doses. Both trials had an overall low risk of bias.</P>
<P>The GAL-INT-6 trial included 592 patients with vascular dementia diagnosed according to recognised criteria and patients with Alzheimer's disease and coincidental radiographic findings of cerebrovascular disease. Limited outcome data were reported for the subgroup data with vascular dementia. In the whole trial population, statistically significant treatment effects in favour of galantamine compared with placebo in cognition (ADAS-cog, mean difference (MD) -2.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.46 to -1.12, P = 0.0001 ), activities of daily living (DAD, MD 4.10, 95% CI 1.25 to 6.95, P = 0.005) and behaviour (NPI, MD -2.06, 95% CI -4.09 to -0.03, P = 0.05 ) were noted. Significantly higher numbers of patients dropped out, (102/396 galantamine, 33/196 placebo odds ratio (OR) 1.71, 95% CL 1.11 to 2.65, P = 0.02) and withdrew due to an adverse event from the group treated with galantamine compared with the placebo group (79/396 galantamine, 16/196 placebo, OR 2.80, 95% CI 1.59 to 4.95, P =0.0004).</P>
<P>Data were also included from a second larger trial (GAL-INT-26) involving 788 patients with vascular dementia diagnosed using standard criteria. Statistically significant benefits favouring galantamine over placebo in assessments of cognition (ADAS-cog, MD -1.50, 95% CI -2.39 to -0.61, P = 0.0009), and favouring placebo compared with galantamine for behaviour (NPI, MD 1.80, 95% CI 0.29 to 3.31, P = 0.02) are recorded. Significantly higher numbers of patients dropped out from the group treated with galantamine compared with the placebo group (50/396 galantamine, 25/390 placebo OR 2.11, 95% CL 1.28 to 3.49, P = 0.004).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-01-04 17:08:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline Birks">
<P>Limited data were available when considering the impact of galantamine on vascular dementia or vascular cognitive impairment. The data available suggest some advantage over placebo in the areas of cognition and global clinical state. In both included trials galantamine produced higher rates of gastrointestinal side-effects. More studies are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-03-11 11:59:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline Birks">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-02-25 15:14:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline Birks">
<P>Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common subtype of dementia affecting around one quarter of all dementia sufferers. Cases of mixed vascular and Alzheimer's disease (AD) raise the proportion to around 50%. In line with demographic changes, the absolute number of patients with VaD is rising.</P>
<P>The diagnosis of VaD requires the presence of dementia, evidence of cerebrovascular disease on brain scanning and a likely association between the two. The requirement for memory impairment as a criterion for defining dementia excludes people who nonetheless experience significant cognitive dysfunction. The more comprehensive term "vascular cognitive impairment" (VCI) is sometimes preferred.</P>
<P>Several forms of vascular damage can lead to cognitive impairment. Traditional concepts based on stroke and multi-infarct dementia are outdated as VCI arises from a broader range of pathologies. The most common form of VCI is due to the combination of vascular disease and AD (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-CFAS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC CFAS 2001</LINK>). The two conditions share similar risk factors and their histopathological features may overlap. It has been suggested that small vessel ischaemia may produce both Alzheimer's type pathology or white matter damage (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vascular cognitive impairment in the absence of AD may be secondary to large cortical infarcts at one extreme or diffuse white matter lesions at the other (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003</LINK>). Small infarcts or lacunae may also be a feature. Unsurprisingly, VCI presents in different ways depending on the location of the neurological damage and the pathogenic mechanism. Single strategic infarcts present abruptly, while the onset of impairment due to subcortical change in the form of lacunae or white matter damage may be more insidious. Relative preservation of memory in a setting of impairment of attention and executive dysfunction is typical, and the underlying damage is to the neuronal circuitry of the prefrontal region rather than of the mesial temporal lobe (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Erkinjuntti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erkinjuntti 2000</LINK>). Non-cognitive features such as depression, apathy and emotional lability may also occur (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2000</LINK>). Physical impairment such as gait disorder or imbalance may be a concomitant feature (<LINK REF="REF-Pohjasvaara-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pohjasvaara 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Currently, no standard treatment for VCI exists and clinicians must extrapolate from large primary and secondary prevention trials in ischaemic heart disease, hypertension and stroke. Cholinesterase inhibitors modestly improve a range of symptoms in some patients with AD through enhancement of cholinergic neurotransmission. Reductions in acetylcholine and acetyltransferase activity are noted to differing degrees in both AD and VCI, raising the possibility that these drugs may also be beneficial in the latter (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perry-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toghi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toghi 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The three cholinesterase inhibitors used for the treatment of AD internationally are donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine. Placebo-controlled trials involving large numbers of patients have demonstrated clear cognitive benefit in AD with each drug. Additional gain has also been demonstrated in other areas such as activities of daily living (ADL), global functioning and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors in VCI is less clear. A Cochrane review of the role of donepezil in VCI noted improvements in cognitive function and activities of daily living as well as a more global measures of change (<LINK REF="REF-Malouf-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malouf 2004</LINK>). Galantamine (marketed as Reminyl by Janssen) is an alkaloid originally extracted from Amaryllidaceae (<I>Galanthus woronowi</I>, the Caucasian snowdrop and daffodil bulbs) but now synthesised. It is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase with very little butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity (<LINK REF="REF-Lilienfeld-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lilienfeld 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two review authors (DC, JB) independently discarded publications deemed as irrelevant on the basis of title and abstract. Disagreements between review authors about final inclusion of trials were resolved by discussion and external expert advice.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>The methodological quality of each selected trial (<LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_26" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-26</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-6</LINK>) was based on the 'Risk of bias' tool.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Data were extracted from the published reports. The summary statistics required for each trial and each outcome for continuous data are the mean change from baseline, the standard error of the mean change, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each assessment. Where changes from baseline were not reported, the mean, standard deviation and the number of patients for each treatment group at each time point were extracted if available.</P>
<P>For binary data the numbers in each treatment group and the numbers experiencing the outcome of interest were sought.</P>
<P>The baseline assessment was defined as the latest available assessment prior to randomisation, but no longer than two months prior.</P>
<P>For each outcome measure, data were sought on every patient randomised. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the data were sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. If intention-to-treat data were not available in the publications, "on-treatment" or the data of those who complete the trial were sought and indicated as such.</P>
<P>Data from titration phases prior to the randomised phase were not used to assess safety or efficacy because patients were usually not randomised, nor were treatments concealed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>The outcomes measured in clinical trials of dementia and cognitive impairment often arise from ordinal rating scales. Where the rating scales used in the trials have a reasonably large number of ordered categories (more than 10), the data were treated as continuous outcomes arising from a normal distribution.</P>
<P>Summary statistics (number (n), mean and standard deviation) were required for each rating scale at each assessment time point for each treatment group in each trial for change from baseline.</P>
<P>When change from baseline results was not reported, the required summary statistics were calculated from the baseline and assessment time treatment group means and standard deviations. In this case a zero correlation between the measurements at baseline and assessment time was assumed. This method overestimates the standard deviation of the change from baseline, but this conservative approach is considered to be preferable in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis requires the combination of data from the trials that may not use the same rating scale to assess an outcome. The measure of the treatment difference for any outcome was the mean difference when the pooled trials used the same rating scale or test, and the standardised mean difference, which is the absolute mean difference divided by the standard deviation when they used different rating scales or tests.</P>
<P>The duration of the trials may vary considerably. If the range was considered too great to combine all trials into one meta-analysis, it was divided into smaller time periods and a separate meta-analysis conducted for each period. Some trials may contribute data to more than one time period if multiple assessments have been done.</P>
<P>For binary outcomes, such as clinical improvement or no clinical improvement, the odds ratio was used to measure treatment effect. A weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials was calculated.</P>
<P>Overall estimates of the treatment difference were presented. In all cases the overall estimate from a fixed-effect model was presented and a test for heterogeneity using a standard Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic or the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was performed. If, however, there was evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials then either only homogeneous results were pooled, or a random-effects model used (in which case the confidence intervals would be broader than those of a fixed-effect model).</P>

<P>Eligible patients were either diagnosed with probable vascular dementia (VaD) based on NINDS-AIREN (National Institute of Neurological Disorders of Stroke-Association International pour la Recherche et l' Enseignement en Neurosciences) criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Roman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roman 1993</LINK>) or possible Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on NINCDS-ADRDA (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders of Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association) criteria (<LINK REF="REF-McKhann-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKhann 1984</LINK>). They also showed significant radiological evidence of cerebrovascular disease on recent computed tomography (CT) or MR imaging. Patients had an MMSE (mini&#8211;mental state examination)score of 10 to 25 (inclusive), an ADAS-cog/11 score of 12 or greater, and evidence from a carer on the patients ability to perform ADLs on the DAD scale. Evidence was required of relevant focal neurological signs consistent with previous stroke and cerebrovascular disease. Three diagnostic groups were identified. Where there was a history of progressive worsening of memory and other cognitive functions for at least six months combined with radiological evidence of cerebrovascular disease, patients were labelled as having AD with cerebrovascular lesions (50% of patients). Where there was dementia within three months of a stroke or a history of fluctuating or stepwise progression then patients were given the diagnosis of probable VaD (41% of patients). In cases where it was difficult to make a clear-cut differentiation, the term 'intermediate diagnosis' was used (9% of patients). Patients were excluded if they had, other than AD, Huntington disease, other neurodegenerative dementia, any serious comorbid medical condition, or if they were using drugs for dementia.</P>
<P>All randomised patients who received at least one dose of trial medication and had some follow-up data after baseline, the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, were included in analyses of baseline and safety data. The primary efficacy analyses were based on an observed case population, those in the ITT population with observed data at each scheduled assessment visit. In addition, last observation carried forward (LOCF) analyses were carried out on data from the ITT population with LOCF to replace missing assessments.</P>
<P>The primary end-points were cognition (using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale, ADAS-cog) and global functioning (using the Clinician's Interview-based Impression of Change plus caregiver input, CIBIC-plus). Secondary efficacy measures were ADAS-cog/13, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1994</LINK>)and the disability assessment in dementia DAD (<LINK REF="REF-Gelinas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelinas 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_26" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-26</LINK> is a 26-week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 788 patients (390 received placebo and 396 received galantamine) aged between 40 and 90 years. All patients completed a four-week, single-blind placebo run-in period before randomisation. Galantamine was initiated at 4 mg twice daily for four weeks, followed by 8 mg twice daily for four weeks, followed by 12 mg twice daily if the previous dose was tolerated.</P>
<P>The prevalence of vascular diseases was high in the selected sample (91% of the patients had cardiovascular risk factors). The diagnosis of VaD was based on NINDS-AIREN criteria. MRI was used to confirm the clinical diagnosis of VaD. Patients had an MMSE score of 10 to 26 (inclusive), and an ADAS-cog/11 score of 12 or greater. Patients were excluded if they had AD, Huntington disease, other neurodegenerative dementia, any serious comorbid medical condition, or if they were using drugs for dementia.</P>
<P>Primary outcomes were analysed via a modified ITT analysis in which galantamine (8 mg or 12 mg twice daily) was compared with placebo. The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population was defined as including all participants who had both a baseline assessment and at least one post-treatment assessment within therapeutic reach for at least one of the primary efficacy variables. Therapeutic reach was given as the maximum number of days between the last dose of the trial drug and the outcome assessment and was set at seven days, based on galantamine's pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.</P>
<P>Primary outcomes were cognition (using the ADAS-cog sum of 11 cognitive items, ADAS-cog/11(<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1984</LINK>)) and activities of daily living score (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living inventory (ADCS-ADL) (<LINK REF="REF-Galasko-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galasko 1997</LINK>)). Secondary objectives were to evaluate effects of galantamine on global clinical assessment (CIBIC-plus), behaviour (NPI, (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1994</LINK>)), and other cognitive scores based on the ADAS-cog/11 (ADAS-cog/13, ADAS-cog/10, and ADAS-cog/memory). The effect of galantamine on executive function was assessed using the EXIT-25 scale (Executive Interview) (<LINK REF="REF-Royall-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royall 1992</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Description of the outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>1. The first primary outcome test in the study <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-6</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_26" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-26</LINK> was the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog/11) (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1984</LINK>): a standard scale which assesses a set of cognitive functions including memory, language, and praxis. The battery comprises 11 individual tests, spoken language ability (0 - 5), comprehension of spoken language (0 - 5), recall of test instructions (0 - 5), word finding difficulty (0 - 5), following orders (0 - 5), naming object (0 - 5), construction drawing (0 - 5), ideational praxis (0 - 5), orientation (0 - 8), word recall (0 - 10) and word recognition (0 - 2). The score ranges from 0 to 70 (higher the score = greater impairment). The ADAS-cog/13 (score range 0 - 85, has the additional items of concentration and distractibility and delayed word recall test), ADAS-cog/10 (score range 0 - 53, includes only non-memory items) and ADAS-cog/memory (score range 0 - 32, includes memory items) were measures of secondary outcomes in <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_26" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-26</LINK>, and ADAS-cog/13 in <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-6</LINK>.</P>
<P>2. The second primary outcome test in the study <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_26" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-26</LINK> was the ADCS-ADL (<LINK REF="REF-Galasko-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galasko 1997</LINK>), the AD Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Scale, which assesses basic and instrumental ADLs. It requires an interview with a caregiver familiar with the behaviour of the patient. The items include ratings of the patient's ability to eat, dress, bathe, telephone, travel, shop, and perform other household duties. Lower scores indicate greater functional impairment. Basic ADLs (scoring range 0 - 22) includes items for eating, walking, toileting, bathing, grooming, dressing, selection of clothes, and physical performance. Instrumental ADLs (scoring range 0 - 56) includes items for telephone, television, conversation, dishes, managing personal belongings, obtaining beverages, making a meal or snack, disposal of garbage, travel outside home, shopping, keeping appointments, ability to be left alone, current events, reading, writing, hobbies, and household appliances.</P>
<P>3. The primary outcome measure of global change in <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-6</LINK> and a secondary outcome measure used in the study <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_26" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-26</LINK> was the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change-plus care-giver input version (CIBIC-plus) (<LINK REF="REF-Knopman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knopman 1994</LINK>): a global assessment instrument that provides an index of clinically important change for the assessment of dementia patients. The rating of patient function focuses on domains of concentration, orientation, memory, language, behaviour, initiative and activities of daily living. The scale rating is made on a seven-point scale.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Very much improved: a major activity in the patient's daily routine or in mental status has been regained in addition to regaining functional independence.</LI>
<LI>Improved: in this stage some measures of functional independence- social, instrumental, cognitive has been regained.</LI>
<LI>Minimally improved: a noticeable change in the patient's functioning, social interactions, or mental clarity.</LI>
<LI>Indicating no change since baseline.</LI>
<LI>Minimally worsened: a marked decline in patient's functioning, social interactions, or mental clarity in any aspects of performance.</LI>
<LI>Worsened: a functional dependence on some measure.</LI>
<LI>Very much worse: there is a loss of a major activity in patient's daily activity or mental status as well as the loss of functional independence.</LI>
</OL>
<P>4. The EXIT-25 (<LINK REF="REF-Royall-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royall 1992</LINK>), a secondary outcome measure in <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_26" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-26</LINK>, consists of 25 items that assess executive function including number-letter task, verbal and design fluency, finger/nose testing, conflicting instruction and echopraxia (involuntary repetition or imitation of another person's actions). The test is scored from 0 - 50 with higher scores indicating a greater executive dysfunction.</P>
<P>5. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1994</LINK>), a secondary outcome measure in <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-6</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_26" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-26</LINK>, is a 12-item, carer-rated instrument used to evaluate behavioural and neuropsychiatric symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor behaviour, night-time behaviour, and appetite/eating disorder. A lower score indicates improvement.<BR/>
</P>
<P>6. The disability assessment in dementia (DAD, <LINK REF="REF-Gelinas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelinas 1999</LINK>) grades the ability to execute daily activities across six domains thus: basic, initiation, instrumental, leisure, performance, and planning. Positive changes indicate improvement.</P>
<P>
<BR/>Safety for both studies was assessed by monitoring of adverse events, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, vital signs, body weight, and laboratory tests.</P>

<P>For <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-6</LINK> treatment allocation was randomised according to a code generated by the Janssen Research Foundation. Dose escalation was carried out at weekly intervals. Galantamine and placebo were administered as identical tablets taken twice daily. For <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_26" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-26</LINK> treatment allocation was randomised using IVRS provided by Covance. Blinding was ensured by using the same escalation schedule for both galantamine and placebo groups. The examiner who measured the drug's efficacy in a patient was not the same person who treated that patient and recorded adverse events. Overall, both trials were free from high risk of bias.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-02-25 15:17:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline Birks">
<P>In this review we examined the effect of galantamine in patients with vascular dementia (VaD)/cognitive impairment. The only clinical trial identified that focused specifically on VaD, <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_26" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-26</LINK>, showed statistically significant benefits in favour of galantamine in cognition, and in favour of placebo in behavioural symptoms over a short period of 26 weeks. Adverse effects were noted to be higher in the galantamine-treated group and twice the number of participants (13% versus 6%) had more than one adverse events leading to withdrawal from medication.</P>
<P>It is difficult to reach firm conclusions regarding the other included trial, <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-6</LINK>. The trial population was composed of patients with VaD diagnosed according to recognised criteria (41% of patients), most of whom had stroke, plus patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and radiographic evidence of cerebrovascular disease (50% of patients). In this population benefits across a range of domains (cognition, activities of daily living, and behaviour ) favouring galantamine were noted but these should be viewed in the context of significantly higher rates of adverse events and significantly higher withdrawal rates in the galantamine-treated group.</P>
<P>A report of the six month open-label extension of <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-6</LINK> (<LINK REF="STD-Small-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Small 2003</LINK>) demonstrated that patients treated with galantamine were able to maintain their cognitive scores throughout the total duration of this study. Interpretation of results is difficult when both VaD and AD plus cerebrovascular disease are analysed collectively in this way as the response to galantamine may be due to the drug effect on the AD component. There is limited utility in including AD patients with concomitant cerebrovascular disease in clinical trials until more is understood regarding the symptomatology and natural history of what might be considered 'mixed' dementia. In general, trying to define treatment response prior to defining the natural history of the condition one is hoping to improve is potentially frustrating and undermines conclusions from treatment trials such as <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-6</LINK>. Both <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_26" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-26</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-GAL_x002d_INT_x002d_6" TYPE="STUDY">GAL-INT-6</LINK> relied on the NINDS-AIREN (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseigement en Neurosciences) criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Roman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roman 1993</LINK>) for possible or probable VaD. These criteria, which capture VaD in all its forms, may not be optimal for interpreting the results of large randomised controlled trials when distinct pathologies are likely to influence clinical response.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-02-25 15:17:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are some weak indications that galantamine is useful in improving cognition in dementia secondary to vascular damage. However, the possible benefit must be balanced against the potential to harm as active treatment was associated with higher rates of adverse event (nausea and vomiting) and withdrawal. These patients desperately need better treatment options and clearer management strategies. Before recommending galantamine for the treatment of VaD, well-designed and adequately powered trials of sufficient duration which clearly define the subgroup of VaD under investigation are needed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-01-03 14:53:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline Birks">
<P>Further research into the aetiological mechanisms and clinico-pathological subtypes of VaD is needed as more accurate division of patient groups within the context of clinical trials may better demonstrate useful treatment effects. Further exploration of the cholinergic deficiencies in the brain of patients with dementia and vascular pathology would strengthen the rationale for using this potentially helpful group of drugs.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Randomisation occurred immediately before double-blind trial medication administered. The participant's number and treatment code were assigned after phoning into IVRS provided by Covance, which is a remote data entry system used to collect and retrieve standard information such as the participant's drug treatment assignment and number. The caller used their own user ID and PIN, and then gave the requested participant details, e.g., participant's initials, date of birth. Based on this information, IVRS assigned a unique participant number and treatment code, which dictated the treatment assignment for that participant.<BR/>
