<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-03-06 14:38:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>A fetal heart rate that is abnormal or not reassuring during labour may be caused by the inability of the baby to adapt to decreases in oxygen supply during the birth. Inadequate oxygen supply may lead to the development of acidosis (low pH levels) and increased lactate in the blood. After the amniotic membranes have ruptured and the cervix dilated to around 3 cm, it is possible to measure lactate (or pH) levels in a sample of blood taken from the baby's scalp. A much smaller amount of blood is needed for the lactate test than to measure pH. This review identified two studies of 3348 mother-baby pairs that compared lactate and pH testing in labour. Lactate testing was more likely to be successful than pH testing, but with no differences in newborn outcomes, including the number of babies with low Apgar scores, low pH in their cord blood or admissions to the neonatal intensive care nursery. There were no differences in the number of mothers having caesarean sections, forceps or vacuum births between the two groups. We conclude that lactate testing in labour may be more likely to be successfully achieved than pH testing.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-04-15 13:27:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Fetal scalp blood sampling for lactate estimation may be considered following identification of an abnormal or non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern. The smaller volume of blood required for this test, compared with the more traditional pH estimation, may improve sampling rates. The appropriate use of this practice mandates systematic review of its safety and clinical effectiveness prior to widespread introduction.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-04-15 13:27:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We used the standard methodological procedures of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. Two review authors independently assessed the studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-24 08:25:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The search identified two completed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and two ongoing trials. The two published RCTs considered outcomes for 3348 mother-baby pairs allocated to either lactate or pH estimation of fetal blood samples when clinically indicated in labour. Overall, the published RCTs were of low or unclear risk of bias. There was a high risk of performance bias, because it would not have been feasible to blind clinicians or participants.</P>
<P>No statistically significant between-group differences were found for neonatal encephalopathy (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 3.09, one study, 2992 infants) or death. No studies reported neonatal seizures. We had planned to report death with other morbidities, for example, neonatal encephalopathy; however, the data were not available in a format suitable for this, therefore death due to congenital abnormality was considered alone. The three reported neonatal deaths occurred in babies with diaphragmatic hernias (n = 2) or congenital cardiac fibrosis (n = 1). All three babies had been randomised to the pH group and were not acidaemic at birth.</P>
<P>There were no statistically significant differences for any of the pre-specified secondary fetal/neonatal/infant outcomes for which data were available. This included low Apgar score at five minutes (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.68, two studies, 3319 infants) and admission to neonatal intensive care units (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.25, one study, 2992 infants), or metabolic acidaemia (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.36, one study, 2675 infants) considered within the studies, either overall or where data were available for those where fetal blood sampling had occurred within 60 minutes of delivery.</P>
<P>Similar proportions of fetuses underwent additional tests to further evaluate well-being during labour, including scalp pH if in the lactate group or scalp lactate if in the pH group (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.30, two studies, 3333 infants;Tau 1.00, I = 58%). Fetal blood sampling attempts for lactate and pH estimation were successful in 98.7% and 79.4% of procedures respectively in the one study that reported this outcome.</P>
<P>There were no significant between-group differences in mode of birth or operative birth for non-reassuring fetal status, either for all women, or within the group where the fetal blood sample had been taken within 60 minutes of delivery (for example, caesarean section for all enrolled, RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.22, two studies, 3319 women; operative delivery for non-reassuring fetal status for all enrolled RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.11, one study, 2992 women).</P>
<P>Neither study reported on adverse effects of fetal scalp lacerations or maternal anxiety.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-03-06 14:38:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>When further testing to assess fetal well-being in labour is indicated, fetal scalp blood lactate estimation is more likely to be successfully undertaken than pH estimation. Further studies may consider subgroup analysis by gestational age, the stage of labour and sampling within a prolonged second stage of labour. Additionally, we await the findings from the ongoing studies that compare allocation to no fetal blood sample with sampling for lactate and address longer-term neonatal outcomes, maternal satisfaction with intrapartum fetal monitoring and an economic analysis.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-04-15 13:28:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-01-28 05:09:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cardiotocography (CTG), often referred to as electronic fetal monitoring (EFM), records the fetal heart rate and uterine contractions to paper or computer, or both. It was introduced in the 1960s with the aim of improving neonatal outcomes by improving intrapartum fetal surveillance. External monitoring of the fetal heart is achieved using an ultrasound transducer placed on the mother's abdomen, over the region of the baby's heart. Once the amniotic membranes have ruptured, it is also possible to monitor the fetal heart rate by attaching an electrode to the baby's scalp. Fetal heart rate patterns can be classified in a number of ways. These include: (i) normal/reassuring; and (ii) when meeting the criteria for normal or reassuring, a range of terms including non-reassuring, suspicious, atypical, abnormal, pathological or ominous. These classifications are based on the fetal heart rate, its variability and the presence of accelerations or decelerations, compared with the occurrence of uterine contractions.</P>
<P>There is not universal agreement on the definition of these patterns (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Tommaso-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Tommaso 2013</LINK>). Several groups have published guidelines in an attempt to improve uniformity of interpretation. Examples include the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (<LINK REF="REF-RANZCOG-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RANZCOG 2014</LINK>), Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (<LINK REF="REF-NCCWCH-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCWCH 2007</LINK>), Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (<LINK REF="REF-Liston-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liston 2007</LINK>) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2009</LINK>). Consistent with some of these guidelines and with the clinical practice of the review team, we will generally refer to 'non-reassuring fetal status/CTG/patterns' in this review, rather than the term 'fetal distress' which is sometimes used inappropriately to refer to CTGs that do not meet normal/reassuring/abnormal status (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2005</LINK>). Reassuring patterns require no specific action. Non-reassuring patterns occur in approximately 15% to 19% of labours (<LINK REF="REF-East-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Umstad-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Umstad 1993</LINK>) and may prompt clinical actions ranging from simple manoeuvres, such as a change of maternal position, improved maternal hydration, through to expedited birth of the baby (by caesarean section, forceps or vacuum), with the aim of preventing or minimising hypoxia in the fetus.</P>
<P>Non-reassuring CTG patterns may reflect the ability of the individual fetus to adapt to decreases in oxygen supply. Inadequate oxygen supply results in anaerobic metabolism of glucose, which leads to metabolic acidosis. Anaerobic glycolysis results in acidosis through the production of pyruvate, with some conversion to lactate. Low pH is a combined measure of both metabolic acidosis (including base deficit) and the more labile component, respiratory acidosis. The differences in individual fetal responses to a decrease in oxygen (and therefore differences in heart rate changes) mean that the positive predictive value of CTG for adverse outcome is low and the negative predictive value high (<LINK REF="REF-Bogdanovic-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bogdanovic 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holzmann-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holzmann 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nonnenmacher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nonnenmacher 2010</LINK>), although this has the potential for improvement with computerised interpretation of CTGs (<LINK REF="REF-Georgieva-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Georgieva 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strachan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strachan 2001</LINK>). This means that a normal CTG usually indicates reassuring fetal status, while a non-reassuring CTG does not necessarily equate with 'fetal distress'. These features, combined with marked inter-observer variation in CTG interpretation by midwives (<LINK REF="REF-Devane-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devane 2005</LINK>) and doctors (<LINK REF="REF-Palomaki-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palomaki 2006</LINK>), result in variable but inappropriately high operative birth rates for non-reassuring fetal status in many hospitals.</P>
<P>Once a non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern is identified during labour, a number of additional assessments of fetal well-being may be considered. Some clinicians may also consider these in the presence of an ominous pattern, rather than proceeding with immediate delivery. These tests aim to assist the clinician to determine which baby may benefit from expedited birth and for which baby labour may be continued safely. Answers are rarely clear cut and the pros and cons of further tests and potential consequences need to be discussed with the mother. These tests do not replace the CTG, but complement it. Cochrane reviews have examined the safety and efficacy of several additional testing options, including fetal pulse oximetry (<LINK REF="REF-East-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2014</LINK>), fetal electrocardiography (ECG) for changes in the ST-segment or PR interval patterns (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2013</LINK>), vibroacoustic stimulation (sound and vibration) (<LINK REF="REF-East-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2013</LINK>) and near-infrared spectroscopy (a measure of blood oxygen levels) (<LINK REF="REF-Mozurkewich-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozurkewich 2000</LINK>). The addition of fetal scalp blood sampling (FBS) for pH estimation to standard EFM may reduce the caesarean section rate, although the odds of having a caesarean birth are still increased compared to intermittent auscultation of the fetal heart (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2013</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-10-30 05:00:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampaon">
<P>Following identification of one abnormal or two non-reassuring features on the CTG, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends FBS for pH estimation, with a published action algorithm based on the result (<LINK REF="REF-NCCWCH-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCWCH 2007</LINK>). Collection of a small blood sample from the fetal scalp (a fetal blood sample) for blood gas analysis has been practiced since the 1960s (<LINK REF="REF-Saling-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saling 1967</LINK>). It is contra-indicated when the mother is known to have HIV or hepatitis, or where there is suspicion of a bleeding tendency in the fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Maiques-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maiques 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pachydakis-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pachydakis 2006</LINK>). Following rupture of the amniotic membranes and at cervical dilatation greater than or equal to approximately 3 cm, an amnioscope is placed vaginally to allow adequate visualisation of the fetal head. A small sample of blood is then taken from the fetal scalp.</P>
<P>This procedure may be uncomfortable and intrusive for the mother, is invasive to the baby and expensive. Rare complications include infection and haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Jaiyesimi-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaiyesimi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maiques-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maiques 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schaap-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaap 2011</LINK>). Traditionally, such testing has required approximately 30 to 50 microlitres of blood, which is often difficult to obtain. Even when the clinician is able to collect this quantity of blood, samples are frequently rejected by the testing equipment due to contamination with air or amniotic fluid. Some equipment can also analyse for other components, such as lactate. Fetal lactate testing equipment requiring a much smaller blood volume (as little as 5 microlitres) is now available (<LINK REF="STD-Wiberg_x002d_Itzel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wiberg-Itzel 2008</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-04-15 13:28:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Fetal scalp blood samples of lactate taken within 60 minutes of birth correlate well with umbilical arterial and venous lactate measured following delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Bowler-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowler 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kruger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruger 1998</LINK>). Umbilical arterial (UA) lactate values correlate well with UA pH and base deficit values (<LINK REF="REF-Kruger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruger 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramanah-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramanah 2005</LINK>). Fetal scalp lactate values correlate significantly with cardiotocography patterns, scalp pH, UA pH, lactate and base deficit, but not with Apgar scores (<LINK REF="REF-Holzmann-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holzmann 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramanah-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramanah 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Kruger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruger 1999</LINK> retrospectively examined the predictive values of simultaneous fetal scalp blood estimation of lactate and pH (n = 326) for Apgar scores, UA pH, UA base deficit and neonatal encephalopathy. Cut-off values were the 75th percentile for lactate (4.8 mmol/L) and the 25th percentile for pH (7.20). The area under the receiver operator curve was significantly larger for lactate than for pH in predicting neonatal encephalopathy and Apgar score less than four at five minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Kruger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruger 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Ramanah-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramanah 2010</LINK> prospectively examined the predictive value and feasibility of fetal scalp lactate microsampling in the management of non-reassuring fetal status during labour (n = 7617). Using receiver operating characteristic curves, a scalp lactate cut-off value of 5 mmol/L was the most predictive for neonatal acidosis (<LINK REF="REF-Ramanah-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramanah 2010</LINK>). A retrospective study of 229 scalp lactate measurements reported a positive predictive value of 5% and negative predictive value of 98% of the prediction of an umbilical arterial pH measurement of &#8804; 7.10 (<LINK REF="REF-Bowler-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowler 2014</LINK>). These findings and evidence from animal studies of the effects of lactate on brain tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Engidawork-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engidawork 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myers-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 1981</LINK>) suggest that lactate estimation may be a better predictor of severe neonatal morbidity than pH.</P>
</THEORY>

<P>The emerging use of fetal scalp blood sampling for lactate estimation requires systematic evaluation prior to becoming widespread, to ensure the appropriate use of this test in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1994</LINK>). Although many published guidelines of fetal monitoring do not include a recommendation for lactate estimation (including those published by <LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liston-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liston 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCCWCH-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCWCH 2007</LINK>), this trend is changing in some local and national guidelines (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Monash-Health-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monash Health 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RANZCOG-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RANZCOG 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-The-Women_x0027_s-Hospital-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">The Women's Hospital 2014</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">About this review and its update</HEADING>
<P>The original review (<LINK REF="REF-East-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2010</LINK>) and this 2015 update are primarily concerned with the use of fetal scalp lactate sampling in clinical practice. Several of the outcomes of interest would also benefit from a formal review of diagnostic accuracy. However, that is well beyond the scope of this clinical review. Such outcomes include: (i) those that demonstrate the ability of fetal scalp lactate sampling to predict which fetuses are hypoxic or acidaemic, measured after the birth from umbilical arterial cord blood, including pH less than 7.00 (<LINK REF="REF-Sehdev-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sehdev 1997</LINK>) or less than 7.10 (<LINK REF="REF-Arikan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arikan 2000</LINK>), lactate (<LINK REF="REF-White-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2010</LINK>) and base deficit greater than or equal to 12 mmol/L; (ii) clinical outcomes, including Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes (<LINK REF="REF-MacLennan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLennan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sehdev-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sehdev 1997</LINK>), abnormal neurological status of the baby, possibly caused by inadequate supply of oxygen or blood (neonatal encephalopathy) or long-term infant disability, or both. Other outcomes of interest may include the success rate of fetal blood sampling for lactate measurement, the volume of blood required for lactate evaluation and the number of fetal scalp lacerations, including those which became infected or haemorrhaged.</P>
<P>Interventions resulting from additional tests of fetal well-being during labour are also important. For example, overall modes of birth following different forms of monitoring would usually be included in any analysis of this nature. However, it is important to also record specific interventions, such as operative birth (vacuum, forceps and caesarean section) performed for the indication of non-reassuring fetal status, since assessment of fetal well-being is the purpose of fetal lactate measurement.</P>
<P>Operative birth for non-reassuring fetal status has immediate resource implications and long-term effects. For example, the healthcare facility needs to make provision for an urgent caesarean section. The mother may have an improved likelihood of a vaginal birth in a subsequent pregnancy if the index caesarean was performed for non-reassuring fetal status rather than for another reason such as dystocia (<LINK REF="REF-Shipp-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shipp 2000</LINK>). Women's satisfaction with differing forms of fetal monitoring is important in determining the provision of appropriate maternity services (<LINK REF="REF-East-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2006b</LINK>). A cost-effectiveness analysis of the additional costs of fetal scalp lactate sampling, compared with the potential effect of reducing operative birth rates, is also an important consideration (<LINK REF="REF-East-2006c" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2006c</LINK>).</P>

If we identify cluster-randomised trials in future updates of this review, we will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> [Section 16.3.4] using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.

All three babies had been randomised to the pH group and were not acidaemic at birth (RR 0.14. 95% CI 0.01 to 2.76, one study, 2992 infants; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>

Fetal electrocardiography (specifically ST segment analysis) was used in some hospitals in the RCT reported by <LINK REF="STD-Wiberg_x002d_Itzel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wiberg-Itzel 2008</LINK> as an adjunct to fetal heart rate monitoring, similar numbers were randomised to each of the pH and lactate groups.</P>

Failed pH sampling procedures for the 169 original participants of this same study were attributed to birth before the sample could be collected (n = 3), inadequate sample collection (n = 44) and pH meter dysfunction (n = 19). Failed lactate sampling for the study population of 172 was attributed to inadequate sample (n = 1), lactate meter dysfunction (n = 2) or unlikely result (n = 1). Fourteen of these failures were identified as protocol violations and excluded from further analysis, as lactate sampling was then performed in the pH group (n = 13) or pH sampling was performed in the lactate group (n = 1). The report indicated that individuals could have had more than one sampling episode: we have interpreted the reported data to mean that the 14 protocol violations represented 14 mother-baby pairs, rather than 14 of the total 634 samples taken, given the subsequent exclusion of 14 participants. These exclusions translated to the absence of complete data and meant that we were unable to analyse by intention-to-treat. <LINK REF="STD-Westgren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Westgren 1998</LINK> suggested that the failure rate was inversely correlated with cervical dilatation in the pH group, but not the lactate group. More scalp incisions were made for each pH sampling attempt (median 2.0, interquartile range (IQR) 1 to 2) than for lactate (median 1.0, IQR 1 to 1) and there was a longer interval from sampling to available result for pH (median 230 seconds (s), IQR 188 to 300s) compared with lactate estimation (120s, IQR 90 to 147s) (<LINK REF="STD-Westgren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Westgren 1998</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-15 13:30:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This review identified two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that considered some aspects of the effectiveness and risks of fetal scalp lactate sampling compared with pH estimation for the assessment of fetal well-being, following identification of a non-reassuring cardiotocography trace during 3348 labours.쟊actate sampling was more likely to be successful than for pH sampling. This success and speed did not translate to differences in clinical management in terms of mode of birth, or neonatal outcomes evaluated by umbilical cord blood gases, Apgar scores, encephalopathy or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. The studies were underpowered to assess differences in the low prevalence outcomes.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-04-15 13:31:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The studies did not address some of the outcomes of interest for this review, including scalp lacerations/infections, longer-term measures of infant well-being, such as long-term disability, maternal satisfaction with fetal monitoring in labour, maternal anxiety or an economic analysis. Each of these outcomes may impact on the introduction of fetal scalp blood lactate estimation in the clinical setting. One study noted that lower cervical dilatation was associated with greater difficulty in obtaining the fetal blood sampling (FBS) (<LINK REF="STD-Westgren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Westgren 1998</LINK>). However, it was not clear whether cervical dilatation was similar for each group at the time of sampling. This could be important, particularly for lower dilatations, and may have implications for whether equivalent numbers of women had fetal blood sampling in the latent phase of labour (e.g. less than 3 to 4 cm cervical dilatation) compared with those in the active phase of the first stage of labour.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Further considerations</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cut-off values</HEADING>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Westgren-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Westgren 1998</LINK> study did not mandate clinical action at any given fetal scalp blood lactate value, as they considered it important that the clinician consider the full clinical picture, rather than act on a single finding. They did acknowledge that a fetal scalp pH of less than 7.20 or lactate greater than 3.08 mmol/L was considered abnormal, while a lactate level between 2.9 and 3.08 was suspicious. The study report did not provide details of lactate values obtained from the FBS attempts or any estimation of the predictive value of the results. The available data would appear to support the action cut-off value greater than 4.8 mmol/L for intervention, measured with the Lactate Pro (Arkray, Kyoto, Japan) in the RCT reported by <LINK REF="STD-Wiberg_x002d_Itzel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wiberg-Itzel 2008</LINK>. Some hospitals publish internal guidelines on cut-off values: for example, one such guideline uses the same meter as that used by <LINK REF="STD-Wiberg_x002d_Itzel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wiberg-Itzel 2008</LINK> and recommends escalating levels of urgent delivery when lactate values exceed 4.7 mmol/L (<LINK REF="REF-The-Women_x0027_s-Hospital-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">The Women's Hospital 2014</LINK>). These cut-off values are considerably higher than the cut-off value of 4.2 mmol/L recommended following an observational study by <LINK REF="REF-Allen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2004</LINK>, using the Accusport (Boeringer, Mannheim, East Sussex, UK) and a report by <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1983</LINK>. Different point-of-care meters such as the Lactate Pro and the Nova Biomedical Statstrip Express may provide differing lactate results, with or without correction for the high haematocrit of fetal blood, when compared with each other and with a laboratory reference standard (<LINK REF="REF-Orsonneau-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orsonneau 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reif-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reif 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Su-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2013</LINK>). The cut-off lactate value must therefore be considered specifically for the lactate meter in use. Whilst it is beyond the scope of this review to recommend a specific meter or cut-off values, one option for those developing guidelines for their institution may be to base their recommendations on values used in studies performed with the specific lactate meter in use at the hospital's birthing facility.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Normal lactate in umbilical bloods: gestation</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Wiberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiberg 2008</LINK> studied umbilical blood lactate concentrations in 10,169 "vigorous" newborns, presumably healthy, born vaginally either spontaneously or with instrumental assistance, to establish reference ranges. The study demonstrated a linear relationship between logarithmic lactate values and gestational age commencing from 34 weeks' gestation.쟕he study had relatively few numbers below 34 weeks' gestation (n = 207), so these results may vary if studied in a larger cohort and in addition, may be influenced by the reason for preterm birth. Following exclusion of instrumental deliveries, linear regression analysis revealed duration of second stage as an independent variable. The variation in umbilical arterial lactate values at term ranged from a mean of 3.5 mmol/L at 37 weeks to 4.3 mmol/L at 42 weeks' gestation. According to these data, the use of the cut-off value for lactate as 4.8 mmol/L would not result in any unnecessary interventions, even in babies at 42 weeks' gestation. This study excluded babies with complicated pregnancies and those born by caesarean section. No studies have addressed the significance of a relative rise in lactate levels for a given gestation, rather than a critical cut-off action level applied across all gestations. Future studies could consider receiver operator characteristics for a variety of cut-off values by gestation. The effect of gestational age on the development of lactic acidosis due to hypoxia, particularly in pregnancies of longer than 42 weeks, also warrants further investigation. We will consider the impact of gestation in this review when data become available from one of the two included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Wiberg_x002d_Itzel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wiberg-Itzel 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Stage of labour</HEADING>
<P>The relationship between maternal and fetal lactate concentrations have been considered in observational studies in labour.쟕he findings demonstrated no significant correlation between duration of first stage of labour and fetal lactate concentration at the beginning of second stage (<LINK REF="REF-Nordstr_x00f6_m-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordstrm 2001</LINK>). This confirms previous findings suggesting that fetal lactate concentrations are constant during the first stage of labour, in the absence of hypoxia (<LINK REF="REF-Nordstr_x00f6_m-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordstrm 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nordstr_x00f6_m-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordstrm 1995</LINK>). Maternal lactate concentrations increase significantly during the active phase of the second stage of labour. The source of the lactate is thought to be maternal skeletal muscles.쟏ne estimate for the maternal increase has been given as 2 mmol/L per 30 minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Nordstr_x00f6_m-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordstrm 2001</LINK>). Fetal lactate concentrations also correlated positively with the duration of active pushing, however at a rate about half that of the maternal lactate (1 mmol/L per 30 minutes). The question of whether this lactate rise is driven by fetal hypoxia or derived from the mother was investigated by studying the arterio-venous lactate difference at delivery, the results of which suggested that the main contributor to the fetal lactate increase is the fetus itself, especially with prolonged second stage (<LINK REF="REF-Nordstr_x00f6_m-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordstrm 2001</LINK>). This is also supported by animal studies (<LINK REF="REF-Milley-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milley 1988</LINK>).쟕hese findings suggest that fetal scalp lactates would still be an appropriate indicator of fetal hypoxia in second stage, although the clinical appropriateness of performing a lactate in response to abnormal fetal heart rate monitoring in active second stage would have to be considered. We await data from the authors of the <LINK REF="STD-Wiberg_x002d_Itzel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wiberg-Itzel 2008</LINK> study to consider the impact of stage of labour in this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Diagnostic accuracy</HEADING>
<P>We constructed this review with the objective of determining the safety and effectiveness of fetal scalp lactate sampling/analysis. The two identified RCTs essentially compared the effectiveness of fetal scalp lactate sampling with what was a more common clinical practice of pH sampling. As such, the available data provide some evidence that the use of lactate monitoring does not result in neonatal or maternal outcomes that differ from those following fetal scalp pH sampling, which had been more commonly used than lactate in many maternity units. Whist the review was not designed to consider the diagnostic accuracy of fetal lactate estimation during labour, the lack of statistically significant clinical outcomes may provide limited <I>de facto</I> support for the equivalence of lactate and pH estimation in identification of the at-risk fetus. Whilst such a concept may warrant further consideration in a formally constructed review of diagnostic accuracy, a brief overview of some observational studies may be informative here. Several observational studies have investigated the correlation between fetal scalp lactates and clinical outcomes of interest to this review, although we note that it is potentially problematic to draw conclusions about the relationship between lactate and these low prevalence outcomes in the relatively small published studies. <LINK REF="REF-Borruto-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borruto 2008</LINK> reported no correlation between scalp lactates and five-minute Apgar scores, with only 12 of the total 188 neonates assigned an Apgar score less than seven at five minutes.<LINK REF="REF-Ramanah-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramanah 2005</LINK> compared fetal scalp lactates to scalp pH, cord blood pH and lactate and Apgar scores.잸lthough good correlations for the former were found in their series of 129 patients, no correlation was found with Apgar scores at one or five minutes.쟕his series included only two babies with Apgars less than seven at one minute of age and in both cases the fetal scalp sample was taken at least 60 minutes prior to delivery.쟕he study of 136 cases by <LINK REF="REF-Allen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2004</LINK> did not undertake direct correlation of fetal scalp lactate with outcome data.쟕he lack of large, well-conducted studies with sufficient examples of clearly defined intrapartum asphyxia limits the confidence with which fetal scalp lactate estimation can predict intrapartum fetal well-being. Such a deficiency needs to be considered in studies (and a review) of diagnostic accuracy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>The inability to conduct the planned subgroup analyses may be important, particularly given the potential for increases in lactate levels with both advancing gestational age and prolongation of the second stage of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nordstr_x00f6_m-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordstrm 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiberg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiberg 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>When it is clinically determined that further testing is warranted to assess fetal well-being in labour, fetal scalp blood lactate estimation is more likely to be successfully undertaken, with fewer scalp incisions and results more readily available than for pH estimation.

<P>Future studies may consider the outcomes within the subgroups of gestational age, stage of labour, serial fetal scalp lactate measurements and in the presence of other tests of fetal well-being. Large, well-conducted studies with sufficient examples of clearly defined intrapartum asphyxia may provide confidence with which fetal scalp lactate estimation can predict intrapartum fetal well-being and inform a systematic review of diagnostic accuracy. Such trials would also compare the effectiveness of fetal scalp blood lactate estimation versus no blood sampling, to reduce clinically important outcomes such as those presented in this review.</P>
<P>Additionally, future studies may address longer-term neonatal outcomes and maternal satisfaction or anxiety with fetal monitoring during labour, as well as conduct of an economic analysis. Outcome assessor blinding would be appropriate in future trials.</P>

<P>For those where fECG is used, it is hypothesised that there will be a reduction in caesarean section from 95% in the FBS group to 80% in the no FBS group. When fECG is not used, this will mean a reduction in caesarean birth from 80%in the FBS group to 65% in the no FBS group. </P>
