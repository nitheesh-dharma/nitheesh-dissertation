<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-27 13:58:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Calcium channel blockers have not been shown to reduce preterm birth or improve the outcomes for babies when given to women after contractions of preterm labour have been stopped.</P>
<P>Babies born premature (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) may not survive, or may have serious long-term problems if they do survive. Women who have had their preterm labour stopped with tocolytic treatment (medication to reduce uterine contractions), remain at risk of giving birth preterm. After this initial tocolytic treatment has been given to stop early labour, a maintenance tocolytic treatment may be given to try to prevent further early contractions and early birth. Calcium channel blockers are one of the types of tocolytic therapy that have been used in an attempt to prevent the onset of further preterm contractions.</P>
<P>We identified six randomised controlled trials involving a total of 794 women and their babies for this review. The trials were of moderate risk of bias overall. The trials did not demonstrate differences between calcium channel blocker maintenance therapy and placebo or no treatment in the prevention of preterm birth or perinatal death (fetal or neonatal deaths). None of the trials included any follow-up of the infants to assess longer-term development. Calcium channel blocker maintenance therapy (with a drug called nifedipine) was more likely than placebo or no treatment to prolong pregnancy, however the infants of these mothers were more likely to have a longer hospital stay. Based on the current studies, we found no convincing evidence that calcium channel blocker maintenance therapy prevents preterm birth for women after threatened preterm labour, or that it improves outcomes for babies.<BR/>

<P>We included six trials that enrolled 794 women and their babies and all assessed nifedipine as calcium channel blocker maintenance therapy. The six trials were judged to be at a moderate risk of bias overall. No differences in the incidence of preterm birth (risk ratio (RR) 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.09; five trials, 681 women), birth within 48 hours of treatment (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.07 to 3.00; two trials, 128 women) or neonatal mortality (average RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.05 to 11.76; two trials, 133 infants) were seen when nifedipine maintenance therapy was compared with placebo or no treatment. No stillbirths were reported in the one trial that provided data for this outcome. No trials reported on longer-term follow-up of infants.</P>
<P>Women receiving nifedipine maintenance therapy were significantly more likely to have their pregnancy prolonged (mean difference (MD) 5.35 days; 95% CI 0.49 to 10.21; four trials, 275 women); however, no differences between groups were shown for birth at less than 34 weeks' gestation, birth at less than 28 weeks' gestation, birth within seven days of treatment, or gestational age at birth. No significant differences were shown between the nifedipine and control groups for any of the secondary neonatal morbidities reported. Similarly, no significant differences were seen for the outcomes relating to the use of health services, except for in one trial, where infants whose mothers received nifedipine were significantly more likely to have a longer length of hospital stay as compared with infants born to mothers who received a placebo (MD 14.00 days; 95% CI 4.21 to 23.79; 60 infants).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-10-27 13:58:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm birth, defined as birth occurring before 37 completed weeks of gestation, remains the single most important cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. While preterm birth may occur for a variety of reasons, most preterm births occur as a result of spontaneous preterm labour. In addition to the short-term morbidity in infants born preterm there is a significant risk of long-term neurological sequelae in the survivors (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1993</LINK>). The lower the gestational age of the baby at birth, the higher the risk of complications. This risk remains very high for those born extremely preterm (<LINK REF="REF-Agustines-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agustines 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kok-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kok 1998</LINK>). Prematurity and its complications contribute greatly to the emotional trauma caused to the parents of the preterm infant. Therefore, a quest for interventions to prevent or reduce the incidence of preterm birth continues.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-10-27 13:58:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tocolytic agents have been used to inhibit preterm labour. However, these agents have so far succeeded only in prolonging preterm labour rather than improving infant outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Gyetvai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyetvai 1999</LINK>). Tocolytics conventionally have been used to try to prevent preterm birth, but now are mainly used to buy time for corticosteroids to be administered to mothers, to exert their beneficial effect in reducing the risks of respiratory distress syndrome and the other problems of immaturity in babies. Current evidence supports the use of a course of antenatal corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturation in women at risk of preterm birth, however further evidence surrounding the optimal dose to delivery interval, optimal corticosteroid to use and longer-term effects is required (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Preterm labour is diagnosed by the presence of regular painful uterine contractions and/or evidence of cervical dilatation and effacement prior to 37 weeks' gestation. A substantial proportion of women who have an episode of threatened preterm labour and are actively treated with an acute tocolytic therapy stop contracting and have still not given birth after 48 hours. For these women, the use of tocolytic maintenance medication has been advocated to try to reduce the risk of recurrence of preterm labour and to prolong gestation.</P>
<P>Most tocolytics have to be administered intravenously which makes long-term therapy a difficult proposition. Moreover, there is minimal evidence to suggest that delaying birth beyond 48 hours after administration of corticosteroids is associated with clinically significant improvements for the baby, woman or the health system (<LINK REF="REF-Gyetvai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyetvai 1999</LINK>). Any benefits of prolonging gestation could be offset by potential risks such as intrauterine infections and side effects of the drugs. Infants born preterm are at increased risk of infection, jaundice, respiratory disease, intracranial haemorrhage, chronic lung disease, necrotising enterocolitis and retinopathy of prematurity. These complications translate into delayed physical and cognitive development in the child, emotional trauma for the families, and enormous costs for the healthcare system.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-07-15 01:05:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Calcium channel blockers have been shown to be effective acute tocolytic drugs with minimal maternal adverse effects for women in preterm labour (<LINK REF="REF-King-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2003</LINK>). These agents act to inhibit calcium influx across cell membranes, thereby decreasing tone in the smooth muscle. They act as profound vasodilatory agents and have minimal effects on the cardiac conduction system (<LINK REF="REF-Economy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Economy 2001</LINK>). Although concerns about the effects of these agents on utero-placental blood flow have been raised in animal studies (<LINK REF="REF-Harake-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harake 1987</LINK>), they have not been substantiated in human studies (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 1990</LINK>). Oral administration and minimal adverse effects make calcium channel blockers potential suitable maintenance tocolytic agents to be used longer-term to prevent preterm birth after an episode of threatened preterm labour.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-07-15 01:07:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review updates a previously published Cochrane review on maintenance therapy with calcium channel blockers for preventing preterm birth after threatened preterm labour (<LINK REF="REF-Gaunekar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaunekar 2004</LINK>). This review included only one randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Carr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 1999</LINK>) and found no difference in the risk of preterm birth when calcium channel blocker maintenance therapy (nifedipine) was compared with no treatment. Stillbirths, neonatal deaths and neurological follow-up of infants were not reported. The review concluded that high-quality evidence from randomised trials was lacking in this area.</P>
<P>It is currently uncertain whether maintenance therapy with calcium channel blockers is effective in preventing preterm birth and its sequelae and what the personal, emotional and healthcare costs are to society. This review assesses the effectiveness of calcium channel blockers for maintenance therapy after preterm labour has been successfully arrested with an initial dose of acute tocolytic therapy. Other Cochrane reviews address the use of terbutaline pumps (<LINK REF="REF-Nanda-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nanda 2002</LINK>), magnesium sulphate (<LINK REF="REF-Han-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2013</LINK>), oral betamimetics (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2012</LINK>) and oxytocin antagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Papatsonis-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papatsonis 2009</LINK>) for maintenance therapy.</P>

<P>We planned to include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. In future updates of this review if we include cluster-randomised trials, we plan to adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we plan to report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there was little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-10-27 13:59:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. Where there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or where substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we have discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials.</P>

<UL>
<LI>dosage administered (i.e. high dose versus low dose);</LI>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-27 14:02:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Calcium channel blockers have been shown to be more effective than betamimetics for initial tocolysis (reducing births within seven days of initiation of treatment, and before 34 weeks' gestation), with improvements in some clinically important neonatal outcomes and a marked reduction in some adverse maternal side effects (<LINK REF="REF-King-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2003</LINK>). Maintenance therapy (including therapy with calcium channel blockers) has been evaluated far less. The evidence for maintenance magnesium therapy is insufficient to exclude either important benefits or harms (<LINK REF="REF-Han-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2013</LINK>), and other systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Berkman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berkman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meirowitz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meirowitz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanchez_x002d_Ramos-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez-Ramos 1999</LINK>) have to date concluded that there is insufficient evidence for any form of maintenance therapy in tocolysis.</P>
<P>This review included six trials, which all assessed nifedipine, and found no convincing evidence to support calcium channel blockers when used as maintenance therapy for preventing preterm birth after threatened preterm labour. No significant differences between the nifedipine and control groups were shown for the review's primary outcomes, of preterm birth, birth within 48 hours of treatment, stillbirth or neonatal death; and none of the trials reported on longer-term follow-up of infants.</P>
<P>Few other statistically significant differences were shown between nifedipine maintenance therapy and a placebo or no treatment, apart from a significant prolongation of pregnancy for women receiving nifedipine. Women who received maintenance therapy with nifedipine were found to be more likely to have their pregnancy prolonged by 5.35 days on average (95% confidence interval 0.49 to 10.21 days), compared with women who received no treatment or a placebo. The meta-analysis, however, was not able to include data from the largest trial included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Roos-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Roos 2013</LINK>), which showed no significant difference between groups in pregnancy prolongation (median days were reported). No differences were shown in this review for gestational age at birth, or early and very early preterm birth. Importanly, no significant differences were shown for any of the neonatal morbidities measured, and in fact a significant increase in neonatal length of hospital stay was shown for infants whose mothers had received nifedipine, as compared to infants whose mothers had received a placebo in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Parry-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Parry 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>In this review we included six trials which together recruited in total only 794 women and their babies (<LINK REF="STD-Carr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lyell-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lyell 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parry-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Parry 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roos-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Roos 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sayin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sayin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uma-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Uma 2012</LINK>). All trials apart from the <LINK REF="STD-Roos-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Roos 2013</LINK> trial, which recruited 406 women, had small sample sizes. The overall risk of bias for the trials was judged to be moderate, with only one trial judged at a low risk of bias across all domains (<LINK REF="STD-Roos-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Roos 2013</LINK>). For two trials, the risk of bias was predominately unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Sayin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sayin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uma-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Uma 2012</LINK>), with very little detail available regarding trial methods; and three of the six trials did not use a placebo control (<LINK REF="STD-Carr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sayin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sayin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uma-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Uma 2012</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-10-27 14:02:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence for this review has been derived from trials identified through a detailed search process. It is possible (but unlikely) that additional trials assessing maintenance therapy with calcium channel blockers for preventing preterm birth after threatened preterm labour have been published but not identified. It is also possible that other studies have been conducted but not published. Should such studies be identified, we will include them in future updates of this review. We attempted to reduce bias wherever possible by having two review authors independently working on study selection and data extraction.</P>

<P>The role of maintenance therapy with calcium channel blockers for preventing preterm birth is unproven.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-10-27 14:03:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>Researchers who consider that calcium channel blockers might be an effective maintenance therapy should consider conducting further well-designed randomised controlled trials, of sufficient sample sizes. Any future trials should measure clinically relevant and meaningful outcomes (such as incidence of preterm birth; stillbirth and neonatal death). The trials conducted to date, and any future trials, should follow up infants past the neonatal period to assess long-term safety and neurological outcomes at follow-up.</P>

<P>For this update we have updated the review methods. We have specified that we will exclude quasi-randomised and cross-over trials and that we will include cluster-randomised trials. We have also specified that we will include studies published in abstract form only along with those published as full-text manuscripts. We have reported data for a non pre-specified outcome 'composite neonatal morbidity' as we believed this to be an important, clinically relevant outcome.</P>

<B>Inclusion criteria: </B>women aged between 16 and 42, admitted with a diagnosis of preterm labour. Preterm labour was diagnosed by regular uterine contractions of over 4 per hour with documented cervical change on serial digital examinations. All women had intact membranes, and no medical or obstetric condition requiring delivery.</P>
<P>
<B>Exclusion criteria:</B> cervical dilation of at least 4 cm, triple or higher order pregnancy,<B> </B>documented intrauterine infection, fetal congenital anomalies, fetal growth restriction and any contraindication to beta-mimetics such as diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease or hyperthyroidism.</P>

<P>
<B>Intervention (n = 37)</B>
</P>
<P>Women received tocolysis with nifedipine, initiated 2 hours before discontinuation of their intravenous therapy with an oral dose of 20 mg given every 6 hours. Women who demonstrated uterine quiescence, the absence of progressive cervical change and intact membranes were observed in hospital for at least 24 hours after beginning the study medication. Thereafter women were discharged home and followed up as outpatients. Follow up was performed in the antenatal clinic.</P>
<P>If preterm labour episodes recurred, oral maintenance therapy was accepted as unsuccessful and discontinued. The women were subsequently treated with intravenous therapy. Oral treatment was reinitiated after successful repeat intravenous tocolysis and managed according to the same protocol as in first admission. Treatment was discontinued if membranes rupture or 37 weeks or gestation was reached.</P>
<P>
<B>Control (n = 36)</B>
</P>
<P>No maintenance therapy. Women were treated with intravenous tocolysis in the case of readmission for recurrent preterm labour.</P>
<P>
<B>All women: </B>all women had best rest and received intravenous saline before starting acute tocolysis. All were assessed 4 hourly for contraction frequency and cervical dilation/effacement. Women were treated with intravenous ritodrine and verapamil until uterine quiescence was achieved. Women between 26 and 34 weeks' gestation without overt intrauterine infection received corticosteroids therapy to promote fetal lung maturation. Women did not receive prophylactic antibiotics; the use was limited to standard clinical indications.</P>

<P>In the 2004 version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Gaunekar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaunekar 2004</LINK>), we also searched MEDLINE (1966 to March 2004) and DARE (June 2003) using the terms: preterm labo(u)r, premature labo(u)r, calcium channel blockers, nifedipine, nicardipine.</P>

<TITLE MODIFIED="2010-01-18 15:39:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">Methods used to assess trials included in previous versions of this review</TITLE>
<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-27 13:57:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>We processed included trial data (<LINK REF="STD-Carr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 1999</LINK>) as described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>). We evaluated trials under consideration for inclusion and methodological quality, without consideration of their results. Two authors separately assessed the trials and any differences of opinion were resolved by discussion. There was no blinding of authorship.</P>
<P>
<B>Allocation concealment</B>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>Quality scores for concealment of allocation were assigned to each trial, using the criteria described in Section VI of the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003a</LINK>).<BR/>A = adequate, B = unclear, C = inadequate, D = not used.<BR/>Studies rated as a C or D were excluded.</P>
<P>In addition, quality scores were assigned to each trial for use of a placebo, completeness of follow-up and blinding of outcome assessment as follows.</P>
<P>
<B>Use of placebo </B>
<BR/>(A) Placebo used;<BR/>(B) attempt at a placebo;<BR/>(C) no placebo;<BR/>(D) unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>Completeness of follow-up</B>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>(A) Less than 3% of participants excluded;<BR/>(B) 3% to 9.9% of participants excluded;<BR/>(C) 10% to 19.9% of participants excluded;<BR/>(D) 20% or more excluded;<BR/>(E) unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>Blinding of assessment of outcome</B>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>(A) Double blind, neither investigator nor participant knew or were likely to guess the allocated treatment.<BR/>(B) Single blind, either the investigator or the participant knew the allocation. Or, the trial is described as double blind, but side effects of one or other treatment mean that it is likely that for a significant proportion of participants (at least 20%) the allocation could be correctly identified.<BR/>(C) No blinding, both investigator and participant knew (or were likely to guess) the allocated treatment.<BR/>(D) Unclear.</P>
<P>Two reviewers independently extracted and double entered the data. We resolved discrepancies by discussion and there was no blinding of authorship. We would have assessed statistical heterogeneity between trials. Results are presented using relative risks for dichotomous data and weighted mean differences for continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>We decided a priori that all eligible trials would be included in the initial analysis and sensitivity analyses carried out to evaluate the effect of trial quality. This was to be done by excluding trials given a B rating for quality for allocation concealment, then B, C or D for use of a placebo, then D or E for completeness of follow up and then C or D for blinding.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analyses</B>
</P>
<P>We planned the following subgroup analyses, but these were not carried out due to lack of data:</P>
<UL>
<LI>dosage of calcium channel blockers;</LI>
<LI>type of calcium channel blockers;</LI>
<LI>duration of use of calcium channel blockers.</LI>
</UL>
