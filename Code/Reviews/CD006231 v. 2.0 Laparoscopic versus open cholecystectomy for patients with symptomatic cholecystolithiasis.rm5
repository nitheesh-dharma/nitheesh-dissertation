<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy seem equivalent considering complications and operative time, but laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with quicker recovery</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The classical open cholecystectomy and the minimally invasive laparoscopic cholecystectomy are two alternative operations for removal of the gallbladder. There are no significant differences in mortality and complications between the laparoscopic and the open techniques. The laparoscopic operation has advantages over the open operation regarding duration of hospital stay and convalescence. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Cholecystectomy is one of the most frequently performed operations. Open cholecystectomy has been the gold standard for over 100 years. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was introduced in the 1980s. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of laparoscopic versus open cholecystectomy for patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched <I>The</I> <I>Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register </I>(April 2004)<I>,</I> <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(Issue 1, 2004), <I>MEDLINE </I>(1966 to January 2004), <I>EMBASE </I>(1980 to January 2004), <I>Web of Science</I> (1988 to January 2004)<I>,</I> and <I>CINAHL </I>(1982<I> </I>to January 2004) for randomised trials. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All published and unpublished randomised trials in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis comparing any kind of laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus any kind of open cholecystectomy. No language limitations were applied. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently performed selection of trials and data extraction. The methodological quality of the generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and follow-up was evaluated to assess bias risk. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. Authors were requested additional information in case of missing data. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed when appropriate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty-eight trials randomised 2338 patients. Most of the trials had high bias risk. There was no significant difference regarding mortality (risk difference 0,00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.01 to 0.01). Meta-analysis of all trials suggests less overall complications in the laparoscopic group, but the high-quality trials show no significant difference ('allocation concealment' high-quality trials risk difference, random effects -0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.02). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients have a shorter hospital stay (weighted mean difference (WMD), random effects -3 days, 95% CI -3.9 to -2.3) and convalescence (WMD, random effects -22.5 days, 95% CI -36.9 to -8.1) compared to open cholecystectomy. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>No significant differences were observed in mortality, complications and operative time between laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with a significantly shorter hospital stay and a quicker convalescence compared with the classical open cholecystectomy. These results confirm the existing preference for the laparoscopic cholecystectomy over open cholecystectomy.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-12 13:30:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Gallstones are one of the major causes of morbidity in western society. It is estimated that the incidence of symptomatic cholecystolithiasis is up to 2.17 per thousand inhabitants (<LINK REF="REF-Legorreta-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legorreta 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steiner-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 1994</LINK>) with an annual performance rate of cholecystectomies of more than 500,000 in USA (<LINK REF="REF-Olsen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-Consensus-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH Consensus 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roslyn-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roslyn 1993</LINK>). Until the end of the 1980s, open cholecystectomy was the gold standard for treatment of stones in the gallbladder. This operative procedure was effective with low mortality and complication proportions.</P>
<P>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was introduced in 1985 (<LINK REF="REF-M_x00fc_he-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mühe 1986</LINK>) and rapidly became the method of choice for surgical removal of the gallbladder (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-Consensus-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH Consensus 1993</LINK>) although the evidence of superiority was absent. This rising popularity was based on many arguments, including assumed lower morbidity and complication proportions, and a quicker postoperative recovery compared to open cholecystectomy, despite an apparent increase in bile duct lesions. In non-randomised studies, the laparoscopic cholecystectomy seemed superior to open cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Deziel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deziel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Downs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shea-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shea 1996</LINK>), but due to non-randomisation adequate assessment of intervention effects may be missing. </P>
<P>Differences in primary outcomes like mortality and complication proportions (particularly bile duct injuries) are important reasons to choose one of the two operative techniques. When these primary outcomes show no significant difference, then secondary outcomes like non-severe complications, pulmonary outcomes, differences in health status related quality-of-life, hospital stay, and differences in cost-effectiveness analysis should help decide which technique is superior. </P>
<P>Up to now, despite the availability of numerous randomised trials on this topic, no systematic review or meta-analysis of randomised trials has been conducted in order to compare laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy. This lack of evidence was the main reason for writing this systematic review. The objective is to evaluate the assumed superiority of the laparoscopic over the open cholecystectomy. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy for patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. To assess whether laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy are different in terms of primary (mortality, complications, and relief of symptoms) and secondary outcomes (conversions to open cholecystectomy, operative time, hospital stay, and convalescence). When data were present, differences in other secondary outcomes like analgesic use, postoperative pain, pulmonary function, and costs were compared as well. </P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-11-12 13:29:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomised clinical trials comparing laparoscopic cholecystectomy to classical open cholecystectomy. Trials were included irrespectively of blinding, number of patients randomised, and language of the article. Quasi-randomised studies were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients with one or more stones in the gallbladder confirmed by ultrasonography or other imaging technique and symptoms attributable to them, scheduled for cholecystectomy. Acute cholecystitis is a disease with different operative results including the number of complications and conversions. Cholecystectomy in patients suffering from acute cholecystitis should be distinguished from cholecystectomy in patients suffering from symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. Therefore, randomised trials only including patients with acute cholecystitis were excluded from this review. Randomised trials including both symptomatic cholecystolithiasis and acute cholecystitis were included in the review only if the large majority (more than half) of the included patients were operated on because of symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Any kind of laparoscopic cholecystectomy was assessed versus any kind of open cholecystectomy. The group of open cholecystectomy does not include small-incision cholecystectomy.</P>
<P>The following classifications of the surgical procedures (based on intention-to-treat) were used:<BR/>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy includes those procedures started as a laparoscopic procedure. Any kind of laparoscopic cholecystectomy with creation of a pneumoperitoneum (by Veress needle or open introduction) or mechanical abdominal wall lift, irrespective of the number of trocars used.<BR/>In all other cases the surgical intervention was classified as 'open cholecystectomy'; this traditional procedure can be carried out through a larger subcostal incision or median laparotomy. The length of incision of 8 cm was used as cut-off point between small-incision and open cholecystectomy. This incision length was chosen arbitrary as in literature most authors used this length as a cut-off point between small-incision and (conversion to) open cholecystectomy.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome measures are mortality, complication proportions (intra-operative, severe, bile duct injuries and total complications; except minor complications), and relief of symptoms (pain relief). Although relief of symptoms is the aim of cholecystectomy, some patients continue to suffer from their complaints and have persistent pain. Most important in obtaining a high proportion of patients with relief of symptoms is adequate decision making in setting the indication to operate or not. However, it cannot be ruled out that some of this persistent pain should be attributed to the way of incision for cholecystectomy. Therefore, it is of interest to include pain relief as a primary outcome.</P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures are all other outcomes assessed in comparing the two operative techniques. We assessed the following secondary outcomes: operative time, hospital stay, convalescence, analgesic use, postoperative pain (visual analogue scale), pulmonary outcome (pulmonary function tests by flow-volume curves), and cost-effectiveness if data were available.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-10-11 15:47:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following databases: <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register </I>(6 April 2004)<I>, </I>the <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), </I>the<I> Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, </I>all in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 1, 2004), <I>The National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE)</I> (1966 to January 2004), <I>The Intelligent Gateway to Biomedical &amp; Pharmacological Information (EMBASE)</I> (1980 to January 2004), <I>ISI Web of Knowledge</I> (<I>Web of Science</I>) (1988 to January 2004), and <I>CINAHL </I>(1982 to January 2004). The search strategies used are provided in Appendix 1.</P>
<P>Our aim was to perform a maximal sensitive search in order to conduct a more complete review. As describing an operation of the gallbladder in medical terms without the word 'cholecystectomy' is impossible, a maximal sensitive search with the term cholecystectomy was used. For our MEDLINE search, a more sophisticated strategy, advised by the Dutch Cochrane Centre and listed in Table 1 was used (with help from Geert van der Heijden, Julius Center, Utrecht).</P>
<P>Additional relevant trials were looked for by cross reference checking of identified randomised trials. Finally all authors of included trials were requested by letter for additional information on any published, unpublished, or ongoing trials.</P>
<P>Furthermore, during data extraction it turned out that in a large number of trials essential data and information on methods were missing. To improve the quality of the analysis, individual trialists were contacted and asked for missing data.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-11-12 13:29:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>The review was conducted according to the present protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Keus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keus 2004</LINK>) and the recommendations by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). All identified trials were listed in the characteristics of included studies table and an evaluation whether the trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria was made. Excluded trials and the reasons for exclusion were listed as well (characteristics of excluded studies).</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality </B>
<BR/>Inadequate methodological quality in randomised clinical trials carries the risk of overestimating intervention effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). Methodological quality, study design, and reporting quality have been recognised as criteria that can restrict bias in the comparisons of interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). Therefore the methodological quality of randomised clinical trials was assessed using the following components.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Generation of the allocation sequence<BR/>
</I>
</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the allocation sequence was generated by a computer or random number table. Drawing of lots, tossing of a coin, shuffling of cards, or throwing dice was considered as adequate if a person who was not otherwise involved in the recruitment of participants performed the procedure.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used for the allocation sequence generation was not described.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if a system involving dates, names, or admittance numbers were used for the allocation of patients. These studies are known as quasi-randomised and were excluded from the present review.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Allocation concealment<BR/>
</I>
</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the allocation of patients involved a central independent unit, on-site locked computer, or sealed envelopes.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants or if the study was quasi-randomised.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Blinding<BR/>
</I>
</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the trial was described (at least) as blind to participants or assessors and the method of blinding was described. We are well aware that it is very difficult to properly blind trials comparing surgical treatments.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the trial was described as (double) blind, but the method of blinding was not described.</LI>
<LI>Not performed, if the trial was not blinded.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>
<I>Follow-up<BR/>
</I>
</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate, if the numbers and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals in all intervention groups were described or if it was specified that there were no dropouts or withdrawals.</LI>
<LI>Unclear, if the report gave the impression that there had been no dropouts or withdrawals, but this was not specifically stated.</LI>
<LI>Inadequate, if the number or reasons for dropouts and withdrawals were not described.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Extraction of data</B>
<BR/>Inclusion and exclusion criteria used in each trial.</P>
<P>The following data on the randomisation procedure have been extracted:<BR/>(1) Number of randomised patients.<BR/>(2) Number of patients not randomised and reasons for non-randomisation.<BR/>(3) Exclusion after randomisation.<BR/>(4) Drop-outs.<BR/>(5) 'Intention-to-treat' analysis.</P>
<P>Also information on sample size, single- or multicentre study design, assessment of primary and secondary outcome measures, use of antibiotic prophylaxis, surgical experience, and intra-operative cholangiography was registered (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>General descriptive data (like sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) classification) are supposed to be equally divided due to randomisation (<LINK REF="REF-Assmann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assmann 2000</LINK>). These data are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> as far as available. Outcome data on mortality, complications, health-related quality-of-life, pulmonary function, pain, duration of operation, hospital stay, and convalescence were extracted according to availability.</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical analysis<BR/>
</B>With adequate binary data available, a priori presentation in odds ratios was preferred, based on clinical considerations and statistical robustness of the odds ratio. From this, results could be presented in relative risk (ratio) (RR(R)) or numbers needed to treat (NNT) by recalculation. However, exploring the data showed that for many binary data the outcome was rare or zero in both arms. Odds ratios (OR) and risk ratios (RR) are not estimable in trials with zero events in both arms (<LINK REF="REF-Sweeting-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeting 2004</LINK>). Binary outcomes with zero events in both arms can merely be presented in risk differences (RD). Although risk differences are statistically less robust and result in conservative estimates, they are simple measures, easy to understand, and useful for public communication.</P>
<P>For continuous data, authors generally present their results in medians with ranges due to suspicion of skewed data. However, for the analysis of data in a meta-analysis, means with their corresponding standard deviations (SD) are needed to calculate mean differences (MD) or weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Using means from all trials would ignore a non-Gaussian distribution. Therefore, skewness ratios (mean divided by the standard deviation) were calculated first (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>, page 96). With a ratio larger than two, skewness is ruled out, whereas skewness is suggested when the ratio is between one and two and a ratio less than one indicates strong evidence of skewness. In situations where skewness could be ruled out, assumptions on equality of median to mean was made and used in the sensitivity analyses. For trials presenting confidence intervals or standard error of means, we performed a recalculation to a standard deviation (SD) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>, page 90-91). In case no data on standard deviation were available, we calculated an average standard deviation from those observed in other studies and imputed this value for the standard deviation in the sensitivity analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>, page 92).</P>
<P>Results were considered according to the four different criteria of quality. The existence of an overall difference in outcome was clear when all four criteria showed significance. However, when the different quality criteria showed contradicting results, then an overall conclusion considering one outcome was not obvious and had to be made individually. In each individual component, results from high-quality trials subgroups were given more weight compared to analyses including all trials or low-quality trials subgroups. Results with confidence intervals that touched, but did not cross, the line of equivalence were considered not significant.</P>
<P>Apart from comparisons in the four individual quality criteria, we also performed a comparison with trials divided into low-bias risk trials (high methodological quality) and high-bias risk trials (low methodological quality). Trials that were assessed as adequate regarding all the four methodological criteria were considered low-bias risk trials. All trials that were not assessed adequate with regard to all the four methodological criteria were considered high-bias risk trials.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Bias detection</I>
</B>
<BR/>We have used funnel plots to provide a visual assessment of whether treatment estimates were associated with study size. The presence of publication bias and other biases (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macaskill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macaskill 2001</LINK>) varies with the magnitude of the treatment effect, the distribution of study size, and whether a one- or two-tailed test is used (<LINK REF="REF-Macaskill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macaskill 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both the random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and the fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-DeMets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 1987</LINK>) for pooling effect estimates were explored.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>In case of no discrepancy (and no heterogeneity) the fixed-effect models were presented.</LI>
<LI>In case of discrepancy between the two models (ie, one giving a significant intervention effect and the other no significant intervention effect) both results were reported. Discrepancy will only occur when substantial heterogeneity is present.</LI>
<LI>Most weight was put on the results of the fixed-effect model if the meta-analysis included one or more large trials, provided that they had adequate methodology. (By large trials we refer to those that outnumber the rest of the included trials in terms of numbers of outcomes and participants (ie, more than half of all included events and participants)).</LI>
<LI>Otherwise, most weight was put on the results of the random-effects model as it incorporated heterogeneity. The reason for this is that the random-effects model increases the weight of small trials. Small trials, however, are more often than large trials conducted with unclear or inadequate methods (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>In situations of excessive heterogeneity we refrained from reporting a pooled estimate when inappropriate.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The main focus of looking at heterogeneity in meta-analysis is to discriminate true effect modifiers from other sources of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was calculated by the Cochrane Q test and quantified by measuring I<SUP>2 </SUP>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>). If excessive heterogeneity occurred, data were re-checked first and then adjusted. Extreme outliers were excluded (and tested in sensitivity analyses) when adequate reasons were available. If excessive heterogeneity still remained, depending on the specific research question, alternative methods were considered: subgroup analysis and meta-regression if appropriate.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Subgroup analysis<BR/>
</I>
</B>Subgroup analyses were performed to compare the effects of the interventions according to the methodological quality of the trials (adequate compared to unclear/inadequate). Furthermore, causes of heterogeneity (defined as the presence of statistical heterogeneity by chi-squared test with significance set at P-value &lt; 0.10 and measured by the quantities of heterogeneity by I<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>)) were explored by comparing different groups of trials stratified to level of experience of the surgeon and other factors that may explain heterogeneity.<BR/>
<BR/>Sensitivity analyses were performed assuming zero mortality for missing data. Sensitivity analyses were performed imputing medians and using average standard deviations for missing data. In case of outliers and borderline trials sensitivity analyses were performed as well. Subgroup analyses were performed testing the influence of antibiotic prophylaxis, surgical experience and intra-operative cholangiography on operative time, complications and hospital stay. These subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed as far as data were available.</P>
<P>The statistical package (RevMan Analyses) provided by The Cochrane Collaboration was used (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). The statistical analyses were performed by FK and CL.</P>

<B>Searches and trial identification</B>
<BR/>For the search strategies used and the number of hits we refer to additional Table 1.</P>
<P>The search was conducted in <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register </I>(840 hits, 65 selected) and <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 1, 2004 with the following results: the<I> Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I> (33 hits, none were selected), the <I>Database of Abstracts of Reviews on Effects</I> (DARE) (17 hits, 5 selected), the <I>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials</I> (<I>CENTRAL</I>) (1343 hits, 146 selected), the <I>Health Technology Assessment </I>(HTA) Database (11 hits, 4 selected), and the <I>NHS Economic Evaluation Database </I>(43 hits, 6 selected).</P>
<P>The search further comprised the following databases: <I>The National Library of Medicine</I> (<I>MEDLINE</I>) (8354 hits, 347 selected), The Intelligent <I>Gateway to Biomedical &amp; Pharmacological Information</I> (<I>EMBASE</I>) (685 hits, 131 selected), <I>ISI Web of Knowledge</I> (<I>Web of Science</I>) (1163 hits, 148 selected), and <I>CINAHL</I> (740 hits, 9 selected).</P>
<P>Altogether, the search resulted in 13229 hits. The first selection process was performed based on the title of the publications. In each step of selection, we included the publication in case of any doubt. The total number of selections by title from this group of 13229 publications was 911 hits. After correction for duplicates, 586 remained.</P>
<P>The abstracts of these 586 publications were reviewed independently by two reviewers (FK and JJ) in order to evaluate whether the study should be included in or excluded from the review. Differences between FK and JJ were discussed with CL. A total of 428 publications could be rejected based on their abstract. Initially, trials which did not clearly mention whether they were randomised clinical trials or not, were given the benefit of the doubt. If appropriate, they were excluded later on. Eventually, 158 publications were selected for further evaluation and these are all listed in the review with reasons for in- or exclusion.</P>
<P>A total of 112 publications were excluded (see table with 'Characteristics of excluded studies'). A total of 46 publications describing 38 trials including 2338 patients were included (see table with 'Characteristics of included studies' and <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Critical appraisal and data extraction of these 38 trials were done by FK, JJ, and CL separately. Any disagreements were solved in several consensus meetings.</P>
<P>Of the 38 included trials, one trial was only described in short (abstract: <LINK REF="STD-Zulfikaroglu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zulfikaroglu 2002</LINK>). Therefore only limited information was obtained from this trial. As no language restrictions were used, two publications (<LINK REF="STD-Jan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charlo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Charlo 1995</LINK>) were translated. Double publications of the trial results by the same research group are listed in the references of included studies and are considered one trial (eg, <LINK REF="STD-Agnifili-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Agnifili 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karayiannakis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Karayiannakis 1997</LINK>). After contacting individual trialists additional data and information were obtained from 7 out of 38 included trials (see 'Acknowledgements').</P>
<P>All included trials used similar inclusion criteria, ie, patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis who were scheduled for elective cholecystectomy. The extensiveness in which exclusion criteria were described varied among the trials, but nearly all trials excluded acute cholecystitis. Trials with exclusively acute cholecystitis as inclusion criterion for cholecystectomy were excluded. Trials that included minorities of patients with acute cholecystitis next to patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis were included.</P>
<P>
<B>Trial designs<BR/>
</B>One trial used a three-arm design (<LINK REF="STD-Coelho-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Coelho 1993</LINK>). Another trial used a five-arm design with in the first until the fourth arm open cholecystectomy in combination with variable applications (intra-operative injection of bupivacaine for sympathetic blockade, and propranolol combined with neostigmine treatment in order to evaluate postoperative paralytic ileus). We summarized all open cholecystectomy patients in one group, resulting in a ratio of one to four of included patients in both groups in this trial (<LINK REF="STD-GarciaCaballero-1993" TYPE="STUDY">GarciaCaballero 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trial by Lausten included two groups: patients with postnecrotic liver cirrhosis and patients with chronic hepatitis (both groups classified ASA classification III-IV). Both groups were randomised separately resulting in four groups. For data management reasons we listed both groups as separate trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lausten-1999-_x0028_1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Lausten 1999 (1)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lausten-1999-_x0028_2_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Lausten 1999 (2)</LINK>).</P>
<P>All other trials used a two-arm parallel-group design.</P>
<P>
<B>Surgical interventions<BR/>
</B>Usually laparoscopic cholecystectomy was not further specified. Some trials stated that a four trocar technique was used, creating a pneumoperitoneum by using carbon dioxide insufflation with a maximum intraperitoneal pressure of 12 to 15 millimetres mercury.</P>
<P>Open cholecystectomy was normally performed by a subcostal incision, sometimes by midline laparotomy. As noted before, an incision length of 8 centimetres was taken as the cut-off point between small-incision and open cholecystectomy. Trials with small-incision cholecystectomy were excluded from this review.</P>
<P>Antibiotic prophylaxis administered at induction of anaesthesia was explicitly mentioned in some trials. In others the explicit omission of antibiotic prophylaxis was mentioned, but most trials did not report on its use. Information on surgical experience (one or a few highly experienced surgeons performing all operations or also involving registrars) and intra-operative cholangiography (attempted in all or only in selected patients) was recorded as well.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcome measures<BR/>
</B>A problem considering relief of symptoms and pain is how this outcome is defined and measured. Apart from differences in measurement, very few trials reported on this outcome. Therefore, we were unable to report results considering relief of symptoms and pain. Nearly all trials reported on complications, operative time, and hospital stay. Duration of sick leave was another commonly examined outcome. Not all trials clearly mentioned mortality. In trials in which mortality remained unclear, only in a sensitivity analysis the assumption that no patient had died was made when mortality was not mentioned (mean and most probable outcome of a trial). Some trials included mortality in their complications; we considered them separately. Because of the wide range of the types of complications described, we classified (subcategorised) all complications into four subcategories (intra-operative, minor, severe, or bile duct injury) in addition to a total complication proportion (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Each complication was classified twice: once in one of the four subcategories (intra-operative, minor, severe, or bile duct injury) and once again in the total complication proportion. Consequently, all bile duct complications were registered separately from all other complications (and not counted in the severe and minor subcategories). Likewise, all intra-operative complications (except from the bile duct injuries) were categorised separately from other minor and severe complications.</P>
<P>The following outcomes were reported in one trial only or in different ways: bowel function, haemostatic markers (thrombin and fibrinolysis markers), Swann-Ganz haemodynamic monitoring of operation, endocrinological parameters, immunological parameters and cytokines, acute phase proteins, and acute phase hormones. Pain scores and analgesic use as well as health-related quality-of-life were frequently examined outcomes. Due to the great variation in the way these were measured and reported, it appeared impossible to pool results.</P>
<P>Considering pulmonary function there is some limited data available from randomised trials. However, considering the inconsistency in the type of effect measure reported, as well as the difference in moments in time the outcome was measured, and the statistical problems that arise in pooling these results, we decided to refrain from reporting these results.<BR/>Our intention was to cover costs (an important secondary outcome) as well, but although costs were described in several trials, it was reported in a lot of different ways. Moreover, as different points of view were taken in those analyses, and regarding the cultural differences (<LINK REF="REF-Vitale-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vitale 1991</LINK>) as well as differences in local costs, we decided that reporting this outcome would not be meaningful.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-11-12 13:30:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>We evaluated the internal validity of the trials by considering the four quality components, resulting in the following number of high-quality (ie, adequate) trials. Information that was not mentioned in a trial, was scored 'unclear'. When necessary information about randomisation, blinding procedure, or follow-up was unclear or missing, the authors were contacted to obtain specific additional information on these issues. Trials, of which no response was received, remained classified as 'unclear' trials.</P>
<P>We assessed the quality of the 38 included trials as follows: generation of allocation sequence was adequate in five trials (13.2%), allocation concealment in nine trials (23.7%), blinding in three trials (7.9%), and follow-up in six trials (15.8%) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>The comparison dividing trials into low-bias risk trials (adequate methodological quality in all four criteria) versus high-bias risk trials could not be performed as there was no low-bias risk trial present.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-10-23 12:12:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>We conducted five analyses: four comparisons based on the four methodological quality components including the subgroups high- and low-quality trials, and a fifth comparison containing sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Background data of all trials on age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) classification are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>We identified a total of 38 randomised trials comparing laparoscopic versus open cholecystectomy (one trial was split up into two trials for data management reasons (<LINK REF="STD-Lausten-1999-_x0028_1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Lausten 1999 (1)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lausten-1999-_x0028_2_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Lausten 1999 (2)</LINK>). Some authors excluded patients with complications or converted laparoscopic procedures for reasons of influencing analyses (eg, <LINK REF="STD-Chaudhary-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chaudhary 1999</LINK>). As we are interested in complication proportions and intention-to-treat, we included these patients in our analyses. A total of 1165 and 1173 patients were included in the laparoscopic and open groups, respectively. Data are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> together with data on antibiotic prophylaxis, performance of cholangiography, and experience of the surgeon.</P>
<P>In the analyses, there were no significant differences in mortality, intra-operative complications, minor complications, and bile duct injuries considering all trials, neither in the subgroups high-quality and low-quality trials, nor between the fixed-effect model and the random-effects model. As 'concealment of allocation' is considered the most important component of methodological quality, all subgroup results considering this aspect (except for the fore-mentioned results that were not significantly different) were presented in additional <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were performed assuming zero mortality and imputing medians and standard deviations for missing data (operative time and hospital stay). No outliers and no borderline trials were identified. Subgroup analyses were performed testing the influence of cholangiography on operative time and the influence of antibiotic prophylaxis on hospital stay. Other sensitivity and subgroup analyses were not performed as necessary data were missing or analyses were considered inappropriate.</P>

<B>
<I>Mortality</I>
</B>
<BR/>Mortality was explicitly reported in 14 trials. Mortality was not reported in 24 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Putensen_x002d_Himmer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Putensen-Himmer 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coelho-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Coelho 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GarciaCaballero-1993" TYPE="STUDY">GarciaCaballero 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trondsen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Trondsen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dionigi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Dionigi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kjaersgaard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kjaersgaard 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dauleh-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dauleh 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Essen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Essen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koprulu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Koprulu 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ortega-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ortega 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rovina-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rovina 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karayiannakis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Karayiannakis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Volpino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Volpino 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zajac-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zajac 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chaudhary-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chaudhary 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blanc_x002d_Louvry-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Blanc-Louvry 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coskun-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Coskun 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Demirer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Demirer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendolin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hendolin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hasukic-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hasukic 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zulfikaroglu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zulfikaroglu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bukan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bukan 2004</LINK>). No significant differences were identified in analysis stratifying trials for all four quality components. There was no heterogeneity, therefore the fixed-effect model has been applied (risk difference 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.01). Sensitivity analysis (10-1) assuming zero mortality in the trials that did not report mortality led to the same result (risk difference, fixed-effect 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01). The mortality proportions were 0% and 0.09% in the laparoscopic and open groups, respectively.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Intra-operative complications</I>
</B>
<BR/>Complications were explicitly reported in 29 trials. Intra-operative complication proportions were 0.9% and 0.1% in the laparoscopic and open group, respectively. Applying the fixed-effect model, no significant differences in all four quality components were identified (risk difference, fixed-effect, all trials 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.02).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Minor complications</I>
</B>
<BR/>The minor complication proportions were 2.1% and 3.1% in the laparoscopic and open group respectively. There was no significant difference present in analysis of all trials. As heterogeneity was not present, the fixed-effect model has been applied (risk difference -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.00). No significant differences were present in any of the subgroups.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Severe complications</I>
</B>
<BR/>The severe complication proportions were 2.2% and 6.8% in the laparoscopic and open group respectively. As heterogeneity was present (up to 69%), the random-effects model has been applied and no significant differences were present. There were no discrepancies between the four quality components.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Bile duct injury</I>
</B>
<BR/>The bile duct injury proportions were 0.2% in both groups. No significant differences were present and there were no discrepancies between the four quality components in the subgroups. As no heterogeneity was present, the fixed-effect model has been applied (risk difference 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Total complications<BR/>
</I>
</B>Complications were not reported in nine trials (<LINK REF="STD-Blanc_x002d_Louvry-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Blanc-Louvry 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bukan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bukan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GarciaCaballero-1993" TYPE="STUDY">GarciaCaballero 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kjaersgaard-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kjaersgaard 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koprulu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Koprulu 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Luo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Putensen_x002d_Himmer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Putensen-Himmer 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rovina-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rovina 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zulfikaroglu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zulfikaroglu 2002</LINK>). All complications (and frequencies) were listed (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). There were three re-operations reported in each group. We defined a complication as something the author called a complication and refrained from interpretation by ourselves. In a funnel plot using total complication proportions we did not find indications of publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The total complication proportions were 5.4% and 10.1% in the laparoscopic and open group respectively (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Reoperation proportions were 0.3% in both groups.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity was present, therefore the random-effects model has been applied resulting in significant differences in analysis of all trials and in the low-quality trials subgroups (risk difference all trials -0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01). Meta-analysis of all trials suggested fewer overall complications in the laparoscopic group, but not in the high-quality trials subgroups ('allocation concealment' high-quality trials risk difference, random effects -0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.02). Regarding the high-quality trials subgroup analyses as most reliable, we conclude that there is no significant difference in total complication proportions (allocation concealment, high-quality trials: laparoscopic: 2.5% versus open: 4.3%).</P>
<P>Comparing in subgroup analysis (10-4) total complication proportions from trials that explicitly mentioned that they did use antibiotic prophylaxis versus the total complication proportions from trials that explicitly mentioned that they did not use antibiotic prophylaxis, showed no clear influence of antibiotic prophylaxis on total complication proportions.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Operative time</I>
</B>
<BR/>Heterogeneity was present, therefore the random-effects method has been used and no significant differences were present in all methodological quality components (the high-quality subgroup in the 'blinding' quality component did show a significant difference, but was calculated from one trial only) (WMD all trials, random effects 3.79 minutes, 95% CI -4.88 to 12.46). All available data were presented in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>. In a sensitivity analysis (10-2) including the assumptions on standard deviations and medians considering skewness, there was no significant difference present (WMD, random effects 6.42 minutes, 95% CI -1.21 to 14.04).</P>
<P>Comparing in a subgroup analysis (10-5) the operative time from trials that explicitly mentioned they did attempt intra-operative cholangiography in all patients versus the operative time from trials that explicitly mentioned they did not attempt routine intra-operative cholangiography in all patients (but only in selected or no patients) (and also including the assumptions on standard deviations and medians) did not show an influence of cholangiography on operative time.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Hospital stay</I>
</B>
<BR/>There was a significant shorter hospital stay in the laparoscopic group. There was severe heterogeneity present, therefore the random-effects model was applied. This model resulted in a significant difference in all four methodological comparisons (WMD all trials, random effects -3.07 days, 95% CI -3.89 to -2.26). Only two high-quality trials subgroups did not show this significant difference.</P>
<P>All available data were presented in <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>. In a sensitivity analysis (10-3) including the assumptions on standard deviations and medians considering skewness, there was a significant shorter hospital stay in the laparoscopic group (WMD, random effects -3.15 days, 95% CI -3.94 to -2.35). Comparing in a subgroup analysis (10-6) hospital stay from trials that explicitly mentioned that they did use antibiotic prophylaxis versus the hospital stay from trials that explicitly mentioned that they did not use antibiotic prophylaxis (and also including the assumptions on standard deviations and medians) did not show an influence of antibiotic prophylaxis on hospital stay.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Convalescence</I>
</B>
<BR/>Unfortunately convalescence involving normal activity was not reported, therefore only convalescence considering work leave could be analysed. Applying the random effects model, there was a significant difference favouring the laparoscopic technique, equal in all methodological comparisons (WMD, random effects -22.51 days, 95% CI -36.89 to -8.13). However, only three trials described return to work.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-23 12:12:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>The present systematic review contains four major findings. First, the comparison of the clinical outcome of laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy has been well tested in randomised clinical trials (over 2300 patients have been randomised in 38 trials), but the methodological quality has been disappointingly low. Not even one trial could be graded as low-bias risk trial (adequate methodological quality in all four components). Secondly, laparoscopic cholecystectomy did not carry more bile duct injuries than open cholecystectomy. Thirdly, hospital stay was significantly shorter for laparoscopic cholecystectomy compared with open cholecystectomy. Fourthly, convalescence after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, measured by return to work, was significantly shorter compared with open cholecystectomy.</P>
<P>We identified a total of 38 trials comparing laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy with different focuses on outcome measures. In these comparisons mortality was near 0% which is in concordance with data from the non-randomised literature (<LINK REF="REF-Downs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downs 1996</LINK>). With 1165 and 1173 patients included in the trials of this comparison, only one death was reported.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of all trials showed a significant difference in total complications in favour of the laparoscopic technique, however, high-quality trials subgroups showed no significant difference. As most value must be given to the high-quality trials, it must be concluded that there is no significant difference between both techniques considering total complication proportions. Regarding intra-operative, minor, and bile duct injury complication proportions there are no significant differences (fixed-effect and random-effects models) between laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy. Regarding severe complications, the low-quality group and all trials group suggest a lower complication proportion in the laparoscopic treatment group applying the fixed-effect model. However, after incorporating the high degree of heterogeneity (up to 69%) in the random-effects model, no significant difference in severe complications could be observed.</P>
<P>Comparing high-quality trials with low-quality and all trials for total complication proportions, a significant difference is suggested using the fixed-effect model. However, incorporating the high degree of heterogeneity (up to 68%) in the random-effects model, the high-quality trials subgroup that is the most reliable, shows no significant difference for total complications. In the subgroup analysis evaluating the influence of antibiotic prophylaxis on total complications no evidence of effect was found. There were no significant differences in the subgroup analyses of the four methodology quality aspects.</P>
<P>We found no significant difference in operative time. Incorporating the high degree of heterogeneity (98%) in the random-effects models in all four methodological subgroup analyses, the significant differences in operative time (in the fixed-effect models) disappear. The significant result of one high-quality trial (subgroup analysis in the 'blinding' comparison) is considered an outlier and ignored in our conclusion.</P>
<P>In sensitivity analysis assumptions were made on medians for means and imputing values for standard deviations. Skewness was ruled out and reported in additional <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>. Incorporating excessive heterogeneity (97%) in the random-effects model reduces the suggested shorter operative time of the open group to no significant difference in operative time between laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy. This is in line with the previous results in the four methodological subgroups. In subgroup analysis of the effect of intra-operative cholangiography on operative time, no effect was found.</P>
<P>Hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopic group. After incorporation of severe heterogeneity in the random-effects model, and also in sensitivity analysis assuming values for missing standard deviations and means, both in the fixed-effect as in the random-effects model a significant difference persists. Subgroup analysis on antibiotic prophylaxis as a potential factor influencing hospital stay (through complications) demonstrated that we still have insufficient data.</P>
<P>Convalescence regarding work leave is quicker after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Distinction was made in convalescence concerning work leave and return to normal activity. Unfortunately, only three trials reported on convalescence considering work leave and none reported on return to normal activity. The results of all four methodological subgroup analyses agree on their findings: both in the fixed-effect and random-effects model there were significant differences in favour of laparoscopic cholecystectomy considering convalescence.</P>
<P>Considering methodological quality there were five, nine, three, and six trials classified as being high-quality considering 'generation of allocation sequence', 'concealment of allocation', 'blinding' and 'follow-up', respectively. In a total of 38 trials we thought this rather disappointing. As many trials did not report on items like mortality and complication proportions, the number of trials left for analysis in some outcomes (and subgroups) were rather low, sometimes even only one or two.</P>
<P>Another aspect of trial quality is that a lot of trials focus on haemodynamics, acute phase reactants, oxidative stress factors, or endocrine functioning etcetera, making comparison of these items impossible because authors used different outcome measures. Moreover, these outcomes are short-term results, implying a limited follow-up in all patients in these randomised trials. For the sake of equal comparisons, some authors even excluded complicated and/or converted patients, thereby ignoring the intention-to-treat principle. As we performed all our analyses according to intention-to-treat, we included these patients again in our analyses. As authors describing these 'immunological' and other comparable outcome measures are not focused on complications (not looking for them, making registration of complications probably less accurate) and especially taking into account that they only perform very short-term follow-up (hospital stay of a few days), we are afraid that some underreporting of complications must exist. As high-quality trials are more likely to estimate the 'true' effects of the interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2003</LINK>), the relatively low percentage of high-quality trials in this review is probably the most important factor of possible underestimation of complication proportions.</P>
<P>All 38 trials were conducted as single-centre trials. With the risks of false-positive and false-negative findings in small trials this single-centre culture ought to be replaced by large trials conducted as multi-centre trials. Although many trials in this systematic review were small trials, no clear indications of publication bias were found analysing total complication proportions (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy did not differ significantly from open cholecystectomy regarding mortality, complications, bile duct injuries, and operative time. However, laparoscopic cholecystectomy leads to shorter incisional wounds and seems to be associated with a significantly shorter hospital stay and faster return to work. These seem the reasons for laparoscopic cholecystectomy being the preferred method of choice above open cholecystectomy. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Cost-minimisation analyses could probably play a decisive role. </P>
<P>Future research on implementation issues of laparoscopic techniques in general, with the cholecystectomy as a model, should focus not only on clinical outcome measures, but also, or more importantly, on differences in costs.</P>
<P>In accordance with research in general, the overall quality of the randomised trials included in this systematic review varied enormously, with the majority of trials having several methodological deficiencies. In line with conclusions from other systematic reviews, the quality of trials needs to improve in order to limit bias. Reports can be improved importantly by adopting the CONSORT Statement while conducting and reporting trials (www.consort-statement.org).</P>
<P>More trials ought to become multi-centre trials with larger number of participants. </P>

<PUBLIC_NOTES>
<P>The protocol for this systematic review was first published in Issue 3, 1997 of The Cochrane Library. The reviewers, Dr T Jørgensen and H Laugesen have abandoned the preparation of the systematic review. This necessitated that an update of the protocol and preparation of the review be performed by a new team of reviewers. They are F Keus, JAF de Jong, HG Gooszen, and CJHM van Laarhoven. Due to the large number of identified trials it was considered wiser in terms of clarity and usability to produce three separate reviews. Thus this review is one of the three.</P>
<P>Correction of name<BR/>Eric Keus, the lead author of the protocol, and Frederik Keus, the lead author of the review, is one and the same person.</P>
