<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Appendicitis is an Inflammation of the appendix. The conventional treatment for this condition involves an operation to remove the appendix, called an appendectomy. In recent years, this operation has been increasingly performed as keyhole surgery - laparoscopic appendectomy. For removal of the appendix during laparoscopic appendectomy, the best method of closing the remaining appendix stump to avoid leakage of bowel contents is unclear. Traditional approaches have involved ligatures and knots. However, in recent years, some surgeons have elected to use automated mechanical devices rather than ligatures, and it is unclear whether these devices reduce complications during laparoscopic appendectomy when compared with ligatures.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for all relevant randomised controlled trials up to 14 June 2017. This systematic review included eight randomised controlled trials involving a total of 850 participants. All trials compared mechanical devices versus ligatures for appendix stump closure. Five of the eight trials compared use of clips versus ligature, two trials compared an automated stapler versus ligature, and one trial compared all three methods.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Use of mechanical devices to close the appendix stump during laparoscopic appendectomy did not make a significant difference in the rate of overall complications when compared with use of a ligature, or in the rate of complications that happened during or after the appendectomy procedure. However, mechanical devices did make the operation nine minutes quicker when compared with ligatures. Mechanical devices did not make a substantial difference in overall hospital stay. We did not have enough information to reliably evaluate hospital costs, pain, or quality of life for either of these comparisons. As a result, we have not found enough evidence at present that would lead us to strongly recommend any particular method over another. More research should be undertaken to better compare available newer methods. </P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence used to derive our conclusions was generally of low quality. The studies we included for each analysis were vulnerable to different types of bias and contained inconsistencies and imprecision in their results due to small numbers of participants and events in each included study arm. It is likely that future research will substantially change our conclusions; further studies in this field are needed.</P>

<P>Laparoscopic appendectomy is amongst the most common general surgical procedures performed in the developed world. Arguably, the most critical part of this procedure is effective closure of the appendix stump to prevent catastrophic intra-abdominal complications from a faecal leak into the abdominal cavity.<BR/>
<BR/>A variety of methods to close the appendix stump are used worldwide; these can be broadly divided into traditional ligatures (such as intracorporeal or extracorporeal ligatures or Roeder loops) and mechanical devices (such as stapling devices, clips, or electrothermal devices). However, the optimal method remains unclear.</P>

<P>Two review authors identified trials for inclusion, collected data, and assessed risk of bias independently. We performed the meta-analysis using Review Manager 5.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-11-07 14:13:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included eight randomised studies encompassing 850 participants. Five studies compared titanium clips versus ligature, two studies compared an endoscopic stapler device versus ligature, and one study compared an endoscopic stapler device, titanium clips, and ligature. In our analyses of primary outcomes, we found no differences in total complications (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.27 to 3.50, 8 RCTs, very low-quality evidence), intraoperative complications (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.55, 8 RCTs, very low-quality evidence), or postoperative complications (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.21 to 3.13, 8 RCTs, very low-quality evidence) between ligature and all types of mechanical devices. However, our analyses of secondary outcomes revealed that use of mechanical devices saved approximately nine minutes of total operating time when compared with use of a ligature (mean difference (MD) -9.04 minutes, 95% CI -12.97 to -5.11 minutes, 8 RCTs, very low-quality evidence). However, this finding did not translate into a clinically or statistically significant reduction in inpatient hospital stay (MD 0.02 days, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.17 days, 8 RCTs, very low-quality evidence). Available information was insufficient for reliable comparison of total hospital costs and postoperative pain/quality of life between the two approaches. Overall, evidence across all analyses was of very low quality, with substantial potential for confounding factors. Given the limitations of all studies in terms of bias and the low quality of available evidence, a clear conclusion regarding superiority of any one particular type of mechanical device over another is not possible. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-11-07 14:14:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Appendicitis refers to inflammation of the appendix. Appendectomy (surgical removal of the appendix) is performed as an emergency procedure for treatment of individuals with acute appendicitis (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 2005</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-11-07 14:14:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute appendicitis, first described by Fitz in 1886, is the most common cause of acute abdominal pain (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rehman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rehman 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilms-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilms 2011</LINK>). The overall incidence of acute appendicitis varies between 76 and 227 cases per 100,000 population per year (<LINK REF="REF-Addiss-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Addiss 1990;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Andreu_x002d_Ballester-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreu-Ballester 2009;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Buckius-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buckius 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pieper-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pieper 1982</LINK>). The overall lifetime risk for acute appendicitis has been reported to be between 6% and 16% (<LINK REF="REF-Addiss-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Addiss 1990; </LINK>
<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2010</LINK>). This condition affects all age groups, with the highest incidence in the second decade (<LINK REF="REF-Addiss-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Addiss 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilms-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilms 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The cause of acute appendicitis is an issue of considerable debate (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 2005</LINK>). Acute appendicitis might be associated with obstruction of the appendix lumen (the inside space of an appendix), which could result in increased intraluminal pressure with transmural tissue necrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 2005</LINK>). Tissue necrosis is followed by bacterial invasion, leading to inflammation of the appendix (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-11-07 14:11:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patients with acute appendicitis usually need an appendectomy (irrespective of open or laparoscopic approaches) to relieve symptoms and avoid complications. Laparoscopic appendectomy was first described in 1983 (<LINK REF="REF-Schier-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schier 1998</LINK>). Since then, the procedure has undergone some modifications (from four ports to three, then to two). In 1992, Pelosi reported the single-incision laparoscopic operation, which resulted in less superficial trauma whilst providing a safe operative approach (<LINK REF="REF-Pelosi-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pelosi 1992</LINK>). Both laparoscopic appendectomy and open appendectomy are well accepted by surgeons, and clinical data have shown distinct relative advantages of laparoscopic appendectomy, albeit small in absolute terms. One of the possible drawbacks of the laparoscopic technique is the slightly higher intra-abdominal abscess rate (<LINK REF="REF-Sauerland-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sauerland 2010</LINK>). In this context, it has been suggested that appendix stump closure techniques play a key role in preventing infectious complications after appendectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Krisher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krisher 2001</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-11-07 14:11:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The traditional technique for securing the appendix stump during open appendectomy involved transfixing the appendix base, then applying a purse suture circumferentially around the appendix base to invert it into the caecum. However, this suture is difficult to apply during laparoscopic appendectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Houben-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Houben 1998</LINK>). Therefore, two other techniques have been introduced for laparoscopic appendectomy. The first technique involves the Roeder loop - a pre-tied sliding knot that was developed by Roeder (a German ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeon) for tonsillectomy (<LINK REF="REF-R_x00f6_der-1918" TYPE="REFERENCE">Röder 1918</LINK>). After one or more of these loops is applied to the base of the appendix, the appendix can be excised (<LINK REF="REF-Beldi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beldi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shimi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shimi 1994</LINK>). The second technique utilises a mechanical device such as a gastrointestinal anastomosis (GIA) stapler (<LINK REF="REF-Daniell-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daniell 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klaiber-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klaiber 1994</LINK>), titanium clips (<LINK REF="STD-Akbiyik-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Akbiyik 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ates-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ates 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Delibegovic-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Delibegovic 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gonenc-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gonenc 2012</LINK>), or an electrothermal bipolar tissue sealing device (<LINK REF="STD-Sucullu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sucullu 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The GIA stapler applies two rows of small staples to hold tissue edges together, so that automatic dissection can be done between the two rows (<LINK REF="REF-Beldi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beldi 2006</LINK>). This device can be loaded with different cartridges of staples, thus allowing its application to different types of tissue, such as the appendix base and the mesoappendix with its artery. Use of different types of titanium clips for laparoscopic appendectomy has been described more recently (<LINK REF="REF-Hanssen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanssen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Partecke-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partecke 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delibegovic-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delibegovic 2009</LINK>) and offers the advantages of easy application and low costs. The LigaSure Vessel Sealing System (Valleylab, Boulder, Colorado, USA) (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2015</LINK>) avoids placement of prosthetic clips via an electrothermal bipolar tissue sealing system.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-11-07 14:11:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Traditional ligatures (such as intracorporeal knots or Roeder loops) and mechanical devices (such as GIA stapling devices, clips, or electrothermal devices) are widely used during laparoscopic appendectomies worldwide. It is currently believed that the main difference between the two approaches represents a trade-off between cost and safety. However, this concept is not evidence-based; although mechanical devices are more expensive to use, it remains unclear whether they truly provide safer closure of the appendix stump than their cheaper ligature counterparts. Certainly, the degree of local inflammation and the expertise of the operating surgeon play a decisive role in the selection of surgical technique. However, to date, no Cochrane review has determined the preferred technique for securing the appendix stump in laparoscopic appendectomy.</P>

<P>Blinding of performing surgeons to the technique is impossible with this type of intervention, and personnel are likely to be aware of study group allocation from intraoperative and postoperative records. This lack of personnel blinding is an inherent drawback of such surgical intervention trials.

<LINK REF="STD-Nadeem-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Nadeem 2015</LINK> stated that this was a single-blinded trial and made efforts to minimise detection bias by ensuring that investigators who collected data were "at the same time blinded for the type of procedure done". However, it was unclear to what extent the operating team could influence the postoperative course outside the remit of data collection. In all studies except <LINK REF="STD-Nadeem-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Nadeem 2015</LINK>, it was also unclear whether participants were aware of the method used because no specific reference was made to methods of participant blinding.

Attendings presumably were holding the camera during these laparoscopic procedures. Trial authors did not refer to the variation in seniority amongst operating residents (although <LINK REF="STD-Gonenc-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gonenc 2012</LINK> stated that investigators were at least within their second year of residency). The assumption is that all residents were equally skilled and fluent in both randomised methods of appendix stump closure; however, because trial authors did not explicitly state that all residents were trained to equal proficiency in both approaches, we recorded the potential for performance bias as 'unclear'.</P>

However, it should be noted that the wide 95% confidence intervals in this analysis might actually represent imprecision of the estimate, rather than no true difference. This analysis was subject to a high degree of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 84%); therefore GRADE should be downgraded further by one level to very low quality (i.e. owing to inconsistency), largely because of the addition of the two most recent trials (<LINK REF="STD-Nadeem-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Nadeem 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2014</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-11-07 15:02:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Review authors found no significant differences in our primary outcomes of total complications, intraoperative complications, and postoperative complications between the use of any mechanical device versus a ligature technique for closure of the appendix stump during laparoscopic appendectomy. One exception to this was that the stapler device resulted in reduced likelihood of postoperative superficial wound infection when compared with ligature (odds ratio (OR) 0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.84) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>). However, this review cannot unequivocally recommend the routine use of any single mechanical device over another for appendix stump closure because reductions in postoperative superficial infection and in our secondary outcome of operative time failed to translate into a clinically or statistically significant reduction in overall complications or in in-patient hospital stay when compared with ligature use. For indirect comparisons of mechanical devices, analyses of total complications associated with use of an endoscopic stapler compared with a ligature (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.05 to 2.41) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>), and with use of endoscopic clips compared with a ligature (OR 2.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 5.84) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>), were subject to moderate heterogeneity; the only study that directly compared the two devices found no substantial differences in total complications (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 7.60) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Delibegovic-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Delibegovic 2012</LINK>). All included studies had limitations in terms of biases; therefore a clear conclusion is not possible in light of the quality of current evidence. </P>
<P>Although our findings suggest that use of the endoscopic stapler results in reduced operative time and decreased rates of postoperative superficial infection compared with ligature (or Endoloop) placement, the reason for the reduction in postoperative superficial infection is not entirely clear. One consideration is that endoscopic staplers require a 10- to 12-mm port, whereas ligatures can be introduced through a 5-mm port, and wound infection rates may be related to length of the surgical incision. A second explanation may be based on the technique required for use of the stapler device versus ligature placement. The endoscopic stapler requires that care be taken in ensuring that a viable appendix stump is placed between endoscopic stapler arms to allow clear margins of healthy tissue when the device is &#8216;fired&#8217;. Once successfully positioned, stump closure results in little contamination of surrounding viscera and little device displacement on firing and retrieval. The result may be less ambient faecal contamination of surrounding tissues, as both proximal and distal lumens of the appendix are simultaneously closed. In contrast, endoscopic Roeder loops or intracorporeal knot tying requires greater skill in ensuring sufficient economy of motion to secure the knot and excise the appendix without inadvertent faecal contamination of the ends of instruments or of the surrounding viscera (which might thereby seed and spread infection). Potential additional risks of faecal contamination and intra-abdominal instrumentation when a ligature is secured may explain the excessive postoperative ileus superficial infection rates and operative times reported when mechanical devices are compared. Of interest, we did not see a difference in postoperative ileus or deep infection rates, as might be expected to follow this explanation. In theory, this explanation should be equally applicable to endoscopic clip use and endoscopic stapler use. However, a reduction in postoperative superficial infection is not seen with endoscopic clips in the same way as with the endoscopic stapler. This may have more to do with outcome assessment limitations amongst included studies, particularly for subjective outcomes such as postoperative ileus (see <LINK TAG="QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE" TYPE="SECTION">Quality of the evidence</LINK>), and may not be truly representative of the technique used.</P>
<P>A surgeon must consider two key points when deciding how to close the appendix stump, namely, patient safety and health economic costs. Patient safety may be expanded to include the detrimental effects of prolonged anaesthesia, seen as delays in operative time, potential collateral damage or iatrogenic injury from use of the intervention, and the implications of failure for the intended outcome of the intervention. Economic costs extend beyond hardware costs per use of the intervention and also include the fiscal repercussions of time-consuming procedures (resulting in reduced time for other operations), prolonged hospital stay, and costs of reoperations or follow-up.</P>
<P>Any reduction in costs resulting from fewer postoperative complications must be reconciled with the cost of the device, particularly because a stapler device on average is at least four times as expensive as a ligature (in the form of Endoloops). Our included studies did not provide sufficient data to allow a detailed cost-benefit analysis. Similarly, available information is insufficient for a quantitative morbidity comparison between devices. However, results from our qualitative review show no substantial differences in pain or quality of life associated with any individual intervention.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-11-07 14:11:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of participants undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy. Two of our included studies excluded participants who were converted to open appendectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Colak-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Colak 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gonenc-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gonenc 2012</LINK>). Thus, the findings of this review are applicable to patients with diagnosed uncomplicated acute appendicitis who are fit for a laparoscopic procedure.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-11-07 14:11:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this review, meta-analysis included 850 participants from eight randomised studies. We downgraded the quality of evidence for the primary outcome 'Total complications' for all comparisons by one level for high risk of bias, one level for inconsistency due to substantial heterogeneity, and one level for imprecision. We graded the quality of evidence for remaining outcomes for all comparisons as very low owing to high risk of bias and imprecision (wide confidence intervals).</P>
<P>All studies reported details of intraoperative and postoperative complications. However, no studies provided information on blinding of personnel or participants. Blinding of personnel in randomised studies comparing different surgical procedures is difficult, which is a common drawback of many surgical trials. Blinding can affect the perception of secondary outcomes such as pain and quality of life. It also can influence detection of outcomes such as postoperative ileus, which, although our results show is reduced with use of mechanical devices, can be difficult to objectively quantify even by blinded personnel; none of our included studies clearly specify whether this diagnosis was made by blinded personnel. Every effort should be taken to blind outcome assessment, as blinding can significantly contribute to reduction of detection bias.</P>
<P>Two trials were at high risk of attrition bias or selection bias, as they excluded participants postoperatively (<LINK REF="STD-Colak-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Colak 2013</LINK>) or changed the allocation of several participants from the group initially randomised to <LINK REF="STD-Ortega-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ortega 1995</LINK>. In addition, two trials were at unclear risk of attrition bias, as they excluded participants postoperatively but did not provide enough detail on the exclusion process to permit judgement (<LINK REF="STD-Gonenc-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gonenc 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nadeem-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Nadeem 2015</LINK>). Both selection bias and attrition bias could have been reduced by appropriate a priori trial protocol publication and registration, as well as by diligent reporting of prespecified outcomes among all randomised participants according to the group to which they were randomly allocated (intention-to-treat analysis).</P>
<P>The quality of evidence may also be compromised as the result of heterogeneity of performing surgeons. <LINK REF="STD-Ortega-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ortega 1995</LINK> contributed the greatest population of participants to our analysis, with all procedures performed by residents with a reportedly high total number of complications. This can be a significant source of bias in assessing the primary outcomes, especially with no significant differences in complication rates reported by other studies. To ensure homogenous assessment, experienced surgeons with predefined levels of competency should be in charge of performing the procedures. Data available from the included studies were insufficient to allow us to undertake our intended detailed subgroup analyses (see <LINK TAG="SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</LINK>). In addition, no published studies eligible for inclusion allowed us to undertake our intended analyses of one versus two ligatures and of the LigaSure sealing device versus other methods; this provides scope for future research (see <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK>).</P>

<P>We followed guidance provided in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>). We applied no language, publication status, or sample size restrictions. We minimised bias in trial selection and included only RCTs. As we applied no restriction on publication date, we did include trials run before the imposition of mandatory trial registration. Therefore, the possibility exists that some trials might not have been reported owing to the direction of results (publication bias). Moreover, excluding trials that did not meet our selection criteria rendered only eight studies for inclusion in quantitative meta-analysis - a number that was inadequate to generate funnel plots for assessment of reporting bias (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2011</LINK>).</P>

These differences may explain why the conclusions drawn by respective review authors have differed so dramatically. <LINK REF="REF-Kazemier-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazemier 2006</LINK> concluded that routine use of endoscopic staplers was favourable, and <LINK REF="REF-Shaikh-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaikh 2015</LINK> concluded that use of the Endoclip was simple, efficacious, safe, and a cost-effective alternative whereas <LINK REF="REF-Sajid-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sajid 2009</LINK> concluded that although use of the Endoloop took longer than use of the Endo-GIA, length of hospital stay, perioperative complication rates, and incidence of intra-abdominal abscess appeared equal. To the best of our knowledge, we have undertaken the most extensive systematic review in this field to date, and our results show that current evidence is insufficient to strongly support the routine use of any single stump closure method over another during laparoscopic appendectomy.</P>

<P>Results of this review show no differences between overall complications associated with mechanical devices and ligature methods during appendix stump closure. In light of this, we cannot unequivocally recommend routine use of mechanical devices in appendix stump closure because reduction in operating time has not translated into any clinically significant reductions in in-patient hospital stay (mean difference 0.02, 95% confidence interval -0.12 to 0.17; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). Similarly, information on the fiscal costs of different mechanical devices is insufficient to show whether additional costs of these devices compared with the costs of ligatures are outweighed by reduced operating time, allowing the possibility of including additional procedures in an operating list. Until such time when these devices show more definitive comparative evidence of efficacy in comparison with each other and with ligatures (as outlined below under <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK>), it is not possible to advocate omission of conventional ligature-based appendix stump closure in favour of any single mechanical device over another.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-11-08 11:54:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For our comparison of types of mechanical devices, we were limited to a single study that met our inclusion criteria. The only studies comparing the efficacy of the Medtronic LigaSure vessel sealing system (Valleylab, Boulder, Colorado, USA), or comparing one versus two ligatures in terms of complication rates, used a quasi-randomisation method and did not meet our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Sucullu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sucullu 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Beldi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Beldi 2004</LINK>, respectively); therefore we were unable to undertake our planned analyses of these comparisons. Similarly, no robust randomised trials have examined laparoscopic appendectomy using the Ethicon ENSEAL device or the Harmonic scalpel device, and none have compared these against Weck Hem-o-lok Polymer Locking Ligation System (Weck Closure Systems, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA), titanium clip devices, or the Ethicon Endo GIA stapler (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio, USA). Although a plethora of cases series and observational studies from single-centre experiences have used various types of mechanical devices, they have contributed little conclusive evidence of efficacy because of confounding factors inherent in these types of study design.</P>
<P>None of our included studies have reported postoperative bleeding, appendix stump rupture, or purulent peritonitis in either comparison group, and included studies have poorly reported other outcomes such as hospital costs (operation, direct and indirect) and pain/quality of life. Well-designed randomised clinical trials are needed to compare contemporary mechanical sealing devices versus each other and versus conventional ligature-based methods, with particular emphasis on health economic implications and clinically relevant complication rates (such as postoperative peritonitis and appendix stump rupture); they should be designed in a manner that will allow investigators to address the biases identified in existing studies on this topic (see <LINK TAG="QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE" TYPE="SECTION">Quality of the evidence</LINK>). It would be ethically feasible for a double-blinded trial to ensure that (1) the consenting participant is blinded to the method of appendix stump closure used for the duration of postoperative recovery until study completion, unless a complication precludes this; (2) a senior operating surgeon is blinded to identifiable participant details and is not directly involved in the decision to operate or in providing postoperative care; and (3) the participant's responsible healthcare team is blinded to the operative details, unless clinically relevant reasons preclude this. In such trials, blinded investigators may evaluate outcomes. With this approach, a double-blinded surgical randomised trial would be feasible and robust enough to avoid confounding factors such as those evident in the studies included in this review.</P>

<P>We appropriately refined primary comparisons compared with those in the published protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Peng-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peng 2012</LINK>) and followed results of the updated systematic search for 'mechanical devices compared to ligature devices' due to paucity of published research on different subtypes of mechanical devices, as discussed in <LINK TAG="QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE" TYPE="SECTION">Quality of the evidence</LINK> and <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK>. Furthermore, whereas the protocol specified the inclusion of all studies irrespective of length of publication, we decided that in cases when studies were reported solely in abstract form, we would include them in our quantitative synthesis only if full study data were made available to us. In preparation of this review, these refined inclusion criteria did not result in subsequent exclusion of any studies. In light of the type of outcome measures reported amongst included studies, we deemed Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) with 95% confidence intervals to be more appropriate for dichotomous outcomes when compared with relative risk estimates. However, we have presented the results of both in our sensitivity analysis.</P>

<P>Investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example:</P>
