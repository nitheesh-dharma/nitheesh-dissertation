<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-11-09 05:28:42 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most babies born before 37 weeks of pregnancy (preterm babies) are not developed enough to take all the water and nutrients they need by mouth. As a result, they are unable to regulate their intake of water. Inadequate water intake can cause the baby to become dehydrated. Excessive water intake can cause heart and lung problems or intestinal damage. Systematic review of trials related to this issue leads to the conclusion that careful restriction of water for preterm babies, to amounts that meet their physical needs without causing dehydration, reduces the risk of certain complications. More research on this topic is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-11-09 05:20:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most premature infants are physiologically not sufficiently mature to orally ingest all of their required water and nutrients. Therefore, premature infants rely on their caregivers to regulate their volume of water intake. Thus, the caregiver must determine the amount of water to be given each day to such infants.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-11-09 05:38:08 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effect of water intake on postnatal weight loss and the risks of dehydration, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intracranial hemorrhage, and death in premature infants.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-11-10 02:03:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) identified in previous versions of this review were re-examined and, in each case, retained. Additional trials were sought that compared the outcomes of interest in groups of premature infants who were given different levels of water intake according to an experimental protocol. Such trials were sought in a list of trials provided by the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, with a PubMed search and in the authors' personal files.</P>
<P>This search was updated in 2014.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-11-09 05:23:18 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only RCTs of varying water intake in premature infants were included. The review was limited to trials that included infants whose water intake was provided mainly or entirely by intravascular infusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-11-09 05:25:11 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration were used. Study selection and data abstraction were performed independently by each review author. The adverse event rates were calculated for the restricted and liberal water intake groups for each dichotomous outcome, and the relative risk and risk difference were computed. In addition, the maximal weight loss results were recorded and the weighted mean difference was computed.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-09 05:26:35 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The analysis of the five studies taken together indicated that restricted water intake significantly increased postnatal weight loss and significantly reduced the risks of patent ductus arteriosus and necrotizing enterocolitis. With restricted water intake, there were trends toward increased risk of dehydration and reduced risks of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intracranial hemorrhage, and death but these trends were not statistically significant.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Based on this analysis, the most prudent prescription for water intake to premature infants would seem to be careful restriction of water intake so that physiological needs are met without allowing significant dehydration. This practice could be expected to decrease the risks of patent ductus arteriosus and necrotizing enterocolitis without significantly increasing the risk of adverse consequences.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-11-09 05:29:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Premature infants are generally too ill or immature to be fed by the breast or bottle. Therefore, the premature infant depends on his physicians and nurses to determine the rate of water administration by infusion into the infant's veins and arteries or by tube feeding into the stomach or intestine.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-11-09 05:32:38 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Estimation of the desirable intake of water each day is based on incomplete knowledge of the consequences of varying the rate of water intake. Moreover, the margin of error is small in managing the premature infant for several reasons. First, the premature infant's water losses to the environment are large (per kg body weight) and highly variable compared to larger, more mature infants or to children and adults. Second, the premature infant's kidneys are limited in their ability to compensate for varying water and solute intake by adjusting the concentration of the urine.</P>
<P>Several clinical trials have been conducted to examine the impact of varying the premature infant's water intake on clinical outcomes. These outcomes have included dehydration, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intracranial hemorrhage, and death. Dehydration may lead to hyperkalemia, cardiac arrhythmia, renal failure, and death. Patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and intracranial hemorrhage are serious complications that may lead to death or disability in premature infants. The first two of these have been found by some investigators to be more likely if the water intake is excessive.</P>

<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were employed. The methodological quality of each trial was reviewed independently by the two review authors. Each identified trial was assessed for methodological quality with respect to: a) masking of allocation, b) masking of intervention, c) completeness of follow-up, and d) masking of outcome assessment. This information is included in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table.</P>
<P>For the updated review in 2010 and 2014, the 'Risk of bias' table was completed. The two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Any disagreement was resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>The risk of bias table addressed the following questions.</P>
<P>1. Sequence generation: was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: adequate (any truly random process for example a random number table, computer random number generator); inadequate (any nonrandom process for example odd or even date of birth, hospital or clinic record number); or unclear.</P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment: was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: adequate (for example telephone or central randomization, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); inadequate (open random allocation, unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation, date of birth); or unclear.</P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors: was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed the methods as: adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants; adequate, inadequate or unclear for study personnel; and adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors and specific outcomes assessed.</P>
<P>4. Incomplete outcome data: were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>For each included study, and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total number of randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. We assessed methods as: adequate (&lt; 20% missing data), inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data) or unclear.</P>
<P>5. Selective outcome reporting: were reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>For each included study, we assessed the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias as: adequate (where it was clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review were reported), inadequate (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported, one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified, outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used, study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported) or unclear. </P>
<P>6. Other sources of bias: was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns regarding other possible sources of bias (for example whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as: yes, no or unclear.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2014-11-12 09:28:32 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five studies were included in this analysis. All were RCTs of varying water intake in premature infants. Each study compared two groups, one of whom received liberal water intake (this was considered the standard or control therapy) and the other restricted water intake. The principal difference among the studies was the timing and duration of the period when the infants' water intake was determined by the study protocol. In the Bell study (<LINK REF="STD-Bell-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bell 1980</LINK>), the prescribed water intake was begun before 72 hours of age and continued up to age 30 days (unless any of certain criteria were met first). In the Kavvadia study (<LINK REF="STD-Kavvadia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kavvadia 2000</LINK>), the prescribed water intake was given only during the first seven days of life; this study was limited to infants who required assisted ventilation starting within six hours of birth. In the Lorenz study (<LINK REF="STD-Lorenz-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Lorenz 1982</LINK>), the prescribed water intake was given only during the first five days of life.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Summary</HEADING>
<P>The analysis of the five studies taken together indicated that restricted water intake significantly increased postnatal weight loss and significantly reduced the risks of patent ductus arteriosus and necrotizing enterocolitis. With restricted water intake there were trends toward increased risk of dehydration and reduced risks of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intracranial hemorrhage and death, but these trends were not statistically significant.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-11-10 02:28:34 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This analysis shows what appear to be significant advantages to a restrictive strategy for managing the water intake of premature infants. When considered collectively using meta-analysis, the infants in these five trials who were in the restricted groups were at lower risk of patent ductus arteriosus and necrotizing enterocolitis, with no significant increase in adverse effects. There were trends toward increased risk of dehydration and decreased risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intracranial hemorrhage and death with restricted water intake but these trends were not significant. It is important to use caution in extrapolating these results to extremely premature infants, who were under-represented in these studies.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-11-10 02:29:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on this analysis, the most prudent prescription for water intake of premature infants would seem to be careful restriction of water intake so that physiological needs are met without allowing significant dehydration. This practice could be expected to decrease the risks of patent ductus arteriosus and necrotizing enterocolitis without a significant increase in adverse consequences.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-11-10 02:30:32 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future research in this area might be directed toward refining the critical period during which water intake must be controlled in order to achieve the desired reduction in complications of prematurity. It would also be valuable to develop models for predicting optimal water intakes, which take into account the most important determinants of water requirement such as birth weight, gestational age, postnatal age and ambient humidity. Finally, future studies should target the most vulnerable group, extremely premature infants.</P>

<P>Water intake was controlled by study protocol until one of six criteria was met: significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), dehydration, death, full enteral feedings, transfer to another hospital, or age 30 days. This was a randomized, unblinded clinical trial. Enrolled infants were divided into eight groups (prognostic stratification) according to three factors thought to influence the risk of PDA: birth weight below or above 1.25 kg, size for gestational age (AGA versus SGA), and respiratory status (presence or absence of significant RDS). Within each of the resulting eight groups, subjects were randomly assigned to either of two treatment groups ('low' and 'high' volume water intake) by opening the next opaque, sealed envelope from the pile for the corresponding prognostic group; the envelope contained the designation of 'low' or 'high' volume group as determined from a table of random numbers prior to enrollment of the first subject in the study. Within each of the eight prognostic groups, the randomization was balanced so that the number of low and high volume infants was equal after every second infant was enrolled into that group. Consecutively enrolled infants in each group were paired for analysis. A two-sided sequential plan was used, and the outcomes for discordant pairs of infants were plotted on this plan. No confounding variables were identified. No infants were withdrawn from the study. Infants were cared for in unhumidified single-walled incubators.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>The participants were 170 infants with birth weight ranging from 751 to 2000 g. They were enrolled within the first three days of life. Complete accounting is given for infants in this weight range who contemporaneously were not enrolled in the study. Infants were excluded who by the third day of life had died, were receiving more than half of their water intake enterally, had evidence of PDA or other congenital heart defect, were suspected of having renal anomaly or injury or elevated intracranial pressure, or were clinically dehydrated. Of the 384 consecutive infants admitted with birth weight between 751 and 2000 g, 123 were excluded according to one or more of the aforementioned criteria. Of the remaining 261 eligible infants, consent was not sought in 39 cases and was denied in 52 cases. The remaining 170 infants were enrolled in the study. The mean birth weight was 1.4 kg in both groups, and the mean gestational age was 31 weeks.</P>

<P>The subjects' total water intake (enteral plus parenteral) was determined by study protocol. An upper limit was set for the 'low' volume group, and a lower limit was set for the 'high' volume group.

<P>The duration of the study (control of water intake according to study criteria) was for five days after birth. This was a randomized, unblinded clinical trial. The details of randomization are not given, but the subjects were first stratified according to birthweight group (750 to 999 g, 1000 to 1249 g, and 1250 to 1500 g), 5-minute Apgar score (6 or less versus more than 6), presence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and hospital of birth (inborn versus outborn). No confounding variables were identified in a comparison of demographic features in the two groups. Deviations from the protocol were allowed for infants with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), but the number for whom this occurred is not stated. Seven of 108 infants were withdrawn from the study. Two infants in the liberal water intake group were subsequently found to have non-PDA congenital heart defects; two in the restricted water intake group were withdrawn because of intestinal obstruction or perforation requiring surgery; and three infants in the restricted water intake group died within 24 hours of enrollment. In addition, 13 infants were excluded from analysis because they had no matching infant (according to the above stratification criteria) who received the other treatment.
