<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-01-08 10:10:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hip fractures located outside the hip joint capsule (extracapsular hip fractures) may be surgically fixed using metal implants. Often these are extramedullary devices consisting of a screw or rod, inserted in the upper part of the thigh bone (femur) to bridge (fix) the fracture, connected to a plate secured to the femur. Sometimes external fixators are used. In these, the stabilising component is held outside the thigh by pins or screws driven into the bone on either side of the fracture.</P>
<P>The 18 randomised controlled trials included in this review tested seven comparisons in a total of 2615 mainly female and older participants. All trials had methodological flaws that may affect the validity of their results and there was a general lack of evidence on long-term effects and functional recovery. Some extramedullary implants appeared to be associated with an increased risk of fixation complications and reoperation. In particular, three trials comparing a fixed nail plate (Jewett or McLaughlin) with the sliding hip screw (the 'standard' extramedullary device for these fractures) found an increased risk of fixation failure for fixed nail plates. Less invasive implants, such as the external fixator, which require smaller incisions resulted in less blood loss and often quicker operations than the sliding hip screw.</P>
<P>We concluded that the sliding hip screw seems preferable to older types of fixed nail plates given their high rate of implant and fixation failure. However, there was not enough evidence to draw conclusions for other comparisons of extramedullary implants or on the use of external fixators.</P>

<P>Three trials of 458 participants compared the Medoff plate with the SHS. There was a trend to higher blood losses and longer operation times for the Medoff plate along with a trend to a lower risk of fixation failure with the Medoff plate for unstable trochanteric fractures.</P>
<P>Two trials of 676 participants compared the Medoff plate with three different screw-plate systems. There were no statistically significant differences in outcome for trochanteric fractures.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-01-08 11:23:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Proximal femoral fractures, generally termed 'hip fractures', can be subdivided into intracapsular fractures (those occurring proximal to the attachment of the hip joint capsule to the femur) and extracapsular (those occurring distal to the hip joint capsule). Extracapsular fractures are those which traverse the femur within the area of bone bounded by the intertrochanteric line proximally up to a distance of five centimetres from the distal part of the lesser trochanter. Numerous subdivisions and classification methods exist for these fractures, and other terms that are used to describe these fractures include trochanteric, subtrochanteric, pertrochanteric, intertrochanteric, basal and lateral femoral fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The majority of these fractures occur in an older population with an average age of around 80 years. Females predominate over males by about four to one. The number of people sustaining a hip fracture continues to rise due to a combination of an increasingly elderly population and a continued increase in the age specific incidence in some countries. An estimated 1.26 million hip fractures occurred in adults in 1990 with predictions of numbers rising to 7.3 up to 21.3 million by the year 2050 (<LINK REF="REF-Gulberg-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulberg 1997</LINK>). Approximately half of these fractures are extracapsular.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-06-14 13:04:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Operative treatment was introduced in the 1950s using a variety of different implants. An extramedullary fixation implant refers to an implant, which has a nail, or screw, which is passed up the femoral neck to the femoral head. This is connected to a side plate, which is secured to the femur using screws. A variant is the external fixator, in which the stabilising component is held outside the thigh by pins or screws driven into the bone on either side of the fracture.</P>
<P>The sliding hip screw (SHS) is synonymous with the term compression hip screw and equivalent models such as the Dynamic, Richards or Ambi hip screws. It consists of a lag screw, passed up the femoral neck to the head, which is then attached to a plate on the side of the femur. These are considered 'dynamic' implants as they have the capacity for sliding at the plate/screw junction to allow for collapse at the fracture site. Currently the most prevalent implant for the surgical treatment of extracapsular fractures is the SHS and this is considered the standard treatment for extracapsular hip fractures by most orthopaedic surgeons.</P>
<P>Fixed nail plates (FNP) consist of a nail, which is passed up the femoral neck to the femoral head, connected to a plate on the femur. These implants have no capacity for sliding and hence are termed 'static' or 'fixed' implants. In some implants, such as the Jewett nail, the nail is fixed to the plate at manufacture. In others, such as the Thornton or McLaughlin nail plates, the nail is connected to the plate at the time of surgery with a locking bolt.</P>
<P>The Resistance Augmented Bateaux or Rigidity Augmentation Baixauli plate (RAB plate) is similar to a fixed nail plate of the Jewett type, but has an additional oblique strut to connect the nail and the side plate. This strut increases the strength of the implant and resists collapse occurring at the fracture site.</P>
<P>The Pugh nail (<LINK REF="REF-Pugh-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pugh 1955</LINK>) is similar to the SHS except that, instead of a lag screw being passed up the femoral neck, a nail with a trifin or three-flanged terminus is inserted by a punching mechanism. This is then connected to the side plate in the same manner as for a SHS.</P>
<P>The Medoff plate (<LINK REF="REF-Medoff-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medoff 1991</LINK>) is a modification of the sliding hip screw, where a lag screw is again passed up the femoral neck and attached to a plate on the side of the femur. The difference is that the plate has an inner and outer sleeve, which can slide between each other. This creates an additional capacity for sliding to occur at the level of the lesser trochanter as well as at the lag screw. An additional variant of the Medoff plate is the capability of compressing the fracture distally using the two interlocking plates and a compression screw. In addition, sliding at the lag screw can be prevented with a locking screw to create a 'one way' sliding Medoff instead of a 'two way' sliding Medoff. At a later date the locking device on the lag screw can be removed to 'dynamise' the fracture. Case series reports of the Medoff plate have described technical details of the operation (<LINK REF="REF-Lunsjo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunsjo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olsson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsson 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Gotfried percutaneous compression plate (PCCP) has a side plate that is inserted, via a small incision level to the lesser trochanter, by use of a connecting jig. Using the latter, two sliding proximal screws are passed up the femoral neck and the plate is fixed to the femur shaft with three screws. The insertion technique is designed to minimise the damage to soft tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Gotfried-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotfried 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The type of external fixator reviewed here is held outside the thigh by two pairs of pins. One pair is passed up the femoral neck under X-ray control. The other pair is placed in the femur. The fixator is left in place until the fracture has healed, which usually takes about three months. It is then removed under local anaesthesia, generally as an outpatient procedure.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-01-08 10:11:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There remains continuing controversy over the choice of implant for extracapsular hip fractures. Complications related to failure of the implant holding the fracture in place whilst fracture healing takes place continue to be reported with an incidence of 3% to 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2002</LINK>). These complications are increased in the more comminuted (unstable fractures). In the last decade, there have been a number of new implants that are aimed at reducing the occurrence of fracture healing complications. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1998, and last updated in 2005.</P>

<P>For this update of the review, risk of bias was independently assessed, without masking of the source and authorship of the trial reports for all included trials, by both review authors. We used the tool outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool incorporates assessment of randomisation (sequence generation and allocation concealment), blinding (of participants and treatment providers, and outcome assessors), completeness of outcome data, selection of outcomes reported and other sources of bias. We considered subjective outcomes (e.g. pain) and objective outcomes (death, reoperation) separately in our assessment of blinding of outcome assessment; and short term and longer-term outcomes separately in our assessment of completeness of outcome data. We assessed risk of bias related to surgeons' experience with the devices prior to commencement of the trial, this was generally rated as 'high' where there was a lack of information on measures taken to avoid learning curve problems, often in the context of a large number of operating surgeons. All differences were resolved by discussion.</P>

<P>Allocation concealment was considered assured in four studies, three of which used sealed numbered envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Janzing-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Janzing 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peyser-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Peyser 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2011</LINK>); treatment assignment was confirmed as being independent of the surgeon in <LINK REF="STD-Moroni-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moroni 2005</LINK>. While insufficient details were provided to assign a low risk of bias rating, allocation concealment was possible in the three studies that used sealed envelopes opened in the operating theatre (<LINK REF="STD-Kosygan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kosygan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lunsjo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lunsjo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lunsjo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lunsjo 2001</LINK>) as well as <LINK REF="STD-Vossinakis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vossinakis 2002</LINK>, which used sealed numbered envelopes.

<P>The only study to report on length of surgery was <LINK REF="STD-Esser-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Esser 1986</LINK>, with an average operating time of 48 minutes for the Jewett nail plate against 57 minutes for the SHS, a difference that was reported not to be significant when surgeon's experience and reduction type were taken into consideration.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Fracture fixation complications</HEADING>
<P>These were poorly documented in all studies; the available data for the various outcomes are presented in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Pitsaer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pitsaer 1993</LINK>, the only study to provide separate data on cut-out, showed a non-significant difference between the two groups for the 59 survivors (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.20). There were however 11 cases of bending or breakage of the McLaughlin nail plate compared with no cases for the SHS. <LINK REF="STD-Bannister-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bannister 1990</LINK> reported on non-union, early reoperations and the total fixation failure rate, but only gave the results for the 86 survivors who had complete clinical and radiographical data. For these, there was a significant increase in fixation failure, defined as cut-out or bending or breaking of the implant, for the Jewett nail plate (25/36 versus 8/50). Pooling of the results from these two studies showed a significantly increased fixation failure rate for the fixed nail plate (RR 4.27, 95% CI 2.44 to 7.45). There was no statistically significant difference in pooled reoperation rates (6/62 versus 4/83: RR 1.97, 95% CI 0.59 to 6.58). <LINK REF="STD-Esser-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Esser 1986</LINK> reported that technical complications at the time of surgery were more common for the SHS (24% versus 2%), which may be a learning curve issue as the surgeons were less experienced in the use of the SHS.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Operative details</HEADING>
<P>The median operative times for the two procedures were almost identical in <LINK REF="STD-Buciuto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Buciuto 1998</LINK> (64 versus 63 minutes). The difference in the mean operative times in favour of the SHS group in <LINK REF="STD-Lizaur-Utrilla-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lizaur Utrilla 1998</LINK> was indicated as being statistically significant (50 versus 43 minutes; reported P = 0.02).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Buciuto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Buciuto 1998</LINK> reported median operative blood loss was 400 millilitres for both the RAB plate and the SHS. <LINK REF="STD-Lizaur-Utrilla-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lizaur Utrilla 1998</LINK> reported a statistically significantly higher blood loss in the RAB plate group (1045 ml versus 985 ml; reported P = 0.02).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Fracture fixation complications</HEADING>
<P>These outcomes were only reported for trial participants who were included in the final analysis of each trial; the available data for the various outcomes are presented in <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>. Twice as many RAB plate operations (14 versus 7) were reported as being technically difficult in <LINK REF="STD-Lizaur-Utrilla-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lizaur Utrilla 1998</LINK>. Operative complications, comprising two fractures of the greater trochanter and two cases in which the tip of the nail did not settle on the nail support, were only reported for participants of the RAB plate group in <LINK REF="STD-Lizaur-Utrilla-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lizaur Utrilla 1998</LINK> (RR 9.22, 95% CI 0.50 to 168.52). Similarly, the two cases of implant breakage and two cases of implant disassembly occurred in the RAB plate group of this trial. Cut-out in the two trials was reported for six participants of RAB plate group and 11 participants of the SHS group (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.49). One study, <LINK REF="STD-Buciuto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Buciuto 1998</LINK> accounted for almost all of these cut-outs with only one in each group for <LINK REF="STD-Lizaur-Utrilla-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lizaur Utrilla 1998</LINK>. Other reported complications, presented in <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>, of non-union, avascular necrosis and fracture distal to the plate showed no notable differences between the two implants.</P>
<P>The pooled fixation failure rate (excluding cases of varus angulation) was similar in the two groups (21/173 versus 22/179; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.74). (This assumes that each complication occurred in separate people in <LINK REF="STD-Lizaur-Utrilla-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lizaur Utrilla 1998</LINK>.) However, these results were significantly heterogeneous (P = 0.02): where just over half as many fixation failures occurred in the RAB plate group as in the SHS group (8 versus 16) in <LINK REF="STD-Buciuto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Buciuto 1998</LINK>, the converse (13 versus 6) occurred in <LINK REF="STD-Lizaur-Utrilla-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lizaur Utrilla 1998</LINK>. Similarly, the reoperation rates of two trials were significantly heterogeneous (P = 0.02); these were in opposite directions although the pooled data showed similar numbers for the two intervention groups (21/173 versus 26/179; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.43). Nearly three quarters of reoperations were in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Buciuto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Buciuto 1998</LINK> and included 20 cases (9 RAB, 11 SHS) where the implant was removed after the fracture had healed due to local discomfort (lateral tenderness or unspecified leg pain, or both). A separate publication by Buciuto (<LINK REF="REF-Buciuto-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buciuto 1997</LINK>), which documented the outcome of these 20 participants, reported seven spontaneous fractures of the femoral neck and drew attention to this outcome "as a serious and frequent complication after implant removal".</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lizaur-Utrilla-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lizaur Utrilla 1998</LINK> reported two cases of superficial wound infection in each group.

In these two studies, the Medoff screw-plate was compared with one of three screw-plate systems (sliding hip screw (SHS), the SHS with a trochanteric stabilising plate (TSP) and the dynamic compression screw (DCS)); the latter being chosen by the operating surgeon. Since the choice of which one of the three screw-plate systems was selected was not random, individual results for these are not presented despite being made available in the trial reports.

The overall failure of fracture fixation was not statistically significantly different between groups (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-005.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.4</LINK>: 18/268 versus 12/301; RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.43).

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Lunsjo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lunsjo 1999</LINK>, there were no cases of cut-out in the Medoff plate group, compared with four in the screw-plate group (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>). Non-union of the fracture occurred in one person in the screw-plate group. Breakage of the implant occurred in one participant of the Medoff group compared with three participants of the screw-plate group. No fracture occurred below the implants. Overall failure of fracture fixation was significantly less common in the Medoff group compared with the screw-plate group (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-005.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.4</LINK>: 1/55 versus 8/52; RR 0.12; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.91).

These deviations included the use of the locking set screw in the Medoff group for trochanteric fractures or failure to use the locking set screw for subtrochanteric fractures (attributed to inexperience with the Medoff plate) and supplementary fixation (such as use of cerclage wire) in the screw-plate group.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fixed nail plates versus the SHS</HEADING>
<P>Only three small studies, all of poor methodology, were identified. Furthermore, the poor reporting of outcomes within these studies means that clear-cut conclusions regarding the difference between fixed nail plates and the SHS cannot be made from randomised trials. However within the limited data presented, there was a significantly increased risk of failure of fixation (61% versus 14%) for the fixed nail plates. In addition, there was potential for more hip pain and reduced mobility after a fixed nail plate.</P>
<P>The shortage of evidence from randomised trials may be because the SHS and fixed nail plate have been extensively evaluated by other methods before the more widespread use of randomised trials. Mechanical tests have consistently indicated that the fixed nail plates are weaker than the SHS and therefore more liable to break. Case series reports and comparative case series reports have also supported the conclusion that fixed nail plates have a markedly increased risk of fixation failure (<LINK REF="REF-Chinoy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chinoy 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fixed nail plates are often marginally cheaper than the SHS. The saving in implant costs represents only a small proportion of the total cost of treating a hip fracture. Furthermore, as a consequence of the increased risk of fixation failure there is a potentially increased, but not proven in this review, risk of reoperation with its associated costs. Reduced implant cost should not therefore be cited as justification for using a fixed nail plate.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Resistance augmented bateaux (RAB) plate versus the SHS</HEADING>
<P>The two studies identified gave contrasting results with one study (<LINK REF="STD-Buciuto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Buciuto 1998</LINK>) tending to favour the RAB plate, in terms of a lower fixation failure rate and improved anatomical restoration, and the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Lizaur-Utrilla-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lizaur Utrilla 1998</LINK>) favouring the SHS in terms of intra-operative outcomes and lower fixation failure rate. It should be noted that the combined overall fixation failure rate for both implants in the two studies was 43/352 (12.2%) which is higher than that reported in other randomised trials (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2010</LINK>). The high fixation failure rate for the SHS was accounted for primarily by the rate of cut-out in <LINK REF="STD-Buciuto-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Buciuto 1998</LINK> (10/95 (10.5%)). The overall cut-out rate for the SHS in a Cochrane review of trials comparing it with intramedullary nails (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2010</LINK>) was 39/1416 (2.8%). The small numbers of patients involved, lack of intention-to-treat analysis, incomplete outcome ascertainment and clear heterogeneity in the findings of these two trials means that no conclusions can be made about the relative effectiveness of these two implants.</P>

No cases of fixation failure for stable fractures occurred. <LINK REF="STD-Watson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 1998</LINK> referred to the "larger surgical exposure" (resulting in increased operating time and blood loss for the Medoff plate group) as the basis for their recommendation for precluding the use of this device for stable fracture fixation. However this conclusion should be interpreted with caution due to the small numbers involved. <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 2001</LINK> used a smaller four-hole Medoff plate, which may account for the smaller differences noticed between implants for length of surgery and operative blood loss.</P>
<P>For unstable fractures there was a statistically significantly reduction in the fixation failure rate in the Medoff plate group, but this needs to be confirmed in further studies before definite conclusions can be made. It should also be noted that the overall failure rate for the SHS (17/237 (7.2%)), mainly resulting from cut-out, is higher than other randomised studies as discussed earlier.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Lunsjo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lunsjo 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lunsjo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lunsjo 1999</LINK> compared the Medoff plate with three other screw-plates in unstable trochanteric and in subtrochanteric fractures respectively. These studies had major limitations as the 'control' implant was one of three screw-plate systems, which could be used at the discretion of the operating surgeon. This study design means that it is not possible to conclude if the Medoff plate was superior, equivalent or inferior to any particular one of the three implants. Both studies involved a large number of surgeons in eight hospitals and it seems likely that the study design was compromised to allow for variation in practice in order to facilitate recruitment. The results of <LINK REF="STD-Lunsjo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lunsjo 2001</LINK> showed no statistically significant differences for the Medoff plate in comparison with the screw plate systems for trochanteric fractures. For subtrochanteric fracture (<LINK REF="STD-Lunsjo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lunsjo 1999</LINK>), there was a tendency to a lower fixation failure rate and reoperation rate for the Medoff plate in comparison with the three other plates. At present, all that can be said is that the Medoff plate remains potentially useful for the fixation of unstable trochanteric and of subtrochanteric fractures, but its superiority over other devices, in particular the SHS, remains to be confirmed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Gotfried percutaneous compression plate (PCCP) versus the SHS</HEADING>
<P>Only limited conclusions can be drawn from the four small studies comparing the PCCP with the SHS. Three of the trials reported intra-operative problems with the PCCP, some of which precluded its use. This indicates some particular restrictions to its use. Consistent with its less invasive method of insertion, there is some evidence of a reduced need for transfusion after surgery with the PCCP. There was no proven difference in mortality. There were insufficient data on long term functional outcomes or residual pain to make any definite conclusions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pertrochanteric external fixator versus the SHS</HEADING>
<P>The three studies for this comparison, which involved only 200 people, found a shorter operative time, less surgical trauma, less post-operative pain, earlier mobilisation and generally a shorter hospital stay in the fixator group. Superficial (pin-track) infection was more common in the fixator group for two of the studies, although <LINK REF="STD-Moroni-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moroni 2005</LINK> recorded no instances of superficial infection and invited consideration that this reflected the use of hydroxyapatite-coated external fixator pins; this is tested in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Moroni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moroni 2004</LINK>) that has been excluded from this review. Long term outcomes were poorly reported in all studies with no definite differences being apparent. While the short term results reported appear promising for the external fixator, there is insufficient evidence overall from these three small studies to draw conclusions of the relative merits of the two devices.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-01-08 12:11:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For each comparison considered here, the limited patient numbers available at follow-up hindered the drawing of definite conclusions for key outcomes related to failure of fixation. The SHS has been to have a low overall fixation failure rate (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2010</LINK>). Thus to be able to determine if an implant has an equivalent or significantly lower failure rate in comparison with the SHS many more patients need to be studied. Furthermore, the included studies show a lack of consistency and other deficiencies in the reporting of outcomes. Many of the outcomes reported have been intermediate outcomes, or concerned with process. The general adoption of an agreed set of outcomes for trials comparing the effectiveness of different implant designs would be a useful development. This is particularly relevant for the functional outcomes, including residual pain and regain of mobility.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-01-28 16:31:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched widely, without imposing restrictions on language or publication status, but it remains possible that we may have missed some relevant studies. These may, for instance, have been unpublished trials, raising the possibility of publication bias, or not published in journals listed in the main databases. However, our scrutiny of other reviews and articles on this topic over the years has been reassuring in that these have not identified trials of which we had not been already aware. We anticipate, however, that unpublished data from early studies, which might have augmented some comparisons, may not now be available.</P>

<P>The limited and methodologically flawed data available from randomised trials support the general view, based on mechanical and other clinical evaluations, that fixed nail plates have markedly higher fixation failure rates compared with the sliding hip screw (SHS). Although the evidence from randomised trials is insufficient to confirm an overall superiority of the SHS for the final outcome measures, the SHS is preferable to fixed nail plates from the results of this outcome alone.</P>
<P>Insufficient evidence exists to determine if the Pugh nail, the RAB plate, the Medoff plate, the Gotfried percutaneous compression plate or the pertrochanteric external fixator produce results comparable or superior to that of the SHS.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-01-28 16:19:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In spite of reservations over the data that are available, there is little to suggest that fixed nail plates should be evaluated further in well-designed trials. The Pugh nail is an early design of the SHS and it is doubtful if further development or research on this implant is appropriate.</P>
<P>Further randomised trials, employing good methodology and with full reporting of outcomes, are required to determine if the other implants studied to date are inferior, equivalent to or have any advantages over the SHS. This particularly applies for the Medoff plate, PCCP plate and external fixators. Until such studies are completed, caution should be exercised in using these newer implant designs. Such trials should be sufficiently powered to be capable of demonstrating both equivalence and difference, and abide by the CONSORT criteria for design and reporting of non-pharmacological studies (<LINK REF="REF-Boutron-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutron 2008</LINK>). Linked with other trials comparing different surgical implants for these fractures, the development of a benchmark set of outcomes, and concurrent economic evaluation are warranted (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>This study was reported as a conference abstract of a randomised trial, involving 50 patients with unstable trochanteric fractures, comparing the sliding hip screw versus the same implant supplemented with a trochanteric stabilising plate. The abstract reported that the operative blood loss and length of surgery were increased for those treated with the supplementary stabilising plate although the difference was not statistically significant. The functional outcome, limb length discrepancy and abductor muscle strength were all reported to be statistically significantly better for those treated with the stabilising plate. There were three cases of cut-out in the SHS group and none in the stabilising plate group. We were unable to contact the trial authors for this trial.
