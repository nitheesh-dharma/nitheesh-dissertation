<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-22 22:01:31 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Assisted hatching is a technique sometimes used for IVF (in vitro fertilisation) and similar procedures. It involves thinning the coat surrounding the fertilised egg, or making a hole in it. It is suggested that this may improve the chance of the embryo attaching to the womb so that pregnancy can begin. In this review of randomised controlled trials there was no evidence of a benefit in the live birth rate with assisted hatching although there was an increase in multiple pregnancy rates. There was some evidence that assisted hatching improves the chances of pregnancy in women for whom IVF has been repeatedly unsuccessful, but more research is needed.</P>

<P>Failure of implantation and conception may result from an inability of the blastocyst to escape from its outer coat, which is known as the zona pellucida. Artificial disruption of this coat is known as assisted hatching and has been proposed as a method for improving the success of assisted conception by facilitating embryo implantation.<BR/>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-09-17 12:48:31 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register (August 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (August 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to August 2012).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-10-22 21:48:24 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Three authors identified and independently screened trials. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of AH (mechanical, chemical or laser disruption of the zona pellucida prior to embryo replacement) versus no AH that reported live birth or clinical pregnancy.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-07-29 12:11:23 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Three authors independently performed quality assessments and data extraction.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-29 14:24:45 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty-one trials reported clinical pregnancy data, including 1992 clinical pregnancies in 5728 women. There was no significant difference in the odds of live birth in the AH group compared with the control group (9 RCTs; odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.26, moderate quality evidence), with no evidence of significant heterogeneity (P = 0.38) or inconsistency (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 6%). Analysis of the clinical pregnancy rates from the nine studies which reported live birth showed a non-significant result (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.25 ).</P>
<P>Analysis of all of the studies included in this update (31 RCTs) showed that the clinical pregnancy rate in women who underwent AH was slightly improved, but the level only just reached statistical significance (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.27, moderate quality evidence). However, it is important to note that the heterogeneity for this combined analysis for clinical pregnancy rate was statistically significant (P = 0.001) and the I<SUP>2</SUP> was 49%. Subgroup analysis of women who had had a previous failed attempt at IVF found improved clinical pregnancy rates in the women undergoing AH compared with the women in the control group (9 RCTs, n = 1365; OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.81) with I<SUP>2</SUP> = 20%.<BR/>
<BR/>Miscarriage rates per woman were similar in both groups (14 RCTs; OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.54, P = 0.90, moderate quality evidence). Multiple pregnancy rates per woman were significantly increased in women who were randomised to AH compared with women in the control groups (14 RCTs, 3447 women; OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.70, P = 0.004, low quality evidence).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-10-22 21:56:58 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This update has demonstrated that whilst assisted hatching (AH) does appear to offer a significantly increased chance of achieving a clinical pregnancy, the extent to which it may do so only just reaches statistical significance. The 'take home' baby rate was still not proven to be increased by AH. The included trials provided insufficient data to investigate the impact of AH on several important outcomes. Most trials still failed to report on live birth rates.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-11-08 08:48:33 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The World Health Organization estimates that one in six couples experiences some delay in conception (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1975</LINK>), and an increasing number of couples require treatment by the assisted conception (AC) procedures of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In the UK in 2008, 12,211 successful births giving rise to 15,082 babies were achieved from 50,687 assisted conception cycles (24.1%), increasing from one live birth in seven cycles in 1992 to one in four (<LINK REF="REF-HFEA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">HFEA 2000</LINK>; <A HREF="http://www.hfea.gov.uk/docs/2010-12-08_Fertility_Facts_and_Figures_2008_Publication_PDF.PDF">HFEA 2010</A>).</P>
<P>The implantation rate of embryos resulting from IVF cycles is generally less than 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Gardner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lopata-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopata 1996</LINK>), culminating in a generally low 'take home baby rate' (<LINK REF="REF-Sengoku-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sengoku 2000</LINK>). This may be the result of poor embryo quality, poor endometrial receptivity, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Denker-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denker 1993</LINK>). The human embryo is surrounded by an outer glycoprotein coat (zona pellucida) that, during fertilisation, prevents penetration by multiple sperm or sperm from other species (<LINK REF="REF-Bleil-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bleil 1980</LINK>). After fertilisation, the zona maintains the three-dimensional integrity of the uncompacted embryo, facilitates free passage of the compacted embryo through the fallopian tube into the uterus and protects the embryo from micro-organisms and immune cells (<LINK REF="REF-Bronson-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bronson 1970</LINK>). The blastocyst-stage embryo eventually hatches out of this protective coat prior to implantation (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1967</LINK>).</P>
<P>Human embryos resulting from superovulation develop more slowly in vitro compared to embryos in vivo, manifest a relatively high degree of cytogenetic abnormalities and undergo cellular fragmentation; and only a small proportion achieve blastocyst-stage development (<LINK REF="REF-Hsu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsu 1999</LINK>). Cultured embryos also hatch and implant at lower rates than occurs naturally (<LINK REF="REF-Harlow-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harlow 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mercader-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercader 2001</LINK>). It is unclear whether this is due to 'hardening' of the zona pellucida as a result of cross-linking of its constituent glycoproteins (ZP1, ZP2, ZP3) in an in vitro environment (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1991</LINK>). Zona thickness appears to be influenced by a woman's age, hormone profile (high early proliferative phase follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)), smoking and the cause of infertility, and correlates negatively with embryo implantation rates (<LINK REF="REF-Loret-de-Mola-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loret de Mola 1997</LINK>). With IVF and ICSI treatment, the possible combination of delayed embryo hatching and advanced endometrial development may present an unfavourable environment for implantation (<LINK REF="REF-Check-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Check 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hsu-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsu 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-10-22 22:24:36 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Assisted hatching is a technique sometimes used for IVF and similar procedures. It involves thinning the coat surrounding a fertilised egg, or making a hole in it. This was thought to improve the chances of the embryo attaching to the womb so that pregnancy could begin. Artificially disrupting the zona pellucida is known as assisted hatching (AH) and was first suggested in the 1980s. It was subsequently observed in women undergoing embryo biopsy for pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Fehilly-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fehilly 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>A variety of techniques have since been employed to assist embryo hatching, including partial mechanical zona dissection, zona drilling and zona thinning, making use of acid tyrodes, proteinases, piezon vibrator manipulators and lasers (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Nuaim-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Nuaim 2002</LINK>). In this update, one of the randomised controlled trials employs a new method of AH, namely that of mechanical expansion (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 2010</LINK>). Regardless of the AH technique employed, it is also important to distinguish whether the zona has remained unbreached such as in thinning (chemically or lasered), been fully breached (when a hole is made chemically, with a laser or mechanically), or has been completely removed (chemically). This distinction may have implications for whether an embryo is able to undergo normal zona expansion and escape following AH (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>), and also subsequent monozygotic twinning (<LINK REF="REF-da-Costa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">da Costa 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Menezo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menezo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schieve-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schieve 2000</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-10-22 22:25:45 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are a variety of mechanisms by which AH could improve embryo implantation. The most obvious is that AH overcomes the zona pellucida hardening caused by IVF and cell culture or cryopreservation. Additionally, there is some evidence that embryos that have undergone zona manipulation for AH tend to implant one day earlier than unhatched embryos (<LINK REF="REF-Rink-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rink 1995</LINK>). Finally, as suggested by <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1992</LINK>, artificial opening could enhance hormonal and metabolite exchange in addition to messaging between the embryo and the endometrium.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-10-22 22:28:39 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For over a decade now, zona manipulation of some form has been offered to older women, those with high FSH levels, a high risk of zona hardening (as with in vitro oocyte maturation) and following repeated implantation failure (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Nuaim-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Nuaim 2002</LINK>). However, there remains considerable uncertainty over whether AH significantly improves IVF and ICSI success rates or whether it is associated with negative consequences. The previous update showed that AH results in a significant increase in clinical pregnancy rate when compared with no AH. AH failed to result in a statistically significant increase in live birth rate. However, few trials reported on live birth rate. We hoped that by updating this review and incorporating more studies more conclusive evidence of AH's effects on both clinical pregnancy and live birth rate, as well as other outcomes such as miscarriage and multiple pregnancy rates, could be achieved.</P>

<P>Trials were included that investigated any known method of AH after fertilisation. The techniques involved to disrupt the zona pellucida prior to embryo replacement were of the following forms:</P>
<UL>
<LI>mechanical (including a new technique of hydrostatic pressure injection after thawing);</LI>
<LI>chemical;</LI>
<LI>laser.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Assisted hatching took place to the following extents:</P>
<UL>
<LI>breaching the zona pellucida by a hole (by laser, chemical or mechanical means);</LI>
<LI>thinning the zona pellucida (but no actual hole created);</LI>
<LI>removing the whole of the zona pellucida.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In the trials, AH was performed on fresh embryos, cryopreserved embryos following thawing and prior to embryo transfer as well as vitrified-warmed embryos which were transferred at the cleavage stage. The effects of these interventions were compared to a control group in which AH was not performed.</P>
<P>Trials directly comparing different AH methods (without a no hatching control group) were excluded because the objective of this review was to determine the overall effectiveness of the technique of AH.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-11-08 08:56:58 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool (www.cochrane-handbook.org) to assess: allocation (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; selective reporting; and other bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by a third review author.</P>
<P>For each trial it was determined whether adequate allocation concealment was described, and the trial was classed as being at low risk of bias if this was the case. If it was not, or it was unclear how allocation concealment was achieved, the trial was classed as being high risk or as having an unclear risk, respectively. For each trial we also determined whether an acceptable method of randomisation was described within the text, for example by stating that a computer-generated randomisation list had been used. If this was the case, again the trial was classed as being at low risk in this respect. Similarly, if it was unclear, or the trial did not appear to be randomised, the trial was classed as having an unclear risk or being at high risk of bias, respectively. We determined who was blinded in each trial. If participants and medical staff in the trial were blinded to the allocation, the trial was at low risk. If it was not stated or was clear that this was not the case, the trial was again classed as having an unclear risk or as being at high risk of bias, respectively. Finally, selective reporting is an important issue in this review and is an important contributor to reporting bias with only a minority of trials reporting on the primary outcome of live birth. Each trial that reported live birth was classed as low risk whereas each trial which did not was classed as high risk.</P>

For the laser trials, however, there was significant heterogeneity, and for the mechanical method only one trial reported on multiple pregnancy, so there was a wide CI (44 women; OR 8.33, 95% CI 1.56 to 44.64).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Live birth</HEADING>
<P>In this update, the primary outcome remained live birth rate. Yet only nine of the 31 studies reported this outcome, representing only 34% of all women randomised in the studies. Although the live birth rate may not be representative of all the studies in this review, these studies are representative of those with robust randomisation methods and were considered to be of good quality.</P>
<P>There is no evidence as yet that assisted hatching (AH) impacts on live birth rate, and subgroup analysis does not provide evidence of any effects. It was disappointing that the conclusions of the review were still limited by the paucity of available data in probably the most important and sought after statistic on the impact of AH on assisted conception, namely the 'take home baby rate'. This reflects the gap that currently exists between the practice of assisted conception and clinical obstetrics and the absence of a central database of patient records that would facilitate follow up of these women by authorised agencies, like the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) in the UK. That only nine of the included trials from nine authors reported live birth data suggests haste on the part of the other trialists to disseminate data limited to short-term outcomes, and to all intents and purposes these data are incomplete.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Multiple pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>Overall, there was a statistically significant increase in multiple pregnancies per clinical pregnancy (38% increase in OR), indicating that AH does seem to increase the chances of multiple pregnancies. Given this significance in combination with the lack of concrete evidence of an increase in success at achieving live birth, it may bring us to consider the overall risks versus benefits of this technique.</P>
<P>The lack of reporting of live birth data in this group of studies is unfortunate as it limits the interpretation of the results, given this high multiple pregnancy rate, because as many as 5% of multiple pregnancies are lost between 20 and 40 weeks gestation. In addition, most studies were transferring two to four embryos although the numbers transferred were balanced between groups. The reason for the increase in multiple pregnancies can be attributed to an increase in implantation rates resulting in higher pregnancy rates or monozygotic twinning, or both, with AH. This must be taken into consideration in the planning of this procedure.</P>
<P>It is likely that reducing the number of embryos transferred to one will not completely eliminate monozygotic twinning. Implantation rate was not considered as an outcome in this update for two reasons. The pooling of embryo implantation data for meta-analysis is statistically problematic. Implantation is traditionally expressed 'per embryo transferred', without regard to the number of women. However, more than one embryo is normally transferred per woman, resulting in an embryo clustering effect and necessitating more advanced analysis to render the results meaningful. A statistically valid and easier approach is to express implantation 'per woman randomised'. This also has the advantage of being more useful in aiding understanding of the resulting live births. This approach requires, however, that the number of women with at least one gestation sac is reported, which is not the case in practice.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Clinical pregnancy</HEADING>
<P>All 31 included trials reported on clinical pregnancy. There were 1992 pregnancies amongst the 5728 participants, 1064 in the AH group and 928 in the control group. Similar to the previous update in 2007, this update has shown that, overall, AH does seem to increase the chance of achieving a clinical pregnancy, however the level to which it does so only just reaches statistical significance (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.27).</P>
<P>Restricting analysis of clinical pregnancy rate to those trials that went on to report live birth, the clinical pregnancy result showed statistically insignificant differences between the AH and the control groups (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.25, P = 0.18). Analysis of clinical pregnancy rate of the robust studies, which described allocation concealment and their method of randomisation as well as reporting on the live birth rate, gave a clinical pregnancy rate of 1.08 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.41, P = 0.60), again suggesting that AH may not give statistically significant increased chances of achieving clinical pregnancy.</P>
<P>Despite this, similar to 2007, further subgroup analysis of all 31 studies suggests that women undergoing IVF or ICSI cycles who have previously been unsuccessful may benefit from AH as well as those women with a poor prognosis. AH involving complete removal of the zona pellucida shows statistically significant differences in clinical pregnancy rates. The same applies for AH involving expansion of the zona pellucida; however, in this update, there was only one trial which employed this method. In contrast to the previous update, this update showed AH only had statistically significant effects among participants receiving fresh embryos for embryo transfer rather than AH using either fresh or frozen embryos for embryo transfer.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Miscarriage</HEADING>
<P>This review did not find sufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the impact of AH on miscarriage rates overall or for any of the subgroups considered.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The impact of AH on ectopic pregnancy, congenital and chromosomal abnormalities, blastocyst formation and embryo damage could unfortunately not be answered by this review because of the paucity of available data. This was disappointing as it leaves many unanswered questions about the perceived risks of the procedure, from embryo damage to chromosomal and congenital abnormalities.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-11-08 08:55:28 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A large number of trials were incorporated into this review, with a large sample size being investigated. The results of 5698 women in 31 trials are included in this review, leading to a generally acceptable level of evidence. However, failure of many trials to report on primary outcomes (live birth, multiple pregnancy) and variable levels of reporting on other outcomes will inevitably allow potential bias to be introduced into the analysis. This calls for standardised outcome reporting for future assisted conception trials.</P>

<P>Overall, the addition of the nine new trials in this update has not changed the findings regarding live birth that have been shown in previous reviews, namely that AH does not significantly increase the chances of a live birth. Clinical pregnancy rate again was shown to be slightly increased in women undergoing AH and this just reached a level of statistical significance.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-10-23 00:55:11 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Live birth is the primary outcome yet only nine trials reported on this. Therefore, there could be under reporting of live birth outcomes leading to this result (22 of the 31 trials did not report live birth rates). The addition of the new trials resulted in a further 2082 participants in this review update (36% of the 5728 participants). Subgroups including women who had previously had failed attempts at assisted reproduction and poor prognosis women did have increased clinical pregnancy rates in the assisted hatching (AH) groups, which reached significance.</P>
<P>There was a significant increase in multiple pregnancy rates. This significant increase in the rate of twinning raises concerns regarding the number of embryos transferred and AH. The statistically significant chance of a multiple pregnancy if a clinical pregnancy is achieved may bring the clinician to consider the overall safety of offering this procedure to women in the future, or offering the procedure only to specific subgroups for which AH may be favourable.<BR/>

<P>This review once again highlighted a wide range of currently unresolved issues that provide potential avenues for future research, including the need for high quality trials which report live births, clinical pregnancies and adverse events (including multiple pregnancies, miscarriages and long-term adverse outcomes), and which are powered to investigate effects in clinical subgroups.</P>
<P>The potential of assisted hatching in assisted conception makes it imperative that studies of high methodological quality (preferably multicentre trials with appropriate design, adequate power and appropriate duration of follow up) are undertaken to provide these urgently needed answers.</P>
