<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Newborn infants who have been deprived of oxygen before, during, or after delivery ("perinatal asphyxia") are at high risk of dying or developing brain damage. Studies in animal models suggest that over-production of the bodies' own opioids (substances similar to drugs like morphine) is detrimental. Furthermore, researchers have found that giving newborn animals with perinatal asphyxia a drug to counteract the effects of opioids (naloxone, an opioid antagonist) is beneficial. We found only one small randomised controlled trial that examined whether giving naloxone to newborn infants with suspected perinatal asphyxia improved their outcomes, but this trial did not assess the effect on death or disability. Further trials large enough to determine whether naloxone improves survival and/or reduces disability rates are therefore needed. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Studies in animal models have suggested that naloxone, a specific opiate antagonist, may improve outcomes for newborn infants with perinatal asphyxia. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of naloxone versus placebo or no drug, and of single versus multiple doses of naloxone, on mortality, long term neurological problems, severity of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, and frequency of neonatal seizures in newborn infants greater than 34 weeks gestation with suspected perinatal asphyxia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 - February 2007), EMBASE (1980 - February 2007), conference proceedings, and previous reviews.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing naloxone versus placebo, or no drug, or another dose of naloxone, in newborn infants of greater than 34 weeks' gestation with suspected perinatal asphyxia.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data was extracted using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by two authors. The pre-specified outcomes for this review were: death before hospital discharge, severe neurodevelopmental disability, severity of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, and seizures in the neonatal period.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Only one eligible randomised controlled trial was identified. This study compared the use of naloxone with placebo in newborn infants with an Apgar score of six or less at one minute after birth. There were not any data on the pre-specified outcomes for this review.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There are insufficient data available to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the routine use of naloxone for newborn infants of greater than 34 weeks' gestation with suspected perinatal asphyxia. A further randomised controlled trial is needed to determine if naloxone benefits newborn infants with suspected perinatal asphyxia. Such a trial should assess clinically important outcomes such as mortality, and adverse short and long term neurological outcomes. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-10 15:07:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Perinatal asphyxia is an important cause of mortality and of acquired brain damage in newborn infants. The incidence of death or severe neurological impairment following perinatal asphyxia is about 0.5 - 1.0 per 1000 live births in resource-rich countries (<LINK REF="REF-Levene-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levene 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thornberg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornberg 1995</LINK>). In resource-poor countries, perinatal asphyxia is probably much more common and is a major cause of perinatal mortality. Data from hospital based studies in such settings suggest incidences of 5 to 50 per 1000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Airede-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Airede 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oswyn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oswyn 2000</LINK>). These probably represent underestimates of the true community incidence of perinatal asphyxia. Although follow up programmes are less well developed in resource-poor countries, it is likely that perinatal asphyxia produces a substantial burden of world-wide mortality and disability.</P>
<P>Perinatal asphyxia may occur in utero, during labour and delivery, or in the postnatal period. There are numerous causes, and the clinical manifestations vary. The International Cerebral Palsy Task Force has suggested a number of criteria to assist in the clinical diagnosis of perinatal asphyxia and to help to determine the possible underlying causes (<LINK REF="REF-MacLennan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLennan 1999</LINK>). Of these diagnostic criteria, the two that are most relevant to the immediate clinical management in the post-natal period are: </P>
<P>1. Evidence of cardio-respiratory and neurological depression defined as an Apgar score less than 7 at 5 minutes. The Apgar score is most relevant for term and near term (greater than 34 weeks gestation) infants. In less mature neonates the Apgar score directly correlates with gestation and is a much less reliable indicator of perinatal asphyxia (<LINK REF="REF-Catlin-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catlin 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. Evidence of acute hypoxic compromise with acidaemia defined as pH less than 7 or base excess greater than 12 mmol/L in umbilical arterial cord blood, or a very early neonatal blood sample. However, in many instances, and especially in resource-poor settings, an assessment of fetal or neonatal acidaemia is not available.</P>
<P>Signs of neonatal "hypoxic-ischaemic" encephalopathy or signs of other organ dysfunction can also be part of the case-definition of perinatal asphyxia (<LINK REF="REF-MacLennan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLennan 1999</LINK>). However, these criteria are often not evident in the immediate post-natal period and are therefore not useful in determining the immediate post-natal management of suspected perinatal asphyxia. In fact, the aim of early intervention following suspected perinatal asphyxia is to minimise brain and other organ damage in the infant. </P>
<P>Brain damage associated with perinatal asphyxia occurs in two phases. Following a severe hypoxic-ischaemic event, early cell death results from primary exhaustion of the cellular energy stores. A secondary phase of programmed cell death (apoptosis) may occur several hours after the initial insult. The pathophysiology of apoptosis has been the subject of much research since there may be an opportunity to intervene following the asphyxial event to limit delayed cell death. Various pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions that may reduce apoptosis and minimise the extent of the brain damage are the subject of other systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evans-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hunt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kecskes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kecskes 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Enhanced brain endogenous opioid release has been implicated in the pathogenesis of post-asphyxial neuronal damage. Studies in animals have suggested that endogenous opioids released following perinatal asphyxia suppress medullary inspiratory neuronal discharge and worsen the neonatal depression caused by intrauterine asphyxia (<LINK REF="REF-Chernick-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chernick 1980</LINK>). Naloxone, a specific opiate antagonist, reverses this effect (<LINK REF="REF-Chernick-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chernick 1982</LINK>). Other studies in animals have suggested that blood-brain barrier disruption is related to poor neurological outcome following perinatal asphyxia, and that naloxone prevents both the disruption and the neurological dysfunction among those survivors with intact blood-brain barriers (<LINK REF="REF-Ting-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ting 1994</LINK>). However, naloxone has also been shown to exacerbate asphyxial brain damage in animals (<LINK REF="REF-Young-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1984</LINK>), possibly by causing inappropriate sympathomimetic surges (<LINK REF="REF-Padbury-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padbury 1987</LINK>). In a study of hypoxic newborn lambs, naloxone increased cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism, suggesting that endogenous opioid release protects the neonatal brain in hypoxia by diminishing the cerebral metabolic rate (<LINK REF="REF-Lou-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lou 1989</LINK>). </P>
<P>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Drugs recommends that naloxone should not be used in the resuscitation of all infants who are clinically depressed at birth. The AAP advises that naloxone should be "reserved for adjunctive therapy in selected infants who have not initiated or established independent respiration following ventilation, are significantly depressed, and have a high probability of being narcotized" (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1980</LINK>). These recommendations refer to infants of mothers who have received opiate for analgesia up to four hours prior to delivery. The dose of naloxone recommended in 1980, 0.01 mg/kg, was later revised to 0.1 mg/kg (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1990</LINK>). More recently the Neonatal Resuscitation Program has further refined this advice, suggesting that naloxone should only be given to infants with 1. severe respiratory depression after positive-pressure ventilation has restored a normal heart rate and colour, and 2. a history of maternal narcotic administration within the past four hours (<LINK REF="REF-NRP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NRP 2000</LINK>). The effect of naloxone for narcotic exposed newborn infants is the subject of another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-McGuire-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGuire 2007</LINK>). That review identified nine randomised controlled trials that compared naloxone versus placebo or no drug for newborn infants exposed to maternal narcotic analgesia prior to delivery. However, the infants recruited to those trials were not selected because of cardio-respiratory or neurological depression. In fact, infants with low Apgar scores were not eligible for inclusion in some of the trials.</P>
<P>Despite the above advice, there is evidence that in current neonatal practice naloxone is administered to many more newborn infants than recommended, including infants with suspected perinatal asphyxia who are not thought to have been exposed to narcotic (<LINK REF="REF-Herschel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herschel 2000</LINK>). Given this, and the conflicting evidence from animal studies with some suggestion of adverse effects, it is important to evaluate the available data on the use of naloxone in all term and near-term newborn infants with suspected perinatal asphyxia.</P>

<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used, including electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 - February 2007), and EMBASE (1980 - February 2007). No language restriction was applied. The search strategy involved the following text words and MeSH subject headings: Asphyxia-Neonatorum/, OR asphyx*, OR enceph*, OR hypoxi*, AND Naloxone/, OR narcan, OR Narcotic antagonists/, OR narcotic, OR opiate OR opioid. The search outputs were limited with the relevant search filters for randomised controlled trials. References in previous reviews and in studies identified as potentially relevant were examined. The abstracts presented at Society for Pediatric Research and European Society for Pediatric Research, published in the journal Pediatric Research between 1984 and 2006 inclusive were handsearched. In 2002, the manufacturer of Narcan (DuPont Pharmaceuticals Company, Wilmington, Delaware 19880) was contacted to request access to data unavailable from other sources.</P>

<P>Two studies that appeared to be relevant were identified in the first round of screening:<BR/>1. <LINK REF="STD-Chernick-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Chernick 1988</LINK> was included. The investigators undertook a blinded randomised controlled trial of naloxone versus saline placebo in newborn infants (probably term but not explicitly stated) with a one minute Apgar score of six or less. Infants whose mothers had received narcotic analgesia within four hours prior to delivery, or a general anaesthetic during delivery, were not eligible for inclusion (details in the table, Characteristics of Included Studies).The investigators obtained the informed consent of mothers pre-natally, when admitted to the labour ward, and then recruited to the trial only those newborn infants who fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Of 193 infants with 1-minute Apgar scores of six or less, 98 received an injection of naloxone (approximately 0.4 mg/kg) and 95 received saline solution. The outcomes that were assessed in this trial were: Respiratory and heart rate up to 24 hours post intervention; time to onset of spontaneous respiration; passive and active muscle tone up to 24 hours post intervention. There are not any data available on the pre-specified outcomes for this review, either from the published report or directly from the senior investigator Professor Chernick.</P>
<P>2. <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 1996</LINK> did not fulfil all of the eligibility criteria and was excluded. The participants in the trial were infants with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy rather than infants with suspected perinatal asphyxia per se (details in the table, Characteristics of Excluded Studies).</P>
<P>The manufacturer of Narcan (DuPont Pharmaceuticals Company, Wilmington, Delaware 19880) did not have any further data.<BR/>
</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chernick-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Chernick 1988</LINK> achieved good allocation concealment and blinding of intervention by assigning participants to randomly pre-numbered vials of naloxone or placebo. Follow up was complete. Only outcomes in the first 24 hours were reported. All outcomes were assessed without knowledge of whether the infant had received naloxone or saline placebo.<BR/> </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chernick-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Chernick 1988</LINK>: None of the pre-specified outcomes for this review was reported. Of the outcomes that were assessed, naloxone did not have a statistically significant effect on respiratory frequency or heart rate up to 24 hours of age. Active muscle tone of upper and lower limbs was statistically significantly increased in the naloxone group. </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Only one trial that assessed the effect of naloxone for infants with suspected perinatal asphyxia was identified. This trial, published in 1988, concluded on the basis of the short term effects that naloxone "has no readily apparent benefit in the resuscitation of the asphyxiated newborn infant". Although of good methodological quality, this trial did not report on any of the pre-defined outcomes for this review. We have not found any other randomised controlled trials of this intervention. This may be because of the inherent difficulties in undertaking intervention studies in emergency situations, including the need to obtain informed consent. The included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chernick-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Chernick 1988</LINK>) addressed this specific difficulty by informing mothers of the study, and gaining their consent, when they were admitted to the labour ward. Eligible newborn infants could then receive the trial intervention without delay. The lack of other trials of this intervention may also be due to the influence of published recommendations and guidelines. For example, the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Drugs (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1990</LINK>), or the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (<LINK REF="REF-NRP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NRP 2000</LINK>) have recommended that naloxone is only indicated for infants who have been exposed to maternal narcotic administration within four hours prior to delivery. </P>
<P>In addition, a randomised controlled trial of naloxone versus placebo in infants with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy that was undertaken in the Hebei Province People's Hospital in China in 1994 (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 1996</LINK>) was identified. The authors reported that the mortality rate in infants with severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy was statistically significantly lower in the naloxone group than in the placebo group. However, this trial was not included because there are not any details in the published report as to whether these infants also had evidence of perinatal asphyxia as defined in the inclusion criteria for this review. The study investigators will be contacted in order to clarify this issue, and other methodological issues. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No evidence was found to support the routine use of naloxone for newborn infants of greater than 34 weeks' gestation with suspected perinatal asphyxia.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Those who consider the evidence from animal model studies to suggest that naloxone may have a role in improving outcomes for infants with perinatal asphyxia may wish to undertake a randomised controlled trial. This trial should assess clinically important outcomes including mortality, and short and long term adverse neurological outcomes.</P>

<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>The study did not fulfil the "types of participants" eligibility criterion. Based on the translation of the original report, it seems that the population of infants studied was newborn infants with established hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, rather than infants with suspected perinatal asphyxia (who are then at risk of developing hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy). The gestational age range of the infants in the trial is not specified.</P>
