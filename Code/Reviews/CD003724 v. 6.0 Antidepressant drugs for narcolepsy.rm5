<TITLE>Antidepressant drugs for narcolepsy</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Narcolepsy is a disorder of the central nervous system, the main symptoms of which are excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy (an abrupt and reversible decrease in or loss of muscle tone, affecting the limbs and/or trunk, elicited by emotional stimuli). Narcolepsy has an adverse impact on people's quality of life. Together with stimulant drugs (used to control EDS), antidepressants are usually recommended to counteract cataplexy. In addition, some antidepressants are also reported to improve EDS. Five trials with 246 participants were included. There is no evidence that antidepressants have a beneficial effect on narcolepsy. Moreover, despite the clinical consensus recommending their use for cataplexy, there is scarce evidence to support the use of antidepressant drugs to treat this symptom.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> February issue, 2010), MEDLINE (1950 to March 2010), EMBASE (1980 to April 2010), PsycINFO (1872 to March 2010), and CINAHL (1981 to March 2010). Bibliographies of identified articles were reviewed to find additional references. Unpublished randomised trials were searched for by consulting governmental and non-governmental clinical trial registers, disease-specific websites, investigators and experts in the field, pharmaceutical companies/manufacturers.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three cross-over and two parallel trials were included with a total of 246 participants. The methodological quality of all studies was unclear. As the trials tested different comparisons, or had a different design or dealt with different outcome measures, meta-analysis was not performed. In one cross-over trial (10 participants) femoxetine had no significant effect in eliminating or reducing EDS but significantly reduced cataplexy. Mild and transient side effects were reported in the femoxetine treatment period by two participants. In a second cross-over trial (56 participants) viloxazine significantly reduced EDS and cataplexy. In a third cross-over trial the authors inappropriately treated the trial design as a parallel study and no conclusions can be reached in favour of either drug. Two more trials with parallel design tested ritanserin versus placebo without finding differences of effectiveness in reducing EDS or cataplexy.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-05-05 15:46:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 1, 2008) on 'Antidepressant drugs for narcolepsy'.</P>
<P>Narcolepsy is a lifelong disorder of the central nervous system characterized by uncontrollable daytime sleepiness (also called "excessive daytime sleepiness") and intermittent abnormal manifestations of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during wake or sleep-wake transition, of which cataplexy is the most prominent. Cataplexy causes an abrupt and transient decrease or loss of muscle tone, affecting the limbs bilaterally, or the trunk or both, and is elicited by emotional stimuli (<LINK REF="REF-Guilleminault-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guilleminault 2000</LINK>). Estimates of the prevalence of narcolepsy range between the extremes of 0.23 and 590 cases per 100,000 (Israel and Japan respectively); in Caucasian ethnic groups there are about 20 to 60 cases per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Partinen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partinen 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Narcolepsy is a disorder of brain mechanisms governing the sleep-wake cycle. The pathogenic cause is purported to be the dysfunction or destruction of a group of hypothalamic neurones transmitting the neurotransmitter hypocretin (also called orexin) (<LINK REF="REF-Mignot-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mignot 2000</LINK>). An autoimmune mechanism of damage has been hypothesized (<LINK REF="REF-Dauvilliers-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dauvilliers 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mignot-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mignot 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The age at onset is between early childhood and mid adulthood; the peak is in the second decade (<LINK REF="REF-Guilleminault-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guilleminault 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silber-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silber 2002</LINK>). The age at diagnosis has a mean delay of more than 10 years because of the frequent misdiagnosis with other neurological or psychiatric conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Dauvilliers-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dauvilliers 2001</LINK>). The course is usually stable, sometimes with remissions or exacerbations. The main symptom, always present, is excessive daytime sleepiness, principally occurring as daily episodes of unwanted sleep. Other manifestations are the abnormal appearance of REM sleep features during the wake or sleep-wake transition states. This includes cataplexy, sleep paralysis (inability to move during the transition from sleep to wakefulness), and hypnic hallucinations (hallucinations that occur during sleep-wake transition). Disturbed nocturnal sleep and other sleep symptoms are also reported to affect people with narcolepsy.</P>
<P>Previous international diagnostic criteria (<LINK REF="REF-AASM-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AASM 2001</LINK>) deems the combination of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy (narcolepsy with cataplexy subtype: about 80% of cases) as sufficient for a definite diagnosis. Current international diagnostic criteria (<LINK REF="REF-AASM-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">AASM 2005</LINK>) states that together with the above reported two symptoms diagnosis "should be confirmed" by multiple sleep latency test (mean sleep latency less than or equal to eight minutes and two or more more sleep-onset REM periods) or alternatively by hypocretin-1 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (less than or equal to 110 pg/mL). When excessive daytime sleepiness is present without cataplexy (narcolepsy without cataplexy subtype) the diagnosis, according to previous international diagnostic criteria (<LINK REF="REF-AASM-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AASM 2001</LINK>), is confirmed if there are specific findings during nocturnal polysomnography (sleep latency less than 10 minutes and REM sleep latency less than 20 minutes) and multiple sleep latency test (mean sleep latency less than five minutes and two or more sleep-onset REM periods). According to current international diagnostic criteria (<LINK REF="REF-AASM-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">AASM 2005</LINK>) the diagnosis of narcolepsy without cataplexy is confirmed only by multiple sleep latency tests (mean sleep latency less than eight minutes and two or more sleep-onset REM periods).</P>
<P>There is evidence that symptoms of narcolepsy may adversely affect people's quality of life, having a major impact upon education, recreation and occupation, with impaired learning, work performance, promotion and earnings (<LINK REF="REF-Beusterien-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beusterien 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Broughton-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broughton 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Broughton-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broughton 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Daniels-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daniels 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ervik-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ervik 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goswami-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goswami 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kales-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kales 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teixeira-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teixeira 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vignatelli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vignatelli 2004</LINK>). Moreover, life-threatening accidents may occur, for instance while driving (<LINK REF="REF-Findley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Findley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-George-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 1996</LINK>). The most disabling symptom is excessive daytime sleepiness, whilst cataplexy is disabling for a subgroup of people with narcolepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Vignatelli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vignatelli 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The goal of therapy for narcolepsy is to control the symptoms underlying the disability. For excessive daytime sleepiness The Standards of Practice Committee of the American Sleep Disorders Association (<LINK REF="REF-Littner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Littner 2001</LINK>) recommend stimulant drugs such as amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate, pemoline, which are indirect-acting sympathomimetic drugs, or the use of stimulants with other modes of action which include modafinil, selegiline, caffeine and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (<LINK REF="REF-Guilleminault-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guilleminault 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitler 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nishino-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishino 2000</LINK>). Their effect on cataplexy is reported to be absent or uncertain. The use of these drugs may be limited in some countries by legislation designed to counteract drug abuse (amphetamine and derivatives, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid), as well as by drug licensing, availability and cost.</P>
<P>Recommended first-line treatments for cataplexy include antidepressant drugs like tricyclic or serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Littner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Littner 2001</LINK>), but other antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors type A (<LINK REF="REF-Hohagen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hohagen 1993</LINK>) or viloxazine (<LINK REF="STD-Mitler-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mitler 1990</LINK>) or reboxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Larrosa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larrosa 2001</LINK>)) have also been proposed as effective. Some of these drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Hohagen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hohagen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Larrosa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larrosa 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitler-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mitler 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schrader-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Schrader 1986</LINK>) are reported to be useful for excessive daytime sleepiness and some reports indicate that a significant minority of people with narcolepsy are treated with antidepressants alone (about 10% in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Daniels-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daniels 2001</LINK>), and about 40% in Italy (<LINK REF="REF-Vignatelli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vignatelli 2004</LINK>)).</P>
<P>Although the antidepressants have differing modes of action, the rationale for their use is that they all share an effect on the inhibition of uptake or the catabolism of monoaminergic neurotransmitters (<LINK REF="REF-Martindale-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martindale 1996</LINK>), thereby counteracting the imbalance of monoamines in the wake-sleep cycle network of the brain, which is thought to be one of the neurochemical substrates of narcolepsy.</P>
<P>This review examines the effectiveness of antidepressant drugs in narcolepsy for reducing both excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>Our objective was to determine the effectiveness and maintenance of effect of antidepressant drugs in the treatment of narcolepsy. The following hypotheses were tested.<BR/> <BR/>(1) Antidepressant drugs are more effective than no treatment or treatment with placebo in: <BR/>(a) abolishing or reducing the occurrence of excessive daytime sleepiness; <BR/>(b) abolishing or reducing the occurrence of cataplexy;<BR/>(c) improving the quality of life. </P>
<P>(2) One class of antidepressants (non-selective monoamine re-uptake inhibitors versus serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors versus monoamine oxidase inhibitors type A versus other antidepressants) or one antidepressant drug is better than another.<BR/> <BR/>(3) The side effects do not exceed the beneficial effects.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adults (18 years or more) with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy and with any other co-morbidity or co-treatment. Explicit diagnostic criteria of narcolepsy were not required for inclusion in the study; however, if found, trials referring to international standard criteria (International Classification of Sleep Disorders 1990 and following editions (<LINK REF="REF-AASM-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AASM 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AASM-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">AASM 2005</LINK>)) were to be distinguished from those without explicit standard diagnostic criteria by performing a sensitivity analysis.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Therapy with antidepressant drugs (any dose, any regimen) was the intervention of interest. According to the international Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification of drugs (www.whocc.no/atcddd/atcsystem.html), antidepressants are divided into the following chemical subgroups (fourth level):<BR/> <BR/>(1) non-selective monoamine re-uptake inhibitors (tricyclics); <BR/>(2) serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors; <BR/>(3) monoamine oxidase inhibitors type A; <BR/>(4) other antidepressants.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>In order to evaluate the maintenance of the effect, if data were available, we planned to assess outcomes at the following time points post-randomisation:<BR/>(a) less than or equal to 30 days; <BR/>(b) more than 30 days.<BR/> <BR/>Primary outcomes considered in this review were: <BR/>(a) elimination of excessive daytime sleepiness according to subjective or objective indicators at long-term follow up (<I>see</I> below); <BR/>(b) elimination of cataplexy at long-term follow up (<I>see</I> below). </P>
<P>All other possible outcomes were considered as secondary end points. </P>
<P>The outcomes were considered at the latest point of recording during the trial. If possible, the trial was classified according to outcomes:<BR/>(a) short-term outcome if recorded within 30 days of follow up; <BR/>(b) long-term outcome if recorded after 30 days of follow up;<BR/>(c) both short and long-term outcomes if data were available. </P>
<P>The pre-specified outcomes belonged to the following domains: </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>(1) Excessive daytime sleepiness <BR/>
</I>
</B>According to the recognized different domains of excessive daytime sleepiness, it was assessed, if present, by: <BR/>(a) objective laboratory tests: <BR/>(i) multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) (<LINK REF="REF-Thorpy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorpy 1992</LINK> ) measuring the mean time latency of falling asleep during four to five sessions trying to sleep; <BR/>(ii) maintenance wakefulness test (MWT) (<LINK REF="REF-Doghramji-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doghramji 1997</LINK>) measuring the mean time latency of falling asleep during four to five sessions trying to stay awake. <BR/>(b) subjective validated scales, every one investigating chronic excessive daytime sleepiness during common life situations (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2001</LINK>): <BR/>(i) Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) (<LINK REF="REF-Johns-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johns 1998</LINK>); <BR/>(ii) sleep-wake activity inventory (SWAI) (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenthal-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenthal 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>If present, the following outcomes were considered. <BR/>(a) Elimination of excessive daytime sleepiness according to standard cut offs: <BR/>(i) more than five minutes of mean time sleep latency for MSLT (<LINK REF="REF-Thorpy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorpy 1992</LINK>); <BR/>(ii) more than 11 minutes of mean time sleep latency for MWT (<LINK REF="REF-Doghramji-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doghramji 1997</LINK>); <BR/>(iii) fewer than 11 points for the ESS (<LINK REF="REF-Johns-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johns 1998</LINK>); <BR/>(iv) fewer than 11 points for the SWAI (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>If available, the outcomes were measured and analysed as dichotomous variables (number of participants free from the symptom for each treatment group) at the longest common follow up. A separate analysis was considered for every objective and subjective test. <BR/>(b) Reduction of excessive daytime sleepiness, measured as: <BR/>(i) the comparison of mean values (in minutes) of laboratory tests between treatment groups at the longest common outcome follow up. A separate analysis was considered for MSLT and MWT; <BR/>(ii) the comparison of mean ordinal scale values between treatment groups at the longest common outcome follow up. The standardized mean difference was considered for the two excessive daytime sleepiness scales. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>(2) Cataplexy<BR/>
</I>
</B>It was assessed by: <BR/>(a) simple subjective reporting (only for abolition or more than 50% reduction, <I>see</I> below) ; <BR/>(b) subjective validated scales or questionnaires (Stanford Cataplexy Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Anic_x002d_Labat-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anic-Labat 1999</LINK>), the Postural Atonia Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Parkes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkes 1998</LINK>), the cataplexy domain of Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Hublin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hublin 1994</LINK>)). </P>
<P>The following outcomes were considered: <BR/>(i) Elimination of cataplexy measured and analysed as a dichotomous variable (number of participants free from the symptom for each treatment group) according to simple subjective reporting or scales at the latest common outcome follow up. <BR/>(ii) Reduction of cataplexy by more than 50% with respect to baseline according to simple subjective reporting or scales, measured and analysed as a dichotomous variable (number of participants with reduction of the symptom by more than 50% for each treatment group), at the latest common outcome follow up. <BR/>(iii) Reduction of cataplexy measured with the comparison of mean values of subjective ordinal scales between treatment groups at the latest common outcome follow up. The standardized mean difference was considered if more than one scale was found in the elected studies. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>(3) Quality of life<BR/>
</I>
</B>If assessed by validated general (i.e. Medical Outcome Study Short Form (SF36); Nottingham Health Profile (NHP); Sickness Impact Profile scale (SIP) etc) or sleep specific (Functional Outcome Sleep Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 1997</LINK>)) scales/questionnaires, the following outcome was considered: improvement of quality of life measured with the comparison of mean values of ordinal scales between treatment groups, at the latest common outcome follow up. A separate analysis was planned for each scale. </P>

<P>(1) We identified published randomised trials from the following sources:<BR/>(a) Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); terms focused only on participants/condition (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for details of this search). We performed our first search in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 3, 2003; a second one was updated in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 2, 2007. A further search was carried out using the February 2010 issue of <I>The Cochrane Library.</I>
</P>
<P>(b) National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE database (from 1950): terms focused on participants/condition (the same as above) combined with the highly sensitive search strategy for identifying randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2009</LINK>), without any other restriction. A first search was performed in 2003; a second one in April 2007. A further search was carried out on 10 March 2010 (details of the search strategy used on this occasion are given in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>(c) Elsevier's EMBASE (from 1980): terms focused on participants/condition (the same as above) combined with the highly sensitive search strategy for identifying randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2001</LINK>), without any other restriction. A first search was performed in 2003; a second one in April 2007. A further search was carried out on 7 April 2010 (details of the search strategy used on this occasion are given in <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>(d) PsycINFO (from 1872) and CINAHL databases (from 1981): terms focused on participants/condition only (the same as above). A first search was performed in 2003; a second one in April 2007.

<P>(e) Checking reference lists: bibliographies of identified articles were reviewed to find additional references.</P>
<P>(f) 'Grey' literature including dissertations, conference proceedings and government reports were looked for by handsearching in specialized text books and sleep journals (<I>Sleep</I>; <I>Journal of Sleep Research</I>; <I>Sleep Medicine Reviews</I>; <I>Sleep</I> <I>Medicine</I>; <I>Sleep</I> <I>and</I> <I>Hypnosis</I>).</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors (RD, LV) independently reviewed all references with an abstract or full papers without an electronic abstract to assess potentially relevant randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials. Disagreement was resolved by discussion. Subsequently from the full text, two review authors (LC, RD) independently assessed studies for inclusion. There was no blinding of authorship or results. Disagreement was resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>
<B>(1) Assessment of methodological quality <BR/>
</B>We assessed study quality according section 6.7.1 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>) and <LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Selection bias <BR/>
</I>
</B>The studies were assessed as to whether the generation of random sequence was: <BR/>(a) adequate (computer-generated random numbers; table of random-numbers; drawing lots or envelopes; coin tossing; shuffling cards; throwing dice); <BR/>(b) inadequate (case record number; date of birth; date of admission; alternation) or; <BR/>(c) unclear (when generation was not clearly described). </P>
<P>The studies were assessed as to whether the allocation concealment was: <BR/>(a) adequate (a priori numbered or coded drug containers prepared by an independent pharmacy; central randomisation; sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes); <BR/>(b) inadequate (procedures different from the above; open allocation schedule; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes) or; <BR/>(c) unclear (when concealment sequences not clearly described).<BR/> <BR/>
<B>
<I>Performance bias <BR/>
</I>
</B>The studies were assessed as to whether: (a) recipients, and (b) those providing care apart from the intervention were unaware of the assigned therapy; and, if declared, whether the procedure was adequate (if placebo explicitly described as 'indistinguishable', absence of revealing side-effects), inadequate or unclear.<BR/> <BR/>
<B>
<I>Detection bias <BR/>
</I>
</B>The studies were assessed as to whether those measuring outcomes were unaware of the assigned therapy (blinding); and, if declared, whether blinding was adequate, inadequate or unclear. In particular, in the case of the objective tests MSLT and MWT, blinding was considered adequate if assessment was made by an independent person or panel.<BR/> <BR/>To investigate the above criteria as sources of bias, a sensitivity analysis considering the category of 'adequate' versus 'inadequate or unclear' for each bias, was pre-planned.<BR/> <BR/>
<B>
<I>Attrition bias <BR/>
</I>
</B>Was documented as relative frequency of losses to follow up. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Use of diagnostic criteria <BR/>
</I>
</B>The use or not of standard diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis narcolepsy was also used as a quality indicator and, if data were available would have been used in sensitivity analyses. </P>
<P>
<B>(2) Data extraction <BR/>
</B>Two review authors (Luca Vignatelli and Roberto D'Alessandro) independently extracted the following data, when available, from included studies. Disagreement was resolved by discussion. <BR/>(a) Data on participants at baseline (characteristics of the population that may affect the outcome): age, severity of excessive daytime sleepiness according to laboratory findings and to subjective scales, presence or absence of cataplexy and its severity according to scales, co-morbidity (obstructive sleep apnea syndrome), co-treatments (stimulant drugs). <BR/>(b) Data on interventions: type of pharmaceutical antidepressant agent and class; dosage (mg per day); regimen; treatment length according to previously defined criteria. <BR/>(c) Data on outcome measures following the definitions in the outcome section. </P>
<P>
<B>(3) Analysis plan <BR/>
</B>Dichotomous data: the number of people who experienced the outcome in each group and the total number in each group were to be analysed using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model for risk ratios. Heterogeneity amongst the results of trials was to be assessed by calculating a test of heterogeneity (chi-squared test). If heterogeneity was suggested, analyses using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model were planned. </P>
<P>Continuous data: analyses using mean differences (for the comparison of mean values of MSLT, MWT, single cataplexy scales) or standardized mean differences (for the comparison of mean values of subjective excessive daytime sleepiness according to scales) were pre-planned to estimate effect sizes using the inverse variance fixed-effect model. Heterogeneity amongst the results of trials was to be assessed by using a test of heterogeneity (chi-squared test). If heterogeneity was suggested, analyses using the DerSimonian &amp; Laird random-effects model were planned. </P>
<P>If cross-over trials were found, we planned to analyse the data separately from parallel trials. In order to include data from cross-over trials, we required data for all treatment periods and treatment groups regarding the number of allocated participants, exclusions and losses to follow up (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). If a carry-over effect as evaluated on a clinical basis was suspected and data reported by period, then the analysis was to be restricted to data from the first treatment period. </P>
<P>The analysis was going to be conducted separately for each outcome and stratified for each antidepressant class and single type of drug. Possible sources of heterogeneity between trials were going to be explored with the following subgroup analyses: co-morbidity (participants with or without obstructive sleep apnea syndrome), co-treatment with stimulant drugs, level of baseline severity of excessive daytime sleepiness or cataplexy or both.</P>

<P>The first search strategy (2003) identified 153 reports, four of them selected by consensus (Luca Vignatelli and Roberto D'Alessandro) as potentially eligible for this review. After assessing the full text of articles (Luca Vignatelli and Roberto D'Alessandro), one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mitler-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mitler 1986</LINK>) was excluded for the reasons summarised in the table 'Characteristics of excluded studies'. Information of one further trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mitler-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mitler 1990</LINK>) has been requested and obtained by two authors (Prof. Guilleminault and Prof. Mitler) for this updated version of the review. On the basis of published (<LINK REF="STD-Mitler-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mitler 1990</LINK>) and unpublished information this trial was included. However even if basic information was provided, many other data were reported to be lost.</P>
<P>The updated search (April 2007) identified, with possible duplications, 108 reports from CENTRAL, 68 from MEDLINE, 339 from EMBASE, 200 from PsycINFO, 87 from CINAHL. After selection, five studies were potentially eligible for this review. After assessing the full text of articles, three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Henry-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sonka-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sonka 2006</LINK>) were excluded for the reasons summarised in the table 'Characteristics of excluded studies'.</P>
<P>The updated search (March and April 2010) identified, with possible duplications, 16 reports from CENTRAL, 42 from MEDLINE, 387 from EMBASE, 295 from PsycINFO and CINAHL. After selection, 12 studies were potentially eligible for this review. After assessing the full text of articles, all studies (<LINK REF="STD-Anonymous-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Anonymous 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Black-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Black 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Black-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Black 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harsh-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Harsh 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Izzi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Izzi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Joo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ristanovic-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ristanovic 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saletu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saletu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xyrem-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Xyrem 2005</LINK>) were excluded for the reasons summarised in the table 'Characteristics of excluded studies'.</P>
<P>Therefore, a total of five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lammers-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lammers 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitler-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mitler 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schachter-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Schachter 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schrader-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Schrader 1986</LINK>) were eligible for this review.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Schrader-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Schrader 1986</LINK>) was a cross-over trial and recruited 10 adults with narcolepsy, all of whom had cataplexy. The intervention tested was femoxetine, a serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitor, at a dose of 300 mg twice daily, versus placebo. Each participant was randomly allocated first to one treatment then to the other. There was a run-in period of seven days; each treatment period was of 28 days duration with a 14 day wash-out period.</P>
<P>A second study (<LINK REF="STD-Mitler-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mitler 1990</LINK>) was a cross-over trial that recruited 56 adults with narcolepsy, all of whom had cataplexy. The interventions tested were viloxazine, other antidepressants ATC system level group, at dose of 100 mg per day, versus placebo. From unpublished data, each participant was randomly allocated first to one treatment then to the other. There was a run-in period of 15 days; each treatment period was of six weeks duration. It is not known if a washout period was applied.</P>
<P>A third study (<LINK REF="STD-Schachter-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Schachter 1980</LINK>) was a cross-over trial that recruited 18 adults with narcolepsy, all of whom had cataplexy. The interventions tested were fluvoxamine, a serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitor, at doses between 25 mg and 200 mg per day, versus clomipramine, a non selective monoamine re-uptake inhibitor, at doses between 25 mg and 200 mg per day. Each participant was randomly allocated first to one treatment then to the other. There was no run-in period and each treatment period was of 21 days duration with a seven day wash-out period.<BR/>
<BR/>Two other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lammers-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lammers 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2003</LINK>) both tested ritanserin, a 5-HT2 receptor blocker, previously used for some antidepressant action (<LINK REF="REF-Wiesbeck-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiesbeck 2000</LINK>). Even if this molecule is classified under no antidepressant category by ATC, we considered these studies eligible for this review as no other class clearly fit to this molecule.</P>
<P>The first study (<LINK REF="STD-Lammers-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lammers 1991</LINK>) was a parallel trial that recruited 28 adults with narcolepsy. The intervention drug was ritanserin at 2.5 mg bidaily versus placebo as add-on treatment (psychostimulants and/or other antidepressants and/or gamma-OH-butyrate and/or other drugs). Each participant was randomly allocated to ritanserin (16 participants) or placebo (12 participants). After an initial baseline week without medication, the trial lasted 28 days.</P>
<P>The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 2003</LINK>) was a parallel multi-centre trial that recruited 134 adults with narcolepsy, with or without cataplexy. The interventions tested were ritanserin, 5 mg once daily (orally), or ritanserin, 10 mg once daily (orally), or placebo, as add-on treatment (psychostimulants and/or other antidepressants and/or gamma-OH-butyrate and/or other drugs were permitted) or as first treatment. Forty-six participants were randomly allocated to ritanserin 5 mg daily, 45 participants to ritanserin 10 mg daily, 43 participants to placebo. After two weeks of baseline without medication, the trial lasted 28 days.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-05-05 15:46:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is still no reliable evidence to support the use of antidepressants to treat the main symptoms of narcolepsy (excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy). We found three cross-over trials and two parallel trials. We did not combine the cross-over trials for a meta-analysis as they addressed different clinical questions or dealt with different outcome measures. Similarly we did not combine the two parallel trials as they dealt with different outcome measures.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Schrader-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Schrader 1986</LINK> it was observed that the SSRI antidepressant femoxetine reduced the frequency of cataplexy; no effect was observed on excessive daytime sleepiness. In <LINK REF="STD-Mitler-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mitler 1990</LINK> viloxazine was reported to improve both excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. But the measure of effect seems to be of doubtful clinical significance. Moreover the result is burdened by a possible attrition bias. <LINK REF="STD-Schachter-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Schachter 1980</LINK>, assuming 'a priori' the effectiveness of antidepressants in narcolepsy, compared a tricyclic antidepressant (clomipramine) to a SSRI antidepressant (fluvoxamine). The authors concluded that there was no difference in the effectiveness of the two drugs. However, they inappropriately treated the trial design as a parallel study and a calculation of the power of the study was not performed. As a result no conclusion can be reached either for equivalence of effectiveness or non-effectiveness of the two drugs.<BR/>In this updated version of the review we also included two studies that used ritanserin, a molecule not classified in a clear neuropharmacological category. Nevertheless, we chose to consider these trials as eligible because, among others, ritanserin was also reported to have an antidepressant action (<LINK REF="REF-Wiesbeck-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiesbeck 2000</LINK>). Neither of these trials found any effect on excessive daytime sleepiness or cataplexy with respect to the placebo. Moreover, some concerns about tolerability were raised by one of them.</P>
<P>All studies shared the same major weak points. The first was poor reporting of methodological procedures of the trials, with the consequent unclear methodological quality. So, we cannot exclude the possibility of strong influence by common biases. Second, in four out of five trials the duration of treatment was less than 30 days so, by our pre-defined classification, all the outcomes were secondary. Third, given the pharmacological characteristics of antidepressant molecules, the absence (<LINK REF="STD-Schachter-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Schachter 1980</LINK>) or brevity (seven days in <LINK REF="STD-Schrader-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Schrader 1986</LINK>) of the run-in period may introduce another confounder about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of these drugs. Fourth, in <LINK REF="STD-Mitler-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mitler 1990</LINK> a single blind design was applied, and there was a high attrition rate. Finally, in <LINK REF="STD-Schachter-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Schachter 1980</LINK>, the tools used for the measurement of excessive daytime sleepiness were not validated, and the wash-out duration of seven days was probably too short given the half-life of the drugs.</P>
<P>According to the definition of the EC Regulation on Orphan Medical Products (<LINK REF="REF-EURORDIS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">EURORDIS 2007</LINK>), narcolepsy is a "rare disease" that, together with other rare disorders, shares the peculiarity of being an "orphan disease" because it is an "orphan" of market interest. In this review we found some examples on how the antidepressant class shows this "orphan" feature, according to the definitions by the Ophanet group (<LINK REF="REF-Orpha-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orpha 2007</LINK>). First, we observed that because the hallmark anti-cataplectic tryciclic antidepressants derive from a research process that cannot be patented, they were never tested against placebo with randomised controlled trials. Second, narcolepsy has such a small potential market that drug companies are not interested in embarking on randomised controlled trials testing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or atypical antidepressants. Referring to the latter class, the trial testing viloxazine versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Mitler-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mitler 1990</LINK>) enrolled 56 instead of the previously planned 60 participants and lost 20 of them to follow up because the drug company stopped funding (unpublished data, personal communication by one of the authors). Third, some promising molecules were withdrawn from the market. There are two examples in Italy (1) femoxetine which is no longer marketed everywhere in the world, or (2) viloxazine, one of the antidepressants widely used in Italy for narcolepsy up to 2002 (unpublished data from GINSEN - Italian multicentre study on narcolepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Vignatelli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vignatelli 2004</LINK>)), and withdrawn in 2002 from the Italian market by the pharmaceutical company because of the poor therapeutic effect on depression. Fourth, molecules with uncertain neuropharmacological action or doubtful efficacy for their principal indication were tested with low quality randomised controlled trials in narcolepsy to look for some other indication (<I>see</I> the above examples of femoxetine and ritanserin).</P>
<P>Therapy with antidepressants has been recommended to control cataplexy for about 40 years and established by clinical consensus (<LINK REF="REF-AASM-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AASM 2001</LINK>), basing the evidence mainly on case series (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Godbout-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Godbout 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guilleminault-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guilleminault 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hishikawa-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hishikawa 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hohagen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hohagen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langdon-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langdon 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Larrosa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larrosa 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitler-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mitler 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitler-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitler 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parkes-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkes 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Passouant-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Passouant 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roth-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sonka-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sonka 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 1971</LINK>). Nevertheless the key clinical questions on antidepressants for narcolepsy (class or molecule of choice, duration of the effect, the balance between benefits and harms) remain unresolved. Independent clinical researchers are the only candidates embarking on randomised controlled trials to give these answers, as drug companies will probably never be interested.</P>

<P>Since the last version of this review no new studies were found.</P>
<P>The clinician considering the use of antidepressants for people with narcolepsy should bear in mind that:<BR/>(1) there is no reliable evidence that antidepressant drugs reduce excessive daytime sleepiness;<BR/>(2) there is scarce evidence to recommend the use of antidepressant drugs to treat cataplexy. However, if people with narcolepsy request a drug for cataplexy, antidepressants could be proposed making the following facts clear:<BR/>(a) the individual drug or the drug class of choice are not known;<BR/>(b) the duration of the effect, if any, is not known;<BR/>(c) their use could be burdened by problems of tolerability.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Since antidepressant drugs are still recommended for practice by clinical consensus and the available evidence is of poor methodological quality, there is a need for studies adequately exploring their effectiveness in narcolepsy.</P>
<P>In particular, further studies are required which address the following:<BR/>(1) the effect of antidepressants on excessive daytime sleepiness;<BR/>(2) the effect of antidepressants on cataplexy;<BR/>(3) the effect of antidepressants on quality of life;<BR/>(4) the long-term effect on the above outcomes;<BR/>(5) the effect on the above outcomes in comparison with side-effects;<BR/>(6) the use of validated objective and/or subjective tools to capture the above outcomes;<BR/>(7) the application of methodological tools in the design of the trials to avoid more common biases;<BR/>(8) reporting clearly the methodological procedures of trials;<BR/>(9) comparing antidepressants of different classes on the above questions.</P>

<P>Luca Vignatelli and Roberto D'Alessandro were the co-ordinators of the Italian multicentre study for the validation of a questionnaire for the diagnosis of narcolepsy (GINSEN 2001). The study was funded by Dompé Biotec, a pharmaceutical company selling Provigil (modafinil), a stimulant drug for narcolepsy. No use of the drug was promoted in the study. Neither author was sponsored by Dompé nor has any direct or indirect interest in the sale of the drug.</P>
