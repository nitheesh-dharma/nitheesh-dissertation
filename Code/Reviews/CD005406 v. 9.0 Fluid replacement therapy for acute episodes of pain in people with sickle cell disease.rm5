<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>To assess the best route, quantity and type of fluid replacement for people with sickle cell disease with acute painful crises.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Sickle cell disease is a common genetic disorder characterised by periodic episodes of pain which usually happen again and again throughout life. These episodes occur when sickled cells obstruct blood vessels. The degree of pain may range from a mild discomfort to a severe disabling pain where the person needs treatment in hospital. A drop in body fluid levels promotes and sustains the sickling process. Routine treatment includes the use of drugs to relieve pain and the maintenance of adequate fluid levels. Fluid levels will fall if insufficient fluids are taken in compared to the amount of fluid lost. The kidneys of people with sickle cell disease do not concentrate urine properly, which results in poor control of bodily fluids. Additional fluids are given to try and slow or stop the sickling process which should reduce the amount and duration of pain. Fluids may be given in many ways, but orally or intravenously are most common. Fluids should be given with care so as to prevent fluid overload which may in turn cause adverse events such as heart failure or fluid building up in the lungs. We looked for randomised controlled trials to show the best way to replace fluids, which type of fluids and how much fluid to replace to treat acute episodes of pain in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.</P>

<P>Treating vaso-occlusive crises is complex and requires multiple interventions. Extra fluids, generally oral or intravenous, are routinely administered during acute painful episodes to people with sickle cell disease regardless of the individual's state of hydration. Reports of their use during these acute painful episodes do not state the efficacy of any single route, type or quantity of fluid compared to another. However, there are no randomised controlled trials that have assessed the safety and efficacy of different routes, types or quantities of fluid. This systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre randomised controlled trial assessing the efficacy and possible adverse effects of different routes, types and quantities of fluid administered to people with sickle cell disease during acute painful episodes.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-03 16:02:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-07-03 16:02:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is comprised of a group of autosomal recessive haemoglobin disorders characterised by the production of abnormal haemoglobin, haemoglobin S (HbS). The common feature in SCD is the presence of the sickle gene either homozygous or heterozygous. Sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) occurs as a result of homozygous inheritance of the sickle gene and is the most common and severe form of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Serjeant-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Serjeant 1992</LINK>). Other clinically significant diseases are compound heterozygous conditions, in which the sickle haemoglobin interacts with other haemoglobins, such as haemoglobin C (HbSC) or &#946;-thalassaemia (HbSb+ and HbSb0) (<LINK REF="REF-Lane-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 2001a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acute painful or vaso-occlusive crisis is the most common manifestation of SCD (<LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 2006</LINK>). These painful episodes are periodic, often recurrent, and may occur throughout life; among women of child-bearing age, vaso-occlusive crisis tends to occur more frequently during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Adam-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adam 1996</LINK>). The range of duration of painful crises remains unclear; pain often lasts for between four and six days but may persist for weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 1999</LINK>). The pain rate (number of episodes per year) has been used as a proxy to identify people with poor clinical outcome as it correlates well with early death in people with sickle cell anaemia between the second and third decade of life (<LINK REF="REF-Platt-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platt 1991</LINK>). However, in people less than 20 years of age, no correlation exists between pain and mortality. People who experience three or more acute painful episodes per year requiring treatment with parenteral opioid analgesics in a medical facility for four or more hours are considered to have a poor clinical outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Charache-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charache 1995</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-02-17 10:50:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The treatment of acute painful crises is at present predominantly symptomatic, comprising of: pharmacological agents (non-opioid and opioid analgesics with or without adjuvants); non-pharmacologic approaches (heat or ice packs, relaxation, acupuncture, self-hypnosis); as well as other measures such as packed red cell transfusion, oxygen therapy, the treatment of associated infections and fluid replacement therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Ballas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballas 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ballas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballas 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Ceulaer-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Ceulaer 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gaston-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaston 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lane-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 2001a</LINK>). Fluid replacement therapy is of paramount importance because dehydration from insensible water loss, reduced fluid intake and polyuria causes a reduction in plasma volume with an increase in blood viscosity, which promotes and sustains the sickling process (<LINK REF="REF-Adekile-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adekile 1999</LINK>). Hyposthenuria, the inability to concentrate urine, is the most common renal abnormality in people with SCD (<LINK REF="REF-Allon-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allon 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kontessis-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kontessis 1992</LINK>). This functional impairment in the concentrating mechanism arises due to hypoxia in the renal tubules and as a consequence of subclinical intravascular sickling in the hypertonic renal medulla (<LINK REF="REF-Keitel-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keitel 1956</LINK>). Hyposthenuria is most marked in HbSS (<LINK REF="REF-Statius-van-Eps-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Statius van Eps 1967</LINK>). As a result of hyposthenuria, people with SCD produce a higher than usual obligatory urine output and are more susceptible than normal individuals to dehydration (<LINK REF="REF-Saborio-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saborio 1999</LINK>). During episodes of illness, people with SCD often decrease their intake of fluids and may become dehydrated. While people with SCD in painful crisis may not be clinically dehydrated, their red blood cells are known to be dehydrated (<LINK REF="REF-Brugnara-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brugnara 1995</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-02-17 10:51:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Sickling of red blood cells is dependent on the intracellular concentration of deoxyhaemoglobin S which in turn is a function of the osmolality of the plasma. The aim of hydrating people in painful crisis is to slow or stop the sickling process by increasing the plasma volume, thereby decreasing blood viscosity and indirectly reducing red cellular dehydration as well as the intracellular concentration of Haemoglobin S. It has been suggested that routinely giving extra oral fluids in mild vaso-occlusive crisis shortens the episode and relieves pain (<LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 1999</LINK>). Supplemental fluids may be given either orally or intravenously, nasogastrically, subcutaneously or rectally. By inducing severe dilutional hyponatremia (abnormally low levels of blood sodium) in people with SCD using a vasopressin analogue and 5% dextrose in water (5DW) or half normal saline as fluid therapy as well as dietary salt restriction, it is possible to reduce the mean red cell haemoglobin S concentration (<LINK REF="REF-Rosa-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosa 1980</LINK>). This, however, may be associated with severe adverse effects and is not a consistent finding (<LINK REF="STD-Charache-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Charache 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charache-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Charache 1983</LINK>). The use of 5DW or half normal saline as fluid therapy instead of normal saline has not been demonstrated to significantly affect the intracellular concentration of Haemoglobin S, or to prevent or abort painful crises (<LINK REF="STD-Charache-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Charache 1983</LINK>). In children and adolescents between one and one-and-a-half times the estimated daily fluid maintenance requirements are recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Lane-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 2001b</LINK>). Increased fluids may be needed if the individual is dehydrated or insensible losses are increased as in persistent fever, or both. The recommendations for adults is that fluid replacement is administered at an hourly rate of 250 mL for eight hours, and then reduced to 125 mL hourly if there are no signs or past history of congestive heart failure or renal failure (<LINK REF="REF-SCIC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">SCIC 2005</LINK>). For those receiving opioids for pain, fluids should be given with care; opiates decrease cardiac output and fluid overload could precipitate heart failure. In people with acute chest syndrome, fluids are usually given at daily maintenance levels, as over-hydration could cause regions of pneumonitis to develop (<LINK REF="REF-SCIC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">SCIC 2005</LINK>). The clinical effectiveness of fluid replacement therapy for treating painful sickle crisis during pregnancy is, however, not known (<LINK REF="REF-Mart_x00ed__x002d_Carvajal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martí-Carvajal 2009</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-02-17 11:41:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Treating a vaso-occlusive crisis is complex and requires multiple interventions. The routine administration of extra fluids, regardless of the individual's state of hydration, is currently advocated as a potentially beneficial adjunctive treatment in this condition. However, a systematic review of available evidence on the benefits and actual reported harms of fluid supplementation and the routes of supplementation is needed to clarify the uncertainties surrounding this intervention.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-02-17 11:16:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>It is surprising that despite the widespread prevalence of sickle cell disease and the well described nature of the acute painful episodes that are its most common manifestation, there are no randomised controlled trials to provide evidence for the routine use of extra fluids of any type and by any route during acute episodes of pain in people with sickle cell disease. The result of one non-randomised study had suggested that oral hydration alone is inadequate to maintain the hydration status and that vigorous intravenous fluid therapy provides the quickest and most effective method of restoring a satisfactory state of hydration during acute episodes of pain (<LINK REF="STD-Hatch-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Hatch 1965</LINK>). The report of another non-randomised controlled trial suggested that treatment of sickle cell crisis with rapid infusion of hypotonic saline can lower serum osmolality, decreases pain and is well tolerated (<LINK REF="STD-Guy-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Guy 1971</LINK>). Intravenous urea in sugar solutions have also been shown to abort sickle cell crises in the absence of narcotics and analgesics (<LINK REF="STD-Nalbandian-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Nalbandian 1971</LINK>). However, this also required the co-administration of Ringer's lactate to prevent dehydration consequent upon the profound diuresis caused by the urea solution. The methodological limitations of these studies made it inappropriate to draw valid conclusions from them. The authors embarked upon a randomised controlled study but no information on this was found in any of the database searches. In the absence of randomised controlled trials that assessed the effects of different types of supplemental fluids given through any route in sickle cell painful crisis, this systematic review found no evidence to either support or refute these observations.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No conclusions can be drawn at the present time about the effectiveness of fluid replacement therapy of any type for acute painful crises in people with sickle cell disease nor about the optimal mode of delivery. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The absence of randomised controlled trials of fluid replacement therapy in sickle cell disease as shown by this extensive literature search is not justified. Research is needed in this area, and this should take into account both demographic and clinical variables. Well-designed, adequately-powered trials should incorporate people of different age groups, social background and ethnic classifications. The trial design should also take into account the types of fluids, routes of administration and appropriate volumes. Multicentre collaboration may be needed. Outcomes to be assessed in these trials should be such as would address the needs and concerns of patients, care-givers and health providers. Similar outcome measures should also be used in different patient groups and across trial sites to facilitate comparability of results and future synthesis of data in meta-analysis.</P>
<P>An appropriate review will be possible, if data are reported in the publications describing trials in the future.</P>
