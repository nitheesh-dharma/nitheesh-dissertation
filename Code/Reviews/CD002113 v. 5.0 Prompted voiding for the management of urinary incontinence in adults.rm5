<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Regular reminding to prompt going to the toilet for the management of urinary incontinence in adults</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Urinary incontinence is very common amongst elderly long-term residents of nursing homes or hospitals. Prompted voiding is a behavioural therapy used mainly in North American nursing homes. It aims to improve bladder control for people with or without dementia using verbal prompts and positive reinforcement. The review found that although there is suggestive evidence of short-term benefit from prompted voiding, it is not known if these persist. Prompted voiding is also resource-intensive for nursing staff. Prompted voiding can take up a lot of carers time and this hinders its wider use. There was no evidence about long-term effects.</P>

<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Prompted voiding is a behavioural therapy used mainly in North American nursing homes. It aims to improve bladder control for people with or without dementia using verbal prompts and positive reinforcement.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of prompted voiding for the management of urinary incontinence in adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 31 January 2006) and reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted investigators in the field to locate extra studies. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised or quasi-randomised trials which addressed prompted voiding for the management of urinary incontinence. The trials included adult men and women, with or without cognitive impairment, diagnosed as having urinary incontinence as identified by the trialists, either by symptom classification or by urodynamic investigation. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The identified reports were assessed for eligibility. Two reviewers independently reviewed the selected studies for methodological quality. Data describing six pre-specified outcomes were extracted independently by each reviewer and consensus reached when there was disagreement. Trial investigators were consulted when clarification or further detail was required. A third reviewer was recruited to proof read the review at different stages. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nine trials were included in the review. These involved 674 elderly people, the majority of whom were women. Prompted voiding was compared with no prompted voiding in nine<B> </B>trials. The limited evidence suggested that prompted voiding increased self-initiated voiding and decreased incontinent episodes in the short-term. There was no evidence about whether these effects are sustained over a long period of prompted voiding, or persist after stopping prompted voiding.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to reach firm conclusions for practice. There was suggestive evidence of short-term benefit from prompted voiding, but longer-term effects are not known, and prompted voiding has significant resource implications.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-29 15:31:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Urinary incontinence is common amongst elderly long term residents of nursing homes or hospitals. Estimates of prevalence range between 31% to over 70% (<LINK REF="REF-Borrie-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borrie 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fonda-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonda 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ouslander-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouslander 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ouslander-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouslander 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1995</LINK>). Reflecting this, urinary incontinence is costly to those providing care, estimated at approximately $3 million in North American institutions (<LINK REF="REF-Hu-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hu 1990</LINK>) and up to £1.4 billion overall in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Hu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy 1997</LINK>) and up to $19.5 billion overall in the United States (in year 2000). Behavioural interventions are often the first choice of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Beckman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beckman 1995</LINK>) especially in institutional care (<LINK REF="REF-Colling-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colling 1996</LINK>). These include bladder re-education programmes, such as prompted voiding, habit training, timed voiding and bladder training. The differences between these can be easily misunderstood. </P>
<P>Prompted voiding is used to teach people with or without cognitive impairment to initiate their own toileting through requests for help and positive reinforcement from carers when they do this (<LINK REF="REF-Button-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Button 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norton-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2005</LINK>). This is distinctive from some other therapies because of the participation of the individual in the process. In contrast, habit training (<LINK REF="REF-Colling-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colling 1992</LINK>) attempts to determine the micturition pattern for an individual, which can then be used to achieve continence, but does not necessarily rely on the individual to participate. Timed toileting (<LINK REF="REF-Hadley-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadley 1986</LINK>) is fixed by time or event, which is carer led and not individualised. Bladder training actively includes the individual in attempting to increase the interval between the desire to void and the actual void (<LINK REF="REF-Wallace-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 2004</LINK>), and hence would not be suitable for those who are cognitively impaired.</P>
<P>Prompted voiding requires assisting a resident to walk, or be taken, to the toilet and is more labour intensive than practices that aim to suit available resources, such as changing protective pads after two or three incontinent episodes at the convenience of carers. It involves the education of both the person with incontinence and the staff, using a programme of scheduled voids that requires prompting from the caregiver (<LINK REF="REF-Pinkowski-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinkowski 1996</LINK>). Implementing and maintaining prompted voiding therefore has resource implications (<LINK REF="REF-Pinkowski-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinkowski 1996</LINK>). Commitment and motivation need to be coupled with increased staff time to enable implementation. </P>
<P>Prompted voiding is used in particular in North America, mainly in long term facilities for people with cognitive impairment or dementia. Most research on prompted voiding has been done by gerontologists in the USA, Schnelle in particular (<LINK REF="REF-Burgio-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgio 1994</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Creason-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creason 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hu-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hu 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ouslander-1995c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouslander 1995c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surdy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Surdy 1992</LINK>). Some investigators have described the effects of introducing prompted voiding, others have compared prompted voiding with other therapies such as exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1995</LINK>) and bladder relaxant drugs (<LINK REF="STD-Ouslander-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Ouslander 1995a</LINK>), and others have compared prompted voiding plus an exercise programme against no intervention. Although much of this work suggests that prompted voiding is useful, methodological weaknesses are common. They include the lack of appropriate control groups, the use of research staff to implement the intervention, and the short term perspective taken.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of prompted voiding for the management of urinary incontinence.</P>
<P>The following hypotheses were addressed:</P>
<P>1. Prompted voiding is better than no prompted voiding for the management of urinary incontinence.<BR/> <BR/>2. Prompted voiding is better than other treatments for the management of urinary incontinence.</P>
<P>3. Prompted voiding in combination with another therapy is better than that therapy alone.</P>

<P>This review has drawn on the search strategy developed for the Incontinence Group as a whole. Relevant trials have been primarily identified from the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register. The methods used to derive this, including the search strategy, are described under the Group's details in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/INCONT/frame.html">For more details please see the &#8216;Specialized Register&#8217; section of the Group&#8217;s module in The Cochrane Library</A>). The register contains trials identified from MEDLINE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and hand searching of journals and conference proceedings.</P>
<P>The Incontinence Group Trials Register was searched using the Group's own keyword system. The search terms used were:</P>
<P>{design.rct* or design.cct*}<BR/>AND<BR/>{TOPIC.URINE.INCON*}<BR/>AND<BR/>{INTVENT.PSYCH.promptedVoid*}<BR/>(All searches were of the keyword field of Reference Manager 9.5 N, ISI ResearchSoft).<BR/>Date of the most recent search of the register for this review: 31 January 2006.<BR/>The trials in the Incontinence Group Specialised Register are also contained in CENTRAL.</P>
<P>The following additional searches were conducted for this review:</P>
<P>We checked all reference lists of identified trials and other relevant articles. We contacted authors and trialists in the field to identify any additional or unpublished studies or data.</P>
<P>We did not impose any language or other limits on the searches.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Incontinence Group's criteria, which are described in the Cochrane Library. These are based on the assumption that the avoidance of bias is best achieved by secure concealment of random allocation prior to formal entry; few and identifiable withdrawals and dropouts; and analysis on an intention to treat basis. Of the trials included, none fulfilled all the criteria for good methodological quality. Quality assessment was performed by all three reviewers (SE, BR, JP) with a consensus reached through discussion. Two reviewers independently performed data extraction. Any discrepancies were discussed until agreement was reached. Authors of trial reports were consulted where clarification was necessary. Trial data were analysed using the Cochrane software, Review Manager, and processed as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2005</LINK>). Studies were excluded from the review if they were not randomised or quasi-randomised trials, or if they made comparisons other than those pre-specified. Excluded studies are listed with reasons for their exclusion.</P>

<P>Nine trials involving 674 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Engberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Engberg 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ouslander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ouslander 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surdy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Surdy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>) compared prompted voiding against no prompted voiding and were included in the review. In one of these (<LINK REF="STD-Ouslander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ouslander 2005</LINK>) prompted voiding was a part of a wider intervention that included exercise tanning. There was one cross over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ouslander-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Ouslander 1995a</LINK>) which compared prompted voiding combined with another therapy (Oxybutinin) versus prompted voiding alone, which was excluded because both groups received prompted voiding. Three of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ouslander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ouslander 2005</LINK>) have also been reported in supplementary papers. These additional papers were treated in the same way as the original papers in order to extract more complete data. See Table of Included Studies.</P>
<P>Women predominated in most trials. However there were more men in Ouslander 2005 (97 out of 107) and two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>) do not report gender (n=46). The average age was 84 years. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Linn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1995</LINK>) did not report age. All but three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ouslander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ouslander 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 2003</LINK>) performed urological assessment on the participants at baseline. A baseline period was included in all the trials, ranging from two days to six months, although Linn (<LINK REF="STD-Linn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1995</LINK>) does not report the duration of baseline. The duration of the interventions ranged from 20 days to 32 weeks. Linn and Hu et al (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1995</LINK>) reported a follow-up period of 12 and 22 weeks respectively, whereas the other studies did not address longer term effects. The investigators in the majority of each trials applied analysis of variance (ANOVA) to the data, with the addition of t tests in Ouslander (<LINK REF="STD-Ouslander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ouslander 2005</LINK>), Hu et al (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1989</LINK>) and Engberg (<LINK REF="STD-Engberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Engberg 2002</LINK>). Research assistants were utilised to perform the intervention within four of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ouslander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ouslander 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 2003</LINK>). The investigators of the other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Engberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Engberg 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surdy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Surdy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>) used the regular nursing assistant staff or informal caregivers to implement the intervention. The studies were conducted in the main during daytime hours, from 7am to 7 or 9pm, except for Surdy (<LINK REF="STD-Surdy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Surdy 1992</LINK>) who used a 24 hour schedule, but participants were not disturbed unless they were awake. </P>
<P>All but two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Linn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1983</LINK>) reported the average scores for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE range 0 to 30, the lower the score, the greater the cognitive impairment). Linn (<LINK REF="STD-Linn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1995</LINK>) used the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) but did not include any data on this. Schnelle (<LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1983</LINK>) noted that 95% of the sample had senile dementia or organic brain syndrome. In the Surdy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Surdy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Surdy 1992</LINK>) the intervention group had an average score of 14, whereas the control group scored an average of 11. Schnelle et al (<LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1989</LINK>) reported an average score of eight, with 25% having no score at all. Thirty percent of participants were ambulant. </P>
<P>In respect of functional ability, six trials reported details. Surdy (<LINK REF="STD-Surdy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Surdy 1992</LINK>) did not include any profile, whereas Hu et al (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1989</LINK>) used the Katz Activities of Daily Living tool. He reported a high dependency for both treatment and control groups (average score for treatment was 5.1 and for control was 5.5; range 0 to 6 with the higher score being the most dependent). In Schnelle's (<LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1983</LINK>) trial he reports that none of the sample were independent in toileting or ambulation. Only two participants assist with transferring from a commode to the chair and vice versa. In the later trial, Schnelle (<LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1989</LINK>) reported that 11% of his sample could independently ambulate (14 subjects out of a sample of 126). </P>

<P>All nine studies stated that the order of treatment had been randomly allocated. However, the method of random allocation was not described for six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surdy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Surdy 1992</LINK>).

Only two of these provided summary data as means and standard deviations (<LINK REF="STD-Engberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Engberg 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 2003</LINK>). Schnelle (<LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 2003</LINK>) showed a significantly lower proportion in the prompted voiding group (mean difference 12.00%; 95% CI -18.79% to -5.21%). Engberg (<LINK REF="STD-Engberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Engberg 2002</LINK>) compared groups in terms of the change from baseline to follow-up in the mean proportion of hourly checks that were wet. The change was higher in the prompted voiding group, but this difference was not statistically significant (17.60; 95% CI -14.58 to 49.78). In the other four trials, the data were reported as means without standard deviation (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surdy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Surdy 1992</LINK>) or as medians (<LINK REF="STD-Ouslander-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Ouslander 1995a</LINK>). (Other data table 01.03). All four showed lower proportions in the prompted voiding group. Ouslander (<LINK REF="STD-Ouslander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ouslander 2005</LINK>), for example reported data before the groups crossed over, which found that wet checks reduced from a median of 54% to 25% in the immediate intervention group.

<BR/>Hu (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1989</LINK>) and Schnelle (<LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1989</LINK>) both found a decrease in the number of incontinent episodes per day in the prompted voiding group and the pooled result was statistically significant (WMD -0.92; CI 95% -1.32 to -0.53). However this is largely due to a relatively large estimated effect in the Schnelle trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1989</LINK>), and this is reflected in the significant chi square test of heterogeneity (Chi-square 18.07; df=1; p&lt;0.01), I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 94.5%.</P>
<P>Other trials reported this outcome measure, in a way that could not be included in the meta-analysis.

Schnelle (<LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1989</LINK>) found a statistically significant increase in independent requests for the toilet as a result of the intervention (comparison 01.07: Mean difference per day -1.9; 95% CI -1.51 to -2.29). The baseline frequency of requesting the toilet was 4.5 times per 12 hours on a one hour prompted voiding schedule and 2.8 times per 12 hours on a two hour prompted voiding schedule (time cost = 17 minutes per subject). Hu et al (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1989</LINK>) also addressed this outcome measure, but the data could not be included in the meta-analysis as no standard deviations were available. However, the treatment group reported a mean of 2.65 per day versus 1.12 requests per day in the controls for the last four weeks of the treatment period. Schnelle (<LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1983</LINK>) reported that the number of requests for toileting increased from 0.31 per day in the treatment group to an average of twice per day as opposed to the control group which decreased to 0.23 per day. Engberg (<LINK REF="STD-Engberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Engberg 2002</LINK>) reported that the number of self-initiated toilets increased from a baseline of 2.0 to 3.3 after treatment.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review has examined the evidence for the effectiveness of prompted voiding in the management of urinary incontinence in adults. The few data that are available suggest that prompted voiding appears promising for the management of urinary incontinence in the elderly.</P>
<P>Because the Cochrane search strategy is tried and tested, there is some confidence that all the relevant trials have been identified. Published data have been relied upon and the problems associated with depending on aggregate data for analysis have probably weakened the results. For instance, it has not been possible to calculate and analyse the times to specific events reliably. Also checking and correcting data is limited, essentially there is an element of trust needed when extracting the data. We struggled for example to interpret data within Schnelle's trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1989</LINK>), as assumptions had to be made that there must have been a typological error, so that sense could be made of the data. </P>
<P>Although literature searching has been extensive, only fourteen trials were identified that met the inclusion criteria. These trials involved physically and cognitively impaired adults aged over sixty five years, mostly female, who had urinary incontinence. </P>
<P>The nine trials that were included in the review, were of modest methodological quality, with minimal confirmation of allocation concealment and lack of blinding. Wet checks were used as an outcome measure for most of the trials, for which the method was not clearly described. However, checking varied between hourly or two-hourly. It has been suggested that the greater the number of wet checks performed, the greater would be the reliability for the actual number of wet episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Fonda-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonda 1998</LINK>). <BR/> <BR/>Important limitations of the included trials involves the overall small sample size (n=674 completed the trials). In most studies, withdrawal due to dropout or death was not clearly identified or if these events were trial-related. Prompted voiding has been argued as particularly suitable for a US nursing home population (<LINK REF="STD-Ouslander-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Ouslander 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1989</LINK>), so caution may need to be applied to generalising the results outside the settings of the trials. Other limitations were the questions addressed by eligible trials and the limited reporting. The trials that examined prompted voiding alone were of varying treatment duration and intensity (<LINK REF="STD-Engberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Engberg 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surdy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Surdy 1992</LINK>). These issues affect the interpretation, but are not directly relevant to the internal validity. </P>
<P>In respect of short-term effectiveness there is an apparently consistent effect across two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1983</LINK>) suggesting improvement of incontinence as a result of prompted voiding. </P>
<P>External validity has been weakened due to the use of research staff to implement the intervention in four of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ouslander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ouslander 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 2003</LINK>). The other trials have demonstrated that it is possible to use direct caregivers during the trial period (<LINK REF="STD-Engberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Engberg 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surdy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Surdy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1983</LINK>). Reliability checks were performed for the wet checks in seven trials, which may be partly responsible for the compliance of staff with the programme. Two trials did not report reliability checks (<LINK REF="STD-Linn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Linn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>). Without robust trials that address these issues, our understanding of the factors that influence the successful management of urinary incontinence will remain unclear. Nevertheless, these trials are important for exposing the multidimensional aspects of managing incontinence in a frail, elderly population. Therefore, this work adds to the literature on behavioural treatment of urinary incontinence, but the body of knowledge remains incomplete, especially within the nursing home environment. </P>
<P>A specific consequence to be expected from prompted voiding therapy is an increase in self-initiated toileting: as a result of operant conditioning (<LINK REF="REF-Grosicki-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grosicki 1968</LINK>). The five trials that report this outcome all show increased rates in the prompted voiding group. However, only one of these (<LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1989</LINK>) provides a measure of dispersion (S.D.), and in this trial the difference is highly statistically significant. However, a concern with this therapy is the possibility that patients become dependent on the caregiver is a concern with this therapy, especially as success can be related to the frequency of prompts, be it hourly, two or three hourly. The intensity of the intervention has varied among the trials and therefore it is difficult to make predictions about which frequency is most effective. </P>
<P>Longer-term outcomes have not been measured. This raises questions about the feasibility of maintaining the therapy. Indeed, the compliance of both patient and caregiver may be undermined over time, as the client group studied are not likely to improve cognitively or physically. It also leaves unaddressed the question of whether any effects would persist after prompted voiding is withdrawn.</P>
<P>Two trial reports indicate that there is increased time and cost associated with implementing prompted voiding (<LINK REF="STD-Surdy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Surdy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1989</LINK>) but this may be more than offset by subsequent savings. Ouslander (<LINK REF="STD-Ouslander-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ouslander 2005</LINK>) reports that improving continence care as a result of their intervention is four times more costly than regular care. Implementation may be an issue of reallocation of resources, however, such that staff who currently use pads to 'take care of the problem' become motivated and committed to prompted voiding. Nevertheless, the balance between costs and benefits cannot be defined on the basis of the data currently available.</P>
<P>The nursing home environment and the attitudes of staff are likely to impact on the patients' ability to maintain continence on admission and these are issues that deserve investigation. Jirovec and Wells (<LINK REF="REF-Jirovec-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jirovec 1990</LINK>) advocate attention to mobility, as reduced mobility has a profound effect on the ability to remain continent, especially in a nursing home, where reliance on staff to keep the patient dry is necessary. Perhaps this partially explains why prompted voiding might be effective, because of the key elements of prompting memory and prompting the patient to walk (<LINK REF="STD-Schnelle-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schnelle 1983</LINK>). Therefore, it could be argued that although predicting the onset of urinary incontinence is not difficult, finding the resources to enable an individualised approach is more problematical.</P>
<P>The review did provide some evidence that those with a higher cognitive ability (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Surdy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Surdy 1992</LINK>), higher dependency (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 1989</LINK>) and normal cystometry are more likely to benefit. Selecting appropriate patients will require caregivers to be aware of the factors influencing urinary incontinence. Furthermore, there are educational and training needs of caregivers if patients are to have a chance to reduce the degree of urinary incontinence.<BR/> <BR/>The applicability of the prompted voiding has, so far, not been tested outside US settings. Decisions about the transferability of findings need to consider the characteristics of the client group and the circumstances in which they are being nursed. </P>
<P>Every effort has been made to make this review trustworthy. It is possible that more data might have become available if there had been more active dialogue with the trialists. This might have influenced the interpretation of the results. Collecting individual patient data would have been useful and therefore more reliable, but due to the resource intensity and time anticipated for this, it was not pursued.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>While a prompted voiding therapy appears promising as a form of care for the management of urinary incontinence as opposed to no prompted voiding, there is insufficient evidence to reach firm conclusions for practice. There is suggestive short-term benefits from prompted voiding. But there are significant resource implications of prompted voiding, although the size of these is not clear from the trials studied within this review. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Perhaps the main value of the review is as a guide to future priorities for research. Larger well conducted trials are needed, with a longer term follow up if prompted voiding is to have a secure place within care settings as an effective adjunct to continence care for a frail, elderly population. Outcome measures need further definition and validated tools will increase the robustness of future studies. Evaluation in wider settings outside the USA would enhance generalisability.</P>
<P>Tackling the factors that influence urinary incontinence before it happens is also a major area for further research. Prevention and early identification are likely to be key to reducing the impact of incontinence. </P>
