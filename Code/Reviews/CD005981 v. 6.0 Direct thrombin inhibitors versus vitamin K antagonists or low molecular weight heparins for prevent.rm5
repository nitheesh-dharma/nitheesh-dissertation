<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-03-17 16:55:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Venous thromboembolism is the presence of a blood clot that blocks a blood vessel within the venous system; it includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) which can be fatal. Venous thromboembolism occurs in 44% to 90% of those patients who undergo total hip or knee replacement and who do not receive anticoagulants (blood thinning drugs). </P>
<P>The standard treatment is prophylaxis with an anticoagulant such as low molecular weight heparin (known as an indirect thrombin inhibitor), or warfarin or coumarin (vitamin K antagonists). New types of anticoagulants termed direct thrombin inhibitors have advantages over heparin as they can be given by mouth, do not require laboratory control and no relevant interaction with food or alcohol is known.</P>
<P>This review found that direct thrombin inhibitors are as effective in the prevention of major venous thromboembolism in total hip or knee replacement compared with low molecular weight heparin and vitamin K antagonists. However, the newer anticoagulants showed higher mortality and caused more bleeding than low molecular weight heparin. No severe liver complications complications were reported in the analysed studies. </P>
<P>The review also showed that the timing of the start of giving anticoagulants influences the results. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-03-17 16:27:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We included 14 studies included involving 21,642 patients evaluated for efficacy and 27,360 for safety. No difference was observed in major VTE in DTIs compared with LMWH in both types of operations (odds ratio (OR) 0.91; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 1.19), with high heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> 71%). No difference was observed with warfarin (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.15) in TKR, with no heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%).</P>
<P>More total bleeding events were observed in the DTI group (in ximelagatran and dabigatran but not in desirudin) in patients subjected to THR (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.06, 1.85; I<SUP>2</SUP> 41%) compared with LMWH. No difference was observed with warfarin in TKR (OR 1.76; 95% CI 0.91 to 3.38; I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%).<BR/>
<BR/>All-cause mortality was higher in the DTI group when the reported follow-up events were included (OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.10 to 3.87).</P>
<P>Studies that initiated anticoagulation before surgery showed less VTE events; those that began anticoagulation after surgery showed more VTE events in comparison with LMWH. Therefore, the effect of the DTIs compared with LMWH appears to be influenced by the time of initiation of coagulation more than the effect of the drug itself.</P>
<P>The results obtained from sensitivity analysis, did not differ from the analysed results; this strengthens the value of the results.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-03-15 10:45:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Direct thrombin inhibitors are as effective in the prevention of major venous thromboembolism in THR or TKR as LMWH and vitamin K antagonists. However, they show higher mortality and cause more bleeding than LMWH. No severe hepatic complications were reported in the analysed studies. Use of ximelagatran is not recommended for VTE prevention in patients who have undergone orthopedic surgery. More studies are necessary regarding dabigatran.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-03-15 11:27:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been observed three months post operatively in 2.4% of patients who have undergone hip arthroplasty (replacement), and in 1.7% of the patients who have undergone knee arthroplasty despite their having received prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-White-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1998</LINK>). Symptomatic venous thromboembolism occurs after the patients leave hospital, and the risk increases for at least two months after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Douketis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douketis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leclerc-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leclerc 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pellegrini-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pellegrini 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1998</LINK>). Thromboembolism is a common cause of re-admission to hospital subsequent to total hip replacement surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Seagroatt-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seagroatt 1991</LINK>). New anticoagulants are under investigation.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-03-15 11:15:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Venous thromboembolism is the presence of a blood clot that blocks a blood vessel within the venous system; it includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Venous thromboembolism occurs in 44% to 90% of those patients who undergo total hip or knee replacement and who do not receive anticoagulants. Proximal venous thrombosis occurs in another 20% of those patients who do not receive prophylactic anticoagulants (<LINK REF="REF-Geerts-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geerts 2001</LINK>), and PE develops in up to 7% (<LINK REF="REF-Stringer-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stringer 1989</LINK>), of which 0.7% may be fatal (<LINK REF="REF-Ansari-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansari 1997</LINK>). The standard treatment is prophylaxis with the indirect thrombin inhibitor, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (<LINK REF="REF-Geerts-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geerts 2001</LINK>), or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin or coumarin (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hill-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mesko-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mesko 2001</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-03-15 11:18:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>More recently, direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) with properties that give them potential mechanistic advantages over indirect thrombin inhibitors such as heparin, have been used (<LINK REF="REF-Weitz-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weitz 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weitz-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weitz 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weitz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weitz 2004</LINK>). Direct thrombin inhibitors do not require laboratory control (<LINK REF="REF-Desai-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pengo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pengo 2004</LINK>). Most direct thrombin inhibitors (hirudin, argatroban, bivalirudin, etc) need to be given by injection (parenterally). However, ximelagatran, a melagatran prodrug, is the first oral direct thrombin inhibitor ( <LINK REF="REF-Weitz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weitz 2004</LINK>) and its metabolism is not affected by the age, sex, body weight, or ethnic origin of the recipient, and no relevant interaction with food or alcohol is known (<LINK REF="REF-Desai-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 2004</LINK>). They could be used in the treatment of patients with heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) (<LINK REF="REF-DTI-TGC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DTI TGC 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eikelboom-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eikelboom 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2003</LINK>). Its use is associated with an increase of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (an enzyme found primarily in the liver and which is released into the blood stream as the result of liver damage) up to three times its nominal value (<LINK REF="REF-Lazerow-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazerow 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olsson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olsson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petersen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulman 2003</LINK>) although even severe and fatal hepatopathy (liver disease) has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Albers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albers 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Desai-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x00b4_Brien-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">O´Brien 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spell_x002d_Lesane-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spell-Lesane 2004</LINK>). Dabigatran, a newer DTI has the same advantages of ximelagatran, and apparently is not associated with hepathopathy.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-03-15 11:24:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The use of ximelagatran was approved in European countries for short-term treatment and prevention of thromboembolism subsequent to total knee and hip replacement surgery, but later on it was removed due to hepatocellular damage (<LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2006b</LINK>). Dabigatran has been approved for VTE treatment in many countries.<BR/>
<BR/>The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence from randomised clinical trials that evaluate the efficacy (demonstrated by less VTE events) and safety (less bleeding and adverse events) of all the direct thrombin inhibitors compared with vitamin K antagonists or low molecular weight heparins in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) in patients who have undergone total hip or knee replacement. Moreover, we endeavoured to review the risk estimate of serious adverse events associated with the analysed therapies.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-03-15 11:27:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The effectiveness of classic anticoagulants, such as heparin and warfarin, has been proven in numerous studies. However, 47% of the patients treated with warfarin and 31% of the patients treated with low molecular weight heparins develop thrombosis after knee replacement (<LINK REF="REF-Geerts-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geerts 2001</LINK>). Warfarin is administered orally, has a narrow therapeutic window and also requires periodic laboratory controls (<LINK REF="REF-Geerts-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geerts 2001</LINK>). It is associated with an increased risk of haemorrhage of 3% to 4% annually. Coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment are routine during treatment with vitamin K antagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Ansell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirsh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsh 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulman 2003</LINK>). Low molecular weight heparins do not require laboratory control, but all of them are given parenterally.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Critical Evaluation of the Studies</HEADING>
<P>All three review authors independently evaluated the methodological quality of each trial and any differences of opinion were resolved by consensus. We recorded details of randomisation (sequence and masking), blinding, incomplete outcome data, and the number of patients lost to follow up.<BR/>
<BR/>We employed two approaches to evaluate the methodological quality of studies: the Cochrane risk of bias approach and the one used by Handoll et al (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2002</LINK>) which was modified for the purposes of this review. The latter approach evaluates twelve aspects of internal and external validity specifically for anticoagulation in orthopaedic surgery for VTE prevention (See <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>We also determined the external validity of each trial by considering the characteristics of the participants (inclusion and exclusion criteria; clinical and laboratory diagnosis criteria; number of participants; age; sex; duration of follow up; duration of the study, and setting where the trial was carried out); interventions (type of prophylactic anticoagulant; duration of the prophylactic anticoagulation treatment); anticoagulation laboratory control; and results.<BR/>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2010-03-15 12:59:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Where heterogeneity of included studies was low we analysed the results using fixed-effect meta-analysis. Where the heterogeneity was considered to be moderate or high, the results were analysed using a random-effects meta-analysis, because even though this model does not correct the heterogeneity, it considers its existence.

<P>Two subgroups analyses were relevant in the type of studies available: according to the duration of the prophylactic anticoagulation (standard versus extended) and according to the time of initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation (before surgery versus after surgery).</P>
<P>Where there was significant heterogeneity among the studies, we explored the reasons for such heterogeneity and the best conclusions were obtained from the observations. Moreover, the heterogeneity among studies was evaluated subjectively by means of clinical judgment based on the differences in patient population, interventions and measurement of the results.

<LI>according to the type of surgery (THR, TKR, or both);</LI>
<LI>effect of the time of initiation of anticoagulation;</LI>

The <LINK REF="STD-EXTEND-2009" TYPE="STUDY">EXTEND 2009</LINK> study, which fulfilled all the inclusion criteria regarding PICO elements (Participants, Interventions, Comparisons, Outcomes), was excluded due to methodological deficiencies; the evaluation of DVT was with compression ultrasound not the gold standards (venography).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Internal and external validity: 12 questions</HEADING>
<P>There are numerous scales to evaluate the methodological quality of RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). Moher et al (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2005</LINK>), found up to 25 scales and nine checklists to qualify RCTs. The use of scales for assessing quality or risk of bias is explicitly discouraged in Cochrane reviews. We analysed the methodological quality of the included studies without using scales.<BR/>
<BR/>The parameters to quantify the methodological quality of the studies in this review is based on the 12 questions proposed by the Cochrane PVD Group and the questions used in the systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2002</LINK>, which has been modified for the purposes of this review (as detailed in the <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>) and on the Cochrane´s risk of bias proposal.<BR/>
<BR/>The risk of bias for each of the 12 questions are tabulated pursuant to the comparison carried out. More details can be found in the additional tables section (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) and (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>).<BR/>

The rest of the studies refer to double or triple blind and mention certain effective measures to achieve it; none of these detail who were blinded (outcome assessors, patients, treatment providers or analyst).<BR/>
<BR/>All the studies consider in their criteria the exclusion of women with childbearing potential (except <LINK REF="STD-METHRO-III-2003" TYPE="STUDY">METHRO III 2003</LINK>), only including postmenopausal women, surgically sterile or with reliable contraception. But none detail what percentage of the randomised population corresponds to women using hormonal contraception or hormone replacement, which are known risk factors for thromboembolic events.<BR/>
<BR/>With regard to care programmes, none of the 14 studies compared all the characteristics or interventions that in the review authors' judgment are clinically relevant (as detailed in the <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>In none of the studies were the losses or withdrawals more than 10%. The study with the highest percentage was <LINK REF="STD-Heit-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Heit 2001</LINK> (9.2%). The patients whose venographies were not adequate (20.2% of the total randomised patients, range, 15.8% to 26.7%) are not included in these losses.<BR/>
<BR/>The total number of randomised patients in the 14 studies was 27,746 patients; 27,360 patients were included in the safety analysis (98.5 % of the total randomised patients, range 95.6% to 99.8%) and 21,642 patients in the efficacy analysis (78.0% of the total randomised patients, range 72.5% to 84.6%). The percentage of not treated or withdrawn patients (and not included in the safety analysis) with regard to the total randomised patients was 1.49% (range, 0.2% to 9.2%) and the percentage of patients not included in the efficacy analysis with regard to the total number of patients included in the total safety population is 20.24% (5617 randomised patients not analysed) with 97.9% of this due to venograms not carried or not conclusive. None of the studies details the follow up on these patients. These percentages do not significantly differ from the treatment or control group. More details in the additional tables section: Methodological Comparison of Included Studies Table (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Only four out of the 14 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Heit-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Heit 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-METHRO-I-2002" TYPE="STUDY">METHRO I 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-METHRO-III-2003" TYPE="STUDY">METHRO III 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RE_x002d_MOBILIZE-2009" TYPE="STUDY">RE-MOBILIZE 2009</LINK>) mention ITT population and <LINK REF="STD-RE_x002d_NOVATE-2007" TYPE="STUDY">RE-NOVATE 2007</LINK> stated that they performed a modified ITT analysis, but none of the 14 studies analysed all the patients initially randomised.</P>
<P>The review authors decided to include in the analysis all the non included VTE events reported in each study and all the events reported in the follow-up period. Next, we present all the inclusions or assumptions made in each study to develop the review analysis. It is important to mention that all these assumptions were made before the pooled analysis was carried out.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Colwell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Colwell 2003</LINK>
<BR/>One patient was excluded in the enoxaparin group in proximal DVT/PE because she had confirmed distal DVT rather than proximal. We included this patient in these analyses. There were 11 VTE events not included in the efficacy analysis of the original study (seven ximelagatran / four enoxaparin). We included all of them. Four of the ximelagatran group and two of the enoxaparin group were symptomatic events without venography, so based on the ITT analysis, we included all of them in the efficacy population. This was the only study that reported gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevated values. We only included the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values in the analysis because we suspect that it may overvalue the results. We calculated the standard deviation (SD) based on the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) in the continuous variables using the formula: SD results by calculating the square root of group sample size multiplied by the difference of the upper and lower 95% CI and all of this divided by 3.92 (This is valid when group sample size is larger than 100).</P>

<BR/>Seventeen patients included in the population for the safety analysis (eight in ximelagatran 36 mg, five in ximelagatran 24 mg and four in warfarin) presented confirmed VTE but discontinued treatment. We included them in the proximal DVT and in the efficacy analysis population. Four patients in the higher-dose ximelagatran group, two in the lower-dose ximelagatran group, and two in the Warfarin group, did not have a venogram that was adequate for evaluation, but had confirmed symptomatic venous thromboembolism, they had died, or both. We also included them in the analysis.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-EXULT--B-2005" TYPE="STUDY">EXULT B 2005</LINK>
<BR/>Six patients in the ximelagatran group and eight patients in the warfarin group with confirmed symptomatic VTE were excluded from analysis because they discontinued treatment; we included them in the efficacy analysis. Initially, we included the two patients with symptomatic DVT in the follow-up period without venography in the 36 mg ximelagatran group, but then we received the extra required data from Dr. CW Colwell (trialist from <LINK REF="STD-EXULT--B-2005" TYPE="STUDY">EXULT B 2005</LINK>) who stated: "An additional two patients developed symptomatic venous thromboembolism during the follow-up period but did not have mandatory venography" (One in the ximelagatran group and one in the warfarin group). "One patient received five days of treatment with ximelagatran and then withdrew consent and had a proximal deep vein thrombosis objectively confirmed on postoperative day 26. The other patient received 2 days of warfarin, discontinued because of an adverse event, and had a confirmed pulmonary embolism on postoperative day 14". It was then decided to include these patients in the groups to which they were randomised for the sensitivity analysis including the follow-up events.</P>

<BR/>Five patients included in the population for the safety analysis in warfarin presented with confirmed VTE (two DVT and three PE) but discontinued treatment prematurely.

<BR/>The original data are expressed as percentages of cumulative incidence without decimals. We estimated the true values up or down to its next entire number. In order to synthesize the evidence, we grouped the 8 mg, 12 mg and 18 mg of ximelagatran in the group denominated <B>ximelagatran &lt; 24 mg</B>. We defined major deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as the combination of proximal deep vein thrombosis (pDVT) + pulmonary embolism (PE) + DVT &gt; 10 cm.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-METHRO-I-2002" TYPE="STUDY">METHRO I 2002</LINK>
<BR/>There was one study participant with DVT who discontinued treatment and was not included in the efficacy analysis. We could not include this patient because we had no information regarding the group it belonged to (this information is being requested from the trialist). In the ximelagatran &lt; 24 mg group, two patients with DVT developed PE in the follow-up period, but there are no data to which surgery group they belonged. We decided to include these data in the THR group. We decided to include the excessive bleeding data in the THR group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-METHRO-II-2002" TYPE="STUDY">METHRO II 2002</LINK>
<BR/>Two PE were reported in the follow-up period but the trial authors did not state to which surgery group they belonged. We included these data in the THR group. There was a fatal PE reported in the follow-up period. We included these data in the TKR group that received ximelagatran &lt; 24 mg. The ALT values were included in the ximelagatran 24 mg group.</P>

<BR/>All reported follow-up events (seven in the ximelagatran and 16 in the enoxaparin groups) were included in the THR group. In the graphs of events with both surgeries, a combined value was used when it was available, except in a table where the summation of the partials was higher than the total events in the control group (major bleeding: THR+TKR in ximelagatran 24 mg twice daily versus LMWH), for which it was decided to use the sum of the partials instead of the combined total.</P>

<BR/>Regarding the primary outcome measures initially proposed in the preparation of the protocol for this review, it was decided to group mortality associated with VTE with the incidence of proximal VTE in the major VTE group (the results of mortality due to VTE were also analysed separately) so that the analysis would be more practical due to the reduced number of individual events.<BR/>
<BR/>The original studies do not report any serious hepatopathy defined as fulminant hepatitis, symptoms of liver failure, or life-threatening hepatopathy. Moreover, no heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), skin lesions at heparin injection sites, or acute systemic reactions were reported. They reported some other events that are not relevant for this review such as: surgical wound events, transfusion events, transfusion volume and wound drainage volume.<BR/>
<BR/>With regard to the secondary outcome measures, the distal VTE incident was evaluated jointly with the proximal VTE incident and mortality associated with VTE in the total VTE group.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Major/ significant bleeding events</HEADING>
<P>Major or significant bleeding events were reported in all eleven studies that compared DTIs versus LMWH and in all the three studies that compared DTIs versus warfarin. The definition was varied among the studies; all the studies defined severe bleeding if it involved a critical site (intracranial, intraocular, intraspinal or retroperitoneal bleeding). Some studies also included pericardial bleeding and overt bleeding. Some studies included fatal bleeding events in this definition (<LINK REF="STD-Colwell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Colwell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EXPRESS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">EXPRESS 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EXULT-A-2003" TYPE="STUDY">EXULT A 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EXULT--B-2005" TYPE="STUDY">EXULT B 2005</LINK>), score bleeding index &gt;= 2 (<LINK REF="STD-Colwell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Colwell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EXULT-A-2003" TYPE="STUDY">EXULT A 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EXULT--B-2005" TYPE="STUDY">EXULT B 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Francis-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Francis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heit-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Heit 2001</LINK>), severity definition based on transfusion needs and volume &gt; 3500 ml (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1997</LINK>). Some studies included bleeding from the operation wound (<LINK REF="STD-EXPRESS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">EXPRESS 2003</LINK>). All studies also defined severity as judged by a researcher (independent expert in <LINK REF="STD-METHRO-II-2002" TYPE="STUDY">METHRO II 2002</LINK>), and as judged by central adjudication even if they did not fulfil these criteria (<LINK REF="STD-METHRO-III-2003" TYPE="STUDY">METHRO III 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>This variable largely depends on the subjectivity of the researcher or central adjudication in defining the severity of the bleeding. So these conclusions must be taken with caution.</P>
<P>
<B>All Direct Thrombin Inhibitors versus LMWH</B>
<BR/>In the combined analysis of both surgeries in 22,109 patients, there were more bleeding events in the DTI group in comparison with LMWH. However, the difference was not statistically significant (334 events/ 13,753 patients in the DTI group versus 138 events /8356 patients in the LMWH group) (OR 1.17; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.58; I<SUP>2</SUP> 46%) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). It must be considered that this heterogeneity is partly due to the fact that the results of different drugs at different doses are combined and in two different types of operations. When the sensitivity analysis was carried out, excluding the follow-up events reported in the original studies but not included in their analyses, the type of surgery (THR or TKR) and the dose (excluding the lower doses), no significant variation was observed in any of the DTIs compared with LMWH. In the comparison of each independent doses, only dabigatran 225 mg twice daily showed more major bleeding events in the DTI group (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.05 to 3.44) in the combination of both surgeries and specially in THR (26 events/ 270 patients in the DTI group versus 13 events /270 patients in the LMWH group (OR 2.11; 95% CI 1.06 to 4.19).</P>
<P>
<B>Ximelagatran versus vitamin K antagonist (warfarin)</B>
<BR/>In the 5259 analysed patients, more bleeding events were observed in the ximelagatran group however the difference was not statistically significant (30 events/ 3022 patients in the ximelagatran group versus 13 events /2237 patients in the warfarin group) (OR 1.76; 95% CI 0.91 to 3.38; I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%).

The definition varies between the studies because some only considered perioperative bleeding, others postoperative bleeding, some considered both, and other studies did not mention this characteristic.</P>
<P>This variable is less influenced by the researcher's judgment than major bleeding. But even so, the conclusions must be taken with caution.</P>
<P>
<B>All Direct Thrombin Inhibitors versus LMWH</B>
<BR/>As in major bleeding, no difference was observed between both treatment groups, even when the follow-up events were included (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). However, more bleeding events were observed in the DTI group (in ximelagatran and dabigatran or desirudin) in the patients subjected to THR (2370 events/ 5949 patients in the DTI group versus 1374 events /4378 patients in the LMWH group) (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.85; I<SUP>2</SUP> 41%).

No difference was observed in any of these three groups individually, even when the follow-up events were included. Due to the low number of events, the combined analyses of these three mortality groups are presented in the variable called "all-cause mortality".</P>
<P>
<B>All Direct Thrombin Inhibitors versus LMWH</B>
<BR/>More all-cause mortality events were observed in the DTI group in comparison with LMWH (15 events / 13730 patients in DTI versus four events / 8335 patients in LMWH) but the difference was not statically significant (OR 1.72; 95% CI 0.68 to 4.35) with no heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%). When including the events reported in the follow up, more events were also observed in the DTI group (41 events / 13730 patients in DTI versus 11 events / 8335 patients in LMWH) with statistically significance (OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.10 to 3.87) without heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>When the sensitivity analysis was carried out, excluding the studies that evaluated ximelagatran, still more mortality events in the DTI group in comparison with LMWH were observed, but the difference was not statically significant (19 events / 6949 patients in DTI versus five events / 3087 patients in LMWH: OR 1.56; 95% CI 0.63 to 3.90) without heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%).</P>

There was no significant difference regarding mortality (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>The combination of bleeding event results of the studies that began anticoagulation after surgery did not evidence a significant difference between both treatments in any of the two surgery groups (in THR + TKR). In major bleeding: (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.93; I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%) and in total bleeding: (OR 1.29; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.81; I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>).There was also no difference regarding mortality (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>In summary, it is proposed that the time of initiation of anticoagulation can influence the efficacy of treatment more than the drug itself. To explore this effect, a sensitivity analysis was carried out, taking into consideration the time effect by comparing DTI and LMWH. In the DTI group, the studies that initiated anticoagulation before surgery evidenced less VTE events, and those that began anticoagulation after surgery evidenced more VTE events in comparison with LMWH (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). There was no significant difference regarding bleeding (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>) and mortality events (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Extended prophylactic anticoagulation versus standard prophylactic anticoagulation</HEADING>
<P>The duration range of treatment with DTIs in the original studies included in this review was seven to 12 days except in the <LINK REF="STD-RE_x002d_NOVATE-2007" TYPE="STUDY">RE-NOVATE 2007</LINK> study which analysed extended prophylactic anticoagulation (duration range 28 to 35 days). The <LINK REF="STD-RE_x002d_NOVATE-2007" TYPE="STUDY">RE-NOVATE 2007</LINK> study evaluated dabigatran versus LMWH in TKR patients. (<LINK REF="STD-EXTEND-2009" TYPE="STUDY">EXTEND 2009</LINK> was designed to evaluate extended anticoagulation with ximelagatran versus LMWH was excluded because it was prematurely stopped due to the withdrawing of ximelagatran from the market). Regarding standard prophylactic anticoagulation, the included studies were those which evaluated any DTI versus LMWH in TKR patients. The follow-up events were included in both groups. Regarding efficacy, no difference was found in major VTE (extended anticoagulation: 68 events/1797 patients in DTI group versus 37events/ 917 patients in the LMWH group: OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.41) in comparison with ( 235 events/4124 patients in the DTI group versus 123 events/2171 patients in the LMWH group: OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.28; I<SUP>2</SUP> 56%) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). Also no difference was found in total VTE. Regarding symptomatic VTE events in extended anticoagulation, there were more events in the dabigatran group in comparison with LMWH (25 events/2293 patients in the DTI group versus 5 events/1142 patients in the LMWH group), but the difference was not statistically significant (OR 2.51; 95% CI 0.96 to 6.57). In standard anticoagulation no difference was found (76 events/3351 patients in the DTI group versus 37 events/1542 patients in the LMWH group: OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.48; I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Regarding safety, no difference was found in major or total bleeding (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Regarding all-cause mortality, transaminase levels and blood loss were not evaluated since there were not specific individualized data.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological Quality</HEADING>
<P>Regarding the analysis of studies according to methodological quality, the following characteristics were analysed based on efficacy (major VTE) and safety (major bleeding) for the combination of both surgeries (THR+TKR). In <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK> the following study characteristics were analysed: generation of the randomisation sequence and allocation concealment, blinding, randomisation analysis, intention to treat (ITT), and duration of follow-up.</P>
<P>The results obtained from the sensitivity analysis did not differ from the analysed results regarding efficacy and safety; this strengthens the value of the results. It was observed that the studies with methodological deficiencies tended to show differences in results that did not exist in the original analysis.

<P>Current indications supported by evidence for VTE prophylaxis in orthopaedically surgical patients are:</P>
<P>1) general measures: early mobilization, leg exercises, and adequate hydration.<BR/>2) mechanical prophylaxis: graduated elastic compression stockings (GECS) with or without intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) and mechanical foot pumps and foot impulse technology;<BR/>3) pharmacological therapy with LMWH, warfarin and fondaparinux (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2002</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The limited efficacy of classic anticoagulants, such as LMWH and warfarin, has been proven in numerous studies. However, 47% of the patients treated with warfarin and 31% of the patients treated with LMWH developed thrombosis after total knee replacement according to (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzgerald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzgerald 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Francis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Geerts-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geerts 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hamulyak-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamulyak 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heit-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hull-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leclerc-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leclerc 1996</LINK>). These data coincide with the events reported in the studies included in this review. The incidence of VTE events in patients treated with LMWH after TKR was 40% and 30% in patients treated with warfarin.<BR/>
</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-03-17 16:31:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Regarding the efficacy results, when using the previously defined analysis strategy, larger heterogeneity was observed in the studies that compared ximelagatran 24 mg twice daily versus LMWH. The heterogeneity in this case was marked by <LINK REF="STD-Colwell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Colwell 2003</LINK>; the results from this study differ significantly from the rest of the studies and contributed 30% of the patients and 22% of the events of this subgroup. The arguments that might explain the heterogeneity caused by <LINK REF="STD-Colwell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Colwell 2003</LINK> could be its methodological quality (B), that no ITT analysis was carried out, that it evaluated VTE events only by unilateral venography, or that anticoagulation was initiated post surgery. When <LINK REF="STD-Colwell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Colwell 2003</LINK> was not included, fewer major VTE events were observed but still with high heterogeneity. From the review authors criteria, the heterogeneity is too high to be able to conclude that this study is the only important cause of the heterogeneity, so it is recommended that the combined results be taken with caution. In the studies that evaluated oral dabigatran no difference were observed in comparison with LMWH regarding major, total and symptomatic VTE events, even if the lower doses were not taken into consideration. When evaluating the only study that compared subcutaneous desirudin versus LMWH, fewer major and total VTE events were observed in the desirudin group. There were no studies available that analysed this drug in TKR surgery. Due to the high heterogeneity observed when combining all the DTIs versus LMWH, we preferred presenting individual results. Inclusion of the follow-up events did not alter these individual results (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The variability in reported VTE rates in different studies may be due to duration of the anticoagulation, variation in demographic characteristics of the study population, differences in venographic technique, or variations between observers in the interpretation of the venograms. Therefore, between-study comparisons should be made with caution.<BR/>
<BR/>Excessive bleeding is a potential risk associated with prophylaxis with any anticoagulant in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. When evaluating safety in terms of bleeding in DTIs, in the studies that compared DTIs with LMWH regarding major bleeding (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) and total bleeding (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>), a tendency towards fewer events was observed in the LMWH group, especially in THR patients were it was statistically significant for both ximelagatran and dabigatran. An explanation of why TKR presents less bleeding than in THR is that an arterial tourniquet was applied as a routine technique in most of the TKR studies. Regarding blood loss volume, there was no difference between both treatment groups in both types of surgery. When evaluating the studies that compared different doses of ximelagatran with warfarin, a tendency towards more bleeding in ximelagatran was observed regarding major (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>) or total bleeding events (<LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>). However, the difference was not statistically significant, no difference was found regarding blood loss volume between both drugs. Due to the high variability in the definition of this variable and since it largely depends on the subjectivity of the researcher or the central adjudication in defining the severity of the bleeding, the conclusions must be taken with caution. No differences were found regarding mortality due to bleeding between DTIs versus LMWH or warfarin, including the follow-up events.<BR/>
<BR/>The use of ximelagatran was associated with an increase of alanine aminotransferase up to three times its normal value (<LINK REF="REF-Lazerow-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazerow 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olsson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olsson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petersen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulman 2003</LINK>). When evaluating safety in terms of the rise of transaminases in DTIs in this review, in the studies that compared it with LMWH and warfarin, fewer events were observed in the DTI group at the end of the treatment period (<LINK REF="CMP-006.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.4</LINK>), but in the studies that compared DTI with warfarin that evaluated this transitory rise up to the end of the follow-up period, fewer events were observed in the warfarin group that was compared with ximelagatran 36 mg twice daily group, and without any difference in the number of events in the ximelagatran 24 mg twice daily group (<LINK REF="CMP-006.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.5</LINK>). The authors of the original studies indicate that all the patients presented transitory elevation of transaminases and they were still high at the end of the follow-up period, eventually reverting without presenting any significant clinical manifestation.<BR/>
<BR/>Regarding symptomatic VTE events no difference was observed between both treatment groups even when the follow-up events were included (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Symptomatic events, death to any cause and major events (VTE or bleeding) are clinically more important VTE outcomes than all venographic detected DVT. The problem is that symptomatic and death events are infrequent, so these outcomes need a sample size of thousands of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Geerts-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geerts 2004</LINK>). According to an erratum from <LINK REF="STD-RE_x002d_MODEL-2007" TYPE="STUDY">RE-MODEL 2007</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 2007</LINK>), approximately 25,000 patients are required. In this review the efficacy population analysed for the comparison of DTI versus LMWH (larger than with DTI versus warfarin) was 17,305 patients and 22,101 patients for safety. Due to this, clinically relevant outcomes such as symptomatic events or death to any cause, could not had the necessary sample size to be properly evaluated. Thus this non difference result must be taken with caution until adequate sample size are available.<BR/>
<BR/>When evaluating safety in terms of all-cause mortality (the individual analysis was not possible due to the low number of events) including the follow up events, there were more deaths due to all causes in the DTI group in comparison with LMWH  (41 events / 13,730 patients in DTI versus 11 events / 8335 patients in LMWH) with statistical significance (OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.10 to 3.87) without heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). When the ximelagatran events were excluded, and only dabigatran and desirudin were evaluated, still more deaths events in the DTI group in comparison with LMWH were observed (23 events / 7977 patients in DTI versus seven events / 4110 patients in LMWH), but the difference was statically not significant (OR 1.66; 95% CI 0.73 to 3.69) without heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%) probably due to insufficient power.<BR/>
<BR/>Regarding ximelagatran, severe hepatocellular damage was reported (<LINK REF="REF-Albers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albers 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Desai-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halperin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halperin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x00b4_Brien-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">O´Brien 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olsson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsson 2003</LINK>) as well as fatal hepatic damage, whose progression could not be prevented even though the drug was stopped when the hepatic damage was detected (<LINK REF="REF-Spell_x002d_Lesane-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spell-Lesane 2004</LINK>). After reviewing the SPORTIF trials and other data, the FDA Advisory Committee concluded that the risks of ximelagatran outweigh the benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Spell_x002d_Lesane-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spell-Lesane 2004</LINK>). As a result, it was removed from the market due to hepatocellular damage in February 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2006b</LINK>). No fatal events from hepatopathy were reported in the analysed studies in this review, but this information has been specifically requested from the trialist. The only response up to now is from Dr. CW Colwell (trialist from <LINK REF="STD-EXULT--B-2005" TYPE="STUDY">EXULT B 2005</LINK>) who states that "There was no unexplained death in this study with related ALT, AST or liver failure". It is debated whether the question of rare, serious liver toxicity can be fully addressed in 19,000 patients, in particular when the follow-up period is short. Therefore conclusions about this must be taken with caution.<BR/>

<P>The results obtained from sensitivity analysis, did not differ from the analysed results regarding efficacy and safety, this strengthens the value of the results.

<BR/>Efficacy and safety results did not vary significantly when the follow-up events were included (except in mortality events). The data generated during the follow-up period should be interpreted with caution, since concomitant medications were not all recorded and screening for thromboembolic events was not performed systematically during this period.

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-03-17 16:15:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>In this systematic review the DTI comparison was carried out with the current standard therapy (LMWH or warfarin). The DTIs we found that are used for the prevention of VTE in patients who have undergone THR or TKR are ximelagatran, dabigatran (both by oral administration) and desirudin (subcutaneous). Only 15 RCTs were found. One study (<LINK REF="STD-EXTEND-2009" TYPE="STUDY">EXTEND 2009</LINK>) was excluded due methodological deficiencies. Most had an acceptable methodology quality pursuant to the risk of bias analysis. But it must be highlighted that no study carried out a strict ITT analysis (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Due to this, we included all reported patients that presented an event of interest and who had not been included in the original study analysis. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was carried out on all reported patients who presented an event of interest during the follow up. This does not replace an ITT analysis but it is the most rescuable approach that can be carried out with the data provided in the original studies. The trialists have been asked to provide the necessary extra data.<BR/>
<BR/>In the 14 included studies, despite of the fact that this is a small number, a large number of patients were evaluated (the efficacy in 21,642 patients and safety in 27,360 patients. These numbers differ from those presented in the <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK> section because in it were included some patients not analysed in the original studies). Forty three percent were subjected to THR surgery, the remainder to TKR surgery. There was no information available regarding DTIs versus warfarin in patients subjected to THR surgery and the only DTI compared with warfarin was ximelagatran. It must be pointed out that the only drugs that had several studies for its comparison whether to LMWH or warfarin were ximelagatran and dabigatran. There was only one study that evaluated desirudin (and only in patients who have undergone THR surgery), so their conclusions must be taken with caution when generalizing results.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-03-17 16:19:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The optimal duration of thromboprophylaxis after major orthopedic surgery is controversial (<LINK REF="REF-O_x00b4_Donnell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O´Donnell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hull-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EXPERT-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">EXPERT 2007</LINK>). The duration range of treatment with DTI in the original studies included in this review was seven to 12 days except in the <LINK REF="STD-RE_x002d_NOVATE-2007" TYPE="STUDY">RE-NOVATE 2007</LINK> study (evaluated extended prophylactic anticoagulation) where the duration range was 28 to 35 days. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to compare the effect of this study to those with similar characteristics with the exception of the duration of anticoagulation (DTI versus LMWH in TKR), the follow-up events were included. No difference was found regarding major and total VTE for efficacy and major and total bleeding for safety. Regarding symptomatic VTE, more events were seen in the DTI group in extended anticoagulation, but the difference was not statistically significant (OR 2.51; 95% CI 0.96 to 6.57) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). In standard anticoagulation, no difference was found. All-cause mortality, transaminase level and blood loss were not evaluated since there was not specific individualized data. Due to this, the inclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-RE_x002d_NOVATE-2007" TYPE="STUDY">RE-NOVATE 2007</LINK> study did not significantly affect the results of the combination of studies with standard anticoagulation.<BR/>
<BR/>Preventive therapy with LMWH has traditionally been started 12 hours before surgery in Europe, or 12 to 24 hours after surgery in North America. According to recent evidence, thromboprophylaxis should probably be initiated close to surgery. The likely importance of the timing of the first administration of antithrombotic agents can be inferred from the findings of the systematic review and meta-analysis by Hull et al (<LINK REF="REF-Hull-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 2001</LINK>). It is suggested that this timing effect can influence the efficacy of the treatment more than the drug itself. To explore this effect, a sensitivity analysis was carried out in this review considering the effect of the beginning of anticoagulation when comparing DTI versus LMWH. What was observed was that the studies that initiated anticoagulation before surgery evidenced less VTE events, and those that began anticoagulation after surgery evidenced more VTE events in comparison with LMWH (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). There was no significant difference regarding bleeding and mortality events, which agrees with that found by Hull 2001. Therefore, the effect of the DTIs described in the results regarding efficacy, compared to LMWH, seem to be influenced by the time of initiation of coagulation more than the effect of the drug itself.<BR/>
<BR/>Although the number of analysed patients was high, few studies were found and the obtainment of studies by manual search was null. Most of the funnel plots in this review are asymmetrical (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) which suggests certain publication bias. Although there was no restriction regarding languages, only studies in English were found. Bias in this review is not discarded despite the developed methodology.<BR/>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-03-17 16:22:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>In the included studies of this review the International Normalized Ratio (INR) objective range (2.0 to 3.0) was achieved between 33% and 67% of the patients on the third day of treatment and at the end of the treatment period in the 50% to 76% range of the patients treated with warfarin, which is a somewhat higher proportion than usual.<BR/>
<BR/>The percentage of patients with venographically-confirmed DVT following THR or TKR in the LMWH group of this review was similar to rates reported previously in studies with LMWH (<LINK REF="REF-Clagett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clagett 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hull-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 1993</LINK>). The only trial found which evaluated extended prophylactic anticoagulation in patients subjected to TKR was the <LINK REF="STD-RE_x002d_NOVATE-2007" TYPE="STUDY">RE-NOVATE 2007</LINK> study, and it had an incidence of VTE events in LMWH of 7%, much lower than the rest of the studies.<BR/>
<BR/>In the only placebo-controlled prophylaxis trial after TKR, the incidence of major bleeding was 2% in the placebo group (<LINK REF="REF-Leclerc-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leclerc 1992</LINK>). Published studies using warfarin in TKR have shown major bleeding in 0.9% (<LINK REF="REF-Leclerc-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leclerc 1996</LINK>) and 1.8% (<LINK REF="REF-Hull-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 1993</LINK>). In this review, the major bleeding rate was much lower to the ones reported (0.36%). The explanation for this according to some of the trialist of the original studies may be related to improvements in general surgical care and to the strict, predefined guidelines used for central adjudication.</P>
<P>More recently, the NICE Appraisal Committee (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK> guideline) considered evidence submitted by the manufacturer of dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after hip or knee replacement surgery in adults and a review of this submission by the Evidence Review Group (ERG). The manufacturer conducted a systematic review which included three randomised, active-controlled parallel-group, non-inferiority trials of dabigatran etexilate (each including two dosing regimes) versus enoxaparin. These trials were: <LINK REF="STD-RE_x002d_MOBILIZE-2009" TYPE="STUDY">RE-MOBILIZE 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-RE_x002d_MODEL-2007" TYPE="STUDY">RE-MODEL 2007</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-RE_x002d_NOVATE-2007" TYPE="STUDY">RE-NOVATE 2007</LINK>. Outcomes analysed included: mortality; incidence of deep vein thrombosis; incidence of pulmonary embolism; adverse effects of treatment including bleeding events; post-DVT complications including post-thrombotic syndrome; length of hospital stay; and health-related quality of life.  This document was extensively revised and commented by <LINK REF="REF-Holmes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 2008</LINK>. According to his report, &#8220;the processes undertaken by the manufacturer for screening studies, data extraction and applying quality assessment criteria to included studies are not made explicitly clear in the Manufacturer&#8217;s Submission&#8221;.</P>
<P>The main differences with our review are that the manufacturer&#8217;s submission (MS) did not include in the analysis the follow-up events, all-cause mortality was not an individual outcome; it was analysed combined with total VTE events. The outcome measure in the MS report was Absolute risk differences and Relative risks; in our review the Odds ratio was employed as the outcome measure. We also included the rescuable data of the <LINK REF="STD-BISTRO-II-2005" TYPE="STUDY">BISTRO II 2005</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK> states that &#8220;Dabigatran etexilate, within its marketing authorisation, is recommended as an option for the primary prevention of venous thromboembolic events in adults who have undergone elective total hip replacement surgery or elective total knee replacement surgery.&#8221;  However In the economic evaluation they performed analysing the three pivotal studies, dabigatran was more costly and less effective than LMWH.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-03-17 16:25:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) (ximelagatran, dabigatran and desirudin) seem at least equally effective than conventional drugs (LMWH or warfarin) for prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients subjected to total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR).<BR/>However, the DTIs (specially ximelagatran) evidence higher mortality tendency with regard to LMWH in the prophylactic anticoagulation of venous thromboembolism in patients subjected to orthopedic surgery. More total bleeding events were observed in the DTI group in comparison with LMWH in the prophylactic anticoagulation of venous thromboembolism in patients subjected to THR.<BR/>
<BR/>The DTI effects regarding efficacy (major VTE), in comparison with LMWH seem to be influenced by the time of initiation of coagulation more than the effect of the drug itself.<BR/>
<BR/>No severe hepatic complications or fatal events from hepatopathy were reported in the analysed studies.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Safety and efficacy results must be taken with caution because of the variability found in the studies due to the variation in demographic characteristics of the study population, differences in venographic technique, variations between observers in the interpretation of venograms, different drugs, doses, types of surgery, and initiation and duration of the treatment.<BR/>
<BR/>Moreover, the presentation of the combined results, both in the efficacy and safety analyses, must be taken with caution due to the different methodological characteristics of the studies (no ITT analysis, some studies not blinded, difference in the presentation of results, etc.).<BR/>
<BR/>Due to all of these findings, the use of ximelagatran is not recommended for VTE prevention in patients who have undergone orthopaedic surgery. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of dabigatran and desirudin in VTE prevention in orthopaedic surgery.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-03-17 16:26:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>More studies of DTIs are required, specially on dabigatran compared with LMWH and vitamin K antagonist (warfarin). The effect of the coagulation time of initiation needs to be properly analysed for dabigatran. It is debated whether the question of rare, serious liver toxicity can be fully addressed in 19,000 patients, specially when the follow-up period is short. This serious complications needs to be adequately evaluated. Also mortality and symptomatic VTE events needs a detailed evaluation in dabigatran. Due to this, there is currently insufficient data to support their use in preference to LMWH.<BR/>
<BR/>It was not possible to analyse part of the information presented in the original studies due to the various ways of showing the results and, also, in the review authors' opinion, certain relevant information was not available for analysis of this review. The trialists' answers with the requested information is being awaited, which will be included in the updating of this review.<BR/>

<P>Regarding the primary outcome measures initially proposed in the preparation of the protocol for this review, it was decided to group mortality associated with VTE with the incidence of proximal VTE in the major VTE group (the results of mortality due to VTE were also analysed separately) so that the analysis would be more practical due to the reduced number of individual events.</P>
<P>With regard to the secondary outcome measures, the distal VTE incident was evaluated jointly with the proximal VTE incident and mortality associated with VTE in the total VTE group.</P>

<P>UNCLEAR = small but possible chance of disclosure of assignment or unclear.</P>
<P>NO = quasi-randomised or open list/tables.</P>
<P>
<B>2). Were the outcomes of patients who withdrew described and included in the analysis (intention to treat)?</B>
</P>
<P>YES = withdrawals well described and accounted for in the analysis.</P>
<P>UNCLEAR = withdrawals described and analysis not possible.</P>
<P>NO = no mention, inadequate mention, or obvious differences and no adjustment.</P>
