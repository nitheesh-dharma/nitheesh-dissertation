<B>Key messages:</B>
</P>
<P>This Cochrane review found that there was not enough evidence to determine whether one route of bladder drainage was more likely to reduce urinary tract infection than another. The evidence suggests that participants with suprapubic catheters were less likely to have catheter-associated pain compared with those with indwelling urethral catheters. The quality of evidence in this review was low, and many of the trials did not report important outcomes such as catheter-associated quality of life and ease of use. The included trials reported few adverse effects, but it is not clear if this is because the adverse effects did not occur or were simply not reported. Because of the limited evidence, we need more high-quality trials. It is important that these trials report symptomatic urinary tract infection, pain from using catheters, quality of life, adverse effects and ease of use.</P>
<P>
<B>Background: what routes of short-term bladder drainage are there?</B>
</P>
<P>Urinary catheters are tubes that drain urine from the bladder. They are often used in people who are unable to go to the toilet easily during their hospital stay. About one in four hospital patients requires short-term bladder drainage using a urinary catheter. Catheters can be used in different ways. The main routes of urinary catheterisation are:</P>
<P>1. Urethral : a drainage tube is inserted into the bladder via the urethra, and is either left in place (indwelling catheter), or removed after the bladder is emptied (intermittent catheter).</P>
<P>2. Suprapubic catheterisation: a drainage tube is inserted into the bladder through a small cut in the abdominal wall.</P>
<P>A common complication of short-term bladder drainage is urinary tract infection. Infections have many serious implications for patients and healthcare providers. Insertion of a suprapubic catheter may also be associated with more risks than urethral routes, such as bleeding or damage to the bowel.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The Cochrane review looked at studies which made one of three comparisons:</P>
<P>1. Indwelling versus suprapubic catheterisation<BR/>2. Indwelling versus intermittent catheterisation<BR/>3. Suprapubic versus intermittent catheterisation</P>
<P>1. Twenty-five trials (2622 participants) compared indwelling urethral and suprapubic catheterisation. There was not enough evidence from five trials to determine whether people had a lower risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection with indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheterisation. There was low quality evidence from four trials that people with indwelling urethral catheters were at greater risk of catheter-associated pain compared with participants with suprapubic catheters. None of the twenty-five trials reported ease of use, quality of life or economic outcomes.</P>
<P>2. Fourteen trials (1596 participants) compared indwelling and intermittent urethral catheterisation. There was very low quality evidence from two trials reporting on urinary tract infection, and the review could not determine which route of bladder drainage had a lower risk. None of the fourteen trials reported pain, ease of use, quality of life or economic outcomes.</P>
<P>3. Three trials (359 participants) compared suprapubic and intermittent urethral catheterisation. Only one trial reported on urinary tract infection. The evidence was inconclusive and of low quality. Only one trial had evidence on pain. Again, the evidence was inconclusive and the quality of the evidence was very low. None of the three trials reported ease of use, quality of life or economic outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Concluding messages</B>
</P>
<P>Although many trials have been conducted not enough have looked at important outcomes. Many questions are still unanswered about short-term bladder drainage. Which route is the least likely to cause urinary tract infection? Is one route associated with more pain than the others? Is there a significant difference in cost or convenience for patients and hospitals between the three routes? Until these questions are answered with higher-quality evidence, we need more and better trials.</P>

<P>Indwelling urethral catheters are often used for bladder drainage in hospital. Urinary tract infection is the most common hospital-acquired infection, and a common complication of urinary catheterisation. Pain, ease of use and quality of life are important to consider, as well as formal economic analysis. Suprapubic catheterisation can also result in bowel perforation and death. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-12-01 16:30:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this systematic review, we included 42 trials.</P>
<P>Twenty-five trials compared indwelling urethral and suprapubic catheterisation. There was insufficient evidence for symptomatic urinary tract infection (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.69; 5 trials, 575 participants; very low-quality evidence). Participants with indwelling catheters had more cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.63 to 3.10; 19 trials, 1894 participants; very low quality evidence) and more participants reported pain (RR 5.62, 95% CI 3.31 to 9.55; 4 trials, 535 participants; low-quality evidence). Duration of catheterisation was shorter in the indwelling urethral catheter group (MD -1.73, 95% CI -2.42 to -1.05; 2 trials, 274 participants).</P>
<P>Fourteen trials compared indwelling urethral catheterisation with intermittent catheterisation. Two trials had data for symptomatic UTI which were suitable for meta-analysis. Due to evidence of significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity, we did not pool the results, which were inconclusive and the quality of evidence was very low. The main source of heterogeneity was the reason for hospitalisation as Hakvoort and colleagues recruited participants undergoing urogenital surgery; whereas in the trial conducted by Tang and colleagues elderly women in geriatric rehabilitation ward were recruited. The evidence was also inconclusive for asymptomatic bacteriuria (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.28; 13 trials, 1333 participants; very low quality evidence). Almost three times as many people developed acute urinary retention with the intermittent catheter (16% with urethral versus 45% with intermittent); RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.91; 4 trials, 384 participants.</P>
<P>Three trials compared intermittent catheterisation with suprapubic catheterisation, with only female participants. The evidence was inconclusive for symptomatic urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, pain or cost.</P>
<P>None of the trials reported the following critical outcomes: quality of life; ease of use, and cost utility analysis.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-11-17 09:41:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Suprapubic catheters reduced the number of participants with asymptomatic bacteriuria, recatheterisation and pain compared with indwelling urethral. The evidence for symptomatic urinary tract infection was inconclusive.</P>
<P>For indwelling versus intermittent urethral catheterisation, the evidence was inconclusive for symptomatic urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria. No trials reported pain. </P>
<P>The evidence was inconclusive for suprapubic versus intermittent urethral catheterisation. Trials should use a standardised definition for symptomatic urinary tract infection. Further adequately-powered trials comparing all catheters are required, particularly suprapubic and intermittent urethral catheterisation.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-11-30 12:49:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Indwelling urinary catheters are commonly used for bladder drainage during hospital care. The most common complication is infection. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) account for about 20% of hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections (<LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2008</LINK>), and about 80% of these are associated with urinary catheters. Such infections not only prolong hospital stay and are expensive to treat (<LINK REF="REF-Elvy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elvy 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nasr-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nasr 2010</LINK>), but also cause unpleasant symptoms such as fever and chills in up to 30% of the patients. Patients with infection of the urinary tract can go on to develop bacteraemia (presence of bacteria within circulation). About 17% of hospital bacteraemia is due to catheter-associated UTI (<LINK REF="REF-Gould-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2009</LINK>) . When used in patients who are acutely ill, the risk of a catheter-associated infection may be higher and hence pose a greater threat to life.</P>
<P>Bacteria get into the catheterised bladder by direct inoculation at the time of catheter insertion and via the following routes: extraluminally by ascending from the urethral meatus along the catheter-urethral interface, and intraluminally by reflux of the organisms into the catheter lumen (<LINK REF="REF-Tambyah-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tambyah 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warren-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2001</LINK>). The normal mechanical wash-out effect of the urinary stream is interrupted when there is a urinary catheter. The presence of a urinary catheter, plus other factors such as the formation of biofilm, allows bacteria to multiply quickly (<LINK REF="REF-Elvy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elvy 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trautner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trautner 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are various micro-organisms that can cause catheter-associated urinary tract infection. The most common of these is <I>Escherichia coli</I>, a gram-negative coliform. Other common infective organisms include <I>Candida spp</I>, <I>Enterococcus spp</I>, <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>, <I>Klebsiella pneumonia</I> and <I>Enterobacter spp</I>. This list, however, is not exhaustive, with other less common micro-organisms also causing catheter-associated urinary tract infection (<LINK REF="REF-Elvy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elvy 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines catheter-associated UTI as a UTI in the presence of an indwelling catheter which has been in place for more than two calendar days on the day of UTI; or the catheter was in place on the day of the UTI or the previous day and then removed. The UTI criteria must be met on the day of catheter removal or the following day. The UTI CDC criteria must also be met, which include at least one of the following symptoms: fever, suprapubic tenderness, frequency, dysuria, costovertebral pain or tenderness. As well as signs and symptoms, a positive urine culture of 10&#8309; colony-forming units (CFU)/ml with no more than two species of micro-organisms must be identified. CDC includes intermittent catheters but not suprapubic in its definition (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published guidelines for diagnosing catheter-associated UTIs, which include all three types of catheter: indwelling, intermittent and suprapubic catheters. It recommended that a diagnosis be made when symptoms and signs compatible with UTI were present, plus at least 10 cfu/ml of one or more bacterial species in a single catheter urine specimen or in a midstream voided urine specimen from a patient whose catheter was removed in the previous 48 hours.</P>
<P>Signs and symptoms that are compatible with UTI include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>new onset or worsening fever</LI>
<LI>rigors</LI>
<LI>altered mental status</LI>
<LI>malaise, or lethargy with no other identified cause</LI>
<LI>flank pain</LI>
<LI>costovertebral angle tenderness</LI>
<LI>acute haematuria</LI>
<LI>pelvic discomfort</LI>
<LI>dysuria</LI>
<LI>urgent or frequent urination</LI>
<LI>suprapubic pain or tenderness (<LINK REF="REF-Hooton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooton 2010</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>In this review, we use the IDSA definition of catheter-associated UTI as it includes indwelling urethral, intermittent urethral and suprapubic catheters in its definition. The CDC definition includes urethral catheters, but does not include suprapubic and we therefore did not use this definition.</P>
<P>The IDSA defines asymptomatic bacteriuria as the presence of at least 10&#8309; cfu/ml of one or more bacterial species in a sample of urine in a patient with no symptoms of urinary tract infection (<LINK REF="REF-Hooton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooton 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Management of symptomatic UTI varies greatly. Some clinicians will treat patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria, some will use prophylactic antibiotics and others will only treat patients with symptomatic UTI. The European and Asian guidelines on Management and Prevention of Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections recommend that asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antibiotics, as the infection will not be eradicated or, if it is, it will return rapidly. They recommend that symptomatic infections in catheterised patients be treated with broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics, as well as removal and replacement of the catheter (<LINK REF="REF-Tenke-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tenke 2008</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-11-17 09:46:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review, we consider only short-term urinary catheterisation in hospitalised adults. We define 'short-term' as 14 days or less.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Indwelling urethral catheterisation</HEADING>
<P>Indwelling urethral catheterisation is most commonly used, in both the short term and the long term. It involves the insertion of a catheter through the urethra into the bladder, although it is associated with various complications. The most common of these is UTI, which can have a heavy cost for both patient and healthcare provider. The first step in reducing UTIs and other complications is to avoid unnecessary catheterisation; the second is to remove the catheter as soon as possible. Indications for indwelling urethral catheterisation include acute urinary retention or bladder outlet obstruction, the need for precise urinary output monitoring, and in patients undergoing urological or gynaecological surgery who might be expected to be unable to micturate immediately after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Gould-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>While the most common method of bladder drainage is indwelling urethral catheterisation, intermittent catheterisation and suprapubic catheterisation are alternative approaches. From a theoretical point of view, it is possible that either of these methods may be associated with a lower risk of UTI.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Suprapubic catheterisation</HEADING>
<P>Suprapubic catheterisation involves insertion of a catheter into the bladder through an incision in the abdominal wall. Bacterial colonisation of the urethral tract is less likely because of the lower density of (gram-negative) micro-organisms on the abdominal skin than in the periurethral area. However, suprapubic catheterisation involves puncturing the bladder after inserting the catheter through the abdominal wall; the concern is unintended visceral or vascular injury. Contraindications for suprapubic catheterisation include bladder cancer, anticoagulation and antiplatelet treatment, abdominal wall sepsis and presence of subcutaneous vascular graft in the suprapubic region (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>Intermittent catheterisation involves inserting and removing a sterile urethral catheter using an aseptic technique. Micro-organisms are less likely to gain entry into the bladder by tracking along the catheter wall because the catheter is no longer constantly present.</P>
<P>As with other catheters, intermittent catheterisation can be used diagnostically and therapeutically. Diagnostically, it can be used to obtain a sample of urine, or to assess urodynamics or urinary output. Therapeutically, it is indicated in patients who have problems with bladder voiding due to various reasons, such as spinal cord injury, non-neurogenic bladder dysfunction or incomplete emptying due to intravesical obstruction. Intermittent catheterisation is contraindicated in patients with priapism, and urethral catheterisation generally is contraindicated in patients with suspected or confirmed urethral damage, or urethral cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Geng-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geng 2006</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-12-01 11:58:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Once a catheter is in place, the aim is to minimise the risk of infection. There are two accepted basic principles: keeping the catheter system closed, and removing the catheter when it is no longer needed. Antibiotic prophylaxis is controversial and is addressed in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Lusardi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lusardi 2013</LINK>). Another possible strategy for reducing the risk of infection due to indwelling (i.e. urethral or suprapubic) catheters is to use different materials, such as catheters coated with an antibacterial substance. The effects of using different types of indwelling urethral catheters have been evaluated in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Lam-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lam 2014</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-11-17 09:47:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of different routes of catheterisation (urethral (indwelling or intermittent) or suprapubic) for short-term use in hospitalised adults, primarily focused on symptomatic urinary tract infection. Other important outcomes included adverse effects, the need for replacement, duration of use, patient satisfaction and cost effectiveness. For the purposes of this review, we define short term as intended duration of catheterisation for up to 14 days.</P>

<P>We used the following definition for this review:</P>
<P>
<B>Indwelling catheterisation: </B>The European Association of Urology (EAU) definition for indwelling catheterisation: indwelling catheterisation was defined by the passage of a catheter into the urinary bladder via the urethra using an inflatable balloon or other means to retain it in position (<LINK REF="REF-EAU-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">EAU 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Intermittent catheterisation:</B> The EAU definition for intermittent catheterisation: intermittent catheterisation, also known as in-out catheterisation, was defined as emptying of the bladder via the urethra by a catheter that is removed after the procedure, mostly at regular intervals (<LINK REF="REF-EAU-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">EAU 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Suprapubic catheterisation: </B>The European Association of Urology Nurses (EAUN) definition of suprapubic catheterisation: suprapubic catheterisation was defined as the insertion of a catheter into the bladder via the anterior abdominal wall, using sutures or other means to retain it in position (<LINK REF="REF-Geng-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geng 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. We organised a group discussion through the Urological Cancer Charity (UCAN) with participants who underwent urethral or suprapubic catheterisation, in order to identify outcomes which were important from their perspective. We identified five individuals (four men and one woman) who had undergone urethral catheterisation or suprapubic catheterisation. Most of the participants had both types of catheterisation during different stages of their treatment. The participants suggested that infections, pain and discomfort were certainly the most important outcomes from their point of view. They described the pain sensation of suprapubic catheterisation in a number of different ways, such as " very painful", "extremely painful" and "quite painful". They also stressed the impact of catheterisation on their quality of life and identified it as an important outcome. These results were similar to the focus group conducted by <LINK REF="REF-Omar-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omar 2013</LINK> for another Cochrane review of the types of indwelling urethral catheters for short-term catheterisation in hospitalised adults (<LINK REF="REF-Lam-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lam 2014</LINK>).

<P>For categorical outcomes, the numbers reporting an outcome were related to the numbers at risk in each group to derive a risk ratio (RR), and the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT). For continuous variables, we used means and standard deviations to derive a mean difference (MD). As a general rule, we combined the outcome data using a fixed-effect model to calculate pooled estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). However, we considered the use of a random-effects model where there were concerns that heterogeneity might have been complicating an analysis. When appropriate, we undertook meta-analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The trials used a number of different ways to define microbiological outcomes. Eight trials were classified as reporting symptomatic UTI (<LINK REF="STD-Baan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barry-1992-PE" TYPE="STUDY">Barry 1992 PE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dixon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dixon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hakvoort-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hakvoort 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Korkes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Korkes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kringel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kringel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiotz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schiotz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>). We used the following definitions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>&#8805; 10&#8309; cfu/ml and at least one symptom of UTI (e.g. fever, suprapubic tenderness, dysuria) (<LINK REF="STD-Baan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dixon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Dixon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hakvoort-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hakvoort 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kringel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kringel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiotz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schiotz 1989</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>&gt; 10&#8308; cfu/ml and leucocituria with at least one sign or symptom (e.g. fever, malaise, haematuria, pain, etc.) (<LINK REF="STD-Korkes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Korkes 2008</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>Fever in the absence of other sites of infection (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>No definition (<LINK REF="STD-Barry-1992-PE" TYPE="STUDY">Barry 1992 PE</LINK>). The only report of this trial that we could find was an abstract. It is unsurprising, therefore, that no definition of symptomatic UTI was supplied. We assumed that the trial used an appropriate definition.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The time that the urine sample was taken for diagnosis of symptomatic UTI also varied between trials. The urine samples were taken at the following times:</P>

<P>We describe the methods of measuring symptomatic UTI in the trials in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>.</P>
<P>Twenty trials reported asymptomatic bacteriuria. However, an additional 13 trials that said they were reporting UTI were actually reporting asymptomatic bacteriuria (without clinical symptoms), and we reclassified them. Thirty-three trials reported asymptomatic bacteriuria, using the following definitions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>&#8805; 10 cfu/ml (<LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vandoni-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Vandoni 1994</LINK>);</LI>

Another trial used &gt; 10&#8308; cfu/ml to define bacteriuria in participants who still had a catheter present, on the basis that a smaller density of bacteria may be significant (<LINK REF="STD-Sethia-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sethia 1987</LINK>);</LI>

The sample size of these trials was small (the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hammarsten-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hammarsten 1992</LINK>) included 344 participants). All the trials were RCTs, apart from one quasi-RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Barents-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Barents 1978</LINK>).

We summarise the quality of the evidence for the five most important outcomes in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Symptomatic urinary tract infection</HEADING>
<P>Five trials (575 participants) reported symptomatic UTI (<LINK REF="STD-Baan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barry-1992-PE" TYPE="STUDY">Barry 1992 PE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Korkes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Korkes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kringel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kringel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiotz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schiotz 1989</LINK>). There was insufficient evidence to determine if indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheterisation reduced symptomatic UTI (32/376, 8.5% versus 24/199, 12.1%: RR 1.01, 95% 0.61 to 1.69; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). We assessed the quality of evidence to be very low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>We performed subgroup analyses comparing (a) men versus women, (b) participants undergoing urogenital surgery versus other surgery, and (c) two trials which used antibiotic prophylaxis. In both subgroups there was also no statistical difference in symptomatic UTI (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.2,3,4,5,6,7). We also performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding <LINK REF="STD-Barry-1992-PE" TYPE="STUDY">Barry 1992 PE</LINK>, as it did not have a definition for symptomatic UTI. There was no difference in the pooled effect when we excluded this trial , so it remains in the meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Asymptomatic bacteriuria</HEADING>
<P>In 15 of the 19 trials (1894 participants) asymptomatic bacteriuria was more common after indwelling urethral catheterisation; in nine of these the result was statistically significant. There was evidence of heterogeneity between trials (I = 55%), so we compared the random-effects and fixed-effect models (fixed-effect model, RR 2.47 (95% CI 2.04 to 3.00) and random-effects model, RR 2.25 (95% CI 1.63 to 3.10)) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). We decided to use the random-effects model as this would provide a more conservative estimate. We explored heterogeneity in subgroup analyses by gender, type of surgery, antibiotic prophylaxis use and time of collection of the urine sample (while catheterised or afterwards). These all favoured suprapubic catheterisation, although each subgroup analysis had very wide 95% CIs.</P>
<P>Fewer participants with suprapubic catheters developed asymptomatic bacteriuria compared with indwelling urethral catheters (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.63 to 3.10; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) This is equivalent to about five patients being managed with a suprapubic catheter to avoid one case of bacteriuria (risk difference (RD) 0.19, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.27). As there were more than 10 trials included in this comparison, we used a funnel plot to assess publication bias. There was some evidence of publication bias on interpretation of the funnel plot, as trials with low sample size or negative results were not represented <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Recatheterisation</HEADING>
<P>Signficicantly more people needed to be re-catheterised in the urethral group than in the suprapubic group (100/590, 17% versus 42/590, 7%). There was evidence of heterogeneity (I = 58%), so we compared the fixed-effect and random-effects models (fixed-effect model, RR 2.40 (95% CI 1.71 to 3.35) and random-effects model, RR 2.21 (95% CI 1.19 to 4.09) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; 11 trials, 1180 participants)). We decided to use the random-effects model, as this would provide a more conservative estimate.</P>
<P>Participants with a urethral catheter had a higher rate of recatheterisation than those with a suprapubic catheter overall (RR 2.21, 95% CI 1.19 to 4.09; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). This is equivalent to about 11 patients having to receive a suprapubic catheter to avoid one patient needing to be recatheterised (RD 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.16).</P>
<P>As there were more than 10 trials included in this comparison, we used a funnel plot to assess publication bias. There was some evidence of publication bias on interpretation of the funnel plot, as trials with low sample size or negative results were not represented (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Duration of catheterisation</HEADING>
<P>Data related to duration of catheterisation were available for 17 trials.</P>
<P>Two trials (274 participants) reported mean duration of catheterisation with standard deviations (SDs) (<LINK REF="STD-Hammarsten-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hammarsten 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiotz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schiotz 1989</LINK>). From these two trials, participants managed with indwelling urethral catheterisation had a shorter duration of catheterisation compared with participants managed with suprapubic catheterisation, with a mean difference of -1.73 days, 95% CI -2.42 to -1.05; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>. The remaining 15 trials had insufficient data to include in a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). Overall, the pattern does not consistently favour one route of catheterisation over the other.</P>
<P>In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perrin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Perrin 1997</LINK>) duration was expressed as the number of participants catheterised for more than five days (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). These two trials showed significant heterogeneity (I = 93%), and we therefore did not perform meta-analysis. The source of the clinical heterogeneity is likely to be because the participants had different reasons for hospitalisation: <LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1987</LINK> included women undergoing vaginal continence surgery (urethropexy/needle suspension) and vaginal hysterectomy, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Perrin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Perrin 1997</LINK> included people undergoing rectal surgery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Urinary retention</HEADING>
<P>Two trials (282 participants) reported the number of participants who developed acute urinary retention following catheterisation (<LINK REF="STD-Kringel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kringel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratnaval-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ratnaval 1996</LINK>). One trial included women undergoing anterior prolapse repair (colporrhaphy, <LINK REF="STD-Kringel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kringel 2010</LINK>), and the other included men undergoing pelvic colorectal surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Ratnaval-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ratnaval 1996</LINK>). The available evidence was insufficient to conclude whether indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheterisation reduced the risk of acute urinary retention (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.94; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial reported the number of participants who developed chronic urinary retention following catheterisation (<LINK REF="STD-Ratnaval-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ratnaval 1996</LINK>). Only one participant out of 26 developed chronic urinary retention in the indwelling group, and none out of 24 in the suprapubic group. The evidence was therefore inconclusive for chronic urinary retention (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Bladder dysfunction</HEADING>
<P>Two trials (276 participants) reported bladder dysfunction. One trial reported participants with post-void residual volume &gt; 500 ml (<LINK REF="STD-Stekkinger-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Stekkinger 2011</LINK>) and the other reported voiding difficulty, with no further detail given (<LINK REF="STD-Wiser-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Wiser 1974</LINK>). A small number of participants developed bladder dysfunction (9/137 participants with indwelling urethral catheters versus 6/139 participants with suprapubic catheters (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.56 to 4.18; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>)).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pain</HEADING>
<P>Data describing pain were available from eight trials. Five trials reported the number of participants with pain (<LINK REF="STD-Baan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Botsios-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Botsios 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kringel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kringel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Kelly-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Kelly 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piergiovanni-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Piergiovanni 1991</LINK>). There was evidence of significant heterogeneity (I = 76%). Only one trial found more participants with suprapubic catheters reporting pain than participants with indwelling urethral catheters (<LINK REF="STD-Baan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baan 2003</LINK>), although this was not statistically significant. This may be due to how pain was assessed. Participants were questioned on "pain in the abdomen". The population in this trial was people undergoing major abdominal surgery, so it is likely that the participants were reporting on pain associated with the surgery rather than pain from the route of catheterisation. Because of this, we excluded <LINK REF="STD-Baan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baan 2003</LINK> from the meta-analysis, which eliminated the heterogeneity (I = 0%).</P>

<P>From the remaining four trials (535 participants), more participants with indwelling urethral catheters reported pain compared to participants with suprapubic catheters (RR 5.62, 95% CI 3.31 to 9.55; <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). In these trials, pain was defined using the authors' criteria without validation. We rated the evidence as low quality (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). This is equivalent to three patients being managed with a suprapubic catheter to avoid one patient having (urethral) pain (RD 0.32, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.39).</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Kelly-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Kelly 1995</LINK>) also reported that there were significantly more catheter days with pain in the indwelling urethral catheter group (37/126 days versus 6/142; RR 6.95, 95% CI 3.03 to 15.92; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>).</P>

This trial found no difference in pain scores between the indwelling urethral and suprapubic groups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>). However, this trial was stopped prematurely following interim analysis. Originally, the trial reported that a minimum of 102 participants were required to find a "statistically significant and clinically meaningful" result, a difference of one point between groups on the VAS on postoperative day one. However, only 58 participants were included in the final analysis. It is possible that this study was inadequately powered to find a difference between the indwelling urethral and suprapubic groups.</P>

The fixed-effect model RR 0.45 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.93), and the random-effects model RR 0.37 (95% CI 0.08 to 1.78) were similar, so we used the random-effects model. The five trials that reported catheter obstruction included participants undergoing anterior colporrhaphy (<LINK REF="STD-Kringel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kringel 2010</LINK>), rectal surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Perrin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Perrin 1997</LINK>), vaginal plastic surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Schiotz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schiotz 1989</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Wiser-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Wiser 1974</LINK>) and cystocoele repair (<LINK REF="STD-Stekkinger-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Stekkinger 2011</LINK>). Catheter obstruction was a rare adverse event: 7/436 participants managed with an indwelling urethral catheter had an obstruction compared with 13/258 managed with a suprapubic catheter. This small difference between groups was not statistically significant (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.78; <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>).</P>

<P>One trial reported participants who had urine leak around the catheter (<LINK REF="STD-Stekkinger-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Stekkinger 2011</LINK>). More participants with a suprapubic catheter had urine leakage compared with indwelling (indwelling 4/62 versus 17/64; RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.68; <LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>).</P>

These trials did not give information about when the haematuria occurred (i.e. while the catheter was in situ or after catheter removal). People who had urethral catheterisation had a statistically significantly reduced risk of gross haematuria (6/284, 2% versus 16/273, 6% with a suprapubic catheter), although the 95% CI approached one (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; <LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results from the two trials (330 participants) with data on microscopic haematuria were not consistent.

We did not combine the results because of this heterogeneity. A possible explanation is that participants in each of the trials were undergoing different types of surgery. Additionally, neither gave a definition for microscopic haematuria, so this may be another source of heterogeneity.</P>

As there were more than 10 trials included in this comparison, we used a funnel plot to assess publication bias.

There was no information on how bias was assessed in this trial. The trial stated that the nurses found indwelling urethral catheterisation less time-consuming.

Costs were lower for indwelling urethral catheters than intermittent urethral catheters in both trials, though statistical analysis was not possible. However, there were marked differences between the trials in this respect, with one suggesting a six-fold difference, and the other a relatively small difference.</P>
<P>One trial (139 participants) calculated the cost of indwelling and intermittent urethral catheterisation based on the average number of catheterisations, and the cost of the catheter kit used (<LINK REF="STD-Rivard-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Rivard 2012</LINK>). Indwelling urethral catheterisation was very slightly more expensive than intermittent (USD 7.37 for indwelling versus USD 6.28 for intermittent). One trial (169 participants) calculated the cost of each route of catheterisation based on total material and labour cost (<LINK REF="STD-Halleberg-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Halleberg 2013</LINK>). This trial also compared the cost in participants who developed UTI and those who did not. Intermittent catheterisation was slightly more expensive than indwelling (EUR 16.62 for indwelling versus EUR 17.98 for intermittent). They also found that there was a significantly higher direct cost of catheterisation and cost for length of stay for participants who developed UTI compared to those who did not (<LINK REF="CMP-002.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.13</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial carried out a cost-effectiveness analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Halleberg-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Halleberg 2013</LINK>). It used health state scores from EQ-5D, EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) and SF-6D to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained at four-month follow-up. There was no significant difference between groups in QALYs gained between discharge and four months (<LINK REF="CMP-002.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.14</LINK>).

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-11-17 12:05:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this review, we prespecified five important participant-centred outcomes: symptomatic UTI, pain, ease of use, quality of life and cost utility analysis. Only the primary outcome, symptomatic UTI, was reported by at least one trial in each of the three comparisons. The number of participants with pain was reported in the comparison of indwelling urethral versus suprapubic (comparison 1) and suprapubic versus intermittent urethral catheterisation (comparison 3). Ease of use was not reported in any of the included trials, although it is an important outcome for patients and healthcare providers. One trial comparing indwelling and intermittent urethral catheterisation reported quality of life, but did not report SDs so could not be included in meta-analysis and assessment of quality. None of the trials reported cost utility analysis, though some reports of costs were available.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of critical outcomes</HEADING>
<P>A previous Cochrane review reported the findings of a focus group aimed at identifying important outcomes for patients undergoing short-term urinary catheterisation (<LINK REF="REF-Omar-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omar 2013</LINK>). The outcomes were identified by clinicians, nurses, a health economist and patients who had experience with urethral catheterisation. The healthcare professionals identified:</P>
<UL>
<LI>symptomatic UTI with/without microbiological evidence;</LI>
<LI>patient discomfort whilst catheter is in situ;</LI>
<LI>bacterial resistance to the antimicrobial agent;</LI>
<LI>urinary sepsis.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The patients in the focus group identified infection and discomfort as critical outcomes for short-term urinary catheterisation. They also identified length of hospital stay and duration of catheterisation. Quality of life issues such as impact on self esteem and ability to wear clothes comfortably were also deemed important. Patients also had concerns about catheter insertion.</P>
<P>The five critical outcomes identified for this review were informed by and hence very similar to the ones identified by the focus group. Ease of use could impact positively or negatively on a patient&#8217;s experience of being catheterised, or the need to perform catheterisation themselves. If a patient or healthcare worker found one route of catheterisation more difficult to use than another, they might be less likely to want to use that route again.</P>
<P>An outcome not identified by the focus group was cost utility analysis; the patients in this focus group were unlikely to have identified cost as a primary concern as they were being treated in the NHS, which is free at the point of access. However, the cost implications of catheterisation and their outcomes need to be considered. In England, one episode of symptomatic UTI in a catheterised patient costs on average GBP 2291, in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Health-Committee-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Health Committee 2013</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Time span of included trials</HEADING>
<P>The age of the included trials should also be noted for this review. The oldest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wiser-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Wiser 1974</LINK>) was over 40 years old. The majority of the trials in this review were published in the 1990s (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmed-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmed 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barry-1992-PE" TYPE="STUDY">Barry 1992 PE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Botsios-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Botsios 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dobbs-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dobbs 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hammarsten-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hammarsten 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katz-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knight-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Knight 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nwabineli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nwabineli 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Kelly-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Kelly 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perrin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Perrin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piergiovanni-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Piergiovanni 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratnaval-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ratnaval 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skelly-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Skelly 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tangtrakul-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Tangtrakul 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vandoni-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Vandoni 1994</LINK>). Practice may have significantly changed since then, and the data from older trials may not be as relevant to current practice.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Definiton of UTI and asymptomatic bacteriuria</HEADING>
<P>The available evidence for symptomatic UTI was limited by the diagnostic definitions that were used. Of 24 trials that purported to be reporting symptomatic UTI, only seven trials were actually reporting it. We included an additional trial (<LINK REF="STD-Barry-1992-PE" TYPE="STUDY">Barry 1992 PE</LINK>) that reported UTI with no definition, and performed a sensitivity analysis with and without it. The definition of 'symptomatic UTI' was taken from the IDSA 2010 guideline on the prevention, treatment and management of catheter-associated UTI (<LINK REF="REF-Hooton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooton 2010</LINK>). This definition includes positive urine culture and, crucially, signs or symptoms of UTI. We reclassified the 16 trials that did not actually report symptomatic UTI as reporting asymptomatic bacteriuria, since only a positive urine culture was required to diagnose symptomatic UTI, with no mention of signs or symptoms.</P>
<P>Various guideline panels recommend diverse diagnostic criteria for symptomatic UTI. The criteria for a positive urine culture and time the catheter was in place are where some of the differences lie. Those conducting trials and other forms of research are left to select which definition to use, if they follow recommendations from guidelines at all. Two trials included in this review used a recommended definition of symptomatic UTI, taken from the CDC and IDSA guidelines (<LINK REF="STD-Kringel-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kringel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Millet-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Millet 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The EAU and IDSA both recommend that asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be screened for or treated in any patients during short-term catheterisation, as complications are very rare when patients are not treated (<LINK REF="REF-Grabe-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grabe 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hooton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooton 2010</LINK>). Patients with symptomatic UTI should be treated with antimicrobial therapy. Certain groups of patients may be more at risk of infection. For example, following TURP there is a higher rate of bacteraemia and sepsis compared to other surgery. About 60% of patients undergoing TURP with asymptomatic bacteriuria go on to develop bacteraemia. In these patients, between 6% and 10% have clinical signs of sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Nicolle-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolle 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is interesting to note that significantly more trials reported asymptomatic bacteriuria, the less clinically relevant condition in the majority of patients. The question must be asked why the majority of trials in this review reported the less clinically important outcome of asymptomatic bacteriuria, instead of symptomatic UTI.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment for at-risk patient groups</HEADING>
<P>Certain patient groups are at increased risk of complications of asymptomatic bacteriuria and should be screened and treated for it. These groups are:</P>

<LI>pregnant women;</LI>
<LI>patients undergoing urologic procedures in which visible mucosal bleeding is anticipated (e.g. TURP);</LI>
<LI>immunocompromised patients (<LINK REF="REF-EAU-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">EAU 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hooton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooton 2010</LINK>).</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials</HEADING>
<P>The Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials initiative (<LINK REF="REF-COMET" TYPE="REFERENCE">COMET</LINK>) aims to help co-ordinate information about core outcome sets. Core outcome sets comprise the minimum outcomes that should be measured and reported in all clinical trials, audits of practice and any other research for a specific condition. The development of a core outcome set for short-term urinary catheterisation would be beneficial for future trials and systematic reviews. This core outcome set should specify which outcomes should be reported and also how they should be measured. We would suggest that the five outcomes which we selected for the 'Summary of findings' tables, and which are important for decision making from patients' perspective, should be collected and reported in any future trials.</P>
<P>Future research into routes of catheterisation should report on the outcomes with no or limited usable evidence, using standardised definitions for symptomatic UTI and asymptomatic bacteriuria. Trials including men comparing suprapubic and intermittent urethral catheters are required.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>From the trials that we included which compared suprapubic catheterisation to indwelling urethral catheterisation, it would appear that there are many benefits to suprapubic catheterisation. The evidence suggests that fewer patients have pain with suprapubic catheters compared to indwelling, and the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria is reduced with suprapubic catheters. However, these trials have very limited, if any, reporting, on the complications associated with insertion of a suprapubic catheter. Suprapubic catheters have to be inserted under anaesthetic, unlike urethral catheterisation. As the majority of the trials included in this review studied surgical patients, this aspect of suprapubic catheterisation was not a primary concern. However, the insertion of a suprapubic catheter is associated with both intraoperative and postoperative complications. An audit of three NHS urology institutions found a suprapubic insertion intraoperative complication rate of 10%, with complications including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>anaesthetic-related complications;</LI>
<LI>inability to position patient correctly for catheter insertion;</LI>
<LI>bowel injury/perforation;</LI>
<LI>catheter malpositioning/expulsion (<LINK REF="REF-Ahluwalia-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahluwalia 2006</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>It is hard to know whether the trials included in our review comparing suprapubic catheterisation had any incidences of insertion complications, or whether these complications were simply not reported. The CDC recommends future research into the risks and benefits of suprapubic catheters as an alternative to urethral catheters, with a particular focus on complications related to catheter insertion or catheter site (<LINK REF="REF-Gould-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2009</LINK>). The EAU recommend that suprapubic and intermittent catheterisation is &#8220;preferable to indwelling in the appropriate patient&#8221;. This is a recommendation based on evidence from well-conducted clinical trials, though not RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Grabe-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grabe 2015</LINK>). Future trials should measure and report complications associated with catheter insertion.<BR/>

<P>For this review, we assessed methodological flaws of the included trials using the reports of the trials, which relied on the quality of reporting. Many of the trials had poor reporting, which led to 'Risk of bias' domains being assigned an unclear risk of bias. The domains that were affected by poor reporting in this review were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>random sequence generation;</LI>
<LI>allocation concealment;</LI>
<LI>blinding of other outcome assessment.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Many of the included trials failed to report our prespecified outcomes, which left limited evidence for the outcomes. As a result, many of the pooled results were not significant, with wide CIs.</P>
<P>Future trials should follow the CONSORT checklist, to allow trials to be assessed adequately for systematic reviews, but also so that readers can have confidence in the results that are being detailed.</P>
<P>Assessment of the quality of evidence followed the GRADE approach. The quality of evidence for the reported outcomes was low or very low. We downgraded quality of evidence by one or two levels for the following reasons:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Limitations in design and implementation, i.e. there was evidence of methodological flaws;</LI>
<LI>Indirectness of evidence, i.e. the population, intervention, comparator and outcome were not directly related to the outcome of interest;</LI>
<LI>Inconsistency of results,where there was unexplained statistical or clinical heterogeneity;</LI>
<LI>Imprecision of results, where the pooled effect crossed the line of no effect and the 95% CI was wide;</LI>
<LI>Publication bias. We used a funnel plot to assess publication bias.</LI>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-11-17 12:06:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched all the relevant databases, with no language restrictions, which allowed as many reports of trials as possible. We also included trial registries in this search, and contacted authors for further information about trials that were reported as completed. It is possible that not all eligible trials were included in the databases that we searched. For some of the older reports of trials there were limited usable data, and contacting their authors was challenging. To reduce the risk of bias, we used the methodology described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another potential source of bias may have been introduced when selecting GRADE outcomes to assess the quality of the evidence. It is possible that, as all the previously-included data from the original review were included, the review authors were influenced to pick the outcomes with the most available data. We minimised this risk of bias by looking at the results of a focus group that picked outcomes important to patients who had experience of urinary catheterisation. We also researched common problems affecting patients undergoing short-term urinary catheterisation.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-11-17 12:07:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found the following relevant reviews or guidelines:</P>
<UL>
<LI>An earlier Cochrane review comparing short-term urinary catheter policies restricted to people after urogenital surgery found insufficient evidence to favour indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheterisation to reduce the incidence of symptomatic UTI; this was similar to our review (<LINK REF="REF-Phipps-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phipps 2006</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The CDC 2009 guideline on catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) prevention also recommended that neither route of catheterisation appeared to be more effective than the other, although this was based on low quality of evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Gould-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 2009</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>The EAU 2015 evidence-based guideline on urological infection found that intermittent urethral catheterisation was associated with a decrease in the incidence of bacteriuria compared with indwelling urethral catheterisation. However, they could not make any recommendations for symptomatic UTI (<LINK REF="REF-Grabe-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grabe 2015</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>When comparing suprapubic catheterisation and intermittent urethral catheterisation for the reduction of symptomatic UTI, the IDSA guideline on CAUTI was also unable to make recommendation on which route was more effective (<LINK REF="REF-Hooton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooton 2010</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="REF-Healy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Healy 2012</LINK> is a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing suprapubic catheterisation with urethral (both indwelling and intermittent) catheterisation for short-term catheterisation following gynaecological surgery. It found that suprapubic catheterisation significantly decreased the incidence of UTI compared with urethral routes of catheterisation. However, this review defined UTI as both symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria. This may explain why they found a significant result, whereas our review found the evidence to be inconclusive.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Our updated review comparing routes of catheterisation for short-term use found that indwelling urethral catheterisation was associated with more pain than with suprapubic catheterisation. This result is similar to a systematic review conducted by <LINK REF="REF-McPhail-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McPhail 2006</LINK>, which found that patients with indwelling urethral catheters were more likely to have associated pain or discomfort than patients with suprapubic catheters. This is unsurprising, as all their included trials were included in our own review. However, the magnitude of effect in the McPhail review was smaller than ours, which is probably due to the fact our review includes more trials. Additionally, our review had pain and discomfort as separate outcomes, whereas <LINK REF="REF-McPhail-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McPhail 2006</LINK> combined them as one.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1: Indwelling urethral catheterisation vs suprapubic catheterisation</HEADING>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to determine which route of catheterisation reduced the risk of symptomatic UTI. Suprapubic catheterisation reduced the risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria compared to indwelling urethral catheterisation, although it is unclear if this is clinically meaningful. Fewer participants with a suprapubic catheter reported pain and discomfort, and were less likely to require recatheterisation. Ease of use, quality of life and cost utility analysis were not reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 2: Indwelling urethral catheterisation vs intermittent urethral catheterisation</HEADING>
<P>There was insufficient evidence for both symptomatic UTI and asymptomatic bacteriuria to draw conclusions for clinical practice. Indwelling urethral catheterisation had a reduced risk of acute urinary retention compared to intermittent urethral catheterisation. We could not assess the remaining outcomes such as pain, ease of use, quality of life and cost utility analysis because of lack of usable data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 3: Suprapubic catheterisation vs intermittent urethral catheterisation</HEADING>
<P>From the small number of trials available for this comparison, there was insufficient evidence for any of the outcomes. Symptomatic UTI and pain were reported in one trial, but no significant difference were identified between suprapubic and intermittent urethral group.</P>
<P>The evidence from this review failed to determine which route of catheterisation is most effective for reducing the incidence of catheter-associated symptomatic UTI. The evidence also failed to address key outcomes such as pain, ease of use, quality of life and cost utility analysis. Additionally, the majority of the trials did not report adverse events associated with suprapubic catheter insertion. There is currently insufficient evidence to support changes based on limited evidence with few statistically or clinically significant results.</P>

</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-12-01 16:35:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review found insufficient evidence to select a route of catheterisation to reduce symptomatic UTI.</P>
<P>We need more adequately-powered RCTs reporting the primary outcome of symptomatic UTI, using a standardised definition from the CDC, IDSA or EAU guidelines. Urine samples for symptomatic UTI should be collected based on clinical indications.</P>
<P>The trials included in this review reported a wide range of outcomes. To guide future trials on what outcomes to report, a core outcome set for short-term urinary catheterisation should be developed. This core outcome set should include outcomes important to patients, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders. We suggest that the following outcomes should be reported: symptomatic UTI, other adverse effects, pain during use, ease of use, quality of life and cost utility analysis using standardised measures.</P>
<P>As well as future trials reporting the most important outcomes appropriately, consideration should be given to which clinical scenarios actually require short-term urinary catheterisation. As can be seen from this review, there are many associated complications of urinary catheterisation, such as infection, discomfort, and urethral trauma. By safely reducing the number of patients who have a urinary catheter inserted, the number of patients affected by adverse events will decrease by default, as well as a reduction in the associated costs and resource implications for healthcare providers.</P>
<P>Future trials comparing suprapubic and intermittent urethral catheterisation for short-term use in hospitalised men should be conducted, as we found none when searching for this review. Trials including men under 40 years of age should also be conducted. The participant-centred outcomes of symptomatic UTI, ease of use, quality of life and cost utility analysis all require further evidence comparing any two of the three catheters. We need more evidence for pain in trials comparing indwelling urethral versus intermittent urethral, and suprapubic versus intermittent urethral catheterisation.</P>
<P>Future trials should be reported adequately, following the CONSORT statement. Trials presenting continuous data should report standard deviations.</P>
