<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-07-28 13:51:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Hafis Ibrahim">
<P>It is unclear whether giving steroids to premature newborn babies who have hypotension (low blood pressure) is safe and effective. Low blood pressure is a relatively common problem in premature newborn babies and has been linked with serious short and long term problems including death and neurodisability. Various treatments are used to support the circulation and boost blood pressure. One such treatment is the use of steroid drugs. This review found four small studies that evaluated the effect of steroids on low blood pressure in premature infants. At present, there is insufficient information on which to base recommendations about the value of giving steroids to babies born before term who have low blood pressure.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-11-01 11:12:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Hafis Ibrahim">
<P>Randomized or quasi-randomised controlled trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 2, 2011), MEDLINE (1996 to Jan 2011), EMBASE (1974 to Jan 2011), CINAHL (1981 to 2011), reference lists of published papers and abstracts from the Pediatric Academic Societies and the European Society for Pediatric Research meetings published in Pediatric Research (1995 to 2011).</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials investigating the effect of corticosteroid therapy in the treatment of hypotension in preterm infants (&lt; 37 weeks gestation) less than 28 days old. Studies using corticosteroids as primary treatment were included as well as studies using corticosteroids in babies with hypotension resistant to inotropes/pressors and volume therapy.

<P>Methodological quality of eligible studies was assessed according to the methods used for minimising selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias and detection bias. Studies that evaluated corticosteroids (1) as primary treatment for hypotension or (2) for refractory hypotension unresponsive to prior use of inotropes/pressors and volume therapy, were analysed using separate comparisons. Data were analysed using the standard methods of the Neonatal Review Group using Rev Man 5.1.2. Treatment effect was analysed using relative risk, risk reduction, number needed to treat for categorical outcomes and weighted mean difference for outcomes measured on a continuous scale, with 95% confidence intervals.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-10-10 15:11:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four studies were included in this review enrolling a total of 123 babies. In one study, persistent hypotension was more common in hydrocortisone treated infants as compared to those who received dopamine as primary treatment for hypotension (RR 8.2, 95% CI 0.47 to 142.6; RD 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.37). In two studies comparing steroid versus placebo, persistent hypotension (defined as a continuing need for inotrope infusion) was less common in steroid treated infants as compared to controls who received placebo for refractory hypotension (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.65; RD -0.47, 95% CI - 0.68 to - 0.26; NNT = 2.1, 95% CI 1.47, 3.8).

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-11-01 11:31:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Hafis Ibrahim">
<P>Hydrocortisone may be as effective as dopamine when used as a primary treatment for hypotension. But the long term safety data on the use of hydrocortisone in this manner is unknown.Steroids are effective in treatment of refractory hypotension in preterm infants without an increase in short term adverse consequences. However, long term safety or benefit data is lacking. With long term benefit or safety data lacking steroids cannot be recommended routinely for the treatment of hypotension in preterm infants.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-01 11:33:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Hafis Ibrahim">
<P>Systemic hypotension is a relatively common complication of prematurity, affecting approximately one-third of very low birth weight infants. It is associated with an increased risk of intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular white matter injury and adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Miall_x002d_Allen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miall-Allen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martens-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martens 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuint-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuint 2009</LINK>). Current treatment of hypotension in the premature infant includes the use of volume expansion, inotropes and vasopressor agents. Corticosteroids are generally reserved for infants with refractory hypotension.</P>
<P>There is no widely accepted definition of hypotension, or appropriate organ perfusion pressure in the preterm infant. Hypotension is often defined in terms of a mean blood pressure (BP) below the 5th or 10th centile of a birth weight and age-specific reference range created from a sample of stable, 'healthy' preterm neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1999</LINK>). A frequently used alternative 'rule of thumb' defines hypotension as mean BP below the gestation (in completed weeks) of an infant, although the origin of this definition is unclear. In other neonatal units, mean BP below 30 mm Hg would be considered sub-optimal (<LINK REF="REF-Miall_x002d_Allen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miall-Allen 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Blood pressure is the product of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. The majority of hypotensive preterm babies have normal or high cardiac output, suggesting that in these circumstances hypotension is the result of low systemic vascular resistance due to either a haemodynamically significant ductal shunt or abnormal regulation of vasomotor tone (<LINK REF="REF-Kluckow-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluckow 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pladys-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pladys 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several lines of evidence support a role for corticosteroids in the treatment of hypotension in preterm infants. Relative or absolute adrenocortical insufficiency is increasingly recognised as a cause of hypotension in the preterm infant (<LINK REF="REF-Watterberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watterberg 2002</LINK>). Sick preterm infants have lower cord blood cortisol concentrations and a limited ability to increase cortisol production in response to stressful conditions. Cortisol concentrations are inversely related to gestational age and are particularly low in hypotensive infants receiving inotropic support (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Glucocorticoids increase beta-adrenergic receptor expression in the cardiovascular system, increase responsiveness to circulating catecholamines and may, therefore, increase vascular tone and/or myocardial contractility (<LINK REF="REF-Sasidharan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sasidharan 1998</LINK>). Exposure to antenatal corticosteroids is associated with a reduction in the need for blood pressure support in extremely low birth weight infants (<LINK REF="REF-Moise-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moise 1995</LINK>). There are also several reports from uncontrolled case series supporting the efficacy of postnatal corticosteroids for pressor-resistant hypotension (<LINK REF="STD-Seri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Seri 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, a direct toxic effect of corticosteroids on the developing central nervous system is of particular concern. Current evidence suggests that early postnatal corticosteroid treatment for prevention of preterm chronic lung disease may be associated with an increase in neurodevelopmental impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Halliday-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halliday 2010</LINK>). Other potential adverse effects include increased rate of sepsis (mainly fungal), growth failure, gastrointestinal haemorrhage/perforation and hyperglycaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Sasidharan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sasidharan 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<B>Primary:</B>
<BR/>In preterm infants with hypotension, does the use of corticosteroids (1) as primary treatment or (2) for refractory hypotension, raise blood pressure and reduce mortality and morbidity?</P>

<BR/>Are there any other adverse effects or benefits to the preterm infant when corticosteroids are used to treat preterm hypotension? Are there certain sub-groups of infants in whom corticosteroid therapy for hypotension is particularly effective or harmful?</P>

Details of these studies are given in the table 'Characteristics of included studies'.</P>
<P>1. <LINK REF="STD-Bourchier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bourchier 1997</LINK>
<BR/>This single centre, randomised trial of 40 infants investigated the effectiveness of hydrocortisone versus dopamine in the primary treatment of hypotension. Hypotension was defined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of less than 25 mmHg (for babies with a birth weight of 500 to 749 g), less than 30 mmHg (babies with a birth weight of 750 to 999 g), less than 35 mmHg (babies with a birth weight of 1000 to 1499 g) on two occasions, 30 minutes apart. The method of blood pressure measurement was not specified. The intervention groups were given hydrocortisone (2.5 mg/kg, four - six hourly for 48 hours, followed by 1.25 mg/kg six hourly for 48 hours, and then 0.625 mg/kg for a further 48 hours before stopping treatment) or dopamine (5 to 20 micrograms/kg/minute). Concurrent treatment with volume expansion was permitted in both groups. Approximately one-third of the babies had been exposed to antenatal steroids and all had received prior treatment with a volume expander. Babies with a clinically significant patent ductus arteriosus were excluded.<BR/>
<BR/>Twenty-one babies received hydrocortisone and 19 received dopamine. The primary outcome measure was persisting hypotension despite treatment; other outcomes included survival and a range of neonatal complications (e.g. sepsis, intraventricular haemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia). Baseline plasma cortisol levels, their relationship with BP response and change with hydrocortisone/dopamine therapy were also examined.</P>
<P>2. <LINK REF="STD-Gaissmaier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gaissmaier 1999</LINK>
<BR/>This small study of 17 infants assessed the effectiveness of dexamethasone given to preterm infants with refractory hypotension. The design was a single centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial. Babies who remained hypotensive despite treatment with volume expansion and dopamine (maximum dose 15 micrograms/kg/minute) were eligible. Babies who had been treated postnatally with glucocorticoids for longer than three days with a maximum equivalent dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day, and the last dose administered within seven days of study enrolment were excluded. Approximately 70% of babies had been exposed to antenatal steroids. Babies with a patent ductus arteriosus were not excluded. Hypotension was defined by identifying an 'individual minimum blood pressure' for each baby. This was determined by a complex algorithm including urine output, capillary filling time and target MAP ranges [MAP &lt; 23 mmHg (babies with a birth weight &lt; 750 g), MAP &lt; 25 mmHg (babies with a birth weight 750 to 999 g), MAP &lt; 28 to 30 mmHg (babies with a birth weight 1000 to 2000 g), MAP &lt; 35 mmHg (babies with a birth weight 2000 to 3000 g) and MAP &lt; 40 mmHg (babies with a birth weight &gt; 3000 g)]. Blood pressure was measured invasively using radial or umbilical arterial catheters. Infants received a single intravenous dose of dexamethasone 0.25 mg/kg or placebo (same volume of normal saline solution) concurrently with the start of the epinephrine infusion. The intervention compared, therefore, was epinephrine plus dexamethasone versus epinephrine plus placebo. Concurrent treatment with volume expansion was permitted.</P>
<P>Eight babies were randomised to receive dexamethasone and nine received placebo. The primary outcome was the duration of epinephrine therapy after administration of dexamethasone or placebo, and the end-point of the study was 12 hours after drug administration. Management of hypotension in general, and epinephrine therapy in particular, was standardised and protocol-based.</P>
<P>3. <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2006</LINK>
</P>
<P>This was a single centre trial of 48 infants assessing the efficacy of hydrocortisone in preterm infants with refractory hypotension in the first week of life. The design was a single centre double blinded, placebo controlled randomised trial. Infants less than 32 weeks gestation, with a birth weight of less than 1500 g with systemic hypotension refractory to volume expansion with isotonic saline up to 30ml/kg and dopamine infusion of &gt;10 micrograms/kg/min within the first seven days of life were eligible. Infants with major lethal congenital or chromosomal anomalies, congenital heart defects , postnatal use of inhaled or systemic steroids prior to trial drug initiation, proven systemic infection, necrotising enterocolitis or having major surgery were excluded. The authors mention that most of the mothers received antenatal steroids (though the number has not been specified) and the cumulative dose of antenatal dexamethasone was similar in both groups. Hypotension was defined as MAP lower than the numerical value of the gestational age of the infant in completed weeks. Blood pressure was measured invasively through an indwelling arterial line. Hypotensive infants were treated initially with up to three fluid boluses of 10 ml/kg of isotonic saline. Hypotension unresponsive to volume expansion was treated with dopamine up to 20 microgram/kg/min, dobutamine up to 20 microgram/kg/min and epinephrine starting at 0.2 microgram/kg/min. The trial drug consisted of hydrocortisone given at a dose of 1mg/kg/dose every eight hours for five days. </P>
<P>Twenty four infants received hydrocortisone and 24 received placebo. The primary outcome was the weaning off vasopressor support within 72 hours of commencing the trial drug. Other outcomes studied included cumulative dose of volume expanders and vasopressors within the first 14 days of life and also serious short and medium term side effects of corticosteroids including hyperglycaemia, gastrointestinal complications and systemic infections.</P>

<P>This was a small pilot trial published only in abstract form. Further data on trial methodology and outcomes were obtained through correspondence with the main author. Only published data was included in the final analysis.The design was a single centre double blinded, placebo controlled randomised trial. The study reported on outcomes of 18 infants randomised to receive either hydrocortisone or placebo with hypotension non-responsive to one crystalloid bolus of 10ml/kg. Infants less than 28 weeks and below 1250 g in birthweight within the first 48 hours after birth were included. The exclusion criteria were major congenital abnormalities, congenital heart defects excluding PDA, proven systemic infection, necrotising enterocolitis, major surgery . Hypotension was defined as MAP lower than the numerical value of the gestational age of the infant in completed weeks. In infants with hypotension refractory to one fluid bolus,dopamine was commenced at 5 microgram/kg/min concurrently with the study drug going up to a maximum of 15 micrograms/kg/min. The study, therefore, compared the effects of hydrocortisone plus dopamine to placebo plus dopamine. The use of epinephrine starting at a dose of 0.2 micrograms/kg/min was permitted in refractory hypotension. Hydrocortisone was commenced at 2 mg/kg for the first dose followed by three six hourly doses of 1 mg/kg and a further four doses of 0.5 mg/kg giving a cumulative dose of 7 mg/kg in 48 hours.</P>
<P>Nine infants each received hydrocortisone and placebo. The primary outcome was the total cumulative dose of dopamine at 48 hours of study drug administration and by day seven of life. The secondary outcome was the total cumulative dose of epinephrine and total dose of fluids at 48 hours of study drug administration and by day seven of life. Other outcomes studied included the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, incidence of PDA and proportion of PDA requiring ligation, IVHs grade 3 and 4, incidence of PVL, incidence of NEC and proportion of NEC requiring surgery, NEC with perforation, positive blood cultures and survival to discharge.</P>

<B>1. Minimisation of selection bias</B>
</U>
<BR/>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bourchier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bourchier 1997</LINK>, allocation concealment was performed using a method of sealed envelopes containing a numerical code generated from a random number table. In the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hochwald-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hochwald 2010</LINK> allocation concealment was performed similarly using sealed envelopes, but the codes being computer generated. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Gaissmaier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gaissmaier 1999</LINK> also randomised infants, but the process of allocation concealment was not stated explicitly and was, therefore, classified as 'unclear'.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
<U>2. Minimisation of performance bias</U>
</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Bourchier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bourchier 1997</LINK> did not attempt to mask caregivers with respect to the assigned treatment that an infant received. The two treatments were both administered intravenously, but dopamine was given as a continuous infusion and infants allocated to receive hydrocortisone were given intermittent bolus injections every four to six hours. The assignment group would, therefore, have been clear to the attending caregivers. The only way of effectively blinding caregivers would have been to give every study participant both a continuous infusion and an intermittent bolus injection, one of which would have been real and the other a placebo (a 'double-dummy' strategy).</P>
<P>In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Gaissmaier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gaissmaier 1999</LINK> used a placebo control (isotonic saline solution) to mask caregivers to the group assignment. Ampoules of dexamethasone, or a corresponding volume of the placebo solution, were prepared by hospital pharmacy staff not directly involved in routine clinical management. <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hochwald-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hochwald 2010</LINK> used a similar sytem of using isotonic saline as placebo.

<LINK REF="STD-Bourchier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bourchier 1997</LINK> assessed all randomised infants for the primary outcome and secondary outcomes included in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Gaissmaier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gaissmaier 1999</LINK> randomised 20 infants, but three 'were later excluded from the analysis'. The reasons for exclusion were not stated. Two more infants were subsequently randomised, one of whom was again excluded because of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (not a stated exclusion criterion). The authors report outcomes for 17 babies, leaving one further baby unaccounted for. Clearly, an intention-to-treat analysis was not performed in this study. <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2006</LINK> assessed all 48 of the randomised infants for primary outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Hochwald-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hochwald 2010</LINK> reported the findings on all 18 randomised infants for the primary outcome and other clinical outcomes.</P>

<U>
<B>4. Minimisation of detection bias</B>
</U>
<BR/>In none of the included studies, the method of masking for outcome assessors is not explicitly stated. Nevertheless, since the primary outcome was a short term outcome (that would have been assessed while the infant was still receiving the assigned treatment), one may assume that the outcome assessment was performed in a blinded manner in the <LINK REF="STD-Gaissmaier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gaissmaier 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hochwald-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hochwald 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2006</LINK> studies, but not in the study performed by <LINK REF="STD-Bourchier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bourchier 1997</LINK>. Secondary outcomes would also have been assessed 'blind' in the <LINK REF="STD-Gaissmaier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gaissmaier 1999</LINK> study, since the assigned treatment was masked until study completion. It remains unclear whether any attempt was made to minimise detection bias in the assessment of secondary outcomes in the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Bourchier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bourchier 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hochwald-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hochwald 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2006</LINK> .</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-11-01 12:06:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found four small studies that met our inclusion criteria for this review, with a further two studies that have only been published in abstract form to date, but may be eligible for inclusion in future updates. Two studies addressed the efficacy of corticosteroids as primary treatment in preterm hypotension. We were, unable to perform a meta-analysis on the data on the efficacy of corticosteroids when used as primary treatment for hypotension as one compared hydrocortisone to dopamine whereas the other compared hydrocortisone to placebo. Two studies examined the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of refractory preterm hypotension. Two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bourchier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bourchier 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaissmaier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gaissmaier 1999</LINK>) contained deficiencies in methodological quality, but these were not considered to be significant enough to exclude them from inclusion in this review.</P>
<P>
<U>
<B>1. Corticosteroids for primary treatment of hypotension</B>
</U>
<BR/>Hydrocortisone may not be as effective as dopamine as primary treatment in preterm hypotension. There was no evidence that treatment with hydrocortisone was associated with an effect (either beneficial or detrimental) on other neonatal morbidities or on neonatal mortality in either of the included studies which looked at hydrocortisone as a primary treatment for preterm hypotension. It is important to emphasise that only one-third of babies in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bourchier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bourchier 1997</LINK> had been exposed to antenatal steroids and such data was not available in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Hochwald-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hochwald 2010</LINK>. Since the use of antenatal steroids is associated with a decreased need for BP support in extremely low birth weight infants (perhaps through increasing neonatal circulating steroid concentrations), it could be argued that hydrocortisone therapy may be less effective in treating hypotension in preterm babies who have already been exposed to antenatal steroids.There was no evidence of a statistically significant effect of hydrocortisone on potential adverse effects of steroid therapy such as infection or hyperglycaemia. The effect of hydrocortisone compared to dopamine with respect to long term neurodevelopmental outcome remains unknown.</P>
<P>
<U>
<B>2. Corticosteroids for treatment of refractory hypotension</B>
</U>
<BR/>Corticosteroid therapy for preterm infants with hypotension refractory to volume expansion and dopamine treatment, is associated with a statistically significant reduction in persisting hypotension (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). This benefit was demonstrated as a decrease in the continuing need for inotrope infusion in the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Gaissmaier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gaissmaier 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2006</LINK>. The size of the observed effect (NNT, number needed to treat = 2) means that approximately two babies with refractory hypotension would have to be treated to enable cessation of inotrope therapy later in one baby.There was no evidence of a statistically significant beneficial effect of steroid therapy on short or medium term neonatal morbidity or mortality. Reassuringly, there was no evidence of a statistically significant effect of corticosteroids on potential adverse effects of steroid therapy such as infection,gastric bleeding or gastrointestinal perforation. However, the effect of corticosteroids especially dexamethasone on long term neurodevelopmental outcome remains unknown.</P>
<P>
<U>
<B>3. Limitations of the results of this review</B>
</U>
<BR/>The results of this review must be interpreted with caution. Only four studies were identified for inclusion enrolling a total of 123 babies. Given the small individual study sizes, there is substantial uncertainty (wide confidence intervals) around estimates of treatment effect. Therefore, even a relatively large, potentially clinically significant effect cannot reliably be excluded on the basis of these studies.</P>
<P>The studies used different definitions of hypotension, with only two recent studies using the same definition of blood pressure below the numerical value of gestation in weeks. The method of blood pressure measurement in the <LINK REF="STD-Bourchier-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bourchier 1997</LINK> study was not clear. All the studies concentrated only on relatively short-term effects such as successful treatment of hypotension, but the issue of long term safety and effectiveness was not addressed. None of the studies attempted to investigate changes in the wider range of haemodynamic parameters such as cardiac output, cardiac contractility or systemic vascular resistance and hence provided no information on the mechanism of action of steroids in increasing BP. Similarly, none of the studies provides information about any particular subgroups of patients who may benefit more from steroid therapy rather than continued 'conventional' treatment strategies.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-07-28 14:23:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Hafis Ibrahim">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-07-28 14:23:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Hafis Ibrahim">
<P>1. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of hydrocortisone in the primary treatment of hypotension. Other corticosteroids have not been studied in randomised trials. There are insufficient data from randomised trials regarding the safety of steroids used for this indication.</P>
<P>2. Corticosteroids including dexamethasone and hydrocortisone may be effective in treating preterm infants with refractory hypotension receiving inotropes. Steroids seem to be safe in the short term when used for this indication. However given the lack of data on long term safety (and the concerns about the association between early post-natal dexamethasone use and subsequent cerebral palsy), neither dexamethasone nor hydrocortisone can be recommended for routine use in preterm hypotension.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A number of research questions need to be addressed including the following:</P>
<P>1. What is the relationship between preterm hypotension, cerebral blood flow, neurological injury in the neonatal period and long term neurodevelopmental outcome? What is the underlying pathophysiology? What other factors influence this relationship?</P>
<P>2. What is the relationship between adrenocortical function, cortisol levels and the development of hypotension in preterm infants? Are there particular groups of babies who may respond better to early steroid therapy?</P>
<P>3. Is there an identifiable threshold level of BP at which cardiovascular support (including steroid therapy) should be initiated? </P>
<P>4. Which agents (and at what doses and by which routes) are the most effective steroids for treating preterm hypotension? Are some drugs preferable to others in certain conditions (e.g. sepsis, lack of previous exposure to antenatal steroids etc.)? </P>
<P>5. What are the short and long term effects of steroid therapy? Do any long term benefits outweigh the potential long term risks of therapy?</P>
<P>6. Is prophylactic therapy with steroids safer and more effective than treatment of 'established' or refractory hypotension?</P>
