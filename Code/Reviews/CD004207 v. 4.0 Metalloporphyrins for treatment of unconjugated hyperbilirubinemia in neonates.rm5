<P>Metalloporphyrins may reduce very high levels of jaundice in newborn babies, but more research is required on safety and to compare it with other treatments. Jaundice is very common in newborn babies, and is caused by the liver producing too much bilirubin, a yellow-coloured bile substance. A very high level of bilirubin can damage the developing brain, and is treated with phototherapy (light therapy) or exchange transfusions. Metalloporphyrins are drugs that can prevent the formation of bilirubin, but they might also cause photosensitivity (sensitivity to light) and anaemia (decreased hemoglobin levels in the blood). The review of trials found some evidence that metalloporphyrins might be able to reduce bilirubin, but more research is needed on short and long-term effects and to compare it with other treatments.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Metalloporphyrins are heme analogues that inhibit heme oxygenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of heme to bilirubin. By preventing the formation of bilirubin, they have the potential to reduce the level of unconjugated bilirubin in neonates and thereby reduce the risk of neonatal encephalopathy and long term neurodevelopmental impairment from bilirubin toxicity to the nervous system. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>1. To determine the efficacy of metalloporphyrins in reducing bilirubin levels, reducing the need for phototherapy or exchange transfusion and reducing the incidence of bilirubin encephalopathy in neonates with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia when compared to placebo, phototherapy or exchange transfusion.</P>
<P>2. To determine the nature and frequency of side effects of metalloporphyrins when used to treat unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in neonates. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched Medline (1966 - January 2003) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) from the Cochrane Library (2003, issue 1). We hand-searched the articles cited in each publication obtained. We hand searched the abstracts of the Society for Pediatric Research (USA) (published in Pediatric Research) for the years 1985 - 2002.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included only randomized controlled studies, in which preterm or term neonates (age 28 days of life or less) with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to any cause were randomly allocated to receive a metalloporphyrin in the treatment arm(s), and to receive a placebo or a conventional treatment (phototherapy or exchange transfusion) or no treatment for hyperbilirubinemia in the comparison arm(s). Any preparation of metalloporphyrin could be used, in any form, by any route, at any dose. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors extracted data independently. Data were entered into Revman by one author and checked by a second author. Prespecified subgroup analyses were planned in term versus preterm infants, hemolytic versus non-hemolytic causes of jaundice and according to the type of metalloporphyrin used. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three small studies, enrolling a total of 170 infants, were eligible for inclusion in this review. None blinded intervention or outcome assessment. In all three studies some patients were excluded after randomization. Metalloporphyrin-treated infants appeared to have short-term benefits compared to controls, including a lower maximum plasma bilirubin level in one study, a lower frequency of severe hyperbilirubinemia in one study, a decreased need for phototherapy, fewer plasma bilirubin measurements and a shorter duration of hospitalization. None of the enrolled infants required an exchange transfusion in the two studies that described this outcome. None of the studies reported on neonatal kernicterus, death, long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes or iron deficiency anemia. Though a small number of metalloporphyrin-treated as well as control infants developed a photosensitivity rash, the trials were too small to rule out an increase in the risk of photosensitivity or other adverse effects from metalloporphyrin treatment. No subgroup analyses were possible due to the small number of included trials. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with metalloporphyrins may reduce neonatal bilirubin levels and decrease the need for phototherapy and hospitalization. There is no evidence to support or refute the possibility that treatment with a metalloporphyrin decreases the risk of neonatal kernicterus or of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment due to bilirubin encephalopathy. There is no evidence to support or refute the possibility that cutaneous photosensitivity is increased with metalloporphyrin treatment. Routine treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with a metalloporphyrin cannot be recommended at present. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-30 10:03:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a common problem in the neonatal period, occurring in 30-50% of term newborns (<LINK REF="REF-Kivlahan-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kivlahan 1984</LINK>). It is the most common cause of readmissions to the hospital after early hospital discharge of term neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Catz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catz 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Brown-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1998</LINK>). It is more common in preterm infants than in term infants, mainly because of a delay in the expression of hepatic glucuronyl transferase, the enzyme that conjugates bilirubin (<LINK REF="REF-Gartner-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartner 1994</LINK>). There are many pathologic conditions leading to an elevated unconjugated bilirubin level in neonates and these can be broadly grouped into hemolytic and non-hemolytic conditions. Under certain circumstances unconjugated bilirubin can be toxic to the central nervous system, resulting in encephalopathy and neurologic impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Gourley-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gourley 1997</LINK>). Factors influencing bilirubin toxicity to the brain cells of newborn infants are complex and incompletely understood; they include those that affect the serum albumin concentration and those that affect the binding of bilirubin to albumin, the penetration of bilirubin into the brain, and the vulnerability of brain cells to the toxic effects of bilirubin. It is not known at what bilirubin concentration or under what circumstances significant risk of brain damage occurs or when the risk of damage exceeds the risk of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1994</LINK>). Currently the standard therapies for hyperbilirubinemia include phototherapy and exchange transfusion. These therapies aim to reduce high levels of unconjugated bilirubin or prevent the development of such high levels, and are usually instituted at different levels of bilirubin in different categories of infants, based on the recommendations of experts (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gartner-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartner 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>In recent years, various metalloporphyrins have become available that show potential for the prevention and treatment of hyperbilirubinemia. They act by competitively inhibiting the enzyme microsomal heme oxygenase, the rate limiting enzyme in the catabolism of heme to bilirubin. In this manner, metalloporphyrins decrease the production of bilirubin, in contrast to all other current methods of therapy for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which act by increasing the excretion of bilirubin after it is formed. Metalloporphyrins are natural or synthetic heme analogues comprised of a porphyrin moiety such as a deuteroporphryin, protoporphyrin, mesoporphyrin or a bisglycol derivate and a metal moiety such as tin, zinc, chromium, manganese, copper, nickel or magnesium (<LINK REF="REF-Stevenson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevenson 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Vreman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vreman 2001</LINK>). Based on these structural differences, several varieties of metalloporphyrins have been described, such as zinc protoporphyrin, zinc mesoporphyrin, tin protoporphyrin and tin mesoporphyrin. Various metalloporphyrins have been reported to decrease naturally occurring or experimentally induced hyperbilirubinemia in animals and in humans ( <LINK REF="REF-Cornelius-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornelius 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Chernick-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chernick 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Drummond-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drummond 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Galbraith-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galbraith 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kappas-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kappas 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Labbe-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labbe 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Valaes-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Valaes 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Valaes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Valaes 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Vallier-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallier 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Vreman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vreman 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Heme oxygenase is present not only in the liver but also in the spleen, brain, testis and kidney. Therefore it is important to consider potential effects on the functioning of these other organs when using metalloporphyrin therapy. Bilirubin is reported to be a naturally occurring antioxidant in the human body (<LINK REF="REF-McDonagh-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonagh 1990</LINK>) and decreasing its production in a neonate by using metalloporphyrin therapy can theoretically expose the infant to tissue damage from free oxygen radicals. Adverse effects of metalloporphyrins reported in human studies include photosensitivity causing cutaneous erythema (<LINK REF="STD-Valaes-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Valaes 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Galbraith-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galbraith 1992</LINK>) and, on prolonged administration, anemia due to the decreased uptake of iron from the intestine consequent to inhibition of intestinal heme oxygenase (<LINK REF="REF-Galbraith-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galbraith 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>In clinical trials metalloporphyrins have been used for the prevention as well as the treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The use of metalloporphyrins for the prevention of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia will be discussed in a separate systematic review. In this systematic review we aimed to evaluate and summarize the evidence on the use of metalloporphyrins for treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in neonates (infants aged 28 days or less). Treatment with a metalloporphyrin is defined as its use in neonates who have already developed a moderate or high level of serum bilirubin.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>See: Collaborative Review Group search strategy. We used the standard search method of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group</P>
<P>1. Published manuscripts: We searched Medline (1966 - January 2003) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) from the Cochrane Library (2003, issue 1). We did not limit the search to any language. We used the following search terms: {metalloporphyrin OR protoporphyrin OR mesoporphyrin}, limited to humans and further limited to the age group of newborn infants (infant, newborn). From the resulting studies we manually extracted randomized controlled studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria mentioned above. To identify long term neurodevelopmental sequelae, we performed a search using the following keywords: (outcome OR sequelae OR follow-up OR mental retardation OR cerebral palsy OR hearing OR visual OR motor OR mental OR psychological ) AND (metalloporphyrin OR protoporphyrin OR mesoporphyrin) not limited to any age group or language. We also searched the list of articles cited in each publication obtained, in order to identify additional relevant articles.</P>
<P>2. Published abstracts: We hand searched the abstracts of the Society for Pediatric Research (USA) (published in Pediatric Research) for the years 1985 - 2002. For this purpose we used the following key words: {metalloporphyrin OR protoporphyrin OR mesoporphyrin} AND {jaundice or hyperbilirubinemia}. For abstract books that did not include keywords we limited the search to relevant sections such as hematology, gastrointestinal disorders and neonatology. </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We used the standard method for the Cochrane Collaboration which is described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook.</P>
<P>Selection process: We included randomized controlled trials fulfilling the selection criteria described in the previous section. Two investigators separately selected the studies for inclusion. They resolved any disagreement by discussion. </P>
<P>Criteria for assessing the methodological quality of the studies: We used the standard method of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We assessed the methodological quality of the studies by assessing the risk for four types of bias (selection, performance, attrition and detection). Two reviewers separately assessed each study. They resolved any disagreement by discussion. </P>
<P>Data extraction and entry: Two investigators extracted, assessed and coded separately all data for each study, using a form that was designed specifically for this review. We replaced any standard error of the mean by the corresponding standard deviation. We resolved any disagreement by discussion. For each study, final data were entered into RevMan by one reviewer (GKS) and then checked by a second reviewer (CM). </P>
<P>Statistical analysis: We used the standard method of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, using a fixed effect model. In assessing the treatment effects for dichotomous outcomes we used the relative risk and risk difference, with 95% confidence intervals. For outcomes measured on a continuous scale we used the weighted mean difference, with 95% confidence intervals. </P>
<P>Planned subgroup analyses: We intended to perform analyses in subgroups of term versus preterm (&lt;37 completed weeks of gestation) infants, hemolytic versus non-hemolytic causes of hyperbilirubinemia and type of metalloporphyrin used. </P>

<P>We identified seven studies on metalloporphyrin use in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. We excluded four of them from this review. We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Valaes-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Valaes 1994</LINK> because these randomized trials tested the preventive use of a metalloporphyrin. We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 2001</LINK> because it used historical controls for comparison with metalloporphyrin-treated infants. We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Valaes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Valaes 1998</LINK> because it compared two different strategies of using a metalloporphyrin (preventive versus therapeutic use). We included three randomized trials in which a metalloporphyrin was used to treat neonates with moderate to high levels of plasma bilirubin (<LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1999</LINK>). Two of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995b</LINK>) were reported in a single publication. Details of these studies are provided in the Table of included studies. All three compared tin mesoporphyrin in a single intramuscular dose of six micromoles per kilogram body weight to phototherapy. In two studies all controls received phototherapy and in one controls received phototherapy if the plasma bilirubin rose above pre-defined levels. In all three studies metalloporphyrin treated patients could receive phototherapy if the plasma bilirubin rose above pre-defined levels.</P>
<P>Participants<BR/>All three studies were single center studies. In the three studies combined, a total of 84 infants were treated with metalloporphyrin and there were 86 controls. The studies by <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995b</LINK> were conducted in Greece and the study by <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1999</LINK> was conducted in Argentina. <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1999</LINK> studied healthy term neonates. <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995a</LINK> included only male neonates aged 36 - 84 hours who were breast and formula fed. In this study 22 neonates received tin mesoporphyrin and there were 22 controls. <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995b</LINK> included male and female neonates with a gestation of 245 - 265 days (35 weeks to 37 weeks, 6 days) who were 36 - 96 hours of age. In this study 22 neonates received tin mesoporphyrin and there were 20 controls. Neonates in <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1999</LINK> were of both sexes, fully breast fed and 48 - 96 hours of age. In this study 40 neonates received tin mesoporphyrin and there were 44 controls. All three studies excluded neonates with congenital anomalies, congenital infection and birth asphyxia. Additional exclusion criteria used by <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995b</LINK> were admission to the neonatal intensive care unit and G6PD deficiency. <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995a</LINK> excluded neonates with Coombs positive hemolytic disease whereas <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995b</LINK> permitted the inclusion of neonates with ABO incompatibility. <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1999</LINK> excluded, in addition to neonates with the three conditions mentioned above, neonates with complications such as respiratory distress syndrome, birth weight less than 10th percentile or greater than the 90th percentile, maternal phenobarbitone therapy, venous hematocrit &gt; 65%, significant bruising, large cephalhematoma, hemolytic disease (rhesus or ABO incompatibility and a positive Coombs test or a serum bilirubin rising by greater than 0.5 mg/dl per hour.</P>
<P>Plasma bilirubin criteria<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995b</LINK> included neonates who had a baseline plasma bilirubin value within a defined range on a chart depicting time on the X axis and bilirubin levels on the Y axis. The upper and lower limits of this range rose progressively between 36-84 hours and were approximately 7 - 10 mg/dl at 36 hours of life, 11 - 15 mg/dl at 60 hours of life and 14 - 20 mg/dl at 84 hours of life. Neonates with the onset of jaundice &lt; 36 hours and those with a plasma bilirubin above the defined range were excluded. <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1999</LINK> included neonates who had a plasma bilirubin of 15 - 18 mg/dl 48 - 96 hours after birth.</P>
<P>Interventions<BR/>The experimental intervention in all three trials was tin mesporphyrin in a single dose of six micromoles per kilogram body weight, given intramuscularly. None of the trials used a placebo in the control group. In <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995b</LINK>, all neonates in the control group received phototherapy per study protocol and there was no statistical difference between experimental and control neonates in the mean age at enrollment or in the mean plasma bilirubin at enrollment. In <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1999</LINK>, phototherapy was initiated in both intervention and control neonates if the plasma bilirubin rose to 19.5 mg/dl or higher.</P>
<P>Outcomes<BR/>The following outcomes were reported in one or more of the three studies: maximum plasma bilirubin level attained, severe hyperbilirubinemia (Defined by Kappas 1995 as bilirubin &gt; 23 mg/dl after 84 hours age or above predefined level on bilirubin chart at 36 - 84 hours and by <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1999</LINK> as bilirubin above 19.5 mg/dl after 48 hours of life), phototherapy, number of plasma bilirubin measurements, exchange transfusion, jaundice-related hospitalization past day 4 of life, cutaneous erythema or photosensitivity, local reactions at the site of intramuscular injection and abnormal liver function tests. None of the three studies described the presence or absence of the following outcomes: decrease in unconjugated bilirubin levels over time, neonatal encephalopathy, neonatal mortality, neurodevelopmental sequelae, iron deficiency, chronic lung disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis and retinopathy of prematurity.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-30 10:03:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The purpose of treatment of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is the prevention of a neonatal encephalopathy that has variously been labeled as kernicterus, bilirubin encephalopathy and bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2002</LINK>). The long-term goal of the management of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is the avoidance of neurodevelopmental sequelae that can result from the toxicity of bilirubin to the immature nervous system. The modern management of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia consists of phototherapy and, in cases with extreme elevations of unconjugated bilirubin, exchange transfusion. Phototherapy is widely available and has been used for many years.</P>
<P>In this review we have summarized the results of three trials in which a metalloporphyrin was used to treat neonates with moderate to high levels of plasma bilirubin. The outcomes reported in all three trials were short-term intermediate outcomes and no outcomes addressing long-term neurodevelopmental status of treated and control infants are available. Metalloporphyrin-treated infants appeared to have short-term benefits compared to controls, including a lower maximum plasma bilirubin level in one study, a lower frequency of severe hyperbilirubinemia in one study, a decreased need for phototherapy, fewer bilirubin measurements and a shorter duration of hospitalization. There was marked heterogeneity in the estimate of risk difference for severe hyperbilirubinemia across the three studies. This is likely to be the result of differences in criteria for institution of phototherapy in the control groups. In <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kappas-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Kappas 1995b</LINK> phototherapy was instituted in all controls at enrollment whereas in <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1999</LINK> it was instituted only at a bilirubin level of 19.5 mg/dl.</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1999</LINK> the threshold used for initiating phototherapy was higher than the level recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1994</LINK>). This limits the generalizability of the results of this study. However, there is no evidence to support or refute the possibility that treatment with a metalloporphyrin decreases the risk of neonatal kernicterus, exchange transfusion or the risk of long term neurodevelopmental impairment. A small number of metalloporphyrin-treated as well as control infants developed a photosensitivity rash. The trials were too small to rule out an increase in the risk of photosensitivity or other adverse effects from metalloporphyrin treatment.</P>
<P>Of the metalloporphyrins, tin mesoporphyrin has been most commonly used in clinical trials on humans, including neonates. Early neonatal studies of tin mesoporphyrin used doses varying from one to six micromoles per kilogram body weight. The dose of tin mesoporphyrin used in all recent studies has been six micromoles per kilogram body weight. This is the dose that is likely to be used if this compound were to be come into routine clinical use.</P>
<P>Before metalloporphyrin treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be considered for routine use, further studies with masking of interventions and outcome assessment are required to compare the safety and efficacy of metalloporphyrins and phototherapy. Subsequently, the convenience and cost-effectiveness of metalloporphyrin therapy and phototherapy can be compared and parental preferences can be incorporated to make decisions about clinical usage. Randomized control trials are required to test whether the use of metalloporphyrins can prevent the need for an exchange transfusion in neonates with levels of unconjugated bilirubin that are rising toward the threshold for exchange transfusion. In such trials the use of a metalloporphyrin either alone or in conjunction with phototherapy can be compared against phototherapy alone with exchange transfusion and bilirubin encephalopathy serving as the primary outcomes. If an exchange transfusion can be prevented, the benefits of metalloporphyrins are likely to outweigh the risks, especially in healthcare settings where donor blood carries the risk of viral and other infections. In addition to their use in treatment of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, metalloporphyrins also have the potential for use in its prevention. The use of metalloporphyrins for prevention will be reviewed in a separate systematic review.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The evidence from randomized controlled trials on the effects of metalloporphyrins on clinically important outcomes is insufficient at present. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Randomized clinical trials are required that compare metalloporphyrin treatment to placebo and that report on important outcomes such as severe hyperbilirubinemia, neonatal kernicterus, exchange transfusion and long term neurodevelopmental impairment. Future trials should be designed so that selection, performance, attrition and detection bias are minimized. Measurement of bilirubin values should be done by high pressure liquid chromatography to minimize inter and intralaboratory variation in bilirubin measurement that has been described with other methods of bilirubin measurement. Adequate sample sizes are required to rule out an increased risk of adverse events with metalloporphyrin treatment. Such trials are likely to be difficult to conduct due to the rarity of these outcomes. Therefore the conduct of such trials should be considered in high-risk neonates such as those with hemolysis or those that have rising bilirubin levels approaching the threshold for exchange transfusion. Also useful will be observational studies that lead to the identification of reliable risk factors for severe hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus, so that high-risk neonates may be targeted in future trials. </P>
