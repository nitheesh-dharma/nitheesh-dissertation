<P>There are no trials investigating the effects of epinephrine to try to revive babies who appear to be stillborn or close to death at birth. Some babies are born with a very slow heart beat (extreme bradycardia) or their hearts have stopped beating shortly before birth (apparent stillbirth). Although they may appear to be close to death, it may be possible to revive these babies. Epinephrine is a drug that stimulates the heart and has been used to treat cardiac arrest and bradycardia in people of all ages. However, the review found no trials of the use of epinephrine for reviving newborn babies with extreme bradycardia or whose hearts appear to have just stopped beating. Research is needed into the effects of epinephrine on newborns.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2011-01-07 11:41:53 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Epinephrine is a cardiac stimulant with complex effects on the heart and blood vessels. It has been used for decades in all age groups to treat cardiac arrest and bradycardia. Despite formal guidelines for the use of epinephrine in neonatal resuscitation, the evidence for these recommendations has not yet been rigorously scrutinised. While it is understood that this evidence is in large part derived from animal models and the adult human population, the contribution from work in the neonatal population remains unclear. In particular, it remains to be determined if any randomised studies in neonates have helped to establish if the administration of epinephrine in the context of apparent stillbirth or extreme bradycardia might influence mortality and morbidity.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>No randomised, controlled trials evaluating the administration of epinephrine to the apparently stillborn or extremely bradycardic newborn infant were found. Similarly, no randomised, controlled trials that addressed the issues of optimum dosage and route of administration of epinephrine were found.

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-01-17 20:32:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is widely accepted that epinephrine should have a place in the resuscitation of the apparently stillborn or extremely bradycardic infant. Formal guidelines sanctioning its use are in existence and include the position statement formulated at the International Guidelines 2000 Conference on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiac Care (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2000</LINK>). This position statement, based on a consensus of experts, specifically advises that epinephrine be used when the heart rate remains less than sixty after at least thirty seconds of adequate ventilation and chest compressions. Furthermore, it considers this to be a Class 1 recommendation, where class 1 indicates a practice that is "always acceptable, proven safe and definitely useful". However, a recent review concluded that there is in fact very little scientific evidence in support of these recommendations, and that the existing evidence is largely derived from animal research and the human adult literature (<LINK REF="REF-Wyckoff-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyckoff 2001</LINK>). The use of epinephrine is also endorsed in the resuscitation texts and courses of the American Academy of Pediatrics (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-Kattwinkel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP Kattwinkel 2000</LINK>) and the European Resuscitation Council (<LINK REF="REF-ALSG-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ALSG 2000</LINK>) but again without reference to any supporting scientific data. It is also acknowledged that significant hazards may be associated with the use of epinephrine. These include the possibility that the caregiver may be distracted from giving priority to ventilatory support, and a possible predisposition to major organ injury such as renal failure, necrotising enterocolitis and intraventricular haemorrhage/infarction (<LINK REF="REF-ECNI-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECNI 1992</LINK>). Despite a paucity of evidence, the use of intravenous epinephrine is still recommended in the most recent international recommendations for neonatal resuscitation where profound bradycardia is still present despite efforts to support ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-ILCOR-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILCOR 2010</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-12-15 19:44:34 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In animal models, epinephrine has been shown to exert its benefits through the combination of beta-1 effects which stimulate the heart and, more importantly, the alpha effect of increasing non-cerebral peripheral resistance. As a function of the latter, cerebral and myocardial blood flow are increased (<LINK REF="REF-Berkowitz-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berkowitz 1991</LINK>). Beta-1 effects, however, may also impede post resuscitation recovery by increasing myocardial oxygen demand (<LINK REF="REF-Vincent-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In humans, there are no data on the ontogeny of adrenergic receptors or on the time course of myocardial sympathetic innervation (<LINK REF="REF-Zaritsky-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaritsky 1984</LINK>). Studies that examined age-related effects of catecholamines in piglets and lambs have, however, demonstrated that responses in cardiac contractility and vascular reflexes are diminished in the newborn animal (<LINK REF="REF-Buckley-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buckley 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manders-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manders 1979</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-12-15 19:44:31 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many questions also remain unanswered with regard to both the dosage and route of administration of epinephrine. The current recommendation regarding dose is to use 0.1 - 0.3 ml/kg of a 1:10 000 solution, by the intravenous or endotracheal route, repeated every three to five minutes as indicated. Higher doses have been used in children (<LINK REF="REF-Goetting-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goetting 1991</LINK>) and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Paradis-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paradis 1991</LINK>) but there are no data addressing this issue in the neonatal population. Meta-analysis of studies comparing high versus low dose epinephrine in adults did not show any benefit with the higher dose (<LINK REF="REF-Vandyke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandyke 2000</LINK>). A randomised, blinded trial of high versus standard dose epinephrine in a swine model showed that the higher dose did not improve survival rate or neurological outcome. Furthermore, the higher dose was associated with severe tachycardia and hypertension, and a higher mortality rate immediately after resuscitation (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1996</LINK>). Lucas showed that after endotracheal administration, comparable plasma levels of epinephrine can be achieved despite the low pulmonary blood flow seen in a newborn lamb model of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1994</LINK>). However, on the basis of data derived from a dog model (<LINK REF="REF-Orlowski-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orlowski 1990</LINK>) and from a human adult study (<LINK REF="REF-Quinton-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinton 1987</LINK>), other authors have suggested that the endotracheal route is unreliable. Dosage considerations are also clouded by the finding in newborn lambs that the extent of metabolic acidosis can significantly attenuate the haemodynamic response to epinephrine (<LINK REF="REF-Preziosi-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preziosi 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Whether the use of epinephrine in infants with extreme prematurity poses specific risks remains unclear. The hypothesis that the preterm infant may be vulnerable to haemodynamic fluctuations of the type induced by epinephrine has been investigated in a beagle puppy model (<LINK REF="REF-Pasternak-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pasternak 1983</LINK>). This study showed that acute onset cerebral hypertension, as may be seen in response to catecholamines, is a likely significant risk factor for intraventricular haemorrhage. Antenatal factors predisposing to premature birth pose independent risks for cerebral injury, as may post-natal ischaemia/hypoxia (<LINK REF="REF-Graziani-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graziani 1996</LINK>). Given these considerations, it would be valuable to undertake a subgroup analysis of available data on the use of epinephrine by gestational age.</P>
<P>Finally, perhaps one of the most compelling reasons to closely examine the evidence for the use of epinephrine is that when administered to very preterm infants, there may be a very high rate of death and disability (<LINK REF="STD-Sims-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sims 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1998</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-01-07 11:45:11 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We planned to assess the methodological quality of included studies were using the following key criteria: allocation concealment (blinding of randomisation), blinding of intervention, completeness of follow-up, and blinding of outcome measurement/assessment. For each criterion, assessment was yes, no, can't tell. We planned on having two review authors separately assess each study. If available, this information was added to the Characteristics of Included Studies table.</P>
<P>In addition, for the update in 2010, we planned to evaluate the following issues and, if available, enter the information into the Risk of Bias table: </P>
<P>(1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? For each included study, we planned to categorize the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); </P>
<P>- inadequate (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); </P>
<P>- unclear.  </P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed? For each included study, we planned to categorize the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); </P>
<P>- inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? For each included study, we planned to categorize the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We planned to categorize the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants; </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel; </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors. </P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? For each included study and for each outcome, we planned to describe the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We planned to note whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses. We planned to categorize the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate (&lt; 20% missing data); </P>
<P>- inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data): </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(5) Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? For each included study, we planned to describe how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We planned to assess the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); </P>
<P>- inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to describe any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We planned to assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>- yes; no; or unclear.  </P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>No studies were found meeting the inclusion criteria for this review.</P>
<P>Three case series were identified by the search strategy. Sims et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sims-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sims 1994</LINK>) retrospectively examined data for 105 infants who received epinephrine and/or atropine for resuscitation in the delivery room and/or nursery settings. Of the 25 survivors, nine were severely handicapped at follow up. The factors associated with a worse outcome were: gestation less than 28 weeks, need for early repeated resuscitation, asystole, and collapse without a clear precipitant. O'Donnell et al (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 1998</LINK>) attempted to evaluate mortality and morbidity for 78 infants requiring epinephrine as part of resuscitation at birth, with follow up after at least one year. 40 infants survived, with significantly more term survivors (67%) compared to preterm (42%). Of the babies below 29 weeks gestation, 78% either died or showed evidence of neurodevelopmental disability. These findings are very different to those of Jankov et al (<LINK REF="STD-Jankov-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jankov 2000</LINK>) who retrospectively examined outcomes for babies of birthweight less than 750 grams. In this study, of 16 babies who received CPR, 12 also received epinephrine. Nine of the 16 babies survived and eight of these showed no disability at a median follow up age of two years. In addition, the use of epinephrine was not statistically associated with an adverse outcome in this study.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Given that no randomised controlled trials which address the use of epinephrine in neonatal resuscitation were found, this systematic review does not establish if the administration of epinephrine to the apparently stillborn or extremely bradycardic newborn reduces mortality and morbidity. This confirms that the current recommendations for the use of epinephrine in this context are based only on evidence derived from animal models and the human adult literature.</P>
<P>The search strategy used for this review did identify three case series, but no clinical trial data. These retrospective studies, while highlighting the possible long term dangers and benefits associated with the use of epinephrine, cannot be used to reaffirm or modify current guidelines. Given that epinephrine may be hazardous to the resuscitated newborn, it would be valuable for future trials to compare epinephrine not only with placebo/no drug, but also with other drugs. The neonatal literature does not currently recognise an immediately eligible alternative drug, but other vasopressor agents, such as norepinephrine, are theoretically plausible in providing powerful alpha effects without potentially harmful beta effects.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No randomised, controlled trials were found to support or refute that the administration of epinephrine to the apparently stillborn or extremely bradycardic newborn infant reduces mortality and morbidity. Similarly, we found no randomised, controlled trials which addressed the issues of optimum dosage and route of administration of epinephrine.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is an urgent need for randomised, controlled trials to establish if the administration of epinephrine to the apparently stillborn or extremely bradycardic newborn affects mortality and morbidity.</P>
