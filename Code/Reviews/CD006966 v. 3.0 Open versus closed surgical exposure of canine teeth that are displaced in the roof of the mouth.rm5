<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Is it better to use an open or closed surgical method to expose eye teeth ('canines') that have become displaced in the roof of the mouth?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Permanent canine teeth in the upper jaw usually erupt into the mouth between the ages of 11 to 12 years. In 2% to 3% of young people, the canine teeth fail to erupt (grow down) and become displaced in the roof of the mouth (palate).This can leave unsightly gaps, cause damage to the surrounding roots (which can be so severe that neighbouring teeth are lost or have to be removed) and, occasionally, result in the development of cysts.</P>
<P>Management of this problem is both time consuming and expensive. It usually involves surgical exposure (uncovering), followed by fixed orthodontic braces for two to three years, to move the canine into the correct position. Two surgical techniques are routinely used in the UK: the closed technique involves uncovering the buried tooth, gluing an attachment onto the exposed tooth and repositioning the palatal flap. Shortly after surgery, an orthodontic brace is used to apply gentle forces to bring the canine into its correct position within the dental arch. The canine moves into position beneath the gum. An alternative method is the open technique, which involves surgically uncovering the canine tooth as before, but instead of placing an attachment onto the exposed tooth, a window of gum from around the tooth is removed and a dressing (pack) placed to cover the exposed area. Approximately 10 days later, this pack is removed and the canine is allowed to erupt naturally. Once the tooth has erupted sufficiently for an orthodontic attachment to be glued onto its surface, orthodontic braces are used to bring the tooth in line with the other teeth.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence in this review is up-to-date as of February 2017. Authors with <A HREF="http://oralhealth.cochrane.org/">Cochrane Oral Health</A> found three relevant studies, involving 146 participants who had eye teeth displaced in the roof of the mouth, either on one or both sides. The majority of participants were female and the average age in the studies ranged from 14 to 17 years. Two studies were designed in a way that made them likely to be biased.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We combined results from three studies and found that one technique did not seem to have an advantage over the other for ensuring the movement of the tooth into the correct position without the need for repeat surgery.</P>
<P>Five out of 141 participants analysed were surgical failures, one of which was due to the complication of detachment of the gold chain during surgery. One study reported complications after surgery and found one participant in the closed group had a post-operative infection requiring antibiotics and another participant in the closed group experienced pain during alignment of the canine as the gold chain penetrated through the gum tissue of the palate.</P>
<P>We were unable to combine results from studies for any other outcomes, but individual studies did not show evidence of a difference between the two techniques for pain, discomfort, appearance, gum health, length of treatment time or cost (low to very low quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Overall, we assessed the quality of the evidence as low, which means we cannot be certain of the findings.</P>
<P>
<B>Author conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>It does not seem that one surgical technique is better than the other for moving displaced eye teeth into the correct position, or for other outcomes, but this finding is uncertain because the quality of the evidence is low. This suggests the need for more high-quality studies. Three studies are currently in process. When they are completed, we will include them in an update of this review and may be able to reach firmer conclusions.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-14 10:29:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Palatally displaced canines or PDCs are upper permanent canines, commonly known as 'eye' teeth, that are displaced in the roof of the mouth. This can leave unsightly gaps, cause damage to the surrounding roots (which can be so severe that neighbouring teeth are lost or have to be removed) and, occasionally, result in the development of cysts. PDCs are a frequent dental anomaly, present in 2% to 3% of young people.</P>
<P>Management of this problem is both time consuming and expensive. It involves surgical exposure (uncovering) followed by fixed braces for two to three years to bring the canine into alignment within the dental arch. Two techniques for exposing palatal canines are routinely used in the UK: the closed technique and the open technique. The closed technique involves uncovering the canine, attaching an eyelet and gold chain and then suturing the palatal mucosa back over the tooth. The tooth is then moved into position covered by the palatal mucosa. The open technique involves uncovering the canine tooth and removing the overlying palatal tissue to leave it uncovered. The orthodontist can then see the crown of the canine to align it.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-03-19 11:53:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of using either an open or closed surgical method to expose canines that have become displaced in the roof of the mouth, in terms of success and other clinical and patient-reported outcomes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-07-12 12:23:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cochrane Oral Health&#8217;s Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health&#8217;s Trials Register (to 24 February 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library, 2017, Issue 1), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 24 February 2017), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 24 February 2017). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (<A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</A>) and the <A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform</A> were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-03-19 11:56:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently screened the results of the electronic searches, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-09 09:51:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included three studies, involving 146 participants. Two studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias.</P>
<P>The main finding of the review was that the two techniques may be equally successful at exposing PDCs (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.06; three studies, 141 participants analysed, low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>One surgical failure was due to detachment of the gold chain (closed group). One study reported on complications following surgery and found two in the closed group: a post-operative infection requiring antibiotics and pain during alignment of the canine as the gold chain penetrated through the gum tissue of the palate.</P>
<P>We were unable to pool data for dental aesthetics, patient-reported pain and discomfort, periodontal health and treatment time; however, individual studies did not find any differences between the surgical techniques (low- to very low-quality evidence).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-08-08 10:47:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Currently, the evidence suggests that neither the open or closed surgical technique for exposing palatally displaced maxillary canine teeth is superior for any of the outcomes included in this review; however, we considered the evidence to be low quality, with two of the three included studies being at high risk of bias. This suggests the need for more high-quality studies. Three ongoing clinical trials have been identified and it is hoped that these will produce data that can be pooled to increase the degree of certainty in these findings.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-07-12 13:45:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Maxillary canine teeth are the third teeth along from the midline in the upper jaw, which erupt into the mouth around 11 to 12 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Hagg-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagg 1986</LINK>). Displaced teeth refers to those which have an abnormal position, whereas impacted teeth are those which cannot naturally erupt, usually because they are impeded by other teeth or bone. After mandibular (lower jaw) third molars or wisdom teeth, maxillary canines are the most common teeth to be displaced or impacted (<LINK REF="REF-Thilander-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thilander 1973</LINK>). Canine displacement usually occurs in the roof of the mouth (palate), whereas impaction usually occurs towards the cheek and lip (buccally) or in line with the arch (<LINK REF="REF-Counihan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Counihan 2013</LINK>). Canine teeth, which are displaced in the palate and cannot erupt naturally, are referred to as &#8216;palatally displaced canines&#8217; or PDCs. Prevalence of PDCs has been reported as between 1% to 3% in different populations. It has been reported that in around 8% of these cases teeth on both sides of the mouth (bilateral) are affected (<LINK REF="REF-Bishara-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bishara 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peck-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peck 1994</LINK>). The male to female ratio of maxillary canine displacement varies between studies conducted in different populations. In one study conducted in Italy, palatally displaced canines occurred three times more frequently in females than males (<LINK REF="REF-Sacerdoti-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sacerdoti 2004</LINK>), whereas Bishara reports that displacements are twice as common in females than in males (<LINK REF="REF-Bishara-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bishara 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aetiology of PDCs is not fully understood, but is considered multifactorial. Many studies have claimed that they are mainly inherited, with a polygenic mode of inheritance. Family studies have shown that positional abnormalities of canines are more common in relatives than the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Peck-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peck 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peck-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peck 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peck-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peck 1997</LINK>). Local factors may also be a causative factor in displacement, such as missing or small incisor teeth, crowding or a lack of space in the jaw, delayed or early shedding of the primary tooth, presence of cleft in the jaw, fusion of the tooth to the bone (ankylosis) and trauma to other teeth in the area (<LINK REF="REF-Bishara-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bishara 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Displaced maxillary canines can result in several complications, such as root resorption of adjacent teeth (usually the maxillary lateral and sometimes central incisors (<LINK REF="REF-Strbac-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strbac 2013</LINK>)), and much more rarely, cystic change of the tissue around the displaced tooth (<LINK REF="REF-Manne-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manne 2012</LINK>). Root resorption may become so severe that the neighbouring teeth have to be removed. Also, impaction of these teeth can lead to aesthetic problems (<LINK REF="REF-Shafer-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shafer 1983</LINK>), owing to a gap in the dental arch where the tooth has failed to erupt. This can lead to an abnormal position of the upper dental midline. Due to the potential severe sequelae, some displaced or impacted canines cannot be left alone and require surgical intervention.<BR/>
</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-08-08 10:59:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With every patient, a careful discussion between the patient, parent/caregiver, orthodontist and oral surgeon is required. However, the preferred option for many PDCs is surgical exposure under general anaesthesia (or, in some countries, local anaesthetic) and orthodontic alignment. At present, two surgical techniques are routinely used to uncover palatally displaced canines: the open and closed techniques.</P>
<P>The closed technique involves surgically uncovering the tooth and gluing an attachment onto the exposed tooth, often in the form of a gold chain. The palatal flap is then repositioned and sutured, with the chain exiting through the mucosa. Historically, this could be seen as quite challenging in the surgical theatre setting; however, with the advent of new self-etch adhesive bonding systems, the bonding technique could be simplified. Shortly after surgery, an orthodontic brace is used to apply gentle forces to bring the canine into its correct position, within the dental arch. The canine then erupts through the mucosa into its correct position (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1971</LINK>). See <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The open technique differs slightly. It involves surgically uncovering the canine tooth, as before, but instead of bonding an attachment on the exposed tooth at the time of the surgery, a window of tissue is removed from around the tooth leaving it exposed. A dressing or 'pack' is placed to cover the exposed area. The dressing is removed approximately 10 days later. The tooth is then either left to erupt naturally, or an orthodontic attachment is placed to enable the tooth to be moved, above the gum, into its correct position in line with the rest of the teeth (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1971)</LINK>. See <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>Regardless of which surgical technique is used, orthodontic treatment will be required following surgical exposure, in order to bring the canine tooth into its correct position. On average, this will take between two and three years.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-07-11 23:07:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgical exposure involves removing the bone or fibrous gum tissue (or both) that is impeding the movement of the canine. Without doing this, the tooth is unlikely to erupt. Exposing the canine tooth surgically allows access to the tooth to either allow natural eruption or orthodontic movement. Once sufficiently erupted, then the tooth can be brought into alignment with the rest of the teeth, using orthodontics.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-07-12 13:45:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Palatally impacted canines are a commonly encountered clinical problem that primarily affects children and adolescents. Up till now, there has been a lack of high-quality research to assess the advantages of one technique over the other. Whilst considering patient factors, the choice of technique is currently determined by the orthodontists&#8217; and surgeons&#8217; preference. A survey to investigate the preference of orthodontists in the UK was equally divided between the two techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several studies have evaluated treatment length, periodontal health, root length and aesthetics, while few have looked at the patient&#8217;s perception of recovery and other outcomes most important to the patient. As treatment is long and is being received at a young age, it is important to find out whether one surgical technique will result in better outcomes for the patient in terms of success and treatment burden.</P>

<P>One trial reported on success and failure rates of treatment for each surgical technique at 10 days (<LINK REF="STD-Parkin-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Parkin 2012</LINK>). Out of 66 participants, there were 28 successful treatments and three failures in the open group (n = 31) and 33 successful treatments and two failures in the closed group (n = 35). <LINK REF="STD-Gharaibeh-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gharaibeh 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Smailien_x0117_-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Smailien&#279; 2013</LINK> reported in email correspondence with the review authors that they had a 100 per cent success rate for both techniques. Overall, therefore, there were three failures out of 69 in participants having the open treatment and two failures out of 72 participants having the closed treatment. There was no evidence of a difference in success rates between the the open and closed groups (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.06, P = 0.79).

<P>One study showed photographs of the treated canine and untreated contralateral canine to two panels made up of orthodontists and laypeople, who were asked if they could identify the operated canine from the unoperated canine and whether the operated canine or unoperated canine looked best (<LINK REF="STD-Parkin-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Parkin 2012</LINK>). Orthodontists correctly identified the operated side 60.7% of the time (95% CI 53.7 to 67.8), which was significantly different from the null percentage of 50% (P = 0.003). The lay judges correctly identified the operated side 49.7% of the time (95% CI 45.3 to 54.0), which was not significantly different to the null value (P = 0.880). The were no differences in the proportion of correctly identified sides between those treated with an open or closed surgical procedure for either panel.</P>

Duration of pain or soreness was also recorded and dichotomous data on pain-killer use were collected. There was no evidence of a difference in the pain scores between the open and closed groups (MD 0.00, 95% CI &#8722;1.09 to 1.09, P = 1.00).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-31 22:30:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>From the three included trials, it appears that there may be no advantage in performing an exposure using an open rather than a closed technique for the outcomes documented; however, we cannot be certain of this finding as the quality of the evidence is low. Only one trial was randomised; the other two were quasi-randomised and had a high risk of bias in several domains.</P>
<P>Exposure of PDCs appears to be a successful intervention: only three failures (out of 69) occurred in the open groups and two (out of 71) in the closed groups.</P>
<P>Aesthetic analysis is probably one of the most important outcomes to the patient and it appears that there was little or no difference between operated and unoperated canines at the end of treatment. It is therefore hardly surprising that there was no difference in aesthetic outcome when PDCs exposed with an open versus closed procedure are compared. This is also the case when periodontal health was examined: although a statistically significant difference was detected between unoperated and operated canines, this difference was small (0.5 mm) and unlikely to be clinically relevant. When open versus closed techniques were compared, there was no difference.</P>
<P>Other patient-centred outcomes included pain/discomfort in the post-operative period, and duration of treatment. Again, from the data collected, we could not detect a significant difference.</P>
<P>It should be borne in mind that we cannot be certain about any of our findings because the quality of the evidence is low to very low.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-07-11 23:12:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More data are required from high-quality RCTs to investigate these outcomes further, particularly for patient-centred outcomes, such as treatment duration and aesthetics. As there are only three small RCTs, with two of them at high risk of bias, it is not possible to draw any firm conclusions.</P>
<P>There was no attempt to investigate the influence of tooth location: is there a difference in outcome if the PDC is mildly impacted, as opposed to severely impacted, according to the technique used? The research question asked in the review is non-specific and it might be more applicable to practice if we ask which technique is superior for mildly displaced canines, moderately displaced canines and severely displaced canines. This may be something we explore in future updates of our review.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-07-19 18:22:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available evidence is limited to three small studies, two of which are at high risk of bias. As the evidence found for the review is of overall low quality, further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate that no difference exists between the two techniques.</P>

<P>Some authors of this review (NP, PB) are also investigators involved with one of the included clinical trials; however the screening of abstracts, determination of the included studies and data extraction for this update were undertaken independently of these two authors.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-07-11 23:12:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The previous review published in 2009 had no studies included so no conclusions could be drawn. There is now some evidence that there is no difference in outcome whether PDCs are exposed using an open or a closed technique.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Evidence from excluded studies</HEADING>
<P>There has been one review (not systematic) by <LINK REF="REF-Burden-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burden 1999</LINK>, which concluded that there was no evidence to support either technique. It included only one study that directly compared closed and open techniques (<LINK REF="STD-Wisth-1976a" TYPE="STUDY">Wisth 1976a</LINK>). Thirty-four participants received an open exposure and 22 participants received a closed exposure. It was found that the mean duration of treatment was four months longer in the closed group and it was reported that this was likely due to lack of direct vision of the canine from when it was exposed to when it was brought into the line of the arch. The closed group appeared to have less periodontal damage in terms of loss or attachment and bone levels. The study, however, was retrospective and pretreatment equivalence was not established (in terms of participants' age or severity of canine displacement), therefore the risk of selection and detection bias was high.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Schmidt-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Schmidt 2007</LINK> conducted a study that evaluated differences in periodontal health, root length and aesthetics in 16 participants with unilaterally palatally displaced canines and six participants with bilaterally displaced canines. All were exposed using an open technique and the canines were allowed to erupt autonomously before being brought into their correct position with braces. Outcomes were compared to the contralateral untreated canine (control teeth) and also to data obtained from an earlier study (<LINK REF="REF-Woloshyn-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woloshyn 1994</LINK>). In the Woloshyn study, all palatally displaced canines received a closed exposure. Both studies found that the roots of the impacted canine and adjacent lateral incisor were slightly shorter than those of the contralateral canine and that the treated canine could be visually identified from the untreated canine in 70% to 80% of cases. Woloshyn also found significant differences in probing depths and crestal bone height when comparing treated with untreated canines, which was not found in the Schmidt study. It was concluded that the overall consequences to the impacted canine with this technique seem better than with a closed technique; however, consequences to the lateral incisor were similar with both techniques. This is in contrast to findings of other authors (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crescini-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crescini 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kohavi-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kohavi 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quirynen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quirynen 2000</LINK>). The authors reported excellent periodontal health following alignment of canines using a closed technique. Importantly, all these mentioned studies (including that by Schmidt) are retrospective and findings therefore score low in terms of evidence.</P>
<P>A prospective study investigating "patients' perception of recovery after exposure of impacted teeth" made a direct comparison between open and closed techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Chaushu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaushu 2005</LINK>). Sixty participants were enrolled: 25 received a closed exposure and 32 received an open exposure. There was no random allocation. Questionnaires were given to the participants following surgery to assess their perception of recovery in four main areas: pain; oral function; ability to participate in routine daily activities; and 'other symptoms' such as bad taste, bleeding or swelling. The comparison revealed that participants receiving an open exposure had a longer recovery time in all areas, except 'ability to participate in routine activities'. However, since the participants were not randomly allocated, the risk of selection bias is high. If one group had more severely impacted canines, this would have a bearing on the results.</P>

<P>This review has found some evidence suggesting that there are no differences in outcomes when performing either an open or a closed surgical exposure for an unerupted palatally displaced maxillary canine; however, the quality of this evidence is low.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the three included studies had outcome data that were too different to enable pooling of data for most of our outcomes.</P>
<P>The lack of evidence of a statistical or clinical difference between the two surgical techniques suggests that currently the method of exposing a PDC can be left to the personal preference and choice of the surgeon and orthodontist.</P>

<P>There remains a need for high-quality randomised clinical trials comparing open and closed surgical techniques for exposing canine teeth displaced in the roof of the mouth. The current literature provides some evidence of no difference between the two techniques; however it is hoped that the three ongoing trials will add to current knowledge.</P>

This prospective study evaluates the outcome of forced orthodontic eruption of impacted canine teeth in both palatal and labial positions. METHODS: Eighty-two impacted maxillary canines in 54 patients were included in the study and were observed for 18 to 30 months after exposure. Following exposure by means of a palatal flap or an apically repositioned buccal flap, an orthodontic traction hook, with a ligation chain attached, was bonded to each impacted tooth using a light cured orthodontic resin cement. A periodontal dressing was placed over the surgical site for a period of time. RESULTS: All teeth were successfully erupted. Complications consisted of: failure of initial bond, at the time of surgery, which required rebonding; premature debonding at the time of pack removal and; debonding of brackets during orthodontic eruption.

Treatment Outcome.&lt;br&gt;AB A total of 61 children who had 83 maxillary canines impacted were followed up for a mean of 3.5 years (range 1.1-10.9 years) after treatment to evaluate the long-term results of the treatments. In most of the children, the impacted maxillary canines had been surgically exposed and treated with fixed orthodontic appliances. In 11 cases, lateral incisors had been extracted because of extensive root resorption. The esthetic results as well as functional and periodontal conditions were evaluated. Only four of the 61 children were not satisfied with the esthetic result, whereas orthodontists judged only 56% of the results as esthetically acceptable on clinical evaluation and 57% as esthetically acceptable on color slides. The periodontal conditions and the occlusal function on sides with previously impacted canines and on sides with normally erupted canines, on the whole, were similar. Exceptions were pocket depths of the left lateral incisors and left canines, but these variables were significantly different mainly because of one patient. In lateral movements of the mandible, however, significant differences in contact pattern were found between sides with normally erupted canines and sides with impacted canines. Canine rise occurred more often on working sides with normally erupted canines than with impacted canines.&lt;br&gt;PT Journal Article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-07-12 13:45:55 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

The situation has been analysed after treatment according to 3 methods of surgery and orthodontics: a) excision and active eruption, b) excision and passive eruption and c) replaced flap and active eruption. Many aspects regarding the choice and course of treatment depend primarily on individual data of the patient and on the location of impaction. With surgical exposure by excision some mucogingival problems seem to appear, especially for vestibular impactions. In those cases the surgical techniques using replaced or deplaced flaps seem to be more indicated to preserve the periodontal tissues.&lt;br&gt;PT Journal Article&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-07-12 13:45:55 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

METHODS: Clinical examinations of the maxillary lateral incisors, canines, and adjacent premolars were performed on 16 patients with unilaterally impacted canines and 6 with bilaterally impacted canines treated in this manner. The average age was 23 years 7 months, and the average posttreatment observation period was 2 years 11 months. Data from the bilaterally impacted canines were not used in the central analysis. RESULTS: Differences in probing attachment level were found at the distolingual region of the lateral incisor and at the distobuccal region of the premolar adjacent to the treated canine. Crestal bone height was lower at the mesial and distal regions of the lateral incisor adjacent to the previously impacted canine, and the roots of the treated canine and adjacent lateral incisor were shorter than those of the contralateral control teeth. Twenty-three orthodontists and 9 second- and third-year orthodontic residents could identify the previously impacted canine in the unilateral patients an average of 78.9% of the time, but to a statistically significant degree in 66% of all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The overall consequences to the impacted canine of surgical exposure and free eruption are good compared with closed exposure and early traction, whereas consequences to the adjacent teeth, particularly the lateral incisor, are similar. Future research directly comparing the 2 methods with a larger sample and randomization could yield further insight.&lt;br&gt;PT - Comparative Study&lt;br&gt;PT - Evaluation Studies&lt;br&gt;PT - Journal Article&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-07-12 13:45:55 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

In one group (n =34) the teeth were exposed in the mouth after removal of the bone and soft tissue covering of the crown. In the other group (n =22) the bone covering the crown was removed, whereafter the mucoperiosteal flap was sutured back. In both groups the orthodontic treatment procedures were basically the same. The mean treatment duration was 18 months after radical surgical exposure and 22 months after moderate surgical exposure. The teeth were examined 1-2 years after removal of the fixed appliances. Oral hygiene and gingival inflammation were approximately the same in both groups. The palatal pocket was deeper on teeth subjected to moderate surgical exposure, and the depth also varied more. The loss of fiber attachment was not significantly different except on the palatal surface, where it was greater after radical exposure and also varied more. The interdental bone height, which was measured on radiographs, varied more after radical than after moderate surgical exposure.&lt;br&gt;PT Journal Article.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-07-12 13:45:55 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

The contralateral canines which had erupted unaided served as controls during the study. Measurements of the gingival pocket depths showed that the distal pocket on the treated teeth was significantly deeper than on the control teeth. The treated canines displayed significantly more loss of periodontal support on the buccal and palatal surfaces than did the untreated teeth. Radiographically, there was more alveolar bone loss on the mesial surfaces of the corrected than on the uncorrected canines, the mean distance being 2.06 and 1.51 millimeters, respectively. The age of the patients at the start of treatment did not seem to have any profound influence on the loss of attachment, but the individual variation was considerably greater in adults.&lt;br&gt;PT Journal Article.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2017-07-12 13:45:55 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

</P>
<P>All surgical procedures carried out under general anaesthetic by one of two specialist surgeons at each unit, all of whom had at least 10 years' experience using both techniques. In both groups, the primary canine was extracted if present. Bone was then surgically removed, exposing the largest diameter of the ectopic canine crown, which was followed by:</P>

<LI>
<B>Open: </B>surgical excision of the palatal mucosa standardised using a preformed wire template. Surgical gauze soaked in Whitehead varnish or Coe-pack surgical dressing was sutured in place. The patient was reviewed 10 days later and the surgical pack was removed.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Closed: </B>an eyelet attachment with a gold chain was bonded to the most accessible surface out of the palatal or buccal surface of the ectopic canine using surgical gauze and suction to maintain a dry field. The palatal mucosa was sutured back intact with the gold chain extending through an incision in the palatal flap.</LI>
