<P>This review is an update of a previous Cochrane systematic review of the same title (<LINK REF="REF-Milani-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milani 2011</LINK>) which included four studies. The previous authors decided not to update the review so this updated version was conducted by five new authors (IMG, RL, JGB, AGD, MCW). One new ongoing trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nuegebauer-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Nuegebauer 2013</LINK>) was identified but no new studies eligible for inclusion were found.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-01-26 16:15:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Brain surgery is often required in patients who have abnormal brain blood vessels, had a stroke, sustained a traumatic injury or have suffered spontaneous bleeding into the brain. While surgery can be lifesaving it can also cause further damage due to an associated interruption and reduction of blood flow to the brain cells. Without an adequate supply of blood the brain cells are deprived of oxygen and they may die as a result. If brain cells are lost in large numbers or in important areas of the brain, the patient may die or be severely disabled. This has led to a search for ways to protect the brain cells during brain operations. Studies in animals have shown that lowering the body temperature can help to protect the brain cells in circumstances when the blood supply to the cells is compromised. Similarly, studies in humans who have been resuscitated after their heart stopped beating have shown that lowering their body temperature helps to reduce brain damage. The purpose of this updated version of a previous review of the same title was to determine whether cooling patients who were having brain surgery reduced death and serious disability, or was associated with increased risk of harm. A detailed search of the available literature up until May 2014 identified four eligible studies that included a total of 1219 participants. Their results were combined to answer these questions. No evidence was found that cooling patients who are having brain operations reduced the risk of death or severe disability, or produced significant harm.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-01-10 03:41:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patients undergoing neurosurgery are at risk of cerebral ischaemia with resultant cerebral hypoxia and neuronal cell death. This can increase both the risk of mortality and long term neurological disability. Induced hypothermia has been shown to reduce the risk of cerebral ischaemic damage in both animal studies and in humans who have been resuscitated following cardiac arrest. This had lead to an increasing interest in its neuroprotective potential in neurosurgical patients. This review was originally published in 2011 and did not find any evidence of either effectiveness or harm in these patients. This updated review was designed to capture current evidence to readdress these issues. <I>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-01-10 04:14:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness and safety profile of induced hypothermia versus normothermia for neuroprotection in patients undergoing brain surgery. Effectiveness was to be measured in terms of short and long term mortality and functional neurological outcomes. Safety was to be assessed in terms of the rate of the adverse events infection, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, congestive cardiac failure and any other adverse events reported by the authors of the included studies.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-01-10 03:24:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the original review, the authors searched the databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP) and LILACS to November 2010. For the updated review all these databases were re-searched from November 2010 to May 2014.</P>
<P>For both the original and updated versions, grey literature was sought by searching reference lists of identified studies and relevant review articles, and conference proceedings. No language restrictions were applied.</P>

<P>In this updated review, one new ongoing study was found but no new eligible completed studies were identified. This update was therefore conducted using the same four studies included in the original review. These studies included a total of 1219 participants, mean age 40 to 54 years. All included studies were reported as RCTs. Two were multicentred, together including a total of 1114 patients who underwent cerebral aneurysm clipping, and were judged to have an overall low risk of bias. The other two studies were single centred. One included 80 patients who had a craniotomy following severe traumatic brain injury and was judged to have an unclear or low risk of bias. The other study included 25 patients who underwent hemicranicectomy to relieve oedema following cerebral infarction and was judged to have an unclear or high risk of bias. All studies assessed hypothermia versus normothermia. Overall 608 participants received hypothermia with target temperatures ranging from 32.5 °C to 35 °C, and 611 were assigned to normothermia with the actual temperatures recorded in this group ranging form 36.5 °C to 38 °C. For those who were cooled, 556 had cooling commenced immediately after induction of anaesthesia that was continued until the surgical objective of aneurysm clipping was achieved, and 52 had cooling commenced immediately after surgery and continued for 48 to 96 hours.</P>
<P>Pooled estimates of effect were calculated for the outcomes mortality during treatment or follow-up (ranging from in-hospital to one year); neurological outcome measured in terms of the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) of 3 or less; and adverse events of infections, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and congestive cardiac failure. With regards to mortality, the risk of dying if allocated to hypothermia compared to normothermia was not statistically significantly different (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.27, P = 0.47). There was no indication that the time at which cooling was started affected the risk of dying (RR with intraoperative cooling 0.95, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.51, P = 0.83; RR for cooling postoperatively 0.67, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.35, P = 0.26). For the neurological outcome, the risk of having a poor outcome with a GOS of 3 or less was not statistically different in those who received hypothermia versus normothermia (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.04, P = 0.09). Again there was no indication that the time at which cooling was started affected this result. Regarding adverse events, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence in those allocated to hypothermia versus normothermia for risk of surgical infection (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.97, P = 0.48), myocardial infarction (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.69 to 4.98, P = 0.22), ischaemic stroke (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.05, P = 0.24) or congestive heart failure (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.21, P = 0.38). In contrast to other outcomes, where time of application of cooling did not change the statistical significance of the effect estimates, there was a weak statistically significant increased risk of infection in those who were cooled postoperatively versus those who were not cooled (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.98, P = 0.03). Overall, as in the original review, no evidence was found that the use of induced hypothermia was either beneficial or harmful in patients undergoing neurosurgery.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-01-10 04:10:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-01-10 03:58:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When cerebral blood flow is disrupted due to a traumatic, haemorrhagic or ischaemic insult, anoxic cell membrane depolarization occurs. Neuronal depolarization opens calcium and sodium channels to allow these cations into the cells (<LINK REF="REF-Rothman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothman 1995</LINK>). The resultant osmotic gradient pulls chloride and water into the cells causing cellular swelling and breakdown. The hypoxic cerebral cells also release glutamate, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium levels and further cell damage (<LINK REF="REF-Choi-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choi 1990</LINK>). As part of a generalized and localized inflammatory response oxygen free radicals are produced, which cause mitochondrial dysfunction and further neuronal cell necrosis and apoptosis. When the cerebral blood flow is restored further damage can occur due to a secondary superoxide surge, increased production of nitric oxide and disruption of the blood brain barrier (<LINK REF="REF-Wei-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wei 1999</LINK>). This phase is termed reperfusion injury and can lead to even more severe damage than the initial hypoxic insult.</P>
<P>Patients who have sustained traumatic brain injury, intracerebral haemorrhage or ischaemia often require surgical intervention, as do those who require repair of vascular malformations. Surgery carries the potential for further cerebral ischaemia due to interruption of cerebral perfusion, vasospasm, impaired autoregulation and hyperaemic reperfusion injury, further compromising clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Leslie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leslie 2003</LINK>). This has lead to a search for neuroprotective strategies to limit the extent of surgical induced damaged (<LINK REF="REF-El-Beheiry-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">El Beheiry 2012</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-01-10 04:02:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of hypothermia in neurosurgery was first described in the 1950s, with profound hypothermia being postulated as having neuroprotective effects (<LINK REF="REF-Hendrick-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hendrick 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lougheed-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lougheed 1955</LINK>). However it was largely abandoned due to excessive complications and poor outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Kwak-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwak 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Michenfelder-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michenfelder 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steen-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steen 1980</LINK>). There was a resurgence of interest in this area in the 1990s with studies showing that mild hypothermia improved outcomes in animal models of ischaemic and traumatic brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Clifton-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifton 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goto-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goto 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karibe-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karibe 1994</LINK>). Clinical studies in post-cardiac arrest populations showed improved outcomes, triggering further interest in its potential neuroprotective effects in ischaemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, cerebral aneurysm surgery etc (<LINK REF="STD-Els-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Els 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holzer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holzer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Qiu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Qiu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Todd-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 2005</LINK>). Common to all of these conditions is the disruption of cerebral blood flow with resultant ischaemic cell death.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-01-10 04:06:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hypothermia protects the brain during hypoxic injury by a reduction in cerebral metabolism by approximately 5% for every degree reduction in temperature, attenuating or delaying anoxic depolarization, and reducing glutamate release (<LINK REF="REF-Laptook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laptook 1995</LINK>). It also reduces the production of excitatory amino acids and suppresses nitric oxide and superoxide production (<LINK REF="REF-Drury-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drury 2014</LINK>). In vitro studies have shown that mild hypothermia reduces neuronal apoptosis by reducing the production and activation of hypoxia associated proteins that mediate cell death (<LINK REF="REF-Xu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu 2002</LINK>). Animal studies have shown that hypothermia also attenuates the mechanisms involved in reperfusion injury (<LINK REF="REF-Thoresen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thoresen 1997</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-01-10 04:10:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recently there has been increasing focus on the role of hypothermia in those people undergoing neurosurgical procedures including aneurysm repair, haematoma evacuation, and decompressive craniectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Els-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Els 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hindman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hindman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Qiu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Qiu 2007</LINK>). The original review (<LINK REF="REF-Milani-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milani 2011</LINK>) of the value of hypothermia in neurosurgical populations was carried out at the beginning of this emerging focus of research. It aimed to provide an insight into the overall benefits among and across neurosurgical populations, provide evidence based guidance on the optimal temperature targets and the timing and duration of treatment as well as its safety profile. That review incorporated existing evidence up until November 2010. This updated review was conducted to determine what the current state of evidence is in this regard.</P>

This approach was taken to provide the reader with more comprehensive information about study methods, allow a more detailed assessment of risk of bias and ensure consistency of data extraction for all eligible studies. Three authors (IMG, RL, JGB) independently extracted the data using this form. All items recommended in Section 7 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) were addressed in the data extraction process.

<P>Hindman (<LINK REF="STD-Hindman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hindman 1999</LINK>) induced hypothermia after the start of anaesthesia and the positioning of the patient, with a target temperature of 33.5 ºC. The initial operating room temperature was 20 ºC to 22.0 ºC. Participants in the hypothermic group were cooled by a forced-air cooling and heating blanket set to deliver unwarmed air (room temperature); a cooling and heating mattress connected to a heating-cooling unit set to 20.0 °C; and intravenous fluids and anaesthetic gases that were not warmed until the clip was applied. Participants in the normothermic group were maintained at a target oesophageal temperature of 36.5 ºC by a cooling and heating mattress set to 38.0 ºC; a forced-air cooling and heating blanket set to 36.0 ºC to 38.0 ºC; and intravenous fluids and inspired anaesthetic gases warmed to 37.0 ºC. At the time of clip application, patients assigned to the hypothermia group were significantly colder than those assigned to the normothermia group, with a median temperature of 33.7 ºC versus 36.6 °C, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001).</P>
<P>Todd (<LINK REF="STD-Todd-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 2005</LINK>) used a forced-air blanket connected to a heating-cooling unit to control the temperature for all patients. Hypothermia was induced after the start of anaesthesia and positioning of the patient, with a target temperature of 32.5 °C to 33.5 ºC. The time from induction of anaesthesia to first clip placement was 217 ± 101 minutes and the temperature was 33.3 ± 0.8 ºC. Rewarming of patients began after the last aneurysm clip had been secured and the temperature two hours after surgery was 36.4 ± 1.0 ºC. The temperature of the normothermic group was kept between 36.0 ºC and 37 °C and the time from induction of anaesthesia to the first clip placement was 214 ± 82 minutes. Both groups, normothermic and hypothermic, otherwise received similar treatment.</P>
<P>Els (<LINK REF="STD-Els-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Els 2006</LINK>) induced hypothermia immediately after the operation with a target temperature of 35.0 ºC. In the hypothermic group 10 participants were cooled by an intravenous cooling device; two participants were cooled by an external cooling device in combination with cool ventilator air fanning the body surface. All participants were cooled for 48 hours and active rewarming at a rate of 1 ºC per 24 hours was applied. The normothermic group received the same treatment as the hypothermic group, although details were not provided regarding how the equality of ancillary treatment was ensured. The authors did not report how the temperature was maintained in the normothermic group.</P>
<P>Qiu (<LINK REF="STD-Qiu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Qiu 2007</LINK>) induced hypothermia for four days immediately after the operation, at a temperature of 33.0 ºC to 35.0 ºC, with the use of a water-circulating cooling blanket and, if necessary, a cooling cap around the head with circulating water at a temperature about 4 ºC. The target temperature was generally achieved within 2.5 hours. For those who failed to achieve the target temperature within two hours refrigerated ice bags were placed around the neck. Patients were passively rewarmed over 10 to 24 hours. The normothermic group received the same treatment as the hypothermic group in all other ways, although again details were lacking as to how this was ensured.

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-01-10 07:29:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of this review need to be interpreted in light of the following limitations.</P>
<P>Firstly, there is an overall lack of eligible high quality randomized controlled trials. The original search and this updated search identified only four eligible studies and of these only two (<LINK REF="STD-Hindman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hindman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Todd-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 2005</LINK>) were judged to have an overall low risk of bias. The lack of adequate evidence limited the accuracy and reliability of the results. For the same reason, the scope of the review was limited and it was not unable to fulfil its objectives in terms of analysing the effectiveness and safely of hypothermia by age group or underlying neurosurgical condition.</P>
<P>Secondly, there was potentially important clinical heterogeneity in terms of the underlying neurosurgical condition in the four eligible studies. While all patients in both the Hindman and Todd studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hindman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hindman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Todd-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 2005</LINK>) had surgery for aneurysm clipping, the study by Hindman (<LINK REF="STD-Hindman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hindman 1999</LINK>) included both those who had and had not had a subarachnoid haemorrhage while the study by Todd (<LINK REF="STD-Todd-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 2005</LINK>) was confined to those who had a confirmed subarachnoid haemorrhage. However, participants were homogenous in terms of premorbid neurologic disability, all being required to have a premorbid Modified Rankin score of 0 or 1 (<LINK REF="APP-09" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 9</LINK>), and patients in both trials who had had a subarachnoid haemorrhage were required to have a World Federation of Neurological Surgeons score of I, II or III (<LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK>). The participants in the other two studies were more diverse as Els (<LINK REF="STD-Els-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Els 2006</LINK>) studied those patients having decompressive craniectomy for cerebral oedema after acute ischaemic stoke and Qiu (<LINK REF="STD-Qiu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Qiu 2007</LINK>) studied those who had undergone craniotomy following traumatic brain injury. Among these two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Els-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Els 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Qiu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Qiu 2007</LINK>) there were differences in both the duration of cooling and ancillary treatment, and either of these may have contributed to the diversity and heterogeneity. Pooled estimates of effect that included those studies (<LINK REF="STD-Els-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Els 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Qiu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Qiu 2007</LINK>) in particular should therefore be interpreted with this limitation in mind.</P>
<P>Thirdly, over 90% of the participants underwent surgery for aneurysm clipping (<LINK REF="STD-Hindman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hindman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Todd-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 2005</LINK>), limiting the applicability of these results to other neurosurgical populations. The results of this review should be viewed at best as a general indication of the effectiveness and safety of intraoperative and postoperative hypothermia in patients undergoing craniotomy, with the important caveat that no robust or reliable conclusions can be drawn from it regarding the effects of hypothermia in specific neurosurgical populations aside perhaps from those undergoing cerebral aneurysm clipping.</P>

<P>The quality of the evidence contributing to the main outcomes is detailed in the summary of findings table (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence contributing to the effect estimates for mortality and the Glasgow Outcome Score was deemed to be moderate, with data coming from two studies with an overall low risk of bias, a third with a low or unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Qiu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Qiu 2007</LINK>) and the fourth having a high or unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Els-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Els 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>For myocardial infarction, the quality of the evidence was rated as moderate as one of the studies had a high or unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Els-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Els 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence contributing to effect estimates for ischaemic stoke and congestive heart failure was deemed to be high as both studies reporting these outcomes had a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Hindman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hindman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Todd-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Todd 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the estimate of infective complications, the quality of the evidence was judged to be low as there was significant statistical heterogeneity between studies and we lacked information on how infective complications were defined and diagnosed. The numbers analysed by individual studies for each infective complication were also small and the confidence intervals were not reported.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-01-10 07:34:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An unrestricted comprehensive literature search was conducted for both the original review and the updated review with the aim of identifying all studies eligible for inclusion, and so to minimize reporting and selection bias. The small number of eligible studies that were identified, however, means that the effect estimates should not be taken as an accurate indication of the true effectiveness and safely of induced hypothermia across neurosurgical populations.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-10 07:41:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two other recent systematic reviews addressing the effectiveness and safety of perioperative hypothermia in patients undergoing surgery for intracranial aneurysms found similar results (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2012</LINK>). A Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2012)</LINK> of mild intraoperative hypothermia in patients undergoing surgery for both ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms did not show any statistically significant difference in outcomes for those treated with hypothermia versus normothermia. A second systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2012</LINK>) addressing the use of intraoperative hypothermia in patients undergoing intracranial aneurysm surgery similarly did not show any significant differences in mortality, neurologic outcome or adverse events between the groups. Like this review, both were limited by the lack of availability of eligible studies and both concluded that currently there was insufficient evidence to support the routine use of hypothermia in this population.</P>
<P>We found only one eligible study (<LINK REF="STD-Qiu-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Qiu 2007</LINK>) addressing the role of hypothermia in patients undergoing surgery following traumatic brain injury, and it is important to note that. That study had a number of methodological problems limiting the ability of this review to determine the role of hypothermia in this population. A post hoc analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Clifton-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifton 2012</LINK>) of two randomized controlled trials of hypothermia for severe traumatic brain injury looked at the effect of hypothermia in those patients who had haematomas surgically evacuated within 24 hours of injury. They found that induction of hypothermia to 35 °C before or soon after craniotomy and maintenance at 33 °C for 48 hours postoperatively was associated with an improved neurologic outcome at six months. They postulated that early induction of hypothermia may be beneficial in those requiring surgical evacuation of post-traumatic intracranial haematoma and emphasize the need for future trials in this area that target similar temperature goals.</P>
<P>There is a paucity of trials addressing the value of hypothermia in all neurosurgical populations, especially in those undergoing surgery for epilepsy, non-aneurysmal vascular deformities and ischaemic stoke. Further evidence is required in all these groups before the true effects of hypothermia can be determined in these populations.</P>
