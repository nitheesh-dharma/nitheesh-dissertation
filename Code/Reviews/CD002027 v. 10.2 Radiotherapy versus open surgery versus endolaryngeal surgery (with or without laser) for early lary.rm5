<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Cancer of the larynx or voice box usually begins in the glottis (vocal cords) as a squamous cell cancer (cancer in the membranes). Most people survive these cancers when they get treatment early, before the cancer spreads further into the larynx and surrounding area. Options include radiotherapy, open surgery where access is through the neck or, more commonly now, endolaryngeal excision whereby the throat is reached through the mouth, sometimes with a laser.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics </B>
</P>
<P>This review of trials identified just one trial including 234 patients with early glottic cancer, which compared radiotherapy to open surgery. This was a multicentre randomised controlled trial undertaken in the former Soviet Union, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Patients were followed up for five years and recurrence-free and survival rates were measured.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results </B>
</P>
<P>The results of this trial showed that there was no significant difference in survival between patients treated with radiotherapy or open surgery.</P>
<P>Further data from trials comparing radiotherapy and endolaryngeal surgery are needed to determine the best way of treating early laryngeal cancer, however a number of studies have been abandoned because of difficulties in recruiting participants. One trial is still ongoing.</P>
<P>We found that there is not enough evidence to show which form of treatment might be better for people with early-stage larynx cancer.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The included study is of low quality. The evidence in this review is up to date to September 2014.<BR/>

<P>We identified only one randomised controlled trial, which compared open surgery and radiotherapy in 234 patients with early glottic laryngeal cancer. The overall risk of bias in this study was high.</P>
<P>For T1 tumours, the five-year survival was 91.7% following radiotherapy and 100% following surgery and for T2 tumours, 88.8% following radiotherapy and 97.4% following surgery. There were no significant differences in survival between the two groups.</P>
<P>For T1 tumours, the five-year disease-free survival rate was 71.1% following radiotherapy and 100.0% following surgery, and for the T2 tumours, 60.1% following radiotherapy and 78.7% following surgery. Only the latter comparison was statistically significant (P value = 0.036), but statistical significance would not have been achieved with a two-sided test.</P>
<P>Data were not available on side effects, quality of life, voice outcomes or cost.</P>

<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 2, 2002 and previously updated in 2004, 2007 and 2010.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-11-06 09:18:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Over 150,000 new cases of laryngeal cancer are diagnosed each year (<LINK REF="REF-GLOBOCAN-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">GLOBOCAN 2012</LINK>); the highest rates are observed in Southern and Eastern Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Parkin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin 1997</LINK>). Men are more likely to develop laryngeal cancer than women. Smoking and alcohol are proven risk factors and the temporal decline in incidence of this cancer in some populations is consistent with a decline in the consumption of tobacco (<LINK REF="REF-Coleman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Laryngeal cancers most commonly arise from the glottis, i.e. the true vocal cord, and are usually squamous cell carcinomas. Three-quarters of these patients present early, i.e. without vocal cord fixation, nodal involvement or extension beyond the larynx (<LINK REF="REF-Groome-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groome 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joslin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joslin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robin 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 1997</LINK>). Reported five-year survival rates following treatment of these early tumours, adjusted for deaths from other causes, frequently exceed 85% (<LINK REF="REF-Groome-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groome 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joslin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joslin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robin 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-11-19 10:02:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Radiotherapy, open surgery and endolaryngeal excision are all accepted modalities of treatment for early-stage glottic cancer (T1-T2, N0). Radiotherapy utilises ionising radiation to initiate double-stranded breaks of nuclear DNA leading to loss of the cells' reproductive ability and eventually to cell death. Radiotherapy offers laryngeal preservation, however it is a prolonged treatment course and may be associated with unpleasant adverse effects including oral mucositis, dysphagia, radiation skin burns and xerostomia. Open laryngeal surgery involves an open neck wound with partial or total surgical resection of the larynx with insertion of an indwelling voice prosthesis to allow speech in cases of total laryngectomy, although total laryngectomy is rarely indicated for early-stage cancers. Endolaryngeal surgery is minimally invasive in comparison and involves resection of the tumour via the transoral route with or without the use of laser, with the advantages of preservation of voice and laryngeal function.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-11-07 12:48:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When this review was originally written in 2002, early laryngeal tumours were largely treated with open surgery or radiotherapy, with results of case series demonstrating similar survival rates. Radiotherapy offers the advantage of voice preservation over open surgery, therefore it was previously the generally preferred treatment modality (<LINK REF="REF-Groome-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groome 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mendenhall-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendenhall 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Sullivan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Sullivan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stalpers-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stalpers 1989</LINK>). However, open surgery remained an option, particularly in populations without access to specialist centres for radiotherapy.</P>
<P>In recent years endolaryngeal surgery (with or without laser) has grown in popularity (<LINK REF="REF-DAHNO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">DAHNO 2012</LINK>), and there has been an observed trend away from open surgery as a result. Endolaryngeal surgery offers survival rates that are similar to radiotherapy and has an advantage over open surgery in preservation of voice and laryngeal function. A number of systematic reviews of non-randomised studies have been undertaken (<LINK REF="REF-Abdurehim-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdurehim 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feng-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feng 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spielmann-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spielmann 2010</LINK>), all of which have failed to demonstrate a significant difference between survival rates after radiotherapy or endolaryngeal surgery. Voice outcomes may also be similar following radiotherapy and endolaryngeal surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirano-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirano 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keilmann-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keilmann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGuirt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGuirt 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sittel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sittel 1998</LINK>), thus creating a position of equipoise between these two treatment modalities.</P>
<P>Endolaryngeal resection requires access to specialist surgeons with appropriate experience and expertise, however recent years have seen an apparent increase in the use of this modality of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 2006</LINK>). For example, in England and Wales it has been reported that patients are as likely to receive transoral laser-assisted microsurgical resection as they are to receive radiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DAHNO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">DAHNO 2012</LINK>), although there remains a geographical discrepancy as some UK centres still do not offer transoral laser surgery (<LINK REF="REF-DAHNO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">DAHNO 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>If recurrence does occur, the options for further treatment after endolaryngeal surgery not only include open surgery but also further endolaryngeal resection and radiotherapy, whereas locoregional failure after radiotherapy can only be treated with major open surgical intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Goh-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goh 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smee-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smee 2000</LINK>). Additionally, as endolaryngeal resection is often a day-case procedure, some clinicians believe that treatment costs will be less than for radiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Brandenburg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandenburg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goor-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goor 2007</LINK>); this is supported by a recent cost-utility analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Therapeutic conflicts in the management of early laryngeal cancers are sustained by the belief that randomised controlled trials have not been and could not be undertaken (<LINK REF="REF-Goh-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goh 1996</LINK>). We have undertaken a systematic review to identify any randomised controlled trials comparing open surgery, radiotherapy and endolaryngeal excision in patients with early glottic cancer.</P>

<P>Interpretation of the findings of the only randomised controlled trial that recruited substantial numbers of patients to a comparison between radiotherapy and open surgery is limited by concerns about the adequacy of treatment regimens and deficiencies in the reporting of the study design and analysis. In this trial, open surgical outcomes were better than might be expected from data derived from case series whilst radiotherapy outcomes were worse. The trial investigators admitted that patients were inadequately staged prior to therapy, and radiotherapy may have been sub-optimal. In addition, follow-up was poor and differences between groups may be biased by differential follow-up.</P>
<P>There are no published randomised controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of endolaryngeal resection with either radiotherapy or open surgery and difficulties in recruiting and randomising patients with early laryngeal cancers has been noted by authors of abandoned studies. The difficulties in recruiting to the EaStER trial are addressed in a paper by Hamilton et al, who describe a difference in surgeons' and recruiters' opinions of optimum treatment of carcinoma in situ and those tumours involving the anterior commissure. Additionally, the recruiters felt that there was non-equivalence of the treatment process as endolaryngeal surgery was often considered by patients and clinicians to be more convenient compared to radiotherapy and therefore consent to randomisation was not given (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>Based on the results of one randomised controlled trial, there remains uncertainty as to the comparative benefits and societal costs of different treatment modalities for patients with early glottic laryngeal cancer. Using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' method we judged this study to have a high risk of bias.</P>
<P>Endolaryngeal surgery is gaining popularity in the management of early laryngeal tumours due to voice preservation, shorter treatment duration and results from case series, which show similar survival rates to radiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Csanady-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Csanady 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eckel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eckel 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahieu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahieu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mendenhall-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendenhall 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Motta-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Motta 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ossoff-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ossoff 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steiner-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolfensberger-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfensberger 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zeitels-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeitels 1996</LINK>). Like radiotherapy, endolaryngeal resection is voice-sparing and the shorter treatment duration may further benefit patients and lead to resource savings. In Western countries, where open surgery is infrequently performed, endolaryngeal resection is becoming more popular. A consensus document on behalf of the ENT-UK Head and Neck Group reported that endoscopic excision is now generally the preferred treatment option, particularly for T1a tumours, and suggested that endolaryngeal surgery should be offered to all patients with early laryngeal tumours up to stage 2a (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley 2009</LINK>). As experience with endolaryngeal surgery increases, the application of this treatment modality is expanding to involve more extensive laryngeal tumours, although radiotherapy may offer preferable vocal outcomes when extensive cordectomy is required (<LINK REF="REF-Silver-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silver 2009</LINK>). Furthermore, treatment of the anterior commissure remains controversial as local recurrence rates and vocal outcomes after transoral laser assisted surgery are worse when the anterior commissure is involved and radiotherapy is therefore often preferred in this subset of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Chone-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chone 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hakeem-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hakeem 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sachse-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sachse 2009</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-11-06 09:18:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most patients diagnosed with early laryngeal cancer in Western countries are now treated with either radiotherapy or endolaryngeal surgery. A number of workers consider that it is unlikely that randomised controlled trials comparing open surgery and radiotherapy can be undertaken, because so many clinicians believe that the three treatment modalities confer similar survival advantage but that voice outcomes after open surgery are worse. However, the continued publication of non-randomised studies suggests that even in the West there remains some controversy as to the most cost-effective treatment (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD002027/bibliography.html#CD002027-bbs2-0016">Groome 2001</A>). This systematic review demonstrates that a randomised controlled trial comparing radiotherapy and open surgery has been undertaken (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD002027/bibliography.html#CD002027-bbs2-0001">Ogoltsova 1990</A>), however its conclusions are compromised by methodological and analytical deficiencies.</P>
<P>We identified two recent trials and two protocols for studies. The EaStER feasibility randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-EaStER-2006" TYPE="STUDY">EaStER 2006</LINK>), comparing the effectiveness of radiotherapy and endoscopic excision (with or without laser), is closed and recruited only 17 patients. The status of the other randomised controlled trial that recruited participants is unknown (<LINK REF="STD-Coman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Coman 2003</LINK>). One randomised trial was abandoned due to difficulty in recruiting patients (<LINK REF="STD-Abdurehim-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Abdurehim 2009</LINK>), and one further study is ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-Saedi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Saedi 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>A paper by Hamilton et al details the specific difficulties in recruiting patients to the EaStER trial (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2013</LINK>). The authors describe how surgeons and recruiters felt there was a lack of equipoise between the two treatment options, as endolaryngeal surgery was considered to be more convenient, meaning that recruitment discussions focused on the treatment process rather than expected outcomes. Furthermore, whilst endolaryngeal surgery is generally preferred for T1a cancers, particularly mid-cord lesions, radiotherapy is preferred for anterior commissure lesions, thus the anatomical location of the tumour may create bias when considering recruiting patients to a trial.</P>
<P>Although difficulties have been encountered in recruiting patients to randomised controlled trials, it remains vitally important that randomised studies are undertaken in this field. As data from non-randomised series have demonstrated similar oncological outcomes between radiotherapy and endolaryngeal surgery, quality of life and vocal outcome data must be studied.</P>
