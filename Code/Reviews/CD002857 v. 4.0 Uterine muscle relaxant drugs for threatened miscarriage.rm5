<P>Not enough evidence to say if drugs that relax the muscles of the uterus can prevent threatened miscarriage.</P>
<P>Miscarriage is the loss of a baby in the very early weeks of pregnancy (before 20 weeks), before the baby would be able to survive on its own. This can be a devastating loss to expectant parents. Threatened miscarriage is when there is vaginal bleeding, and sometimes pain, but when the cervix remains closed. The review of studies found just one small trial on uterine relaxant drugs to prevent miscarriage, but the study provided insufficient data to be able to assess its effect adequately. More research is needed.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-09 12:15:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a fetus before it is viable. Caregivers and society may sometimes not consider this to be as tragic a loss as fetal death later in pregnancy, but often it results in a similar degree of mental suffering and anguish for the woman and her partner. Bleeding during the first half of pregnancy is usually referred to as threatened miscarriage, and this may or may not be associated with pain. Once the cervix begins to dilate, miscarriage is inevitable. Threatened miscarriage may present with anything from barely perceptible blood loss to profound life-threatening shock (<LINK REF="REF-McBride-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">McBride 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Miscarriage is common. In fact, it is the most frequent complication of pregnancy. A recent population-based study in Finland of a random sample of 3000 Finnish women showed that by the end of their reproductive lives about 15% of these women had had at least one miscarriage (<LINK REF="REF-Hemminki-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemminki 1999</LINK>). One in seven clinically recognised pregnancies will miscarry, usually during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. Over half the babies who miscarry during this period have a chromosomal abnormality (<LINK REF="REF-Szabo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szabo 1996</LINK>). Other factors which influence the risk of miscarriage include maternal age greater than 35 years, multiple pregnancy (particularly monozygous), uterine malformations, polycystic ovaries, autoimmune factors (such as phospholipid antibodies, lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin antibodies), genetic disorders, poorly controlled diabetes, and having had two or more previous miscarriages. For some women, the specific cause may never be identified. </P>
<P>Ultrasound has the ability to establish rapidly and accurately whether a fetus is alive or not, and to predict whether a pregnancy is likely to continue when there is bleeding. In settings where ultrasound is available, this ability has rationalised the care of women with threatened miscarriage in early pregnancy. Attempts to maintain the pregnancy are only likely to be successful if the fetus is viable, and does not have a chromosomal abnormality. This is one explanation of the high failure rate for many interventions. </P>
<P>Increased uterine activity is associated with threatened miscarriage, although whether as cause or effect is often unclear. In the nineteenth century morphine was introduced in the belief it would reduce uterine activity, and so prolong the pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Charpentier-1883" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charpentier 1883</LINK>). Morphine is no longer used for threatened miscarriage, having been replaced many years ago by two groups of drug thought to have a more specific effect in relaxing uterine smooth muscle. The first were antispasmodic drugs, such as hyoscine. Later, myometrial relaxants, often referred to as tocolytic agents, became popular. These included isoxsuprine, ritodrine, and salbutamol. </P>
<P>In the past, the use of both antispasmodic and tocolytic drugs was widely advocated. There are few reliable data on use, but these agents seem to have been particularly popular in Latin America where they were recommended in several influential textbooks (<LINK REF="REF-De-Lee-1945" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Lee 1945</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Le_x00f3_n-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">León 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwarcz-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwarcz 1986</LINK>). There is little current information about use of either group of drugs, but anecdotally they are thought to be used rarely, if at all, in the UK or USA. However, in other parts of the world their use may be more widespread. For example, in 2001, in an informal survey of 34 obstetricians from seven countries in Latin America, half reported prescribing myometrial relaxants (fenoterol, isoxsuprine) or antispasmodics (scopolamine butylbromide) for women with threatened miscarriage (<LINK REF="REF-Lede-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lede 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Myometrial relaxants are beta2-adrenoreceptor stimulants (beta-agonists), and antispasmodics are atropine-like agents derived from belladona. The hypothesis is that beta 2-adrenoreceptor stimulants decrease the intensity and frequency of uterine contractions, hence reducing the risk of miscarriage. As they also affect smooth muscle elsewhere in the body, side-effects include palpitations, increased heart rate, flushing, nausea and vomiting, low serum potassium, and an increase in blood glucose levels. There are case reports of rare but serious adverse effects of these drugs associated with intravenous or intramuscular use for prevention of preterm delivery. These include myocardial ischemia (<LINK REF="REF-Vermes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermes 1997</LINK>), neutropenia (<LINK REF="REF-Onoe-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onoe 1995</LINK>) and acute pulmonary edema (<LINK REF="REF-Coggiola-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coggiola 1982</LINK>). The risk of these occurring following threatened miscarriage, where oral use is the norm, is unclear, but is likely to be low. </P>
<P>Antispasmodic agents are an old class of drug used to treat common clinical features, such as intestinal, renal or hepatobiliary colic. They should be used with caution during pregnancy, and have considerable side-effects including dry mouth, thirst, difficulty in swallowing, flushing and cardiac arrhythmias. These drugs also cross the placenta, and can produce a variety of secondary effects, such as increased fetal heart rate. Studies on atropine in mice do not show teratogenic effects (<LINK REF="REF-USP-DI-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">USP DI 1999</LINK>), but there are few data and no well-controlled studies in humans. </P>
<P>The aim of this review is to summarise the evidence to date about the benefits and harms associated with the use of uterine muscle relaxing drugs when used for women with a threatened miscarriage.</P>

<P>Six potentially eligible studies were identified. Of these, one is included and five are excluded from the review.

<P>The only included study reported data for 170 women with threatened miscarriage between 6 and 20 weeks' gestation. This study compared buphenine hydrochloride, a beta-agonist, with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Egypt-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Egypt 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the five excluded studies, three were excluded because they were not randomised trials.

The fourth study was excluded as the intervention was not a uterine muscle relaxant drug (<LINK REF="STD-Hirahara-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hirahara 1998</LINK>).

<P>The only included study did not report methods for generation of the randomisation sequence, or for concealment of allocation. The study is reported to have been double-blind. However, despite the use of placebo both participants and care givers were likely to have been able to guess the allocation, for at least some of the women. beta-agonists increase the heart rate, and cause palpitations. The trial report states women allocated buphenine had palpitations and those allocated placebo did not, although frequencies in the two groups are not given.</P>

<P>One trial (170 women) was included, which compared a beta-agonist with placebo.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Studies evaluating uterine muscle relaxant drugs were conducted over 20 years ago. Results of the single small trial included in this review should be interpreted with considerable caution. As discussed above, the methodological quality of this study is unclear. Also, outcome after birth for the babies is not reported. Although the study reports a reduction in intrauterine death, this is difficult to interpret without any information about survival up to discharge from hospital, and beyond, and it requires confirmation in other studies. It is also important to have reassurance about any possible effects on neonatal morbidity, and on later growth and development for the child. This single study is insufficient evidence for any reliable conclusions about whether uterine muscle relaxants are worthwhile for women with threatened miscarriage.</P>
