As it is least prone to bias, vertebroplasty compared with placebo was the primary comparison. Major outcomes were mean overall pain, disability, disease-specific and overall health-related quality of life, patient-reported treatment success, new symptomatic vertebral fractures and number of other serious adverse events.</P></ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA><ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2018-02-23 23:15:20 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-03-21 08:43:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Twenty-one trials were included: five compared vertebroplasty with placebo (541 randomised participants), eight with usual care (1136 randomised participants), seven with kyphoplasty (968 randomised participants) and one compared vertebroplasty with facet joint glucocorticoid injection (217 randomised participants). Trial size varied from 46 to 404 participants, most participants were female, mean age ranged between 62.6 and 81 years, and mean symptom duration varied from a week to more than six months.</P><P>Three placebo-controlled trials were at low risk of bias and two were possibly susceptible to performance and detection bias. Other trials were at risk of bias for several criteria, most notably due to lack of participant and personnel blinding.</P><P>Compared with placebo, high- to moderate-quality evidence from five trials (one with incomplete data reported) indicates that vertebroplasty provides no clinically important benefits with respect to pain, disability, disease-specific or overall quality of life or treatment success at one month. Evidence for quality of life and treatment success was downgraded due to possible imprecision. Evidence was not downgraded for potential publication bias as only one placebo-controlled trial remains unreported. Mean pain (on a scale zero to 10, higher scores indicate more pain) was five points with placebo and 0.6 points better (0.2 better to 1 better) with vertebroplasty, an absolute pain reduction of 6% (2% better to 10% better, minimal clinical important difference is 15%) and relative reduction of 9% (3% better to14% better) (five trials, 535 participants). Mean disability measured by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (scale range zero to 23, higher scores indicate worse disability) was 14.2 points in the placebo group and 1.7 points better (0.3 better to 3.1 better) in the vertebroplasty group, absolute improvement 7% (1% to 14% better), relative improvement 10% better (3% to 18% better) (three trials, 296 participants).</P><P>Disease-specific quality of life measured by the Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO) (scale zero to 100, higher scores indicating worse quality of life) was 62 points in the placebo group and 2.75 points (3.53 worse to 9.02 better) in the vertebroplasty group, absolute change: 3% better (4% worse to 9% better), relative change: 5% better (6% worse to 15% better (two trials, 175 participants). Overall quality of life (European Quality of Life (EQ5D), zero = death to 1 = perfect health, higher scores indicate greater quality of life) was 0.38 points in the placebo group and 0.05 points better (0.01 better to 0.09 better) in the vertebroplasty group, absolute improvement: 5% (1% to 9% better), relative improvement: 18% (4% to 32% better) (three trials, 285 participants). In one trial (78 participants), 9/40 (or 225 per 1000) people perceived that treatment was successful in the placebo group compared with 12/38 (or 315 per 1000; 95% CI 150 to 664) in the vertebroplasty group, RR 1.40 (95% CI 0.67 to 2.95), absolute difference: 9% more reported success (11% fewer to 29% more); relative change: 40% more reported success (33% fewer to 195% more).</P><P>Moderate-quality evidence (low number of events) from seven trials (four placebo, three usual care, 1020 participants), up to 24 months follow-up, indicates we are uncertain whether vertebroplasty increases the risk of new symptomatic vertebral fractures (70/509 (or 130 per 1000; range 60 to 247) observed in the vertebroplasty group compared with 59/511 (120 per 1000) in the control group; RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.87)).</P><P>Similarly, moderate-quality evidence (low number of events) from five trials (three placebo, two usual care, 821 participants), indicates uncertainty around the risk of other serious adverse events (18/408 or 76 per 1000, range 6 to 156) in the vertebroplasty group compared with 26/413 (or 106 per 1000) in the control group; RR 0.64 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.12). Notably, serious adverse events reported with vertebroplasty included osteomyelitis, cord compression, thecal sac injury and respiratory failure.</P><P>Our subgroup analyses indicate that the effects did not differ according to duration of pain &#8804; 6 weeks versus &gt; 6 weeks. Including data from the eight trials that compared vertebroplasty with usual care in a sensitivity analyses altered the primary results, with all combined analyses displaying considerable heterogeneity.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-03-15 06:31:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell"><P>Based upon high- to moderate-quality evidence, our updated review does not support a role for vertebroplasty for treating acute or subacute osteoporotic vertebral fractures in routine practice. We found no demonstrable clinically important benefits compared with placebo (sham procedure) and subgroup analyses indicated that the results did not differ according to duration of pain &#8804; 6 weeks versus &gt; 6 weeks.</P><P>Sensitivity analyses confirmed that open trials comparing vertebroplasty with usual care are likely to have overestimated any benefit of vertebroplasty. Correcting for these biases would likely drive any benefits observed with vertebroplasty towards the null, in keeping with findings from the placebo-controlled trials.</P><P>Numerous serious adverse events have been observed following vertebroplasty. However due to the small number of events, we cannot be certain about whether or not vertebroplasty results in a clinically important increased risk of new symptomatic vertebral fractures and/or other serious adverse events. Patients should be informed about both the high- to moderate-quality evidence that shows no important benefit of vertebroplasty and its potential for harm.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-04-18 22:20:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Renea V Johnston"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-03-15 07:01:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell"><P><BR/></P><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-03-15 06:55:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell"><P>Vertebral compression fractures are among the most common type of fracture in patients with osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Str_x00f6_m-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ström 2011</LINK>). The estimated incidence of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures in individuals 50 years or older has been reported to be 307 per 100,000 year based upon a German study, with the rate in women aged between 85 and 89 years almost eight-fold higher that in women aged 60 to 64 years (<LINK REF="REF-Hernlund-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hernlund 2013</LINK>). The same study estimated that the direct costs associated with a new osteoporotic vertebral fracture in the first year after its occurrence is about 6490 Euros, signifying that these fractures are costly. A Swedish study estimated that the lifetime risk for a symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral fracture for a person of the age of 45 is 15% for a woman and 8% for a man (<LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2000</LINK>). In the USA, approximately 750,000 new osteoporotic vertebral fractures occur each year (<LINK REF="REF-Melton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melton 1997</LINK>).<BR/></P><P>A recent population-based study examining trends in fracture incidence over time in Olmstead County, Minnesota, observed a dramatic increase in the incidence of vertebral fractures, from 1989 to 1991 to 2009 to 2011, and this was associated with an apparent earlier onset of vertebral fracture over time (<LINK REF="REF-Amin-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amin 2014</LINK>). The vast majority of these (83.4%) were considered osteoporotic, defined in the study as resulting from no more than moderate trauma (by convention, equivalent to a fall from standing height or less). While some of the observed increase could have been partially attributable to incidentally diagnosed vertebral fractures, the findings are in keeping with a Dutch study that observed a rise in the number of emergency department visits due to osteoporotic vertebral fractures between 1986 and 2008, due to an increase in falls among the most elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Oudshoorn-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oudshoorn 2012</LINK>). The results are also consistent with a Canadian study that observed a decline in the rate of all low-trauma osteoporotic fractures over 20 years from 1986 to 2006 in the Province of Manitoba, except for vertebral fractures, which did not decline significantly in either sex (<LINK REF="REF-Leslie-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leslie 2011</LINK>).<BR/></P><P>Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures are a common cause of both acute and chronic back pain in older populations, although only about a third of radiographic osteoporotic vertebral compression deformities present with acute pain. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic osteoporotic vertebral fractures can lead to substantial spinal deformity, functional limitation, pulmonary compromise and lowered quality of life. They are associated with an increased risk of further vertebral fractures and increased mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 2008</LINK>).</P><P>Management options for treating acutely painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures are limited and include provision of adequate analgesia, bed rest and physical therapy, as well as assessment and appropriate management of osteoporosis and risk factors for further fractures such as falls prevention.

The procedure may be performed under intravenous sedation or general anaesthesia by interventional radiologists, neurosurgeons or orthopaedic surgeons. Under imaging guidance, most often fluoroscopy, a large calibre needle is inserted into the affected vertebral body usually via a transpedicular route and bone cement, usually polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), is injected (<LINK REF="REF-Hide-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hide 2004</LINK>).</P><P>Early open-label, and uncontrolled studies consistently reported dramatic immediate improvements in pain, and adverse events were reportedly uncommon (<LINK REF="REF-Hochmuth-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hochmuth 2006</LINK>).

At one month, mean disability measured by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) (scale range zero to 23, higher scores indicate worse disability) was 14.2 points in the placebo group and 1.7 points better (0.3 better to 3.1 better) in the vertebroplasty group, absolute improvement in disability 7% (1% to 14% better), relative change 10% better (3% to 18% better) (three trials, 296 participants).</P><P>At one month, disease-specific quality of life measured by the Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO) (scale zero to 100, higher scores indicating worse quality of life) was 62 points in the placebo group and 2.75 points (3.53 worse to 9.02 better) in the vertebroplasty group, absolute change: 3% better (4% worse to 9% better), relative change 5% better (6% worse to 15% better (two trials, 175 participants). At one month, overall quality of life measured by the EQ5D (0 = death to 1 = perfect health, higher scores indicate greater quality of life at one month was 0.38 points in the placebo group and 0.05 points better (0.01 better to 0.09 better) in the vertebroplasty group, absolute improvement in quality of life 5% (1% to 9% better), relative change 18% better (4% to 32% better) (three trials, 285 participants). Based upon one trial (78 participants) at one month, 9/40 (or 225 per 1000) people perceived that treatment was successful in the placebo group compared with 12/38 (or 315 per 1000; 95% CI 150 to 664) in the vertebroplasty group, RR 1.40 (95% CI 0.67 to 2.95), absolute risk difference 9% more reported success (11% fewer to 29% more); relative change 40% more reported success (33% fewer to 195% more).</P><P>Based upon moderate-quality evidence from seven trials (four placebo, three usual care, 1020 participants), with up to 24 months follow-up, we are uncertain whether or not vertebroplasty increases the risk of new symptomatic vertebral fractures (70/509 (or 130 per 1000; range 60 to 247) observed in the vertebroplasty group compared with 59/511 (120 per 1000) in the control group; RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.87)). The evidence was downgraded due to imprecision.</P><P>Similarly, based upon moderate-quality evidence from five trials (three placebo, two usual care, 821 participants), the risk of other adverse events may not differ (18/408 (or 76 per 1000, range 6 to 156) were observed in the vertebroplasty group compared with 26/413 (or 106 per 1000) in the control group; RR 0.64 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.12)). The evidence was downgraded due to imprecision. Notably, serious adverse events reported with vertebroplasty included osteomyelitis, cord compression, thecal sac injury and respiratory failure.</P><P>Our subgroup analyses provided limited evidence that the effects did not differ according to duration of pain &#8804; 6 weeks versus &gt; 6 weeks.</P><P>Including data from the eight trials that compared vertebroplasty with usual care in a sensitivity analyses altered the primary results towards favouring vertebroplasty, with all combined analyses displaying considerable heterogeneity, largely driven by the variation in results amongst the studies with a usual care comparison. These data are explainable on the basis that trials that used a usual care comparator are likely to have provided a biased overestimate of the benefits of vertebroplasty due to the lack of participant blinding. At all analysed time points (one to two weeks, one and three months), sensitivity analyses indicated significant differences in outcome for pain and disability outcomes for trials that included a placebo group in comparison to a usual care control.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Vertebroplasty versus other comparators</HEADING><P>Consistent with the sensitivity analysis, synthesis of the available data from up to six of the eight trials that compared vertebroplasty with usual care in an open design, generally favoured vertebroplasty with respect to pain and disability at all time points up to 24 months although there was considerable statistical heterogeneity across all pooled pain analyses with I<SUP>2</SUP> varying between 94% and 98%.

Eight trials reported at least some funding from medical device companies who manufacture vertebral augmentation systems, and, of these, only two reported that they had no other role in the trial.</P><P>Data from one placebo-controlled trial has only been published as a thesis (<LINK REF="STD-VOPE-2015" TYPE="STUDY">VOPE 2015</LINK>), while we could only include partial data from a second placebo-controlled trial based upon conference proceedings as it remains unpublished to date (<LINK REF="STD-VERTOS-IV" TYPE="STUDY">VERTOS IV</LINK>). A third placebo-controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-VERTOS-V" TYPE="STUDY">VERTOS V</LINK>), was recorded as completed in June 2015 at clinicaltrials.gov, but the trialists subsequently altered the recruitment status in January 2017 to state that the study is now 'enrolling by invitation', with a new estimated completion date of July 2018.</P><P>With respect to trials that have used comparators other than placebo, we classified two as ongoing, although it is unclear if the trials are completed; an additional four have been reported to have been completed but we were unable to find published results; and another four completed RCTs that likely meet inclusion criteria have only been published in Chinese and are awaiting assessment. Inclusion of the results of these trials may alter the conclusions of our second and third comparisons (vertebroplasty compared with usual care or kyphoplasty, respectively).</P><P>Vertebroplasties were performed by interventional radiologists or neuroradiologists, orthopaedic surgeons or neurosurgeons across the different trials, however the procedure itself appeared similar. Mean cement injected varied across the 17 trials that reported these data. The study populations in all included trials appeared to be representative of patients seen in routine care. The age and gender ratio were similar across all trials apart from <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2014a</LINK>, who included a younger study population. However symptom duration did vary widely across trials reflecting different philosophies on when vertebroplasty should be implemented. Some authors have suggested that vertebroplasty only be offered to patients with recent onset of pain (&lt; 6 weeks) (<LINK REF="REF-Bono-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bono 2010</LINK>). Our subgroup analysis, as well as the result of an individual patient data meta-analysis from the same two trials (<LINK REF="REF-Staples-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staples 2011</LINK>), suggests that treatment outcome is not influenced by duration of pain &#8804; 6 weeks versus &gt; 6 weeks. This supports our decision to include all trials in pooled analyses irrespective of symptom duration.</P><P>Trials varied in how they measured pain with respect to the scale used (although most used a continuous measure), time period specified and descriptors used. Only four trials included a dichotomous measure of pain. All except two trials included a measure of disability or function, with the RMDQ used most commonly (9/21 trials). Seven trials included the QUALEFFO and six included an overall generic measure of quality of life. Only two trials included a measure of patient-reported treatment success although three trials did report the number who achieved various thresholds of pain and/or disability improvement. Most trials reported on the presence of new symptomatic and/or radiologically apparent vertebral fractures (although two trials only considered adjacent fractures (<LINK REF="STD-Endres-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Endres 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogl-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vogl 2013</LINK>) and one of these also considered refracture of the treated vertebra (<LINK REF="STD-Vogl-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vogl 2013</LINK>). However other adverse events were less well-reported across trials with three trials only reporting on adverse events that occurred in the vertebroplasty group.</P><P>The RCTs included in this review also varied in terms of duration of follow-up (from two weeks to three years). For one placebo-controlled trial we only included data up to one month, despite the availability of one-year data, because of an <I>a priori</I> decision that for cross-over RCTs, we would preferentially extract data only from period before cross-over. <LINK REF="REF-Comstock-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Comstock 2013</LINK> reported that after one month, significantly fewer participants in the vertebroplasty group crossed over into the alternate group (11 of 68 participants (16%)) compared with the placebo (sham) group (38 of 63 participants (60%), P = 0.001). At one year, difference in pain favoured the vertebroplasty group (MD 1.02 (95% CI: 0.04 to 2.01); P = 0.042), but there was no evidence of an important difference in disability (MD in RMDQ 1.37 points (95% CI: 3.62 to 20.88), P = .231). In the as-treated analyses, participants treated with vertebroplasty did not differ from the placebo (sham) group in terms of either mean pain (MD 0.85 (95% CI: 2.05 to 20.35), P = 0.166) or disability (RMDQ, MD 0.66 (95% CI: 3.30 to 21.98); P = 0.625). Therefore, including data from the one-year intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis from this trial would not have appreciably altered our results. Based upon (ITT) pooled data from the two trials, at 12 months, there was no significant between-group differences with respect to mean pain (MD 0.77 (95% CI -1.85 to 3.39) (data not shown).</P><P>While the lack of significant benefits of vertebroplasty in terms of pain and disability shown in the main analysis of this review would appear to indicate that any other clinical benefits are unlikely, some (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edidin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edidin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lange-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lange 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zampini-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zampini 2010</LINK>), but not all (<LINK REF="REF-McCullough-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullough 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2011</LINK>), population or clinic-based observational studies have reported a reduction in mortality associated with spinal augmentation (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty), compared to those who were untreated. However <LINK REF="REF-McCullough-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullough 2013</LINK> demonstrated that the survival benefit observed with traditional covariate adjustments was no longer in evidence after using propensity score matching to better account for selection bias (<LINK REF="REF-McCullough-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullough 2013</LINK>), suggesting that selection bias from unrecognised confounding explains the observed survival benefit of spinal augmentation seen in other studies. Using propensity score matching <LINK REF="REF-McCullough-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullough 2013</LINK> also reported that one-year major medical complications were similar between the groups, while rates of health-care utilisation, including hospital and intensive care unit admissions and discharges to skilled nursing facilities, were higher among those treated with spinal augmentation.</P><P>Although this review did not demonstrate an increased risk of incident vertebral fractures associated with vertebroplasty, a clinically important increased risk cannot be excluded based upon our review due to the small number of events. Data from the RCTs that compared risk with vertebroplasty compared with placebo or usual care were also inconsistent as evident by the substantial statistical heterogeneity observed in the pooled analyses.</P><P>Observational studies that have compared the incidence of new vertebral fractures following vertebroplasty to the incidence in a cohort who did not receive the procedure have also reported conflicting results (<LINK REF="REF-_x00c1_lvarez-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Álvarez 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chosa-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chosa 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mundano-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mundano 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2011</LINK>). To conclusively establish whether or not there is an increased risk of further vertebral fracture, particularly adjacent fracture associated with vertebroplasty will require additional large randomised trials with extended follow-up and/or population-based studies analysed carefully to account for differences in patient selection as outlined by <LINK REF="REF-McCullough-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullough 2013</LINK>.</P><P>Based upon the randomised controlled data that we reviewed, cement leakage occurs frequently. While in most cases it does not result in symptoms, serious sequelae may occur. In our review, one trial reported one instance of cement leakage into the epidural space requiring immediate decompression. It is not possible to determine the rate of significant sequelae arising from cement leakage or embolism from our review due to the small number of events. However numerous cases of local cement leakage requiring decompression have been reported, as have reports of cement emboli requiring surgical removal from the inferior vena cava (<LINK REF="REF-Baumann-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baumann 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seo 2005</LINK>), right heart chambers (<LINK REF="REF-Caynak-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caynak 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2014</LINK>), and the right pulmonary artery (<LINK REF="REF-Fran_x00e7_ois-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">François 2003</LINK>). Cement embolism has also been reported to cause transient respiratory symptoms and death (<LINK REF="REF-Monticelli-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monticelli 2005</LINK>), and deaths from fatal fat embolism after vertebroplasty have also been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Syed-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Syed 2006</LINK>). In a post-hoc analysis of data from <LINK REF="STD-Buchbinder-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Buchbinder 2009</LINK>, there was an increased odds of cement leakage with higher volumes of injected cement (Odds Ratio (OR) 2.8; 95% CI 1.3 to 6.1), but they found no relationship between cement leakage and efficacy outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Kroon-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroon 2014</LINK>).</P><P>Complications from vertebroplasty reported in the included trials were osteomyelitis requiring surgical drainage, rib fractures, thecal sac injury requiring hospitalisation, pain-induced vasovagal reactions an acute asthma exacerbation, and fracture of a cement spur. However, as event rates were low in included trials, we cannot be certain if there are, or are not, any between-group differences for reported adverse events among the trials we reviewed. We also note that severe adverse events such as deaths due to pulmonary thromboembolism, fat embolism, extensive local cement leakage, infection and complications of anaesthesia and infection requiring surgery have all been reported in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Nakshabandi-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Nakshabandi 2011</LINK>).</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-03-15 08:04:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell"><P>The overall quality of evidence for our primary comparison (vertebroplasty versus placebo) was high for the pain and disability outcomes according to the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011b</LINK>). According to the GRADE Working Group grades of evidence, a grading of high quality of evidence indicates that further research is unlikely to change the effect estimates substantially. For the remaining outcomes, the evidence was downgraded from high to moderate due to either imprecision (i.e. 95% CIs do not exclude clinically important differences (defined as 0.074 on the 0 to 1 EQ-5D quality of life scale), or because the total number of events was small (for other outcomes). According to the GRADE Working Group grades of evidence, a grading of moderate quality of evidence indicates that further research may have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</P><P>While the available data from eight trials that compared vertebroplasty with usual care generally favoured vertebroplasty for some, but not all outcomes, they were all rated as having a high risk of performance and detection bias for self-reported outcomes due to lack of participant and personnel blinding. While recognising that blinding of participants and personnel is difficult to achieve in procedural trials, failure to blind studies of this nature is problematic as trials with unblinded assessment of subjective outcomes (such as pain and function) are estimated to exaggerate the treatment benefit by 22% on average (ratio of OR 0.78; 95% credible interval 0.65 to 0.92) (<LINK REF="REF-Savovi_x0107_-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovi&#263; 2012</LINK>). Correcting for these biases would likely drive the improvements seen with vertebroplasty over usual care, towards the null, in keeping with the findings from the placebo-controlled trials.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-01-20 22:22:00 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We believe that we identified all relevant trials following a thorough search of all major databases with no language restrictions.</P><P>Six review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion in the review, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias, and a third review author adjudicated whenever there was any discrepancy.

To avoid any bias, these papers were assessed by an independent review author to assess whether they met the inclusion criteria for this review. Neither author was involved in the data extraction or 'Risk of bias' assessment of their own trials.</P><P>In view of the potential for bias of open studies when the main outcomes are self-reported, we chose vertebroplasty compared with placebo (sham) as our primary analysis.

Subsequent to the publication of the protocol, several RCTswere published and we therefore only included RCTs or quasi-RCTs in this review.</P><P>Subsequent to publication of the protocol, we clarified the possible comparators eligible for inclusion, i.e. that we would include randomised controlled trials of vertebroplasty compared with any comparator, including sham, conservative treatment or other surgical procedures such as kyphoplasty, but would exclude trials that compared vertebroplasty to another type of vertebroplasty.</P><P><B>Differences between first version of the review and current updated version</B></P><P>We removed four trials that were classed as ongoing trials or awaiting classification in the first version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Damaskinos-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Damaskinos 2015</LINK> NCT02489825; <LINK REF="REF-Nakstad-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakstad 2008</LINK> NCT00635297; <LINK REF="REF-Nieuwenhuijse-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieuwenhuijse 2012</LINK> NTR3282; <LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2014</LINK> ChiCTR-TRC-14004835), as we subsequently discovered that percutaneous vertebroplasty was given to participants in both treatment arms and thus, when trial results become available, they will not be eligible for inclusion in this review.</P><P>Calculating number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB), or number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH), an additional person: we had planned to calculate these for outcomes that showed a statistically significant difference between groups.

The same cement was used for both procedures (Spineplex, Stryker Instruments, Kalamazoo, MI).</P><P><B>Cement directed kyphoplasty system</B></P><P>The kyphoplasty system was provided by Soteira Inc, Natick, MA. The surgical procedure began with access gained through a unilateral intrapedicular or extrapedicular approach. The curved design of the cavity creation instrument allowed the physician to drill a curved path from one pedicle, crossing the sagittal midline and stopping with the contralateral anterior quadrant of the vertebral body. The drill converted to a cavity cutting reamer <I>in situ</I>, which created a 10-mm diameter cylindrical cavity. The cement directing implant consisted of a non load-bearing, hollow, passively self-expanding cylindrical device manufactured from a textile composite of nitinol wire, polyethylene teraphthalate fibre, and polycarbonate urethane. The implant was 10 mm in diameter and 15 mm, 20 mm or 25 mm long. The size of the implant was chosen to match the length of the cavity. The implant was designed to contain initially-injected cement then regulate and direct cement flow into surrounding cancellous bone. Because the cavity was created by cutting, in contrast to bone compaction as in a balloon kyphoplasty, cement was able to penetrate into the bone beyond the boundaries of the cavity. Cement injection into the implant and directed through openings in its wall created a cement mantle in the anterior vertebral body, which extended towards the endplates and stabilised the fracture by filling cracks and voids, interdigitating with viable cancellous bone. Device placement in a centrally-located cavity provided bilateral cement flow with the vertebral body, crossing both sides of the sagittal midline using a unipedicular approach.

The patient was placed in prone position on the operating table. After local infiltration anaesthesia, a bone puncture needle was placed transpedicularly in the fractured vertebral body under a C-arm fluoroscopic monitoring. Then, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was carefully injected into the fractured vertebra with the fluoroscopic control. Injection ceased when cement reached the cortical edge of the vertebral body or leaked into the extraosseous structures or veins. If the cement did not reach the midline on the anterior-posterior fluoroscopic film, another side of injection was performed. In patients who had more than one fracture, all the fractured bodies were treated in a single procedure. After the treatment, a CT scan of the treated vertebral bodies was completed to identify cement distribution and leakage.</P><P><B>Usual care</B></P><P>Patients were confined to horizontal bed rest for the initial 2 weeks after diagnosis. Then, they were encouraged to stand up and walk with brace and assistance. The bed rest time was extended if the back pain worsened when they stood up and walked. For pain medication, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were prescribed for every patient. Additional analgesics, such as tramadol and morphine, would be added in case NSAIDs were not effective. Two weeks after diagnosis, physical therapy was started.</P><P><B>Follow-up care</B></P><P>All patients in both groups were prescribed treatment for osteoporosis including bisphosphonates, calcium supplementation, and vitamin D.</P></CHAR_INTERVENTIONS><CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2018-03-14 12:36:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell"><P>Outcomes were measured at 1 day, 1 week, 1, 3 and 6 months and 1 year.</P><P><B>Primary outcome</B></P><UL><LI>VAS mean pain score (0 to 10 cm) at one year</LI></UL><P><B>Secondary outcomes</B></P><UL><LI>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</LI><LI>Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO)</LI><LI>Patient satisfaction surveys (very satisfied, satisfied or not satisfied.

At 12 months there was complete follow-up for 130/190 (68%) in the vertebroplasty group (20 withdrew, 4 lost, 3 logistical reason, 2 other medical reason, 3 other reason, 1 due to unrelenting pain, 14 died, 13 sponsor terminated study) and 143/191 (75%) in the kyphoplasty group (11 withdrew, 4 lost, 3 other medical reason, 4 logistical reasons, 1 due to unrelenting pain, 5 other reason, 10 died, 10 sponsor terminated study). At 24 months, 91/190 (48%) participants in the vertebroplasty group had completed follow-up (23 withdrew, 10 lost, 5 logistical reason, 7 other medical reason, 3 other reason, 1 due to unrelenting pain, 21 died, 29 sponsor terminated study), and 100/191 (52%)participants in the kyphoplasty group completed follow-up (13 withdrew, 9 lost, 3 other medical reason, 9 logistical reasons, 1 due to unrelenting pain, 11 other reason, 16 died, 29 sponsor terminated study).</P><P>Overall, the reasons for the losses were similar except a higher proportion who received their assigned treatment withdrew from the vertebroplasty group (20/190; 11%) compared to the kyphoplasty group (11/191; 6%). It is unclear if the reasons for withdrawal were systematically different.</P><P>In the methods it is stated that seven participants who received vertebroplasty and 4 who received kyphoplasty underwent the alternate treatment for a subsequent vertebral fracture but the timing was not stated. It is stated that for any participant having surgery for a new vertebral fracture, the last observation before surgery was carried forward to later visits. In the results it is stated that 70/88 (79.5%) participants with a new clinically recognised fracture underwent a subsequent vertebral augmentation but these data are not presented by treatment group and the timing of further vertebral augmentation is not specified.</P></DESCRIPTION></QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY><QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY GROUP_ID="QIG-04.01" MODIFIED="2015-04-06 09:57:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell" RESULT="UNKNOWN" STUDY_ID="STD-Endres-2012"><DESCRIPTION><P>Data were unavailable for 7 participants (two deaths and five participants who refused follow-up: treatment group not specified, however data were not reported for 1 participant in the vertebroplasty, 2 in the balloon kyphoplasty group and 4 in the shield kyphoplasty group).</P></DESCRIPTION></QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY><QUALITY_ITEM_DATA_ENTRY GROUP_ID="QIG-04.01" MODIFIED="2018-01-19 20:25:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" RESULT="UNKNOWN" STUDY_ID="STD-Evans-2015"><DESCRIPTION><P>A quarter of the participants did not complete follow-up (21.8% of vertebroplasty group, 29.3% of kyphoplasty group).
