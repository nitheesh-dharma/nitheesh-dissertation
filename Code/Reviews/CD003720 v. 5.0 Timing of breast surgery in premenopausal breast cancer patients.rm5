<P>Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of mortality and morbidity and the majority of women diagnosed with breast cancer undergo treatment which includes surgical intervention, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or both. This review attempted to ascertain if the timing of tumour removal in relation to different stages of the menstrual cycle has an impact on overall survival or disease-free survival in premenopausal breast cancer patients. The follicular stage of the menstrual cycle relates to days 0 to 14, prior to ovulation. The luteal phase relates to days 15 to 35, after ovulation. If small changes in the timing of surgery could predictably improve the survival rates, any inconvenience and complexity is a small price to pay for the benefit. There were no completed randomised controlled trials comparing surgery performed during the follicular phase and the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. We identified one ongoing randomised multicentre study and three prospective observational studies.</P>
<P>Of the three prospective observational studies, one reported no survival differences between menstrual cycle groups after stratification by lymph node status at a mean follow-up of 48 months. The results showed a lack of prognostic value (recurrence-free survival and overall survival) of timing of surgery in relation to the menstrual period or to oestrogen and progesterone levels in premenopausal breast carcinoma patients. One study gave no data on mean survival time or recurrence-free survival and the third study reported no significant difference in the overall survival of patients when surgery was done in either the follicular or luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.</P>
<P>A large randomised controlled trial would be ideal to establish the influence of timing of surgery in relation to the menstrual cycle (follicular phase or luteal phase) on the prognosis of breast cancer. However, in the absence of this, the information available from the prospective observational studies shows that there is no difference in disease-free survival and overall survival in non-metastatic breast cancer patients irrespective of whether the surgery was done during the follicular or the luteal phase.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-03-10 10:13:34 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of mortality and morbidity among women in both the developed and the developing world (<LINK REF="REF-Ferlay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlay 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sasco-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sasco 2001</LINK>). The majority of women diagnosed with breast cancer undergo a multidisciplinary treatment which includes surgical intervention and radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or both. Surgery may consist of either lumpectomy or wide excision with removal of some or all the axillary lymph nodes, or a total mastectomy (which is the removal of the entire breast with some or all the axillary nodes). However, depending on the stage of the disease and the treatment given, the disease may recur, and is incurable once the person has distant metastases, although treatment will support some women to live with the recurrent disease for some years (<LINK REF="REF-Montazeri-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montazeri 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Recht-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Recht 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-02-15 10:16:37 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>In 1989, <LINK REF="REF-Hrushesky-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hrushesky 1989</LINK> suggested that the timing of breast cancer surgery in relation to the phase of the menstrual cycle might affect long-term and disease-free survival in premenopausal women with operable breast cancer. This hypothesis was formulated by their earlier studies conducted in mice. <LINK REF="REF-Ratajczak-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ratajczak 1988</LINK> reported that surgical cure was most frequent in mice when the operation was performed before and during the span of ovulation when there was a rhythmic surge of oestrogen. Fatal metastatic disease occurred when the primary tumour was resected at the time of metestrus in mice, which is comparable to the time around menstruation in women, a time of rhythmic oestrogen withdrawal.</P>
<P>The menstrual cycle can be divided into two phases, the follicular phase (days 0 to 14) and the luteal phase (days 15 to 35). The follicular phase is characterised by a pre-ovulatory rise and fall of the hormone oestrogen in the absence of progesterone, followed by ovulation. The subsequent luteal phase is characterised by an increase in oestrogen and a concurrent rise in progesterone. Biologists have documented robust rhythmic changes in the breast during the menstrual cycle and have suggested that circulating hormones at the time of surgery may have potential implications for the success of a surgical intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Hagen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kurebayashi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurebayashi 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pujol-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pujol 2001</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-03-10 10:13:13 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Researchers have suggested different explanations for the biological mechanism. Firstly, during the follicular phase low serum progesterone might decrease cell adhesiveness thereby increasing the chances of cell seeding at operation. Secondly, increased secretion of growth factors in the follicular phase is believed to increase the chance of cancer cells being implanted in other organs. A possible mediator might be insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), a potent mitogen for breast cancer cells, since stimulation of IGF-I expression by oestrogens has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Lippman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lippman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1990</LINK>). Thirdly, decreased activity of natural killer cells may favour metastases during the follicular phase of the cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Sulke-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sulke 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1982</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-03-10 10:13:12 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>The importance of timing of breast cancer surgery in relation to the menstrual cycle and its effect on survival rate still remains speculative. The notion that surgery during the luteal phase improves survival outcomes is shown to be inconsistent in the retrospective and prospective studies conducted so far (<LINK REF="REF-Chaudhry-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaudhry 2006</LINK>). In addition, other factors such as menstrual pattern, lymph node status, hormone receptor expression (oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status), tumour grading and differentiation, tumour size and types of treatments may also influence the survival rate (<LINK REF="REF-Badwe-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badwe 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Badwe-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badwe 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fish-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fish 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hortobagi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hortobagi 2002</LINK>). Obviously if small changes in the timing of surgery could predictably improve the survival rates, the inconvenience and complexity is a small price to pay relative to the benefit. This review evaluated whether the timing of surgery can influence the overall and disease-free survival of premenopausal women with operable breast cancer, keeping in view the fact that the above mentioned factors may also influence the outcome.</P>

<P>The study by Pujol (<LINK REF="STD-Pujol-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pujol 2001</LINK>) analysed 487 premenopausal patients with non-metastatic primary breast carcinoma, of which 360 patients were eligible for analysis. Patients had a tumour size of either T1, T2, T3 or T4 with the majority of the patients having T2. Lymph node involvement was either N 0, 1 to 2 or &gt; 2, with the majority of the patients having no lymph node involvement; the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) grade was 1, 2 or 3, with the majority of the patients with SBR grade 2. The seriousness of breast cancer is determined by the SBR grade, which depends upon the three histological parameters: nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic score and tubular differentiation.</P>
<P>Patients who were excluded from the study included those with preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy, metastasis, had used oral contraceptives less than one month before surgery, perimenopausal women and pregnant women. Patients however had radiotherapy or chemotherapy post surgery depending on the oestrogen receptor (ER) status and node involvement. In this study, serum estradiol, progesterone, follicular stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone levels were assayed on the day of surgery to define the menstrual cycle phase. Patients were then followed up for a mean period of 48 months.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Thorpe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Thorpe 2008</LINK> recruited 611 patients to the Intervention, Timing and Surgery (ITS) study between February 1993 and December 2000. This was a multicentre study conducted across 24 UK sites and one Italian site. The median age of patients was 43 years (range 19 to 55 years). The last menstrual period (LMP) was categorised according to the menstrual cycle phase definitions of <LINK REF="REF-Senie-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senie 1991</LINK> (follicular phase: 0 to 14 days; luteal phase: 15 to 36 days); <LINK REF="REF-Badwe-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badwe 1991</LINK> (follicular phase: 3 to 12 days; luteal phase: 0 to 2 days); and <LINK REF="REF-Hrushesky-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hrushesky 1989</LINK> (perimenstrual: 0 to 6 days and 21 to 32 days; mid-cycle: 7 to 20 days). Patients were categorised as being in either the follicular or the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle at the time of intervention using the LMP, first menstrual period after surgery (FMP), hormonal profile at the time of the intervention as well as menstrual cycle length and variation, in order to identify as accurately as possible the patient's phase of the menstrual cycle at the time of intervention. This categorisation was performed by an independent expert who was blinded to the patients&#8217; outcomes. To ensure that each menstrual cycle group had an adequate number of patients (that is 60 to 65 patients per group) and number of events for the analysis, 412 patients were recruited to the primary analysis group. These patients had regular cycles and no oral contraceptives were taken six months prior to entering the study.</P>
<P>The types of surgery included excision biopsy, lumpectomy and mastectomy. The majority of patients had a lumpectomy (47.8%), followed by a mastectomy (33.5%) and an excision biopsy (18%). Fourteen per cent of the tumours were grade I, 42% were grade II and 40% were grade III while 51% were node positive.</P>
<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Grant-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2009</LINK> (North Central Cancer Treatment Group, N9431) 1118 women were initially enrolled (from July 1996 until December 2001), of which the eligible cohort comprised of 834 women who had stages I and II breast cancer and had either single (720 women) or two surgical procedures (114 women). At the time of the surgical procedure, 230 patients (28%) were classified to be at the luteal phase (serum progesterone (Pg) level &#8805; 5 ng/ml) and 363 patients (44%) were in the follicular phase (serum Pg level &#8804; 3 ng/ml, before cycle day 21). Approximately 241 patients were categorised as other (17% were anovulatory, for 9% of patients the luteal phase was unclear, 2% had oligoovulatory, 1% had persistent corpus luteum and another 1% had contradictory information and could not be classified).</P>

<P>The main bias of this review was the lack of randomised controlled trials on the topic. Although this review identified one incomplete randomised controlled trial, the method of randomisation and other methodological qualities of this trial could not be verified owing to the incomplete information in the abstract. Furthermore, the relevant outcomes were not reported.</P>
<P>In one prospective observational study, patients were entered into the trial (from 1992 to 1995) after obtaining informed consent from the patients. It was a single centre study conducted at the Montpellier Cancer Center, France (<LINK REF="STD-Pujol-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pujol 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Initially 487 premenopausal patients were selected but only 360 were eligible for the study. Twenty-six per cent (127/487) of the patients were excluded as they did not meet the eligibility criteria. The sample size calculation was performed a priori and 354 patients were estimated to have a power of 90%. The study had 186 patients who underwent surgery during the follicular phase, 24 patients during their ovulatory phase and 150 patients during the luteal phase.</P>
<P>The hormonal phase of the menstrual cycle was determined on the day of the surgery; however potential bias may have occurred in assigning the patients to a definite time for surgery due to prior knowledge of the patients' characteristics. If the assignment of patients to a definite time for surgery had been handled by an independent person, not involved the study, it may have resulted in less bias during the assignment to surgery. Similar bias may have occurred in the <LINK REF="STD-Grant-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2009</LINK> study.</P>
<P>There was no blinding of patients or surgeons in the study (<LINK REF="STD-Pujol-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pujol 2001</LINK>). During the length of the study (48 months), only two patients were lost to follow up.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2011-03-29 15:09:59 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>This review did not identify any randomised controlled trials. However, there was one ongoing randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Galimberti-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Galimberti 1997</LINK>; Zurrida 2001) focusing on the time of surgery for operable breast cancer. This trial was being undertaken in Italy and no results have been published to date. The status of this trial will be assessed when we next update the review.</P>
<P>While writing our protocol, we did not set a priori conditions for studies of lower quality in the case of insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials. However, considering the importance of this question and the current knowledge gaps, we felt it was worthwhile to include a narrative description of the evidence from the existing prospective studies.</P>
<P>We did not find any controlled clinical trials. Three prospective observational studies involving a cohort of patients who underwent surgical procedures at different phases of the menstrual cycle were identified (<LINK REF="STD-Grant-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pujol-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pujol 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thorpe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Thorpe 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Pujol-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pujol 2001</LINK> had relevant data on recurrence-free survival at one, two, three, four and five years. The data were extracted from the Kaplan Meier curves (comparisons 1:01 and 1:02). The recurrence, where an OR &gt; 1 favours the luteal phase at one year was: OR 0.86 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.08), two years: OR 0.87 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.09), three years: OR 0.95 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.21), four years: OR 1.12 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.43), and five years: OR 1.12 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.43) (refer to <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The study reported that the risk of recurrence was similar whether surgery was completed during the follicular or the luteal phase; patients had non-metastatic breast cancer with a tumour size &gt; 2 cm (T1, T2, T3, T4) with or without node involvement (N0, N1, N2, N3) and a SBR grade 1, 2 or 3.</P>
<P>The study also reported that there were no survival differences between menstrual cycle groups when stratified by lymph node status (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The results showed a lack of prognostic value (that is recurrence-free survival and overall survival) of timing of surgery in relation to the menstrual period or oestrogen and progesterone concentrations in premenopausal breast carcinoma patients. <BR/>
</P>
<P>In addition, there was no relationship between the menstrual phase at time of surgery and tumour size, cathepsin D level, SBR grade, progesterone receptor status and the number of positive lymph nodes. In the multivariate analysis, the lack of lymph node involvement, presence of progesterone receptors and low concentrations of luteinising hormone predicted a longer overall survival independent of other factors (lymph node status: RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 4.2, P &lt; 0.01; progesterone status: RR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.0, P = 0.06; luteinising hormone concentration: RR 3.6, 95% CI 1.4 to 9.0, P &lt; 0.01). There was no difference in survival between the different menstrual groups even after stratification by lymph node status.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Thorpe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Thorpe 2008</LINK>, the median follow up was 59 months (inter-quartile range 43 to 78 months). In this analysis, timing of surgery during the menstrual cycle had no significant impact on the three-year overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 1.02, 95% CI 0.995 to 1.04, P = 0.14) and three-year disease-free survival (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.02, P = 0.92). The study attributed the insignificant result as possibly due to 97% of patients receiving some form of adjuvant therapy. When menstrual cycle was categorised into follicular or luteal phase according to the hormone profiles with LMP and FMP data, 17.7% of patients (73/412) could not be identified as being either in the follicular or the luteal phase and 19.9% of patients (82/412) did not have hormonal data for their first operation and one patient received neoadjuvant therapy only during the primary analysis group. Therefore only 256 patients (62%) were included in the analysis. The study reported no significant difference in the overall survival of patients when surgery was done in the follicular or the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The data extrapolated from the graph showed that at three years the proportion of patients who were at risk was 87% in the luteal phase compared to 82.8% in the follicular phase.</P>
<P>Similar results were also reported by a recent, large prospective study by <LINK REF="STD-Grant-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2009</LINK>. Overall survival and disease-free survival did not differ with respect to the menstrual phase at surgery for patients classified as in the follicular or luteal menstrual phase or in an indeterminate category. Five-year OS rates were 91.9% (95% CI 89.1% to 94.8%), 92.2% (95% CI 88.7% to 95.9%) and 91.8% (95% CI 88.2% to 95.5%); and the 5-year DFS rates were 82.7% (95% CI 78.7% to 86.8%), 82.1% (95% CI 77.1% to 87.5%) and 79.2% (95% CI 73.9% to 84.7%) among women who had surgery during the follicular, luteal or indeterminate phases, respectively. The HR for DFS (follicular versus luteal) was 0.88 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.26, P = 0.498). The authors also performed an analysis based on nodal disease, ER status, adjuvant radiation therapy, adjuvant chemotherapy and menstrual phase at surgery. They reported that there was no association with DFS (adjusted HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.19, P = 0.319; n = 587). Based on the ER status (ER-positive and ER-negative cohorts) the HRs differed for the follicular versus luteal phases (ER-positive cohort: HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.87; ER-negative cohort: HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.93).</P>
<P>Overall survival (OS) did not differ when the analysis was adjusted for nodal disease and ER tumour status (follicular versus luteal HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.71, P = 0.985). For patients with an ER-positive status (n = 417) the HR was 1.46 (95% CI 0.68 to 3.16) compared to the ER-negative patient group (n = 173) with an HR of 0.78 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.68), however the results were insignificant.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-03-29 15:09:24 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Although a large randomised controlled trial would have been ideal to establish the influence of timing of surgery in relation to the menstrual cycle (follicular phase or luteal phase) on the prognosis of breast cancer, the information currently available from the prospective observational studies shows that there is no difference in disease-free survival and overall survival in non-metastatic breast cancer patients irrespective of whether the surgery was done during the follicular or the luteal phase. There was also no significant difference in the overall survival and disease-free survival based on the nodal disease and ER status of the patients.</P>
<P>Data from various excluded retrospective studies showed conflicting results. Some studies reported that premenopausal patients operated on during the luteal phase had a significantly better prognosis than patients operated on during the follicular phase (<LINK REF="STD-Cooper-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cooper 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldhirsch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Goldhirsch 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saad-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Saad 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veronesi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Veronesi 1994</LINK>) whereas other studies suggested no benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Gnant-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Gnant 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harlap-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Harlap 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jager-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jager 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milella-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Milella 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mondini-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mondini 1997</LINK>) or favoured surgery during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (<LINK REF="STD-Normura-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Normura 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sainsbury-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sainsbury 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takeda-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Takeda 2001</LINK>). Some studies reported that the beneficial effect observed during the follicular phase was restricted to patients with node-positive disease while other studies found that the phase interacted with oestrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone (PR) status or with tumour size (<LINK REF="STD-Milella-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Milella 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Fentiman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fentiman 2002</LINK>) was designed to study prognostic factors of early breast cancer and part of this study included the timing of surgery. Blood was taken and frozen serum stored from 471 premenopausal patients. For 289 patients, this was undertaken during four days of surgery and the last menstrual period (LMP) was known in 81% (234/289) of the patients. Both estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) were measured by radioimmunoassay. For those patients with the known LMP, there was no relationship between the phase of the cycle and serum E2 because of wide inter-individual variations, but P values showed a correlation for 92% of patients in the follicular phase (&#8804; 4 ng/mL-1) and 56% of those patients in the putative luteal phase (&#8805; 4 ng/mL-1).</P>
<P>One of the limitations in these studies is that the menstrual history data are often inaccurate and therefore unreliable; studies lack adequate procedures to record hormonal assessment before the surgery, which may potentially lead to misclassification of the patient's menstrual phase. Various treatments (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) are given pre and postsurgery, which may further influence outcome. It was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Pujol-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pujol 2001</LINK> that discrepancies existed between hormonal measures and the dates of the LMP. If hormonal measurements were not taken, 16% of the population would have been misclassified as in the follicular phase and 36% in the luteal phase. According to <LINK REF="STD-Pujol-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pujol 2001</LINK>, the high incidence of misclassification is due to a higher incidence of an anovulatory cycle in aging premenopausal women. Another reason is the variations in the definitions (that is cut off points) of follicular and luteal phases in the current literature, which can lead to false positive results. It is therefore important for researchers in this field to standardise the cut off points during the menstrual cycle and also use hormonal measurements to define phases of the menstrual cycle in future studies.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Thorpe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Thorpe 2008</LINK>, the menstrual cycle was categorised into the follicular or the luteal phase according to hormonal profiles and LMP and FMP data and only 256 patients (62.1%) were included in the analysis. This was due to either unavailable hormonal data or the incorrect identification of the follicular or the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In the recent study of <LINK REF="STD-Grant-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2009</LINK>, 29% of the patients were classified as indeterminate.</P>
<P>The findings from the retrospective studies have resulted in uncertainty and confusion amongst surgeons and patients. However the results obtained from prospective studies show that it is unlikely that there is a difference in overall survival and disease-free survival in patients undergoing surgery during the follicular or the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.</P>

All three trials reported no relationship between the menstrual phase during which surgery was undertaken and overall survival or recurrent-free survival. <LINK REF="STD-Pujol-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pujol 2001</LINK> had relevant data on recurrence-free survival at one, two, three, four and five years and results showed that the risk of recurrence was similar whether the surgery was undertaken during the follicular or the luteal phase for patients with non-metastatic breast cancer with tumour size &gt;2 cm (T1,T2, T3, T4), with or without node involvement (N0, N1, N2, N3), and SBR grade 1, 2 or 3. <LINK REF="STD-Thorpe-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Thorpe 2008</LINK> reported no difference in the overall survival when surgery was done during either the follicular or the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Data extrapolated from their graph showed that at three years, the proportion of patients at risk was 82.8% during the follicular phase and 87% during the luteal phase. Similar results were also reported by <LINK REF="STD-Grant-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2009</LINK>, showing that the results from prospective studies are consistent in their findings.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-02-12 19:30:57 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review highlighted the lack of complete and applicable evidence concerning the time of breast surgery in premenopausal breast cancer patients. One conference abstract of a randomised controlled trial (a multicentre study) was identified which recruited 216 patients, however no results were reported and our attempts to contact the author and ascertain the current state of the trial were unsuccessful.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-02-12 19:31:30 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review draws attention to the lack of randomised controlled trials on the timing of breast surgery in premenopausal breast cancer patients and thus identifies a lack of high quality evidence. However, the limited evidence available from non-randomised prospective studies provides a good indication of the direction of the evidence.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-02-12 19:32:47 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is currently no evidence indicating that timing of surgery during the follicular or the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle can benefit patients with regard to overall and recurrence-free survival. Evidence from three prospective observational studies shows that there is no difference in overall and disease-free survival for non-metastatic or metastatic breast cancer patients whether the surgery was done during the follicular or luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Therefore, scheduling of breast cancer operations based on the menstrual cycle is not justified unless further evidence is forthcoming.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-03-29 15:13:22 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>It would have been ideal if a high quality randomised controlled trial had been completed in order to solve the controversy surrounding whether or not the timing of surgery influences the patient's overall and disease-free survival.</P>
<P>It is vital that researchers discuss and standardise an acceptable definition for the follicular and the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle before embarking on a trial. Since there is a potential for misclassifying the menstrual phases, confirmation should be done by taking hormonal measurements in future trials.</P>
<P>Some researchers believe that a beneficial effect is dependent on the oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positive or negative status, tumour size, node involvement and metastases, hence it is important to note these patient characteristics in a trial so that a stratified analysis can be done.</P>
<P>It would also be worthwhile to investigate if delaying surgery would pose any further harm to patients. <BR/>

<P>In 1997, 94 patients were operated on during the follicular phase and 122 during the luteal phase. Of the follicular phase patients, 50 patients received conservative surgery and 19 patients underwent a mastectomy; amongst the luteal phase patients, 62 received conservative surgery and 28 underwent a mastectomy. Pathological data for patients in the follicular phase are: T1 = 34, T2 = 34, T3 = 1; for the luteal phase: T1 = 49, T2 = 38, T3 = 3. Axillary nodes were involved in 35 follicular phase patients and 53 luteal phase patients. The other cases were N0. Oestrogen receptors were positive in 35 in the follicular phase and 39 in the luteal phase and the data are still being elaborated on for a further 22.</P>
<P>In 2001, further data were published in a review by Zurrida (2001). It included 768 patients were operated for breast cancer and data were available for 711 patients. Patients who underwent surgery during the luteal phase = 389 and during the follicular phase = 322.</P>
