<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-10-27 15:02:46 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Breast cancer may spread and recur in the bones. This may cause fractures, pain and high calcium in the bloodstream (known as complications).</P>
<P>Medicines for osteoporosis may prevent these complications and may help cure cancer by reducing cancer growth in the bone. These medicines are called 'bisphosphonates'. A newer type is called &#8216;denosumab&#8217;. Bisphosphonates or denosumab are given in addition to other cancer treatment medications. These may be given along with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or radiotherapy.</P>
<P>
<B>Study questions</B>
</P>
<P>The goal of bisphosphonates and denosumab differs based on the women's breast cancer status.</P>
<P>We asked three main questions:</P>
<P>1. For <B>women with early breast cancer (EBC)</B>, can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone? Will adding this medicine to anticancer treatments allow women to live longer (improve survival)?</P>
<P>2. For <B>women with advanced breast cancer which does not appear to involve the bone (ABC)</B>, can bisphosphonates reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to the bone and improve survival? Will bisphosphonates reduce complications and improve quality of life?</P>
<P>3. For <B>women with metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the bone (BCBM),</B> can bisphosphonates or denosumab reduce the risk of complication, and improve quality of life and survival?</P>
<P>
<B>Study Results</B>
</P>
<P>We found 44 studies involving 37,302 participants. We included studies published by September 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study results for women with early breast cancer (EBC)</B>
</P>
<P>For women with EBC, we included 17 studies with 26,129 participants. The women&#8217;s health was monitored for at least 12 months from the start of the study. Some studies monitored women for 10 years.</P>
<P>The studies tested different types of bisphosphonate drugs and denosumab, and different doses of these drugs. Some studies compared the drugs to no treatment. Some studies used oral medications. Other studies gave the medicine as an injection into a vein or under the skin.</P>
<P>Bisphosphonates probably lowered the risk of cancer spreading to the bone.</P>
<P>Bisphosphonates were found to improve survival, but the benefit in the whole group of women was small. Postmenopausal women had a benefit from bisphosphonates with improved survival and reduced risk of cancer returning. Premenopausal women did not have improved survival or reduced risk of the cancer returning. New studies that test bisphosphonates by the women's menopausal status are awaited.</P>
<P>We await the reporting of data on survival and other important outcomes from denosumab trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Study results for women with advanced breast cancer (ABC)</B>
</P>
<P>For women with ABC that had not spread to the bone, we included three studies enrolling 330 participants. All three studies compared oral bisphosphonates to no treatment.</P>
<P>Bisphosphonates did not reduce the risk of cancer spreading to the bone or improve survival. Very little information was available on complications and quality of life from only one study.</P>
<P>
<B>Study results for women with metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the bone (BCBM)</B>
</P>
<P>For women with BCBM, we included 24 studies enrolling 10,853 participants. Their health was monitored for at least 12 months. Some women were followed for 24 months. Most studies compared bisphosphonates to receiving no medication.</P>
<P>Bisphosphonates reduced complications (fractures and bone pain). Bisphosphonates did not appear to increase the length of time women survived. Quality of life scores were slightly better for women receiving bisphosphonates compared to similar women having no bisphosphonates.</P>
<P>Denosumab reduced the risk of complications compared to bisphosphonates in the three studies that collected these data. There was no benefit in survival from denosumab in the one study that collected data.</P>
<P>
<B>Side effects for women with all types of breast cancer</B>
</P>
<P>Side effects were uncommon and mild. There was a rare risk of damage to the jaw bone (&#8220;osteonecrosis of the jaw&#8221;).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Overall, most of the evidence was moderate to high-quality. This means that we are fairly confident in the findings.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-10-27 15:01:20 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-10-25 18:07:29 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>Bone is the most common site of metastatic disease associated with breast cancer (BC). Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and novel targeted therapies such as denosumab inhibit other key bone metabolism pathways. We have studied these agents in both early breast cancer and advanced breast cancer settings. This is an update of the review originally published in 2002 and subsequently updated in 2005 and 2012.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-10-25 13:40:58 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>To assess the effects of bisphosphonates and other bone agents in addition to anti-cancer treatment: (i) in women with early breast cancer (EBC); (ii) in women with advanced breast cancer without bone metastases (ABC); and (iii) in women with metastatic breast cancer and bone metastases (BCBM).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-10-09 20:10:08 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review update, we searched Cochrane Breast Cancer's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 19 September 2016.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-10-25 13:41:00 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing: (a) one treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent with the same treatment without a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent; (b) treatment with one bisphosphonate versus treatment with a different bisphosphonate; (c) treatment with a bisphosphonate versus another bone-acting agent of a different mechanism of action (e.g. denosumab); and (d) immediate treatment with a bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent versus delayed treatment of the same bisphosphonate/bone-acting agent.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-10-25 18:24:42 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence. The primary outcome measure was bone metastases for EBC and ABC, and a skeletal-related event (SRE) for BCBM. We derived risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and the meta-analyses used random-effects models. Secondary outcomes included overall survival and disease-free survival for EBC; we derived hazard ratios (HRs) for these time-to-event outcomes where possible. We collected toxicity and quality-of-life information. GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes in each treatment setting.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-10-27 15:01:20 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>We included 44 RCTs involving 37,302 women.</P>
<P>In women with EBC, bisphosphonates were associated with a reduced risk of bone metastases compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate (RR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03, 11 studies; 15,005 women; moderate-quality evidence with no significant heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates provided an overall survival benefit with time-to-event data (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99; P = 0.04; 9 studies; 13,949 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity). Subgroup analysis by menopausal status showed a survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.90; P = 0.001; 4 studies; 6048 women; high-quality evidence with no evidence of heterogeneity) but no survival benefit for premenopausal women (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22; P = 0.78; 2 studies; 3501 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). There was evidence of no effect of bisphosphonates on disease-free survival (HR 0.94, 95% 0.87 to 1.02; P = 0.13; 7 studies; 12,578 women; high-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity present) however subgroup analyses showed a disease-free survival benefit from bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women only (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.91; P &lt; 0.001; 7 studies; 8314 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity). Bisphosphonates did not significantly reduce the incidence of fractures when compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.08, P = 0.13, 6 studies, 7602 women; moderate-quality evidence due to wide confidence intervals). We await mature overall survival and disease-free survival results for denosumab trials.</P>
<P>In women with ABC without clinically evident bone metastases, there was no evidence of an effect of bisphosphonates on bone metastases (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43; P = 0.86; 3 studies; 330 women; moderate-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) or overall survival (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09; P = 0.28; 3 studies; 330 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonates however the confidence intervals were wide. One study reported a trend towards an extended period of time without a SRE with bisphosphonate compared to placebo (low-quality evidence). One study reported quality of life and there was no apparent difference in scores between bisphosphonate and placebo (moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>In women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduced the SRE risk by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95; P = 0.003; 9 studies; 2810 women; high-quality evidence with evidence of heterogeneity) compared with placebo/no bisphosphonates. This benefit persisted when administering either intravenous or oral bisphosphonates versus placebo. Bisphosphonates delayed the median time to a SRE with a median ratio of 1.43 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.58; P &lt; 0.00001; 9 studies; 2891 women; high-quality evidence with no heterogeneity) and reduced bone pain (in 6 out of 11 studies; moderate-quality evidence) compared to placebo/no bisphosphonate. Treatment with bisphosphonates did not appear to affect overall survival (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; P = 0.85; 7 studies; 1935 women; moderate-quality evidence with significant heterogeneity). Quality-of-life scores were slightly better with bisphosphonates than placebo at comparable time points (in three out of five studies; moderate-quality evidence) however scores decreased during the course of the studies. Denosumab reduced the risk of developing a SRE compared with bisphosphonates by 22% (RR 0.78, 0.72 to 0.85; P &lt; 0.001; 3 studies, 2345 women). One study reported data on overall survival and observed no difference in survival between denosumab and bisphosphonate.</P>
<P>Reported toxicities across all settings were generally mild. Osteonecrosis of the jaw was rare, occurring less than 0.5% in the adjuvant setting (high-quality evidence).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-10-25 16:54:54 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>For women with EBC, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of bone metastases and provide an overall survival benefit compared to placebo or no bisphosphonates. There is preliminary evidence suggestive that bisphosphonates provide an overall survival and disease-free survival benefit in postmenopausal women only when compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate. This was not a planned subgroup for these early trials, and we await the completion of new large clinical trials assessing benefit for postmenopausal women. For women with BCBM, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of developing SREs, delay the median time to an SRE, and appear to reduce bone pain compared to placebo or no bisphosphonate.</P>

<P>Breast cancer is the most common cancer, and the most common cause of cancer death in women worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>
<I>; </I>
<LINK REF="REF-Ferlay-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlay 2015</LINK>). Bone is the most common site of metastatic involvement, affecting more than half of women during the course of their disease (<LINK REF="REF-Scheid-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheid 1986</LINK>). Although survival is better in women with advanced breast cancer (ABC) if their metastases are confined to bone (<LINK REF="REF-Coleman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 1987</LINK>), bone metastases cause significant morbidity due to pain, pathological fracture, hypercalcaemia and spinal cord compression, as well as contributing to mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Coleman-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 1985</LINK>). Breast cancers with bone metastases (BCBM) are predominantly osteolytic (50%) or mixed osteolytic and osteoblastic (40%), with only a small proportion (about 10%) being osteoblastic alone (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pathophysiology of bone metastases includes increased bone turnover, imbalance and uncoupling of the processes of resorption and remodelling (<LINK REF="REF-Kanis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 1995</LINK>). Osteoclasts are primarily responsible for the bone resorption of lytic metastases (<LINK REF="REF-Mundy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mundy 1997</LINK>) and are involved in a complex osteolytic cycle that involves parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-&#954;B ligand (RANK-L), osteoprotegerin (OPG), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b) and many other transcription factors. Tumours secrete PTHrP that stimulates osteoblasts, which respond by secreting RANK-L and inhibiting OPG. The increased RANK-L/OPG gradient drives the activation of osteoclasts, which in turn produces TGF-b and other growth factors, all having a profound effect on tumour growth. In this way, tumour and osteoclasts are engaged in a self-perpetuating cycle, where tumour and osteoclasts provide fuel for each other (<LINK REF="REF-Kozlow-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kozlow 2005</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-10-09 20:50:18 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Before the era of bisphosphonates, the management of symptomatic bone disease depended on analgesics, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy and chemotherapy. Despite these frequently effective treatments, progressive skeletal destruction often leads to ongoing symptoms and deterioration of quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Mundy-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mundy 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1997</LINK>). They are effective in conditions characterised by osteoclast-mediated bone resorption such as Paget's disease and osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1999</LINK>). In malignancy, they have become standard treatment for tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Body-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Body 1998</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-10-09 20:52:06 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>RCTs have shown that in multiple myeloma, breast cancer and prostate cancer, bisphosphonates reduce bone pain, improve quality of life, and reduce the number of and time to skeletal-related event (SREs) (<LINK REF="REF-Bloomfield-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloomfield 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Body-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Body 1998</LINK>). In addition, pre-clinical work has suggested that bisphosphonates have an anti-tumour activity, acting through inhibiting cell migration and invasion, and inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells (<LINK REF="REF-Hiraga-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiraga 2004</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-10-09 20:56:55 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is therefore of interest to examine the adjuvant role of bisphosphonates in women with early breast cancer (EBC). Aside from bisphosphonates, many novel agents that specifically target the vicious cycle of bone metastases are being developed. Whilst many are still in the early stages of drug development, RANK-ligand inhibitor denosumab has already completed phase III clinical trials in breast and prostate cancers (<LINK REF="REF-Fizazi-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fizazi 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stopeck-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Stopeck 2010</LINK>). It is with great anticipation that we see where denosumab, with superior efficacy and good tolerability, fits in to clinical practice for women with BCBM.</P>
<P>The aim of this systematic review was to identify, describe and summarise high-quality evidence regarding the use of bisphosphonates and other bone agents in women with early, advanced and metastatic breast cancer. This review was first published in 2002 and was updated in 2005, 2007, 2012 and now in 2017.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-10-25 10:26:57 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias (2016 update: BOC, MLW or AG). A third review author resolved any disagreements by consensus (AG). For recent review updates, we assessed the studies by using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool as outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We used the standard 'Risk of bias' tables by default to describe a detailed appraisal of the study with focus on the selection bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment), measurement bias (blinding), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data analysis), selective outcome reporting and other identified sources of bias. We thoroughly searched each study for these risk of bias domains and extracted information for the purpose of a critical appraisal. We rated each domain as either 'low risk' or 'high risk' of bias. Where the primary references did not provide sufficient details, we resorted to secondary references, abstracts, presentations or protocols. Where there was still insufficient information despite attempts to clarify details, we rated the domain as having an 'unclear risk' of bias.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2017-10-25 11:17:36 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina L Willson">
<P>For the outcome measure of SREs, we have relied on the total number of SREs reported in each paper, in preference to adding together the numbers of each type of SRE. Unfortunately, the reporting of SREs, and in particular the rate of events over time, varied across the studies. Methodology reviews of multiple event reporting such as events per person per year, which assume constant event rates per participant in a given time, have been criticised as providing inaccurate methods for reporting SRE rates within bisphosphonate studies (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2001</LINK>). Consistent methods of multiple event analyses suitable for bisphosphonate studies were described but are yet to be consistently used in the more recent studies (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1982</LINK>). Only a post-hoc re-analysis of the single zoledronate versus pamidronate study reported SRE rates calculated in this way (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to the differences in the way outcomes were reported, we have reported SRE data as number of events during the studied period and risk ratios (RRs), and as time to events. We have expressed the size of the difference between time-to-event distributions as the ratio of the median time to event in the experimental arm over the same outcome in the comparator arm. For a time to SRE, a value over 1.0 suggests superiority for the experimental arm and a value under 1.0 suggests superiority for the comparator arm. We have not formally combined these ratios of SRE rates. Unlike previous versions of this review, this update has presented the median time to a SRE for bisphosphonates versus control as a meta-analysis. We used the method proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Michiels-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michiels 2005</LINK> by calculating the ratio of the medians and presenting these on a log scale using the general inverse variance method in Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5) (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the endpoint of recurrence in EBC studies, the trial authors often reported recurrence together with death (recurrence-free survival) or partitioned into bone metastases, visceral metastases and locoregional recurrence. Since this endpoint needed to be integrated from different components to form an aggregate, for the purpose of this review we have clearly defined recurrence as locoregional plus distant metastases only, and have not included a new primary, contralateral or ipsilateral breast cancer. We have cross-checked the recurrent events by summing up the specified events where the numbers were provided by the trial authors. We have been cautious to include the first event per participant only, so that participants with more than one type of recurrence have not been counted twice. We derived a pooled RR with 95% confidence interval (CI). In addition, we have not presented this outcome as a hazard ratio (HR) due to many studies failing to report the outcome as such and the substantial variation in reporting results across studies.</P>
<P>For the outcome measures of disease-free survival and overall survival in early breast cancer studies, we derived the HR, as it is the most appropriate statistic. When possible, we extracted the HR and associated variances directly from the trial publication(s) or they were provided by the trial authors. If it was not reported, we obtained it indirectly employing the methods described by Tierney and colleagues using other available summary statistics (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1506110210085638280979547544922&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Tierney-2007">Tierney 2007</A>). A HR less than 1.0 favoured the experimental arm. In addition to reporting these outcomes as time to event, we reported data as events and RRs for each study based on reporting preferences in the previous version of this review. In this review update, we have presented data as both time-to-event data and dichotomous outcomes for comparison.</P>
<P>For the outcome measures of bone pain and quality of life, the data reported by the trial authors were particularly varied, with some studies utilising nominal visual analogue scales and others using validated questionnaires such as the EORTC-QLQ-C30 or Brief Pain Inventory. We have restricted the description and synthesis to those studies from which we have extracted suitable data. We have only included, in the relevant tables, studies for which these outcomes were directly assessed. We have used a qualitative scale to summarise their judgment of whether the results indicated a significant difference, a trend or no difference in bone pain and quality of life between groups.</P>
<P>For toxicity, we have reported adverse events descriptively in Tables.</P>

<P>In the adjuvant setting, <LINK REF="STD-ABCSG_x002d_12-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ABCSG-12 2011</LINK> was a two-by-two factorial trial that randomised women to either anastrozole or tamoxifen with or without zoledronate. For the purpose of this review, we included data for the zoledronate versus no-zoledronate comparison. <LINK REF="STD-GAIN-2013" TYPE="STUDY">GAIN 2013</LINK> was also a two-by-two factorial trial that involved two comparisons: (1) 2:1 ibandronate versus observation and (2) 1:1 different dose-dense arms. We included the data relating to the ibandronate versus observation comparison in this review. Some participants that did not start the parallel chemotherapy and were excluded from the ibandronate (n = 19) and observation (n = 10) comparison. <LINK REF="STD-SWOG_x002d_S0307-2015" TYPE="STUDY">SWOG-S0307 2015</LINK> was a three-armed study comparing zoledronate, clodronate and ibandronate, and results were reported in two abstracts.

The three treatment regimens in <LINK REF="STD-Fizazi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Fizazi 2009</LINK> were eligible for two comparisons: (1) immediate versus delayed administration of a bone-acting agent (denosumab) and (2) other bone-acting agent (denosumab) versus bisphosphonate (intravenous zoledronate). For the denosumab-bisphosphonate comparison, the pharmaceutical company (Amgen) provided data to the review authors with new data integrated in the previous version of this review. In <LINK REF="STD-Body-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Body 2003</LINK>, there were two experimental arms (intravenous ibandronate 6 mg and 2 mg, every 3 to 4 weeks) and one control (placebo) arm; only data from the 6 mg and placebo were used in the analysis. Similarly, in <LINK REF="STD-Tripathy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tripathy 2004</LINK>, only one of the experimental arms (oral ibandronate 50 mg a day rather than 20 mg a day) was compared against the control (placebo) arm and reported in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Diel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Diel 1999</LINK> included three experimental arms, intravenous clodronate, oral clodronate and intravenous pamidronate and reported data in abstract form only; we included data from <LINK REF="STD-Diel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Diel 1999</LINK> narratively in the review for all three arms where available. <LINK REF="STD-Rosen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 2004</LINK> initially tested intravenous zoledronate 8 mg or intravenous zoledronate 4 mg as a 15-minute infusion against intravenous pamidronate 90 mg as a two-hour infusion, however the trial authors only reported efficacy data for the 4 mg zoledronate and intravenous pamidronate groups. <LINK REF="STD-von-Au-2016" TYPE="STUDY">von Au 2016</LINK> used intravenous clodronate (900 mg every 3 weeks) or oral clodronate (2400 mg per day) against intravenous pamidronate (60 mg every 3 weeks); we reported data from all three treatment arms where available.</P>

<P>For dichotomous outcomes (i.e. SREs, bone metastases, visceral metastases, locoregional recurrence, overall recurrence), we obtained a pooled RR using the random-effects model (Mantel-Haenszel analysis).

<P>We had planned to conduct subgroup analyses for age, menopausal status, presence of skeletal disease, previous or concomitant chemotherapy, previous or concurrent endocrine therapy, route of administration of drugs, type of bisphosphonate or bone-acting agent and risk groups in early breast cancer (by nodal status, oestrogen/progesterone and HER2 status). However, subgroup analyses were not possible for many pre-planned subgroups because not all studies presented sufficient data to be stratified by these subgroups.</P>
<P>Thus, in the formal analysis, the only pre-planned subgroups we included were route of administration of drugs, type of bisphosphonate or bone-acting agent and menopausal status. For the menopausal status subgroup, some studies specifically recruited premenopausal or postmenopausal women, which enabled us to stratify them in either category. In other studies that recruited both premenopausal and postmenopausal women, we attempted to find out the separate outcomes for each menopausal subgroup. If this was reported, we collated the separate outcomes and analysed them in each subgroup. We were also interested in examining the effect of bisphosphonate in EBC according to the recurrence risk group, especially given the observed discrepancy in results between two large RCTs from two different populations (<LINK REF="STD-AZURE-2014" TYPE="STUDY">AZURE 2014</LINK> in stage II/III; <LINK REF="STD-ABCSG_x002d_12-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ABCSG-12 2011</LINK> in stage I/II breast cancer). This was not possible since many EBC bisphosphonate studies did not report outcomes stratified by tumour stage or recurrence risk group. This would best be done in a meta-analysis of individual participant data from each study (<LINK REF="REF-Colleoni-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colleoni 2000</LINK>). We did, however, summarise the baseline characteristics of each study that reported the percentage of women who were pre- or postmenopausal at the point of study recruitment, hormone receptor- or oestrogen receptor-positive, and on chemotherapy or endocrine therapy (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>For the 2012 and 2016 update, we intended to exclude hypercalcaemia (HCM) from our definition of the total number of SREs, however this was not possible because many studies presented aggregate data for SREs from which it was impossible to subtract the episodes of HCM. We instead chose to perform a sensitivity analysis by evaluating the effect of including or excluding HCM as a primary SRE.</P>

<P>The 44 studies were described as randomised. If the study adequately described the method of random sequence generation and the baseline characteristics in each treatment arm of a study were balanced, we categorised the study to be at low risk of bias. We deemed 17 studies to be at low risk of bias. It was not possible to accurately assess the randomisation process in 26 studies owing to the lack of information presented in the trial publications; we classified these 26 studies as having an unclear risk of bias. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Tevaarwerk-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tevaarwerk 2007</LINK>) had significant imbalances between the baseline characteristics in each treatment arm and we assumed that the randomisation process was inadequate for this study. There was more T1 disease in the treatment group compared to control (39% versus 2%) and more N2-3 disease in the control group compared to treatment (81% versus 56%). This means that there were more women in the control group having disease with intermediate or high-risk of recurrence than in the treatment group. Therefore, we classified this study at high risk of bias.</P>
<P>Fifteen studies out of 44 studies were at low risk of bias for allocation concealment. Twenty-nine studies did not describe methods of allocation concealment or in sufficient details in the trial publication and we judged them as having unclear risk of bias.</P>

<P>Nineteen studies were labelled as double-blind or double-dummy design and we judged them to be at low risk of bias. A proportion of studies that compared bisphosphonates to usual care were open label and not placebo-controlled. In addition, studies comparing bisphosphonates of different routes of administration (intravenous versus oral) or administration schedules were often not adequately controlled.

Five studies were at high risk of bias owing to a lack of intention-to-treat analysis or high dropout rate, or both, with little information on whether the dropouts were different between treatment and comparator arms.

Of the 14 studies that compared bisphosphonates to placebo/no bisphosphonate, bisphosphonates were administered intravenously in six studies and orally in eight studies.

There were 161 events in 901 randomised women, and no heterogeneity. In <LINK REF="STD-ZOOM-2013" TYPE="STUDY">ZOOM 2013</LINK>, the primary outcome was SRE morbidity rate (SRE per patient per year). The reduced-frequency bisphosphonate group (every 12 weeks) had a SRE morbidity rate of 0.26 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.37) compared to the standard-frequency group of 0.22 (95% 0.14 to 0.29). The between-group difference was 0.04 and the upper limit of one-tailed 97.5% CI was 0.17, within the pre-specified non-inferiority margin (0.19). The data should be interpreted with caution as the study was hampered by a lower event rate than anticipated and potentially under-powered; the short, 12-month follow-up may be inadequate to capture cumulative differences in efficacy and a rise in bone-turnover markers among the reduced-frequency group. An additional study, <LINK REF="STD-CALGB_x002d_70604-2015" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB-70604 2015</LINK>, reported the proportion of participants in each group who had more than one SRE.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Early breast cancer</HEADING>
<P>This review update provides moderate- to high-quality evidence that the use of bisphosphonates as part of the treatment plan for women with early breast cancer provides a beneficial effect in reducing the incidence of bone metastases compared to placebo or observation. Most of these studies used either intravenous zoledronate (4 mg every three to six months for one to five years) or oral clodronate (1600 mg daily for two to three years). As expected, there appeared to be no reduction in the incidence of visceral metastases, locoregional recurrence, recurrence (defined as locoregional plus distant recurrence) or fractures with bisphosphonates compared to placebo or observation. However, the confidence intervals were wide in some cases (for example, fracture incidence) suggesting that studies may not be adequately powered for these endpoints. Similarly, in the three recent studies comparing immediate versus delayed bisphosphonate administration, there did not appear to be a significant effect of immediate or delayed bisphosphonates on the incidence of bone metastases, and this lack of an effect was evident when assessing visceral metastases, locoregional recurrence and recurrence.</P>
<P>In this review update, we introduced a new analysis of overall survival using time-to-event data, as this approach is considered to be a more appropriate method rather than using dichotomous data (<LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2007</LINK>). By analysing published and unpublished aggregate data, there was an overall survival benefit in women with early breast cancer receiving bisphosphonates treatment (based on nine studies involving 13,949 women). The bisphosphonates administered were mainly intravenous zoledronate or oral clodronate (four studies each). There was significant heterogeneity, which appears to be due to different effects based upon menopausal status. The group as a whole had significant heterogeneity for the overall survival and disease-free survival outcomes. This heterogeneity was removed when assessed by menopausal status.</P>
<P>Bisphosphonates were found to provide a significant benefit for overall survival in postmenopausal women only. This analysis was based on four studies involving 6048 women who received either intravenous zoledronate (including immediate zoledronate) or oral clodronate. This beneficial effect was not observed in premenopausal women (two studies, 3501 women). The finding was replicated in the analysis of disease-free survival that suggested bisphosphonates improved disease-free survival in postmenopausal women and not premenopausal women (postmenopausal studies: seven studies, 8314 women; premenopausal studies: four studies, 5493 women).</P>
<P>Whilst this benefit is based on a subgroup analysis of these trials, the data are suggestive of a differential effect of treatment based on menopausal status since heterogeneity was removed. There are ongoing trials testing this hypothesis and, once completed, these trials will provided robust evidence of whether bisphosphonates improve survival for menopausal women. </P>
<P>Adjuvant denosumab reduced the incidence of fractures compared to placebo (based on one study) and data for mature overall survival and disease-free survival are awaited. None of the studies reported quality-of-life measures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Advanced breast cancer without bone metastases</HEADING>
<P>As per the original review, the evidence was based on three studies published in 1996 and 2000. Oral bisphosphonates (either clodronate 1600 mg a day for two to three years or pamidronate 300 mg a day) in women with advanced disease, without clinically evident bone metastases, did not appear to have an effect on the incidence of skeletal metastases compared to placebo, and did not provide a survival benefit. However, the confidence intervals were very wide and only three studies involving 330 women were included. Only one study collected and reported the incidence of SREs with a 36% reduction in events in women receiving oral clodronate compared to placebo. One study reported quality of life and there was no apparent difference in quality-of-life scores between oral pamidronate and placebo.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Metastatic breast cancer and bone metastases</HEADING>
<P>Overall, bisphosphonates (intravenous or oral) reduced the incidence of SREs and rate of SREs when compared to placebo/observation. Intravenous and oral bisphosphonate reduced the risk of a SRE by 17% and 16%, respectively. The studies treating intravenously used a wide range of bisphosphonates: zoledronate 4 mg (one study), pamidronate 45 mg to 90 mg (three studies) and ibandronate 6 mg (two studies), while oral bisphosphonates included clodronate 1600 mg a day (three studies), ibandronate 50 mg (one study) or pamidronate 300 mg (one study). Similarly, there was reduced risk of SREs (by 22%) in women receiving denosumab (range: 30 mg, 120 mg or 180 mg subcutaneous every 4 weeks) compared to intravenous bisphosphonate. There was at least equivalent efficacy (or no worse) in the incidence of SREs when different bisphosphonate regimens were compared (e.g. intravenous zoledronate versus intravenous pamidronate) or when standard versus delayed frequency of bisphosphonates was tested. The only exception was that oral ibandronate appeared inferior to intravenous zoledronate (<LINK REF="STD-ZICE-2014" TYPE="STUDY">ZICE 2014</LINK>). The median time to a SRE was significantly longer in the bisphosphonates group than placebo/observation.</P>
<P>In this review update, half of the studies reported survival data for the comparison of bisphosphonate versus placebo. Of these, there was no evidence of an effect of bisphosphonates on survival. Only one study testing the effects of denosumab reported on overall survival and this study reported no significant effect of denosumab when compared to bisphosphonate. None of the studies on standard versus delayed frequency of bisphosphonates collected or reported overall survival data.</P>
<P>In the majority of cases, quality-of-life measures were better with bisphosphonates than with placebo. A similar trend was observed with women receiving denosumab than bisphosphonates. None of the studies on standard versus delayed frequency of bisphosphonates collected or reported quality-of-life data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Toxicity</HEADING>
<P>Following a thorough review of toxicity, adverse events for bisphosphonates or denosumab of any grade were generally uncommon, and grade 3/4 adverse events were rare but did include impaired renal function and osteonecrosis of the jaw. Bisphosphonates carried a small excess risk of acute-phase reactions (such as fever, fatigue and nausea) but these were mostly grade 1 or 2, or the toxicity grade was unspecified.</P>

<P>Many second-generation EBC studies that were specifically designed to detect differences in overall survival or disease-free survival between treatment and control arms have completed accrual and are awaiting analysis (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>). Among the large RCTs that use recurrence as their primary endpoints, there are four zoledronate versus placebo studies (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Ibrashi-2016" TYPE="STUDY">El-Ibrashi 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HOBOE-2013" TYPE="STUDY">HOBOE 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-JONIE_x002d_1-2013" TYPE="STUDY">JONIE-1 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NEOZOTAC" TYPE="STUDY">NEOZOTAC</LINK>). In addition, <LINK REF="STD-SWOG_x002d_S0307-2015" TYPE="STUDY">SWOG-S0307 2015</LINK> is investigating the relative potency between zoledronate, clodronate and oral ibandronate for 36 months; we have contacted the trialists. Denosumab is also pushing forward to be studied in preventing recurrence in EBC studies with two ongoing studies; one closed to recruitment (<LINK REF="STD-D_x002d_CARE-2011" TYPE="STUDY">D-CARE 2011</LINK>) and the other having commenced recruitment (<LINK REF="STD-Kummel-2016-_x0028_GeparX_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Kummel 2016 (GeparX)</LINK>).</P>
<P>The included studies used a range of bisphosphonates and schedules. In the majority of cases, the duration of treatment ranged from two to five years. The variations in bisphosphonate regimens involved: (a) zoledronate: 4 mg every six months for three years (<LINK REF="STD-ABCSG_x002d_12-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ABCSG-12 2011</LINK>) or five years (<LINK REF="STD-E_x002d_ZO_x002d_FAST-2012" TYPE="STUDY">E-ZO-FAST 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Z_x002d_FAST-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Z-FAST 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ZO_x002d_FAST-2013" TYPE="STUDY">ZO-FAST 2013</LINK>), or 4 mg de-escalating schedule over five years (<LINK REF="STD-AZURE-2014" TYPE="STUDY">AZURE 2014</LINK>); (b) clodronate: oral 1600 mg a day for two to three years (<LINK REF="STD-NSABP_x002d_34-2012" TYPE="STUDY">NSABP-34 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powles-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Powles 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saarto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Saarto 2004</LINK>) or (c) pamidronate: oral 300 mg a day for two years (<LINK REF="STD-Kristensen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kristensen 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The immediate commencement of adjuvant bisphosphonates was not superior to a delayed start, triggered by falling BMD or fracture, in preventing recurrence (or any recurrence sub-set) or improving survival. These trials were primarily powered to detect differences in BMD at 12 months and were not powered for clinical outcome data such as recurrence, disease-free survival or overall survival.</P>
<P>The majority of recently published studies examining the effects of bisphosphonates or bone-modifying agents in metastatic breast cancer with bone metastases did not collect or report data on overall survival. The ongoing studies intend to use bone pain or SREs, or both, as the primary endpoints (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>). Five of these studies will be investigating upfront versus delayed bisphosphonates or denosumab while the others are comparing different bisphosphonates head-to-head (e.g. zoledronate versus pamidronate, denosumab versus zoledronate).</P>
<P>Similar to the EBC studies, the included studies in the BCBM setting used a wide range of bisphosphonate agents and schedules. The duration of treatment ranged from 25 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Fizazi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Fizazi 2009</LINK>) to three years (<LINK REF="STD-Paterson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Paterson 1993</LINK>). The optimal timing and duration of treatment for women with BCBM remains uncertain.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-10-11 20:45:58 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In general, we judged the overall body of evidence to be moderate or high quality across the three treatment settings (see: <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). In the cases where some heterogeneity was observed in the meta-analyses, the heterogeneity could be explained by removing studies that used sub-optimal doses of pamidronate (45 mg or 60 mg) that are rarely used in practice today or by analysing data by menopausal status (as in the case for overall survival in the EBC studies). Therefore in the majority of these cases, we did not downgrade the quality of the evidence. Most of the outcomes presented in the 'Summary of findings' table indicated consistent findings across the studies, and this held true when we carried out additional analyses by considering mode of drug administration (e.g. intravenous bisphosphonate versus placebo; oral bisphosphonate versus placebo).</P>
<P>We downgraded the quality of the evidence primarily in those cases where outcomes (such as bone pain or quality of life) were measured on unvalidated scales or questionnaires and involved participant self-reporting when the participant was aware of the drug received.</P>

<P>This review has aimed to provide a thorough overview of the benefits and toxicities from bisphosphonates and denosumab across studies and treatment settings. Despite having conducted a comprehensive search of medical databases and key conference proceedings, we may not have identified all potentially relevant studies. We conducted tests for funnel plot asymmetry for main outcomes and the plots did not strongly indicate publication/reporting bias or other sources of bias (e.g. true heterogeneity). In the review update, we contacted study authors if (a) data were not fully reported in the full-text article or (b) overall survival or disease-free survival were not reported by menopausal status. In some cases, data were available in abstract form (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-CALGB_x002d_70604-2015" TYPE="STUDY">CALGB-70604 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Diel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Diel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-OPTIMIZE_x002d_2-2014" TYPE="STUDY">OPTIMIZE-2 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SWOG_x002d_S0307-2015" TYPE="STUDY">SWOG-S0307 2015</LINK>). Clinical trials registries were also searched and matched against eligible trials though some ongoing trials in the registries may have been missed due to the large number of trial records retrieved on this topic.</P>
<P>For a number of studies, we are still awaiting more mature follow-up data, particularly in the BCBM studies and a number of studies poorly reported toxicities that in part reflects the age of some of these studies (e.g. from the late 1990s particularly in the ABC studies).</P>
<P>We have indicated throughout the review that a number of large trials are awaiting final completion and publication in EBC and BCBM before firm conclusions can be drawn.</P>

<P>The finding of this systematic review replicate the main findings presented in the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) <LINK REF="REF-ASCO-Guidelines-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASCO Guidelines 2017</LINK>. The individual participant meta-analysis (IPD) conducted by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2015</LINK>) that involved 18,766 women described reductions in overall recurrence (RR 0.94, 95 % CI 0.87 to 1.01; P = 0.08, heterogeneity across trials P = 0.04) and distant recurrence (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.99; P = 0.03, heterogeneity across trials P = 0.04) but highlighted these to be of modest effect size and/or borderline statistical significance. The <LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 2015</LINK> meta-analysis also reported that adjuvant bisphosphonates among premenopausal women had no apparent effect on any outcome; but among 11,767 postmenopausal women it produced highly significant reductions in recurrence (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98; P = 0.002), distant recurrence (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.92, P = 0.0003), bone recurrence (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.86; P = 0.0002), and breast cancer mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.93, P = 0.002). In our analyses, we did not detect an effect of bisphosphonates for visceral metastases, overall recurrence (locoregional plus distant recurrence) or locoregional recurrence. However we did observe a benefit from bisphosphonates for bone recurrence and also noted for overall survival (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99) and disease-free survival (specifically comparing intravenous zoledronate versus placebo/delayed zoledronate: HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98; P = 0.02) when analysing data using time-to-event outcomes. We did not collect information specifically on breast cancer-specific mortality. Our aggregate meta-analysis for disease-free survival and overall survival (using time-to-event outcomes) was limited to nine trials for overall survival (13,949 women) and seven trials for disease-free survival (12,578 women) and outcome data stratified by menopausal status were not available for all these studies. In those studies where data were available for postmenopausal women, preliminary evidence suggested a benefit from adjuvant bisphosphonates for overall survival and disease-free survival. These overall survival findings concur with <LINK REF="REF-ASCO-Guidelines-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASCO Guidelines 2017</LINK>.</P>

<P>The results of the meta-analyses in this review are largely consistent with the <LINK REF="REF-ASCO-Guidelines-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASCO Guidelines 2011</LINK> on the use of bisphosphonate treatment in women with BCBM. The guideline recommends the use of intravenous bisphosphonates (pamidronate, zoledronate) in BCBM. <LINK REF="REF-ASCO-Guidelines-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASCO Guidelines 2011</LINK> also recommends the use of denosumab and acknowledges the fact that ibandronate and clodronate are used for the management of BCBM in countries other than the USA, but it has not discussed the relevance of these two drugs or included them in its recommendations because these two drugs are not Federal Drug Agency (FDA)-approved in the USA for the indication of BCBM.</P>
<P>Both ASCO Guidelines and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-ESMO-Clinical-Practice-Guidelines-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines 2014</LINK>) recognise the paucity of evidence of treatment beyond two years. None of the studies included in this Cochrane Review update included data beyond two years.</P>

<P>Adjuvant bisphosphonates reduce bone metastases and most of the studies used either intravenous zoledronate or oral clodronate. On the basis of published and unpublished aggregate data available for this meta-analysis, there is evidence to suggest that adjuvant bisphosphonates improve overall survival and there is preliminary evidence indicating an overall survival and disease-free survival benefit is in those women who were postmenopausal when treatment began. Of the studies included in the stratified analysis by menopausal status, studies used either intravenous zoledronate (4 mg), oral clodronate (1600 mg a day) or oral ibandronate (50 mg a day). The results are limited by the fact that these are subgroup analyses of trials rather than trials planned to test whether the effect differs between postmenopausal and premenopausal or perimenopausal women.</P>

<P>The use of bisphosphonates outside of clinical research is currently not supported by evidence.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Breast cancer with bone metastases</HEADING>
<P>In general, bisphosphonates are effective in reducing the risk of skeletal-related events (SRE), delaying time to SRE, reducing bone pain and improving quality of life. Most of the included studies with data involved intravenous zoledronate or oral clodronate. When comparing different bisphosphonates, one bisphosphonate compared to another did not show any superior benefit, except for one study where ibandronate was inferior to zoledronate in terms of the number of SREs. Denosumab is effective in reducing bone pain and delaying the time to SREs compared to placebo.</P>
<P>In general, when considering all settings, toxicity is generally mild, with rates of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) across studies in mature data sets approximately less than 0.5%.</P>
<P>The ideal choice of bisphosphonates and other bone agents may be different from woman to woman. It is likely to depend on the bisphosphonate efficacy versus its toxicity, ease of administration, patient's prior treatment, patient preference, drug availability and local guidelines and legislation.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-10-11 21:13:53 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This meta-analysis suggests that adjuvant bisphosphonates provide a survival benefit for postmenopausal women with early breast cancer however further trials are awaited before a firm conclusion can be made. Trials should be stratified and reported by menopausal status at study entry. Multi-variate analysis reporting rates of recurrence within different risk groups (or stage of the breast cancer), menopausal status, high or low oestrogen level and endocrine receptor status will be useful in finding a subgroup that will benefit from bisphosphonates. In addition, a uniform definition of recurrence or invasive recurrence would help when combining data for meta-analysis. The benefit of bisphosphonates in women receiving aromatase inhibitors in early breast cancer or targeted non-cytotoxic therapy, such as treatment with monoclonal antibody to HER2-neu, or both, requires further study.</P>
<P>The following outcomes should be considered for inclusion and reported in future trials of bisphosphonates in early breast cancer.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Overall survival</LI>
<LI>Disease-free survival</LI>
<LI>Bone metastases and</LI>
<LI>Toxicity</LI>
</OL>
<P>In women with advanced breast cancer and bone metastases, the questions still remain regarding: (a) the optimum commencement time of bisphosphonate therapy, (b) the duration of treatment and (c) what to do in participants with progressive bone disease and symptoms, despite bisphosphonates and systemic anti-cancer therapy. The uniform and standardised reporting of SRE rates would assist efficacy comparisons between drugs.</P>
<P>The following outcomes should be considered for inclusion and reported in future trials of bisphosphonates in breast cancer and bone metastases.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Numbers of participants developing individual SREs in the study period (with hypercalcaemia reported separately)</LI>
<LI>Time to the first SRE</LI>
<LI>Validated, participant-rated measures of bone pain, quality of life and other relevant symptoms</LI>
<LI>Systematic assessment of toxicities, including fever, flare, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypocalcaemia and renal toxicity</LI>
<LI>Measurement of resource use and incorporation of cost-effectiveness analyses</LI>
<LI>The incidence of ONJ.</LI>

<P>Finally, trial authors should consider reporting effect sizes such as the hazard ratio and its confidence interval for survival outcomes, in line with the CONSORT statement.</P>

<LI>The 'Types of Interventions' section has been revised to explicitly state that other bone-acting agents (including denosumab) can be included in the review. Although this was already stated underneath the main list, we have brought this information upfront.</LI>
<LI>Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool has been fully integrated to comply with Cochrane standards. Performance and detection bias has been split into one domain on 'blinding of participants and personnel' and a second domain on 'blinding of outcome assessment'</LI>
<LI>We have integrated the GRADE approach in the 2016 review update and developed a 'Summary of findings' table for each setting. The MERGE criteria used in previous versions of this review has been removed. Previous MERGE assessments can be found in former versions of this published review in the Cochrane Library</LI>
<LI>A number of new outcomes have been listed under the 'Types of outcome measures' section however most of these outcomes (e.g. skeletal-related event rate and bone pain for breast cancer with bone metastases, and bone metastases for early breast cancer) were part of the previous version of the review but were not fully listed in each section of the review. In addition, we added disease-free survival to the early breast cancer section for this review update. We also grouped the main toxicities for each treatment setting in separate tables and provided frequencies if reported in the trial publications.</LI>
<LI>We conducted analyses of overall survival and disease-free survival data using time-to-event data in the early breast cancer studies, in addition to the analyses using dichotomous data. This was because analyses using time-to-event data are generally considered more appropriate than dichotomous data for outcomes such as overall survival and disease-free survival.</LI>
<LI>Some minor transcriptional errors were noted in previous versions of the review and these have been corrected in the 2016 review update.</LI>

<P>The authors of the 2011 review update made modifications to the search strategies. They added the search terms "Denosumab" (including Prolia and Xgeva) and "RANK ligand" to the MEDLINE, Embase and WHO ICTRP search strategies, simplified the search strategy for WHO ICTRP to include all breast cancer stages, and broadened the search for bisphosphonates. The search strategy for ClinicalTrials.gov and CENTRAL was also included in this review update.</P>
<P>We updated this review in April 2011, with 13 new studies and 6 updates. The meta-analysis is now formally divided into three settings: BCBM, ABC without bone metastases and EBC. The search strategy is included as a flow diagram in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>. We used both MERGE criteria and Risk of Bias Tables to assess the quality of studies.</P>

<P>SABCS Dec 2015: Abstract P5-15-04</P>
<P>"Adding ZOL [zoledronic acid] to endocrine therapy strongly suggests improved DFS versus endocrine therapy alone (90% versus 85% for an absolute increase of 5%). There were fewer disease recurrences in the ZOL group versus no ZOL group (12% vs. 16%) with the greatest reductions in the loco-regional recurrence (3% vs. 5%), distant metastasis (6% vs. 7%) and bone metastasis (3% vs. 5%). Conclusion: ZOL with adjuvant endocrine therapy were generally well tolerated with no reports of renal failure or osteonecrosis of the jaw. So, a twice yearly ZOL enhanced the efficacy of adjuvant endocrine treatment, and this benefit is maintained for long time" We contacted study authors unpublished data</P>

<P>Results: the mean change in uNTx/uCr from baseline to Wk 13 was -81.9% for DmAb and -75.2% for ZA (ANCOVA; P &lt; 0.0001). The median change in S-BALP from baseline to week 13 was -36.8% (DmAb) and -30.3% (ZA) (P = 0.027). Rate of developing any on-study SRE within the first year after initialising treatment was lower in participants receiving DmAb vs ZA (4.9% vs 6.3%) without statistical significance. Incidence of AEs was similar in DmAb and ZA groups (89% vs 91%), with most common AEs being anaemia (25% vs 24%), white blood cell count decreased (21% vs 24%), and pyrexia (13% vs 21%); overall incidence of serious AEs: 14% vs 9%. One serious AE (muscular weakness) was reported as related to study treatment.</P>
<P>Conclusions: DmAb was found to be superior than ZA in reducing uNTx/uCr overall and Chinese patients. No new safety concerns were identified with DmAb</P>

Whilst the primary endpoint urinary NTx/Cr at 13 weeks was reported separately for bisphosphonate and each of the 5 doses of denosumab, the secondary SRE endpoint was reported in aggregate (bisphosphonate vs all doses for denosumab). The standard dose of denosumab was now recognised at 120 mg monthly. It was difficult to know from this trial the true effect of standard-dose denosumab against zoledronic acid</P>
