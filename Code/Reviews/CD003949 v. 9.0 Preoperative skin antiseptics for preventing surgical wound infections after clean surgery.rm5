<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-02-06 16:44:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patients' skin at the operation site is routinely cleansed with antiseptic solutions in the operating theatre before surgical incisions are made. This skin cleansing with an antiseptic aims to reduce the microorganisms present on the skin and therefore reduce the risk that the surgical wound will become infected. It is not known whether one antiseptic treatment is better than any other(s) at preventing infection, so our team examined the evidence for antiseptic skin preparation prior to clean surgery (i.e. surgery that does not involve the breathing system, gut, genital or urinary tract or any part of the body with an existing infection) to see if there are differences between preoperative antiseptic treatments. Unfortunately there is very little good quality research around skin cleansing before surgery and we cannot say whether one antiseptic is better than another at preventing wound infections. More research is required to show whether one antiseptic is better than the others at preventing wound infection after clean surgery.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-02-06 16:41:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgical site infection rates in the month following clean surgery vary from 0.6% (knee prosthesis) to 5% (limb amputation). Due to the large number of clean surgical procedures conducted annually the costs of these surgical site infections (SSIs) can be considerable in financial and social terms. Preoperative skin antisepsis using antiseptics is performed to reduce the risk of SSIs by removing soil and transient organisms from the skin where a surgical incision will be made. Antiseptics are thought to be toxic to bacteria and therefore aid their mechanical removal. The effectiveness of preoperative skin preparation is thought to be dependent on both the antiseptic used and the method of application, however, it is unclear whether preoperative skin antisepsis actually reduces postoperative wound infection, and, if so, which antiseptic is most effective.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-02-06 16:44:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Royle">
<P>To determine whether preoperative skin antisepsis immediately prior to surgical incision for clean surgery prevents SSI and to determine the comparative effectiveness of alternative antiseptics.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-02-23 15:42:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this third update we searched just the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 27 January 2015); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2014, Issue 12). </P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-01-07 14:54:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Royle">
<P>Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias were undertaken independently by two review authors.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-02-16 10:59:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were no new studies added to the review in the third update</P>
<P>Thirteen studies were included in this review (2,623 participants). These evaluated several different types of skin antiseptics - leading to 11 different comparisons being made. Although the antiseptics evaluated differed between studies, all trials involved some form of iodine. Iodine in alcohol was compared to alcohol alone in one trial; one trial compared povidone iodine paint (solution type not reported) with soap and alcohol. Six studies compared different types of iodine-containing products with each other and five compared iodine-containing products with chlorhexidine-containing products.</P>
<P>There was evidence from one study suggesting that preoperative skin preparation with 0.5% chlorhexidine in methylated spirits led to a reduced risk of SSI compared with an alcohol based povidone iodine solution: RR 0.47 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.82). However, it is important to note that the trial does not report important details regarding the interventions (such as the concentration of povidone iodine paint used) and trial conduct, such that risk of bias was unclear.</P>
<P>There were no other statistically significant differences in SSI rates in the other comparisons of skin antisepsis. Overall the risk of bias in included studies was unclear.</P>
<P>A mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis was conducted and this suggested that alcohol-containing products had the highest probability of being effective - however, again the quality of this evidence was low.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-02-06 16:43:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Royle">
<P>A comprehensive review of current evidence found some evidence that preoperative skin preparation with 0.5% chlorhexidine in methylated spirits was associated with lower rates of SSIs following clean surgery than alcohol-based povidone iodine paint. However this single study was poorly reported. Practitioners may therefore elect to consider other characteristics such as costs and potential side effects when choosing between alternatives.</P>
<P>The design of future trials should be driven by the questions of high priority to decision makers. It may be that investment in at least one large trial (in terms of participants) is warranted in order to add definitive and hopefully conclusive data to the current evidence base. Ideally any future trial would evaluate the iodine-containing and chlorhexidine-containing solutions relevant to current practice as well as the type of solution used (alcohol vs. aqueous).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-02-23 15:42:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-02-07 11:38:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgical site infections (SSIs) can occur following an invasive surgical procedure (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). An SSI can be diagnosed by the presence of clinical signs and symptoms alone, e.g. pus, redness, pain, heat, or based on the presence of one or more clinical symptoms along with a quantitative measurement of more than 10<SUP>6</SUP> colony forming units per mm³ tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>). Surgical procedures and their resulting surgical wounds are classified as either clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated or dirty-infected, depending upon the area of the body operated upon and the level of infection and inflammation present (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). A surgical wound is less likely to become infected postoperatively if it is classified as clean. <LINK REF="REF-Leaper-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leaper 1995</LINK> suggested expected infection rates of less than 2% in clean surgery and less than 10% in contaminated surgery.</P>
<P>In the UK the Health Protection Agency (HPA) collects ongoing SSI data nationally although only data collection following orthopaedic surgery is mandatory. From April 2006 to March 2011, the HPA collected data in 237 NHS hospitals on 438,679 surgical procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Health-Protection-Agency-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Health Protection Agency 2011</LINK>). They report clean SSI rates of: 0.6% for knee prosthesis; 1% for cardiac surgery (non-coronary artery bypass graft); 0.8% for hip prosthesis and 5% for limb amputation. This is in contrast to the HPA-reported incidence (2006 to 2011) of SSI following surgery on the large bowel (contaminated) of 10%. Whilst the incidence of SSI in clean surgery can be low relative to other surgical procedures, there are tens of thousands of clean procedures performed annually world-wide and the frequency of these procedures raises the overall numbers at risk for SSI in this group. Addtionally, since for clean surgery there is, arguably, a lower risk of infection from 'internal' contamination, it may be that skin cleansing plays, relatively, a more important role in terms of SSI prevention compared to non-clean surgeries.</P>
<P>The costs incurred when a patient contracts an SSI can be considerable in financial, as well as social, terms. It has been estimated that patients with SSIs require, on average, an additional hospital stay of 6.5 days, and that hospital costs are doubled. When extrapolated to all acute hospitals in England, it is estimated that the annual cost is approximately GBP 1 billion (<LINK REF="REF-Plowman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plowman 2000</LINK>). NICE 2006 identified that an SSI increased the costs of surgery by two to five times (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-02-12 14:18:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The removal of transient bacteria and reduction of the number of commensal organisms by an antiseptic is recommended prior to surgery by several organisations including the Royal College of Surgeons of England (<LINK REF="REF-Leaper-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leaper 2001</LINK>), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>), the Association of Perioperative Registered Nurses (AORN) (<LINK REF="REF-AORN-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AORN 2006</LINK>), and the Association for Perioperative Practice (<LINK REF="REF-AfPP-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">AfPP 2007</LINK>). Therefore, it has become routine preoperative practice to cleanse the skin at the operation site with an antiseptic (<LINK REF="REF-McCluskey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCluskey 1996</LINK>). The effectiveness of preoperative skin preparation is thought to depend on both the antiseptic used and the method of application.</P>
<P>CDC guidance states:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the size of the area prepared should be sufficient to include any potential incision sites divorced from the main incision site e.g. abdominal preparation for laparoscopic surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>the solution should be applied in concentric circles;</LI>
<LI>a dedicated instrument may be used, e.g. a sponge, or X-ray detectable swab, adapted for the purpose; this applicator should be discarded once the periphery has been reached;</LI>
<LI>time should be allowed for the solution to dry, especially when alcoholic solutions are used, as these are flammable (<LINK REF="REF-MHRA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MHRA 2000</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>AORN guidelines stipulate the following (<LINK REF="REF-AORN-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AORN 2006</LINK>):</P>
<UL>
<LI>that the applicator used should be sterile;</LI>
<LI>the solution should be applied using friction, and extend from the incision site to the periphery.</LI>
</UL>
<P>For the purposes of this review skin preparation antiseptic agents are referred to as "antiseptics" and can be applied in the form of liquids, solutions or powders. <LINK REF="REF-Leclair-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leclair 1990</LINK> described an antiseptic as "a chemical agent that reduces the microbial population on the skin". It is suggested that the ideal agent would:</P>
<UL>
<LI>kill all bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa, tubercle bacilli and spores;</LI>
<LI>be non toxic;</LI>
<LI>be hypoallergenic;</LI>
<LI>be safe to use in all body regions;</LI>
<LI>not be absorbed;</LI>
<LI>have residual activity;</LI>
<LI>be safe for repetitive use (<LINK REF="REF-Hardin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardin 1997</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Several antiseptic agents are available for preoperative preparation of skin at the incision site.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Iodine/iodophors</HEADING>
<P>Iodine/iodophors are iodine solutions which are effective against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, the tubercle bacillus, fungi and viruses. These penetrate cell walls, then oxidise and substitute the microbial contents with free iodine (<LINK REF="REF-Hardin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warner-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warner 1988</LINK>). Iodophors contain a surfactant/stabilising agent that liberates the free iodine (<LINK REF="REF-Wade-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wade 1980</LINK>). Iodophor has largely replaced iodine as the active ingredient in antiseptics. Iodophor comprises free iodine molecules bound to a polymer such as polyvinyl pyrrolidine (i.e. povidone), so is often termed povidone iodine (PI) (<LINK REF="REF-Larson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larson 1995</LINK>). Typically, 10% PI formulations contain 1% available iodine (<LINK REF="REF-Larson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reichman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichman 2009</LINK>). PI is soluble in both water and alcohol, and available preparations include: aqueous iodophor scrub and paint, aqueous iodophor one-step preparation with polymer (3M), and alcoholic iodophor with water-insoluble polymer (DuraPrep).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Alcohol</HEADING>
<P>Alcohol denatures the cell wall proteins of bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Hardin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warner-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warner 1988</LINK>). Alcohol is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, the tubercle bacillus and many fungi and viruses. Concentration, rather than type, of alcohol is important in determining its effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Larson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leclair-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leclair 1990</LINK>).</P>

<P>The aim of preoperative skin antisepsis is to reduce the risk of SSIs by removing soil and transient organisms from the skin (<LINK REF="REF-AORN-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AORN 2006</LINK>). The skin is not a sterile surface, but is colonised by a large number of bacteria, with up to three million microorganisms on each square centimetre of skin (<LINK REF="REF-Hinchliffe-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hinchliffe 1988</LINK>). Antiseptics have the ability to bind to the stratum corneum, resulting in persistent chemical activity on the skin (<LINK REF="REF-Larson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larson 1988</LINK>). Primary action of antiseptics includes the mechanical removal, and chemical killing and inhibition, of contaminating and colonising flora (<LINK REF="REF-Larson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larson 1988</LINK>).   As micro-organisms tend to colonise the deeper layers of the stratum corneum (the layer of dead cells on the outside of the body), they are not shed with desquamation (loss of dead cells). There are two types of micro-organisms on the skin; commensals, which are normally resident, and transients, which are not consistently present and are easily exchanged between individuals. The transient organisms are easily removed, whereas, it has been suggested, the commensals are difficult to remove completely (<LINK REF="REF-Larson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larson 1988</LINK>). The commensals include Staphylococci, diptheroid organisms, Pseudomonas and Propionibacterium species which can lead to harmful infections if they are allowed to multiply. An SSI occurs when the number of bacteria in the incision overcome the host's defences. Most commonly these bacteria are commensals from the patient's skin (<LINK REF="REF-Malangoni-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malangoni 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>It has become routine preoperative practice to cleanse the surgical site with an antiseptic (<LINK REF="REF-McCluskey-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCluskey 1996</LINK>), however, it is important to assess the comparative effectiveness of alternative antiseptics to inform clinical practice. The current National Institue of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommendation regarding skin preparation across surgeries is to: <I>"Prepare the skin at the surgical site immediately before incision using an antiseptic (aqueous or alcohol-based) preparation: povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine are most suitable" </I>(<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). However, a recent trial undertaken in 849 participants undergoing clean-contaminated surgery compared chlorhexidine in alcohol with PI-aqueous and reported that the chlorhexidine solution was more effective in terms of SSI prevention for superficial incisional infection (4.2% developed an SSI in the chlorhexidine group compared to 8.6% in the PI group: p-value 0.08) and deep incisional infection (1.0% developed an SSI in the chlorhexidine group compared with 3.0% in the PI group p-value 0.05) (<LINK REF="REF-Darouiche-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darouiche 2010</LINK>). A further recent systematic review meta-analysed five RCTs that compared chlorhexidine-alcohol with PI-aqueous in skin antiseptics for the prevention of SSI and included <LINK REF="REF-Darouiche-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darouiche 2010</LINK>, (this was the largest included study in the analysis). The authors report that there was evidence that chlorhexidine-alcohol reduces risk of SSI following surgery compared with PI: risk ratio (RR) of 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.85 (<LINK REF="REF-Maiwald-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maiwald 2012</LINK>). However, this review goes on to raise the important issue of whether there is potential for the alcohol in the chlorhexidine-alcohol solution to have a role in SSI prevention that is not being acknowledged when PI-aqueous solutions are compared with chlorhexidine-alcohol solutions (<LINK REF="REF-Maiwald-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maiwald 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maiwald-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maiwald 2014</LINK>). Given the inclusion of RCTs evaluating clean/contaminated wounds in this review it is not clear how its results relate to clean surgical wounds.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-04-15 08:31:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered both clinical and statistical heterogeneity. Wherever appropriate data were pooled using meta-analysis (conducted using RevMan 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>)), that is where studies appeared similar in terms of wound type, intervention type, duration and outcome type. We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the chi² test (a significance level of P &lt; 0.1 was considered to indicate heterogeneity) and the I² estimate (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The I² estimate examines the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than to chance. Values of I² over 50% indicate a high level of heterogeneity. In the absence of clinical heterogeneity and in the presence of statistical heterogeneity (I² over 50%), we used a random-effect model, however, we did not pool studies at all where heterogeneity was very high (I² over 75%). Where there was no clinical or statistical heterogeneity we used a fixed-effects model.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Measures of treatment effect  </HEADING>
<P>We entered data into Cochrane Review Manager Version 5 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>), and used this program for the analysis. We presented effect measures for dichotomous outcomes (e.g. rates of infection) as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes, we planned to use the mean difference (MD), or, if the scale of measurement differed across trials, standardised mean difference (SMD), each with 95% CI</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2013-02-07 12:12:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Because of on-going interest regarding whether possible differences in SSI prevention rates for peri-operative skin antiseptics are due to the carrier solutions (alcohol-based vs. aqueous-based), we compared studies comparing aqueous and alcohol solutions regardless of active ingredient (e.g. chlorhexidine or PI).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mixed Treatment Comparison Meta-analysis</HEADING>
<P>To maximise the use of all available RCT data and to facilitate decision making regarding antiseptic choice, in addition to a standard meta-analysis, we conducted a mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis (sometimes called a network meta-analysis). This approach links head-to-head comparison data from trials, via common comparators, into a network which can then be used to calculate indirect estimates of relative treatment effect. In a simple example where there are three treatments A, B and C compared in two head-to-head trials, A vs B and B vs C, as B is a common comparator the network of A&#8212;B&#8212;C can be formed. These data can then be used to obtain an indirect estimate of the relative effects of A vs C. In networks where direct and indirect data exist for some or all links, both are used to generate relative treatment effect estimates, with direct evidence given more &#8216;weight&#8217; in the final estimate. The mixed treatment comparison was conducted from a Bayesian perspective using Winbugs and results summarised in this review. Fixed and random effects models were fitted to these data and model fit was assessed using residual deviance and deviance information criterion (DIC).</P>
<P>The treatment with the highest relative effect estimate in the mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis is expected to confer the highest likelihood of preventing SSIs. However, it is important to fully comprehend the uncertainty around such estimates. In addition to presenting credible interval (CrIs), a Bayesian equivalent of confidence intervals, we represented uncertainty regarding treatment choice as the probability that each dressing was the &#8216;best&#8217; treatment in terms of being the most likely to heal diabetic foot ulcers (when compared to all other evaluated treatments).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment of mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis estimates</HEADING>
<P>We wanted to reflect the quality of the evidence provided by the mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis so that any conclusions made could reflect the quality of the data being drawn on as occurs in other forms of evidence synthesis. Whilst there is no recognised system to undertake such quality assessment for mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis we have previously published a modified GRADE approach (we called this iGRADE) to allow us to access and communicate the quality of mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis-derived evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Dumville-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumville 2012</LINK>). The iGRADE approach uses the five GRADE categories that allow the quality of evidence to be decreased, with the focus of some categories modified so they are relevant when assessing a mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis (<LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>). We conducted a cautious application of iGRADE to the mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis where estimates could be graded as very low quality evidence, low evidence; moderate evidence and high quality evidence. No formal down-weighting of evidence was undertaken.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Method of randomisation</HEADING>
<P>The generation of the randomisation sequence was classed as adequate in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ellenhorn-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ellenhorn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saltzman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saltzman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Segal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 2002</LINK>).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>The risk of bias associated with the method of allocation concealment was considered unclear for all studies. Whilst a number of studies provided some detail about the allocation concealment process there was insufficient information to confidently classify the studies as at high or low risk of bias: e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Meier-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Meier 2001</LINK> states that <I>"Randomisation was performed using a card drawing system" </I>but it is not clear what this refers to or who conducted this process. Likewise <LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1985</LINK> states "<I>randomisation was carried out by drawing a card from a sealed envelope</I>" but there is no detail about who randomised participants and whether other features were used to protect against the introduction of bias - e.g. envelopes being numbered and opaque.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>Blinded outcome assessment is important in wound care studies for outcomes that have a subjective element to their assessment like healing and SSI. The risk of bias associated with outcome assessment was rated as unclear in twelve of the thirteen included studies. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Berry-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1982</LINK> aimed to conduct blinded outcome assessment, but reported that wounds were assessed by those who had been present during surgery for some participants and thus it was classed as being at unclear risk of bias. <LINK REF="STD-Saltzman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Saltzman 2009</LINK> stated that the study was double blind, but provided no further details. Only <LINK REF="STD-Sistla-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sistla 2010</LINK> was classed at low risk of bias for this domain stating that "<I>information</I> <I>regarding the antiseptic used was not available to the investigators or the patients during the assessment of wounds for SSI</I>".</P>

A fixed effects model was found to be the be best fit and was employed - results in the form of odds ratios (OR) are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. When considering all direct and indirect comparisons for available comparisons - there was no statistically significant difference between any two interventions included in the network. It is important to note that the study with a significant finding reported above (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1982</LINK>) could not be included in the network as it did not form any link.</P>
<P>Effect estimates (the evidence) were judged as being at low or very low quality. This was driven by the unclear risk of bias for most studies and the imprecision due to the limited number and size of studies.</P>
<P>When considered in terms of probability of a treatment being the best (the most effective in preventing SSI), analysis suggested that 4% chlorhexidine scrub (in 70% alcohol) has a 78% probability of being the best treatment in terms of preventing SSI, followed by iodophor in alcohol with a 16% probability of being the best and standard soap scrub followed by methylated spirit with 4% probability of being the best. We note that all the treatments that were estimated as having the highest probability of being effective were all alcohol-containing products (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Again it is important to note the low quality of this evidence.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-06 16:50:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included thirteen studies involving a total of 2,623 participants in this review. We did not find any studies that compared skin antisepsis with no skin antisepsis. A large number of different skin cleansing products were evaluated across these 13 trials resulting in 11 comparisons. It is unclear whether the array of products used reflects changes in practice over time or differing practice at local, national or international levels.</P>
<P>One study, classed as being at unclear risk of bias, demonstrated a significant reduction in rates of SSI when skin was prepared with 0.5% chlorhexidine in methylated spirit compared with povidone iodine (in alcohol) paint (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1982</LINK>). Further interpretation of this study data was limited by the lack of detailed description of the interventions evaluated i.e. the concentration of povidone iodine. However, the study does suggest that a chlorhexidine-containing treatment solution was more effective than alcohol-based povidone iodine paint. No other comparisons yielded statistically significant differences. </P>
<P>Ten out of thirteen studies were linked in a mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis - <LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berry-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1982</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Shirahatti-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shirahatti 1993</LINK> could not be linked to the network. This analysis suggested that 4% chlorhexidine scrub (in 70% alcohol) had the highest probability of being effective and that overall alcohol-based solutions had the higher probabilities of being effective than aqueous-based solutions.<BR/>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-02-06 16:51:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whilst only one study demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the rate of SSI between antiseptics, it is important to note that many studies randomised relatively small numbers of participants and therefore had low statistical power to detect a difference even if it existed. Indeed it is notable that of the 13 included studies three (23%) reported no SSI outcomes in either arm and thus contribute no outcome data to the analysis. The universally limited quality of the studies also impacts on the quality of, and thus confidence in, the effect estimates derived from the mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-02-23 15:48:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There has been some suggestion in the literature that perhaps the 'active ingredient' of skin antiseptics is the alcohol solution as it has antimicrobial properties (<LINK REF="REF-Kamel-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamel 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maiwald-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maiwald 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maiwald-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maiwald 2014</LINK>). Whilst not significant, our comparison of trials comparing alcohol-based vs. aqueous based solutions showed an potentially interesting signal towards alcohol which was also observed in the mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis findings - however, no firm conclusions can be drawn based on the current evidence in this area.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-02-06 16:51:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A comprehensive review of current evidence found evidence from a single study that preoperative skin preparation with 0.5% chlorhexidine solution in methylated spirits was more effective in preventing SSIs following clean surgery than alcohol-based povidone iodine paint. However poor reporting of this trial makes this finding difficult to act upon. Practitioners may therefore elect to consider other characteristics such as costs and potential side effects when choosing between alternatives.<BR/>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-02-07 16:34:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are 13 RCTs included in this review presenting data from over 2,000 participants who have agreed to contribute data for clinical research. However, the range of antiseptics evaluated (resulting in the 11 different study-related comparisons), the sometimes limited description of interventions and the relative small sample sizes of the trials make the evidence difficult to interpret and have confidence in. Yet, whilst relatively rare, SSIs following clean surgery are an important issue given the large number of people undergoing surgery annually world-wide.</P>
<P>Given the large number of treatment options, the design of future trials should be driven by the questions of high priority to decision makers. It may be that investment in at least one large trial (in terms of participants) is warranted in order to add definitive and hopefully conclusive data to the current evidence base. Ideally any future trial would evaluate the iodine-containing and chlorhexidine-containing solutions relevant to current practice as well as the type of solution used (alcohol vs. aqueous). Finally, current trials report very limited data on secondary outcomes. Outcomes such as adverse events and resource use may have an important role in influencing decision making regarding the use of different pre-operative skin cleaning products and thus should be assessed.</P>

<P>In response to the publication of a Cochrane review considering the use of plastic adhesive drapes during surgery for preventing SSI (<LINK REF="REF-Webster-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 2011</LINK>) in this update the inclusion criteria was narrowed to include only studies of antiseptic solutions or powders (applied to the patient in the immediate preoperative period).

<P>The Ovid MEDLINE search strategy can be viewed in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> and was adapted as appropriate for the EMBASE and CINAHL searches. The MEDLINE search was combined with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximizing version (2008 revision); Ovid format. The EMBASE and CINAHL searches were combined with the trial filters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network.</P>
<P>The authors also searched web based resources in January 2008: Guideline Finder Specialist Library, Research Findings Register, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination web site, National Electronic Library for Health (Surgery, Theatres and Anaesthetic Specialist Library).</P>
<P>In addition we also searched the bibliographies of all retrieved and relevant publications identified by these strategies for further studies. We placed no specific date restriction upon study inclusion. We also contacted manufacturers and distributors of antiseptic agents as well as professional organisations, for example Association for Perioperative Practice, AORN, Royal College of Surgeons of England, and The Association of Operating Department Practitioners, for details of unpublished and ongoing studies. We did not restrict the search by language or publication status.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of either Yes or No (as above) to be made.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2.  Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Low risk of bias</HEADING>

<B>Indirectness/Inconsistency</B>
</P>
<P>Within GRADE the term inconsistency is used to refer to unexplained heterogeneity. Within mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis inconsistency has meaning specific to agreement between direct and indirect data. Furthermore, in GRADE the presence of indirectness is taken as a reason to downgrade evidence &#8211; however in the context of an mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis where indirect data is expected and ideally adds value such an approach does not make sense. Thus we merged these categories resulting in joint assessment of unexplained heterogeneity and/or assessment of inconsistency where possible.</P>

<B>Qualitative assessment of publication bias difficult for indirect evidence </B>
</P>
<P>Again, in the presence of both direct and indirect evidence there is the need to consider potential publication bias in the indirect links as well as the direct links informing the same comparison. Yet, outlined in the discussion of limitations, assessing potential bias in indirect comparison is complex. If, for example, AC is biased (missing studies) favouring A and BC is biased (missing studies) favouring B, then the AB indirect estimate will be unbiased if the bias in AC is similar to the bias in BC.</P>
