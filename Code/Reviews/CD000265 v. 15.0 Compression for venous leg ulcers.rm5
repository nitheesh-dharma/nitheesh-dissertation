<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-10 11:04:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Venous leg ulcers can occur when blood returning from veins in the legs to the heart is slow or obstructed. These ulcers can take a long time to heal (weeks or months) and can cause distress to patients, as well as being very costly to the health service. Compression bandages help blood to return to the heart from the legs, and there are a variety of types of bandage systems available; some are just a single bandage, while others require the application of several different types of bandages to the leg. Compression stockings are sometimes used as an alternative to compression bandages. This review examined the effectiveness of compression bandages versus no compression, and compared different types of compression bandages and stockings. We looked at how well these different treatments work in terms of ulcer healing. We found that applying compression was better than not using compression, and that multi-component bandages worked better than single-component systems. Multi-component systems (bandages or stockings) appear to perform better when one part is an elastic (stretchy) bandage. A very detailed analysis showed that a system called the 'four-layer bandage' or '4LB' (i.e. four different bandages applied to the leg, including an elastic one) heals ulcers faster than the 'short-stretch bandage' or 'SSB' (a type of bandage with very minimal stretch).</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-06-07 15:27:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Up to one percent of people in industrialised countries will suffer from a leg ulcer at some time. The majority of these leg ulcers are due to problems in the veins, resulting in an accumulation of blood in the legs. Leg ulcers arising from venous problems are called venous (or varicose or stasis) ulcers. The main treatment is the application of a firm compression garment (bandage or stocking) in order to aid venous return. There is a large number of compression garments available and it was unclear whether they are effective in treating venous ulcers and, if so, which method of compression is the most effective.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-06-07 15:28:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To undertake a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects on venous ulcer healing of compression bandages and stockings.</P>
<P>Specific questions addressed by the review are:</P>
<P>1. Does the application of compression bandages or stockings aid venous ulcer healing?<BR/>2. Which compression bandage or stocking system is the most effective?</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-09-06 10:32:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this second update we searched: the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (31 May 2012); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 5, 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to May Week 4 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations 30 May 2012); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2012 Week 21); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 30 May 2012).

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-08-04 10:36:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>RCTs recruiting people with venous leg ulceration that evaluated any type of compression bandage system or compression stockings were eligible for inclusion. Eligible comparators included no compression (e.g. primary dressing alone, non-compressive bandage) or an alternative type of compression. RCTs had to report an objective measure of ulcer healing in order to be included (primary outcome for the review). Secondary outcomes of the review included ulcer recurrence, costs, quality of life, pain, adverse events and withdrawals. There was no restriction on date, language or publication status of RCTs.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-20 09:30:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Forty-eight RCTs reporting 59 comparisons were included (4321 participants in total). Most RCTs were small, and most were at unclear or high risk of bias. Duration of follow-up varied across RCTs. Risk ratio (RR) and other estimates are shown below where RCTs were pooled; otherwise findings refer to a single RCT.</P>
<P>There was evidence from eight RCTs (unpooled) that healing outcomes (including time to healing) are better when patients receive compression compared with no compression.</P>
<P>Single-component compression bandage systems are less effective than multi-component compression for complete healing at six months (one large RCT).</P>
<P>A two-component system containing an elastic bandage healed more ulcers at one year than one without an elastic component (one small RCT).</P>
<P>Three-component systems containing an elastic component healed more ulcers than those without elastic at three to four months (two RCTs pooled), RR 1.83 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.67), but another RCT showed no difference between groups at six months.</P>
<P>An individual patient data meta-analysis of five RCTs suggested significantly faster healing with the four-layer bandage (4LB) than the short stretch bandage (SSB): median days to healing estimated at 90 and 99 respectively; hazard ratio 1.31 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.58).<BR/>
</P>
<P>High-compression stockings are associated with better healing outcomes than SSB at two to four months: RR 1.62 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.10), estimate from four pooled RCTs.</P>
<P>One RCT suggested better healing outcomes at 16 months with the addition of a tubular device plus single elastic bandage to a base system of gauze and crepe bandages when compared with two added elastic bandages. Another RCT had three arms; when one or two elastic bandages were added to a base three-component system that included an outer tubular layer, healing outcomes were better at six months for the two groups receiving elastic bandages.</P>
<P>There is currently no evidence of a statistically significant difference for the following comparisons:</P>
<P>&#8901;alternative single-component compression bandages (two RCTs, unpooled);<BR/>&#8901;two-component bandages compared with the 4LB at three months (three RCTs pooled);<BR/>&#8901;alternative versions of the 4LB for complete healing at times up to and including six months (three RCTs, unpooled);<BR/>&#8901;4LB compared with paste bandage for complete healing at three months (two RCTs, pooled), six months or one year (one RCT for each time point);<BR/>&#8901;adjustable compression boots compared with paste bandages for the outcome of change in ulcer area at three months (one small RCT);<BR/>&#8901;adjustable compression boots compared with the 4LB with respect to complete healing at three months (one small RCT);<BR/>&#8901;single-layer compression stocking compared with paste bandages for outcome of complete healing at four months (one small RCT) and 18 months (another small RCT);<BR/>&#8901;low compression stocking compared with SSB for complete healing at three and six months (one small RCT);<BR/>&#8901;compression stockings compared with a two-component bandage system and the 4LB for the outcome of complete healing at three months (one small, three-armed RCT); and,<BR/>&#8901;tubular compression compared with SSB (one small RCT) for complete healing at three months.</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes: 4LB was more cost-effective than SSB. It was not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding other secondary outcomes including recurrence, adverse events and health-related quality of life.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-08-04 10:42:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Compression increases ulcer healing rates compared with no compression. Multi-component systems are more effective than single-component systems. Multi-component systems containing an elastic bandage appear to be more effective than those composed mainly of inelastic constituents. Two-component bandage systems appear to perform as well as the 4LB. Patients receiving the 4LB heal faster than those allocated the SSB. More patients heal on high-compression stocking systems than with the SSB. Further data are required before the difference between high-compression stockings and the 4LB can be established.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Venous leg ulcers: the extent of the problem and management with compression</HEADING>
<P>Leg ulceration is typically a chronic recurring condition with duration of episodes of ulceration ranging from a matter of weeks to more than 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Callam-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noonan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noonan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lorimer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorimer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vowden-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vowden 2009b</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review of the epidemiological literature from developed countries reported prevalence rates for any aetiology of open lower limb ulceration ranging from 1.2 to 11.0 per 1000 population (cases validated) (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2003</LINK>). Recent surveys undertaken in the UK collected data from populations in Wandsworth, London (<LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 2004</LINK>), Hull and East Yorkshire (<LINK REF="REF-Srinivasaiah-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Srinivasaiah 2007</LINK>), and Bradford and Airedale primary care trust (<LINK REF="REF-Vowden-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vowden 2009a</LINK>). The prevalence of venous leg ulceration was estimated as 0.23 per 1000 population in London (<LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 2004</LINK>), 0.44 per 1000 in Hull and East Yorkshire (<LINK REF="REF-Srinivasaiah-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Srinivasaiah 2007</LINK>), and 0.39 per 1000 in Bradford (<LINK REF="REF-Vowden-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vowden 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vowden-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vowden 2009b</LINK>). The lower estimates in the recent UK surveys relative to the earlier worldwide literature (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2003</LINK>) - searches done during 2000 - might be explained by improvements in treatment as well as the broad versus narrow selection criteria for leg ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Vowden-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vowden 2009b</LINK>). The epidemiological data have consistently suggested that prevalence increases with age and is higher among women (<LINK REF="REF-Callam-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1992a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Graham-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lorimer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorimer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vowden-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vowden 2009b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Leg ulcers are associated with considerable cost to patients and to healthcare providers. Two systematic reviews summarised the literature on health-related quality of life in patients with leg ulcers; one included 24 studies (<LINK REF="REF-Herber-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herber 2007</LINK>), and the other 37 (<LINK REF="REF-Persoon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Persoon 2004</LINK>). Both reviews included qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and reported that presence of leg ulceration was associated with pain, restriction of work and leisure activities, impaired mobility and social isolation.</P>
<P>The estimated annual cost of leg ulcer treatment to the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK was between GBP 230 million and GBP 400 million during 1990-1991 (<LINK REF="REF-Bosanquet-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosanquet 1992</LINK>). A later study estimated the cost of leg ulcer care within individual UK district health authorities at GBP 212,700 to GBP 333,377 annually per district (price year 1999) (<LINK REF="REF-Ellison-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellison 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Ragnarson-Tennvall-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ragnarson Tennvall 2005</LINK> estimated that the average cost of treating a venous leg ulcer in the UK was between EUR 814 and EUR 1994 (price year 2002), with higher costs associated with larger and more chronic wounds. Drew et al estimated that GBP 3.21 million was spent on dressings and other materials in Hull and East Yorkshire during 2005-2006; the cost of nursing time for wound care during the same period was GBP 6.08 million (<LINK REF="REF-Drew-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drew 2007</LINK>). Vowden et al estimated that in Bradford, GBP 1.69 million was spent on dressings and compression bandages and GBP 3.08 million on nursing time (2006-2007 prices) (<LINK REF="REF-Vowden-2009c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vowden 2009c</LINK>). The latter two reports relate to the care of all types of wounds, not just venous leg ulcers. <LINK REF="REF-Posnett-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Posnett 2007</LINK> estimated the costs of venous ulcers to the UK NHS at GBP 168 million to GBP 198 million annually (price year 2005-2006). The differences between the 1990-1991 estimates and those from 2005-2006 may be explained by limitations of the source data (<LINK REF="REF-Posnett-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Posnett 2007</LINK>), or a true reduction in costs attributable to lower prevalence.</P>
<P>Most leg ulcers are associated with venous disease. A history of deep vein thrombosis is widely regarded as a predisposing factor to venous insufficiency and, hence, venous ulceration, however, the aetiology of leg ulceration remains poorly understood. Venous insufficiency has been shown to be associated with increased hydrostatic pressure in the veins of the leg, and it is in an attempt to reverse this and aid venous return that external compression, in various forms, is applied as a therapy for venous leg ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Various forms of bandaging have been applied over the years. In the 17th Century, compression was applied as rigid lace-up stockings, and elasticated bandages were first produced in the middle of the 19th Century (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1995</LINK>). At the beginning of the 21st century wide variation remains in the management of venous leg ulcers within local areas (<LINK REF="REF-Srinivasaiah-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Srinivasaiah 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vowden-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vowden 2009b</LINK>), and across countries (<LINK REF="REF-Cullen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullen 2009</LINK>). In North America, Unna's boot is a popular choice of device (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>). This is a type of paste bandage, often impregnated with preparations such as glycerin, zinc oxide and calamine lotion (<LINK REF="STD-Rubin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rubin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BNF-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2012</LINK>). Such devices can be completely inelastic or may have a degree of pliability (<LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 2007</LINK>). In the UK the four-layer bandage (4LB) - which includes elastic components - is widely used (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>), whilst in mainland Europe and Australia the short-stretch bandage (SSB) is standard practice (<LINK REF="STD-Weller-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Weller 2010</LINK>). This review summarises the evidence for the effectiveness of the different forms of compression bandaging and compression stockings for venous leg ulcers. Devices that apply intermittent or pulsed compression to the limb were specifically excluded from this review and have been assessed in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Classification of different types of compression</HEADING>
<P>There are many ways of applying compression, including single components (i.e. one type of bandage or stocking) and systems consisting of multiple components (different types of bandages and stockings used together or separately). The interpretation of comparisons between compression systems has been hindered by the lack of internationally agreed performance standards, for example the classification systems for compression stockings differ between the UK and Europe. In the UK, performance indicators for bandages and compression stockings have been developed (<LINK REF="REF-British-Standards-Institute1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">British Standards Institute1995</LINK>). Bandages are categorised as retention, support or compression, depending on their performance in standardised laboratory tests. Compression bandages are further sub-divided according to the amount of force required to extend them, and, therefore, the level of compression that they can apply to a limb. Furthermore, the laboratory performance of a bandage may not reflect its performance in clinical use, as this might depend upon operator training and application technique (specifically whether applied as a spiral or figure-of-eight, the numbers of layers applied and the amount of extension used). Compression systems commonly used for venous leg ulcers are listed below (from <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1995</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Recent developments in the classification of compression systems</HEADING>
<P>An international, expert consensus group debated the validity of the bandage classification described above, and recommended classification based on alternative criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Partsch-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partsch 2008b</LINK>). In particular, the group made a distinction between layers and components of compression bandage systems. Whereas previously, different compression systems had been described as 'single-layer', two-layer', 'four-layer' and so on, this report proposed that application of all bandages involves some degree of overlap and therefore it is misleading to categorise any bandage system as 'single-layer'. The group recommended that the components of compression should be described, such as orthopaedic wool, crepe bandage or cohesive elastic bandages. Other recommended classification criteria include sub-bandage pressure (measured in the medial gaiter area with the patient supine) and the elastic property of the overall compression system. In terms of sub-bandage pressure, the group proposed alternative categories to those described by the British Standards Institute (<LINK REF="REF-British-Standards-Institute1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">British Standards Institute1995</LINK>), based on <I>in vivo </I>measurements. Overall, the ranges of pressure proposed by the consensus group are higher than those from the British Standards Institute. The recommendation to assess the elastic property of the compression system overall has arisen from the notion that, although individual parts of a compression bandage system may be elastic, the interaction between different components might result in a system that is inelastic. In order to assess this, a measurement called the 'static stiffness index' (SSI) has been proposed; this is defined as the difference in sub-bandage pressures measured in standing and supine positions. A pressure increase of more than 10 mmHg when the patient moves from supine to standing has been suggested to indicate inelasticity (high stiffness), and an increase of less than 10 mmHg corresponds to elasticity (low stiffness) (<LINK REF="REF-Partsch-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partsch 2008b</LINK>). Findings from a study of haemodynamics in 42 patients with chronic venous insufficiency treated with class II compression stockings suggested that the quotient of maximum working pressure to resting pressure (a measure of stiffness) is closely related to haemodynamic improvement, with increasing quotient representing reduced venous reflux (<LINK REF="REF-H_x00e4_fner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Häfner 2001</LINK>). The relationship between any of these parameters and ability to aid healing remains unknown. Where compression bandages are used as a single component, they can still be defined as 'elastic' and 'inelastic' (<LINK REF="REF-Partsch-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partsch 2008b</LINK>). The following are examples of multi-component bandage systems (listed for illustrative purposes only; not intended as practice recommendations):</P>
<UL>
<LI>short stretch/inelastic systems - orthopaedic padding plus one or two rolls of SSB;</LI>
<LI>inelastic paste systems - paste bandage plus support bandage, e.g. Setocrepe® (Mölnlycke);</LI>
<LI>two-component bandage systems - orthopaedic padding plus elastic bandage, e.g. ProGuide® (Smith &amp; Nephew);</LI>
<LI>four-component bandage systems - orthopaedic padding plus support bandage (crepe) plus class 3a bandage, e.g. Elset® (Mölnlycke) plus cohesive bandage, e.g. Coban® (3M).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The earliest version of this review defined different compression systems in terms of the number of layers, whereas, in line with the recommendations of the consensus group outlined above, subsequent versions refer to components. Nonetheless, where a trial treatment is the original Charing Cross four-layer bandage, or a close variant of it, we have continued to use the term 'four-layer bandage' (4LB), as this is an internationally recognised bandage system. It is more difficult to classify different compression systems in relation to sub-bandage pressures or the SSI since, in general, this information is not available from clinical trial reports. In order to gain further insights into the optimal way to classify different compression systems, we consulted experts in tissue viability at the outset of the previous update of this review, and invited them to complete a survey. The survey listed different types of compression against various classifications and respondents were asked to provide the best choice of classification in their opinion. In addition, free text comments were invited. As far as possible, the information gleaned from this exercise has been used in classifying and grouping different types of compression therapy in this review, and in aiding interpretation of findings.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Risks associated with use of compression</HEADING>
<P>The use of compression to enhance venous return and aid the healing of venous ulcers is not without risk. The application of external compression has been reported to lead to pressure damage in some cases (<LINK REF="REF-Callam-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Callam-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Callam 1992b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barwell 2004</LINK>). This may be due to application of excessive pressure or application of pressure in the presence of arterial insufficiency. National clinical guidelines in the UK and USA recommend that all patients presenting with a leg ulcer be screened for arterial disease using Doppler measurement of the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) by suitably trained staff (<LINK REF="REF-Royal-College-of-Nursing-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royal College of Nursing 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAWC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAWC 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2010</LINK>). Clinically significant arterial disease is often defined using a cut-off of the ABPI of below 0.8. Patients with venous leg ulceration who have ABPI between 0.5 and 0.7 may be eligible to receive modified (reduced) compression (<LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 2007</LINK>). As part of this review, data on baseline ABPI and adverse events related to treatment have been recorded, where available.</P>

<P>For most comparisons, data analysis was undertaken on the basis of group level (aggregate) data extracted from each trial report. The exception to this was the comparison of 4LB and SSB (Section 2.4.2) for which patient level data were available, enabling a meta-analysis of individual patient data (IPD). Methods for this were based on those developed by the Cochrane Individual Participant Data Meta-analysis Methods Group (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1995</LINK>), and were pre-specified in a separate protocol from the main review (available on request). Advantages of IPD meta-analyses include the opportunity to: conduct powerful time-to-event analyses; adjust for prognostic patient-level variables; update outcome data; verify the accuracy of data; and reinstate missing data (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2002</LINK>). The use of patient-level data usually allows for a more sensitive analysis, enabling the best, unbiased, estimate of treatment effect to be obtained (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1993</LINK>). The following sections refer to methods used for the main review of aggregate data. An outline of the methods used for the IPD meta-analysis is provided at the end of the main methods section. </P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-07-11 14:03:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this review update all included trials were individually assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool addresses six specific domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding (outcome assessment of healing); incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other issues (for this review, baseline comparability of groups for prognostic factors such as ulcer surface area and duration). We completed a risk of bias table for each eligible trial. RCTs were classified as being at an overall high risk of bias if they were rated as 'high risk' for any one of three key domains: allocation concealment; blinded outcome assessment of healing; and completeness of outcome data. The overall classification was rated as 'unclear' if any of the key domains was individually rated as being at 'unclear risk of bias.' RCTs were classified as being at an overall low risk of bias only if all key domains were rated as 'low risk of bias'. We have presented assessment of risk of bias using a risk of bias summary figure, which presents all of the judgements in a cross-tabulation of RCT by risk of bias domain.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2012-09-19 18:56:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Included trials were grouped in the narrative synthesis according to the types of compression they compared. Within each comparison group, studies were pooled when they appeared similar in terms of methods, participant characteristics, interventions and outcomes. A test of statistical heterogeneity was generated for each pooled outcome. Significant statistical heterogeneity was defined as a chi-squared P value of 0.1 or less and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was generated in order to estimate the percentage of the variability in estimates of effect due to heterogeneity rather than chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). It has been suggested that when the I<SUP>2</SUP> estimation is greater than zero, both fixed-effect and random-effects analyses should be undertaken, and any difference in estimates noted (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2008</LINK>). Where clinical, methodological and statistical heterogeneity were not apparent, similar studies were pooled using a fixed-effect model. A random-effects model was additionally applied where I<SUP>2</SUP> was greater than zero in the absence of apparent clinical or methodological heterogeneity. Where pooling was not possible or appropriate, individual estimates from trials were reported in the narrative synthesis.</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes (e.g. frequency of complete healing during the trial period), risk ratio (RR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial individually and pooled if considered appropriate. The RR was presented in preference to the odds ratio (OR), as the latter gives an inflated impression of the size of effect when event rates are high, as is the case for most trials reporting healing of chronic wounds. In studies where trial authors excluded randomised patients from their own analyses we assumed that the ulcer did not heal in these cases (therefore they were included in the denominator but not the numerator for the RR estimate of healing). Where a trial did not specify the number of patients per group prior to withdrawal, we presented complete case data.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes (e.g. percentage change in ulcer surface area, healing rate in cm<SUP>2</SUP> per week), the difference in means with 95% CI was calculated for each trial individually. Where appropriate, trials were pooled using the weighted difference in means. When trials assessed the same outcome using different scales (e.g. change in ulcer area in cm<SUP>2</SUP> and as a percentage) but otherwise did not appear to be methodologically, clinically or statistically heterogeneous, estimates were pooled using the standardised mean difference (SMD). Where sufficient information was available from the trial report, we presented data according to intention to treat; otherwise we presented a complete case analysis.</P>
<P>In terms of time-to-event outcomes, it was planned to plot (and, if appropriate, pool) estimates of hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI as presented in the trial reports using the generic inverse variance method in RevMan version 5.1.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Methods for the individual patient data meta-analysis</HEADING>
<P>The methods used were broadly similar to the above with the following additional considerations.</P>
<P>The primary outcome was time to healing, defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of healing, with healing defined as complete epithelialisation of the reference wound. Data for patients with ulcers not healing within the trial period were censored on the date of last follow-up. Secondary outcomes included time to ulcer recurrence (defined as the time interval between healing and recurrence) and adverse events.</P>
<P>Trialists who contributed original data were asked to provide details of any additional or unpublished trials that they knew of, that had not been identified by the main search strategy described above.</P>
<P>Data extraction was carried out for each RCT on the basis of information provided in published trial reports. In addition, trialists were asked to provide anonymised baseline and outcome data for each randomised patient, including those excluded from their own analyses. Baseline data included sex, age, primary or recurrent ulceration, ulcer duration, ulcer area, ulcer diameter, appearance of wound bed, ulcer infection, ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI), ankle circumference, ankle mobility, patient mobility, and history of co-morbidities such as deep vein thrombosis. Outcome variables included healing status (healed or not), date of healing, recurrence status, date of recurrence, ulcer area at follow-up points during the trial, and adverse events. In addition, the trialists were asked to provide date of randomisation, allocated treatment, date of last follow-up, and details of exclusion from analysis. The risk of bias assessment was informed by published reports plus additional information from each trialist. Data from each trial were also subject to additional systematic checks to determine completeness, duplication, consistency, feasibility, and integrity of randomisation (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1995</LINK>). Queries were resolved with the relevant trialist.</P>
<P>The patient was the unit of analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1997</LINK>). In cases where patients had multiple wounds included in the trial, we selected the largest for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Analyses were undertaken on an intention-to-treat basis (that is, according to randomised allocation group with inclusion of all patients as the aim). Imputation was not undertaken for missing data.</P>
<P>In order to provide an analysis that was congruent with others in this review, we pooled data from trials for the outcome of complete healing during the trial period. We then generated a preliminary (unadjusted) analysis of time to healing using non-stratified Kaplan-Meier survival curves for both treatment groups. The dependent variable was time to healing in days, the event was a healed ulcer, and the factor was bandage type.</P>
<P>Next, we generated a Cox proportional hazards model with time to healing in days as the dependent variable, healing as the event, and bandage type as a covariate. This preliminary model did not include adjustment for baseline characteristics. The main, formal, preplanned analysis entailed a Cox proportional hazards model as described above with additional covariates of sex, age, primary or recurrent ulceration, ulcer duration, ulcer area, ulcer diameter, appearance of wound bed, ulcer infection, ankle brachial pressure index, ankle circumference, ankle mobility, patient&#8217;s mobility, and history of deep vein thrombosis. Covariates found to be significant at the 5% level in univariate analyses were entered simultaneously into the model. We then used a backward elimination method to generate HR estimates of treatment effect. The model was extended to include tests of statistical interaction between type of bandage and baseline characteristics using a statistical significance threshold of p&lt;0.05. To take account of any differences in healing rate between study centres, we entered centres into the model as strata. This automatically included trials as strata also as no centre was in more than one trial.</P>
<P>The proportional hazards assumption requires that the hazard ratio is constant over time (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1991</LINK>). We carried out checks to assess the proportional hazards assumption by generating survival curves for each category of a covariate found to be significant during univariate analyses using the log minus log of the hazard function on the vertical axis, and the log of time to healing in days on the horizontal axis. The event was ulcer healing. Any continuous covariates were dichotomised at the median in order to be able to generate the required curves which were examined visually to determine whether the proportional hazards assumption had been upheld. This was judged to be the case if the curves representing different categories of a covariate were approximately parallel (<LINK REF="REF-Elashoff-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elashoff 1983</LINK>). In addition, each covariate was assessed analytically by fitting a time-dependent Cox model for each covariate of interest. The proportional hazards assumption was considered to be upheld if, when a given variable was entered as a time dependent covariate, it failed to make a statistically significant contribution to the model (<LINK REF="REF-Kalbfleisch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalbfleisch 2002</LINK>). For any covariate where the proportional hazards assumption was not met, it was planned to re-run the model entering it as a time dependent covariate.</P>
<P>We also carried out checks to assess the linearity of the relation between the dependent variable and continuous covariates; whether time to healing was similar during early and late accrual (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1998</LINK>); and adequacy of model fit with regard to the relation between the number of events and the number of covariates included in each model (<LINK REF="REF-Peduzzi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peduzzi 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>To generate a forest plot showing the relative contribution of each trial to the meta-analysis, we derived individual trial estimates from the IPD using Cox regression with covariate adjustment as per the final adjusted model. These HR estimates were converted into the log HR and its standard error, and combined using the generic inverse variance method. This allowed assessment of statistical heterogeneity between trials, using the chi-squared test (threshold P value 0.1) and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). When I<SUP>2</SUP> was greater than zero, the analysis was repeated using a random-effects model and sources of heterogeneity were investigated using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>In terms of secondary outcomes, it was planned to repeat the analyses described above for time to healing with respect to time to ulcer recurrence. Adverse events were defined in two ways: as any adverse event or those considered by the trialists to be related to the bandage. For each of these outcomes, we assessed the effect of bandage type on the prevalence of adverse events using the OR with associated 95% CI. We compared the number of adverse events per patient for the two different bandage systems using a weighted difference in means with associated 95% CI. For all pooled analyses of adverse events, we defined statistical heterogeneity between individual trial estimates using the criteria described above.</P>
<P>Survival analyses were conducted with SPSS (version 15.0). The Kaplan-Meier plot was generated with Stata SE (version 10). Adverse event analyses and forest plots were generated using RevMan (version 5.1).</P>

One international trial was conducted in the UK, USA and Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Moffatt-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moffatt 2008</LINK>). In terms of the type of setting, all RCTs (where described) were conducted in outpatient and community settings, with three trials recruiting some hospitalised patients as part of the sample (<LINK REF="STD-Kralj-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kralj 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ukat-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ukat 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polignano-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Polignano 2004a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The number of patients in the included RCTs ranged from 10 to 387. Forty percent of the included trials had sample sizes of 50 patients or fewer, and the majority of trials (67%) recruited 100 patients or fewer. Nine trials reported an a priori sample size estimation in relation to a healing outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Morrell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Morrell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moffatt-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Moffatt 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ukat-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ukat 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2007a</LINK>). Three evaluations were designed as non-inferiority trials and presented a proposed non-inferiority margin (<LINK REF="STD-Moffatt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Moffatt 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00fc_nger-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Jünger 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00fc_nger-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Jünger 2004b</LINK>). Non-inferiority trials are designed to establish whether the study (or new) treatment is not worse than the control treatment by more than a small, pre-specified amount; this amount is known as the non-inferiority margin (<LINK REF="REF-European-Medicines-Agency-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">European Medicines Agency 2005</LINK>). Two more studies included some information about the intended sample size but did not show the full details of the estimation (<LINK REF="STD-Milic-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Milic 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brizzio-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Brizzio 2010</LINK>); one failed to recruit the entire intended sample (<LINK REF="STD-Polignano-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Polignano 2004a</LINK>); one included a post hoc assessment of statistical power with respect to healing (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2002</LINK>); and one included an a priori estimation for a non-healing outcome (bandage slippage) (<LINK REF="STD-Moffatt-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moffatt 2008</LINK>). The remaining 31 trials (65%) did not report any information about statistical power or sample size estimation.</P>
<P>All patients in the included RCTs were deemed to have venous ulceration, and the majority of trials (39/48 or 81%) specified a cut-off value of ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) to exclude clinically significant arterial disease at baseline. The cut-off point for application of compression was 0.8 in the majority of these studies (27/39 or 69%), other values being 0.7 and 0.75 in one trial each, 0.9 in nine trials and 1.0 in one trial. Most of the trial reports provided some information on patient selection criteria. Four trials presented minimal details, describing only the cut-off value for ABPI (<LINK REF="STD-Charles-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Charles 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duby-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Duby 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ukat-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ukat 2003</LINK>), and three early trials did not include any details at all relating to inclusion and exclusion of patients, apart from the stipulation of having a venous leg ulcer (<LINK REF="STD-Hendricks-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hendricks 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knight-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Knight 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The amount of pressure applied to a leg depends on bandage application or stocking-fitting technique. Overall, few details relating to the techniques used for applying compression or relevant staff experience and training were reported in the included RCTs. Some reports stated that compression devices were applied according to the manufacturers' instructions (<LINK REF="STD-Hendricks-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hendricks 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kikta-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kikta 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moody-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Moody 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00fc_nger-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Jünger 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polignano-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Polignano 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moffatt-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moffatt 2008</LINK>); in other RCTs this was established through contact with the trial authors (<LINK REF="STD-Scriven-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Scriven 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ukat-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ukat 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>).

In some trials, patients or their relatives were involved in the application of compression devices: in a trial of compression boots, patients adjusted the straps between clinic visits in order to help maintain the original degree of compression (<LINK REF="STD-DePalma-1999" TYPE="STUDY">DePalma 1999</LINK>); in other RCTs, patients or relatives were instructed to reapply bandages between clinic visits (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ukat-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ukat 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00fc_nger-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Jünger 2004b</LINK>), or were involved in the application of compression stockings (<LINK REF="STD-Hendricks-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hendricks 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00fc_nger-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Jünger 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polignano-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Polignano 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mariani-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mariani 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>In some respects, the methodological quality of clinical trials of compression appears to be improving over time, with evaluations published within the last ten years being more likely to include an appropriate method of randomisation, with attempts to generate balanced groups at baseline, use of allocation concealment and analysis by intention to treat.

<P>Ten trials employed computer-generated randomisation lists (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moffatt-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Moffatt 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polignano-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Polignano 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milic-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Milic 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moffatt-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moffatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taradaj-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Taradaj 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milic-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Milic 2010</LINK>), and one used random number tables to generate the randomisation sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Wilkinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkinson 1997</LINK>).

In the remaining 29 trials, treatment allocation was described as being random with no other information provided, and so they were classified as having an unclear risk of bias for this domain.</P>
<P>Three trials were factorial and included additional randomised comparisons of other interventions used concurrently with compression: i.e. knitted viscose dressing versus foam dressing (<LINK REF="STD-Callam-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Callam 1992b</LINK>); two different foam dressings (<LINK REF="STD-Franks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 2004</LINK>); and knitted viscose dressing versus hydrocolloid dressing and oral pentoxifylline versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2007a</LINK>).

In addition, 11 studies reported the use of sealed envelopes with some other detail about this method (i.e. opaque envelopes and/or opened in sequential order) and we assumed that this would amount to adequate allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Morrell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Morrell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scriven-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Scriven 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vowden-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Vowden 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ukat-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ukat 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00fc_nger-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Jünger 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polignano-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Polignano 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taradaj-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Taradaj 2009</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1 Compression compared with primary dressing alone (three RCTs)</HEADING>
<P>Three trials compared the use of compression with primary dressings alone (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kikta-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kikta 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taradaj-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Taradaj 2007</LINK>). All were small, with two classified as being at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kikta-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kikta 1988</LINK>), and the other at an unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Taradaj-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Taradaj 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1984</LINK> recruited 44 participants and reported mean percentage decrease in ulcer area and volume at eight weeks, which were both greater for compression. The values, as read from a figure with no available variability estimates, were: porcine skin dressing 65% (area) and 75% (volume); aluminium foil dressing 10% and 0%; and compression 80% and 90% respectively. The estimates for the group receiving the porcine skin dressing are difficult to interpret as the randomised intervention ceased mid-study because of lack of availability of the dressing. At this point, patients in this group crossed over to the compression treatment. Six patients receiving the aluminium foil dressing discontinued treatment because of ulcer deterioration. None of the patients randomised to compression discontinued treatment.</P>
<P>The second study recruited 84 patients with 87 venous leg ulcers (<LINK REF="STD-Kikta-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kikta 1988</LINK>). More participants healed with Unna's boot (some compression) than hydrocolloid dressing alone though this difference was not statistically significant at six months when analysed for this review using the assumption that those lost to follow-up were unhealed: RR 1.50 (95% CI 0.90 to 2.50), P value 0.12 (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). None of the patients receiving compression discontinued treatment because of adverse events compared with 10 patients in the hydrocolloid group.</P>
<P>The third evaluation was a three-armed trial, but only one comparison was relevant to this review (49 participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Taradaj-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Taradaj 2007</LINK>). All patients were recruited post-operatively having undergone ligation and stripping of the saphenous or sagittal veins. Patients in both groups received moist normal saline dressings and pharmacotherapy in the form of a combined tablet preparation of diosmin 450 mg and hesperidin 50 mg (2 tablets daily). This preparation has been marketed as an agent to improve venous circulation (<LINK REF="REF-Stragen-Chemical-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stragen Chemical 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Belmont-Pharmacy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belmont Pharmacy 2012</LINK>). The group allocated compression received a two-component system comprising an elastic bandage and an outer stocking. After seven weeks of treatment, no statistically significant differences were observed between treatment groups in terms of mean percentage change in ulcer area relative to baseline: -62.6% for the non-compression group and -69.4% for compression, P value &gt; 0.05 (reported by trial authors). The finding was similar for mean percentage change in ulcer area per week: -8.9% and -9.9% respectively, P value &gt; 0.05 (reported by trial authors). No variability estimates were provided.

None of the patients randomised to compression withdrew from treatment, whereas nine of those allocated to the non-compressive regimen withdrew because of malodorous wound exudate.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.3 Compression compared with usual care that did not routinely include compression (four RCTs)</HEADING>
<P>One UK trial compared a SSB applied by a specialist nurse with usual district nurse care (not involving compression) (<LINK REF="STD-Charles-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Charles 1991</LINK>). The other three studies compared packages of specialised leg ulcer care that included provision of the 4LB, with usual primary care management that generally did not involve compression; two were conducted in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morrell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Morrell 1998</LINK>) and one in Ireland (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 2003</LINK>). Two trials were classified as being at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morrell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Morrell 1998</LINK>), whilst the other two were classified as unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Charles-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Charles 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the evaluation of SSB versus usual care (53 participants), more patients achieved complete healing at three months in the SSB group (71% versus 25%) (<LINK REF="STD-Charles-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Charles 1991</LINK>). The authors stated that this difference was statistically significant, but did not report the P value (data not plotted, as raw numbers unavailable). Twenty-one per cent of the usual care group experienced an increase in ulcer area during the trial versus none in the SSB group. Three patients withdrew from each group.</P>
<P>Three trials compared the 4LB provided in the context of a specialist leg ulcer community service with usual management by the general practitioner (GP) and district nurse (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morrell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Morrell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 2003</LINK>). In one trial (36 participants), significantly more patients experienced complete healing at three months in the compression group: RR 4.0 (95% CI 1.35 to 11.82), P value 0.01 (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1998</LINK>). Further analyses reported in the paper suggested that healing occurred more rapidly with the 4LB. Two patients withdrew from this treatment, compared with four in the usual care group. Cost analyses based on consumables, district nurse time and mileage estimated significantly lower values for the 4LB both per week and for the whole trial duration.</P>
<P>The second trial (233 participants) found no statistically significant difference in complete healing at one year (<LINK REF="STD-Morrell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Morrell 1998</LINK>): RR 1.18 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.47), P value 0.12 (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). However, survival analyses conducted by the trial authors suggested significantly faster time to healing for the compression group (median weeks to healing 20 versus 43, P value 0.03, log rank test). An adjusted HR estimate was also in favour of compression: HR 1.65 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.35) (P value &lt; 0.05, exact value not reported). Ulcer recurrence during the one-year trial period was not significantly different between groups: RR 1.53 (95% CI 0.88 to 2.66), P value 0.13 (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>) and the log rank test of difference in time to recurrence was also not significantly different between groups (P value 0.38). No significant differences were detected between groups either for change in health status during the trial, or for mean NHS cost per patient per year. Seventeen patients withdrew from the 4LB group and 23 from usual care.</P>
<P>Another RCT (200 participants) estimated shorter healing time with compression (P value 0.006, log rank test and P value 0.015 from adjusted Cox model) (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 2003</LINK>). Costs per leg healed were significantly lower for the compression group: median (interquartile range) cost (presume price year 1999-2000) EUR 209.7 (137.5 to 269.4) versus EUR 234.6 (168.2 to 345.1), P value 0.04. In addition, the compression group experienced statistically significant increases in some domains of health-related quality of life at six weeks relative to the usual care group, detected in both disease-specific (including global score) and generic instruments.</P>
<P>Findings from the three evaluations of the 4LB are difficult to interpret because some patients in the usual care group could have received compression, but full details (e.g. number of patients, type of compression) are not always documented. In addition, the bandage application is not the only systematic difference between the two groups; other aspects, such as the provision of specialist care to the compression groups could have influenced the outcomes.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summary of evidence for Review Question 1: Does the application of compression bandages or stockings aid venous ulcer healing?</HEADING>
<P>Overall, there is some evidence that venous ulcers heal more rapidly with compression than without. The overall risk of bias for all eight RCTs was either high or unclear. For the comparisons of compression with primary dressing alone and non-compressive bandages all the RCTs were small. The evidence for compression versus usual care (not routinely including compression) included two large trials (<LINK REF="STD-Morrell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Morrell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 2003</LINK>). Some of the observed benefits for patients receiving a specialised package of care that included application of the 4LB when compared with usual care could be explained by aspects other than compression, for example, a higher level of staff expertise resulting in better clinical management of leg ulceration overall. The evidence on relative costs of compression versus usual care was conflicting, with two trials suggesting that management with compression generated lower costs (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 2003</LINK>), and one indicating no significant difference between treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Morrell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Morrell 1998</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.1 Single-component compression bandage systems (seven RCTs)</HEADING>
<P>For the purposes of this review, it has been assumed that a single-component compression system consists of one type of compression bandage that may be used with, or without, a primary dressing. When used, primary dressings have been recorded, but are not considered as part of the compression system. Seven trials were identified overall. Two compared different single-component compression systems (<LINK REF="STD-Cordts-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cordts 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zuccarelli-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarelli 1997</LINK>), and five compared single-component systems with multi-component compression (<LINK REF="STD-Eriksson-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eriksson 1986</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Travers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Travers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colgan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Colgan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kralj-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kralj 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2007a</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1.1 Comparison between different single-component bandage systems (two RCTs)</HEADING>

This trial was small (30 participants analysed) and had an overall high risk of bias. No statistically significant between-group differences were found for complete healing at 12 weeks, RR 1.17 (95% CI 0.54 to 2.54) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>), and pain score (not plotted). Adverse events were reported in two patients receiving the elastic bandage and in three patients allocated the paste bandage, but none of these necessitated withdrawal from treatment. There were seven withdrawals in the elastic bandage group and six for the paste bandage.</P>
<P>In an RCT with unclear risk of bias, 48 participants were randomised to receive either an elastic bandage or a SSB for two months (<LINK REF="STD-Zuccarelli-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarelli 1997</LINK>).

In the single-component group, the elastic bandage was removed at night and reapplied in the morning by the patient.

Two patients receiving the single-component system withdrew, compared with three from the other group.</P>
<P>When a single-component system (elastic cohesive bandage) was compared with a three-component bandage (paste bandage, non-cohesive elastic bandage and elastic tubular overlay; 27 participants) there was no statistically significant difference detected at seven weeks for percentage change relative to baseline ulcer area (difference in means -7.0%, 95% CI -18.38 to 4.38, based on values read from graph) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Travers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Travers 1992</LINK>).

In terms of complete healing at 12 weeks, no significant difference was found between groups for the comparison between single-component compression and the 4LB, RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.27) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>), or for single-component versus modified Unna's boot, RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.08 to 1.05) (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>). There were no cases of ulcer recurrence during a six month follow-up period. Three participants withdrew from the single-component group, one from the Unna's boot group and none from the 4LB group. The average cost of the bandages per participant over 12 weeks in IEP (Irish pounds) (price year not stated) was: single-component IEP 58.33, Unna's boot IEP 66.24, and 4LB IEP 82.54.</P>
<P>A large trial (245 participants) with 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design evaluated pentoxifylline versus placebo, knitted viscose versus hydrocolloid dressings as well as single-component compression (hydrocolloid-lined elastic adhesive bandage) versus the 4LB (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2007a</LINK>). Initially analyses were conducted on all participants, i.e. those with both simple and non-simple venous ulceration (non-simple defined as serologically confirmed rheumatoid arthritis or venous pathology not confirmed with hand-held Doppler). The estimate for complete healing at 24 weeks suggested a statistically significant difference in favour of the 4LB over the single-component bandage: RR 0.74 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.92) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>). A Kaplan-Meier estimate of median days to healing showed faster wound closure for the 4LB group (78 versus 168 days, log rank test not reported) and a HR estimate from an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model was 2.0 (95% CI 1.4 to 2.9), P value &lt; 0.0005, indicating a greater probability of healing with the 4LB. The proportion of participants who changed bandage during the trial because of an adverse event was 28% for the single-component compression and 15% for the 4LB. Further analyses (complete healing, withdrawal rate and quality of life) were conducted on a subset of participants with simple venous ulceration (200 participants). The estimate for complete healing at 24 weeks was similar to that for the total study population: RR 0.70 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.89) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.3</LINK>). The proportion of participants who withdrew from the bandage system with or without simultaneous withdrawal from the randomised drug and dressing treatment was 20% for the single-component group and 5% for the 4LB. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Nottingham Health Profile and showed significantly greater improvements in some domains for the 4LB group at 24 weeks.</P>
<P>A small trial (40 participants) found similar rates of complete healing at six months with an inelastic bandage (used with a hydrocolloid primary dressing) and the 4LB (<LINK REF="STD-Kralj-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kralj 1996</LINK>): RR 1.14 (95% CI 0.51 to 2.55), P value 0.74 (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>).

Both had unclear risk of bias. When data were pooled for complete healing at three to six months (95 participants), there was no statistically significant difference between groups: RR 1.23 (95% CI 0.67 to 2.25), P value 0.51 (test for heterogeneity P value 0.47, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2.2 Two-component bandage systems compared with the 4LB (four RCTs)</HEADING>
<P>Four RCTs compared two-component compression (consisting of a padding or cushioning layer followed by an elastic bandage) with the 4LB (<LINK REF="STD-Moffatt-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Moffatt 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Harley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moffatt-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moffatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szewczyk-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Szewczyk 2010</LINK>). One RCT was at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Moffatt-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Moffatt 2003a</LINK>), and the other three were unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Harley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Harley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moffatt-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moffatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szewczyk-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Szewczyk 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>One cross-over RCT (81 participants) of eight weeks' duration stipulated the primary outcome for the trial as degree of bandage slippage (<LINK REF="STD-Moffatt-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Moffatt 2008</LINK>). Complete healing was assessed at four weeks, just prior to the cross-over, and there were no statistically significant difference between groups: RR 2.15 (95% CI 0.58 to 8.03) (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>). In terms of adverse events assessed over the whole 8-week trial period, 68 occurred whilst using the two-component system and 67 with the 4LB. Prior to cross-over, two participants withdrew from the group receiving two-component compression (both due to adverse events) and one withdrew from the group allocated the 4LB (participant request). Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Cardiff Wound Impact Schedule. During the first four weeks, no significant between-groups differences were detected for overall health-related quality of life. However, significant differences were observed in favour of the two-component system for one domain, i.e. physical symptoms and daily living, (P value &lt; 0.05, based on per protocol analysis by trial authors).</P>
<P>The second and largest of these trials (112 participants) reported a statistically significant difference in favour of the 4LB for complete healing at six months when participants were analysed up to end of the randomised treatment: RR 0.56 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.77), P value 0.0003 (<LINK REF="CMP-008.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.3</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Moffatt-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Moffatt 2003a</LINK>). This analysis was repeated, this time including participants who had healed following withdrawal from the randomised treatment, some of whom switched bandage systems; the between group difference was not statistically significant: RR 0.88 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.05) (<LINK REF="CMP-008.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.4</LINK>). The adjusted HR was 1.18 (95% CI 0.69 to 2.02), P value 0.55. In the group receiving the two-component system, 19 participants reported 21 bandage-related adverse events compared with seven participants with eight events in the 4LB group. Withdrawal rates were 54% for the two-component system and 12% for 4LB. The mean weekly cost of treatment per participant (clinic costs and home care costs) was lower in the 4LB group (GBP 79.91 versus GBP 83.56) and the same trend was observed for mean cost per participant over the six-month trial (GBP 876 versus GBP 916) (price year 2000). Assessment of health-related quality of life using SF-36 data at 24 weeks and at healing/withdrawal adjusted for baseline score suggested no significant differences between groups.</P>
<P>The third trial recruited 30 participants and reported a shorter average time on treatment for the group receiving the two-component compression (63 versus 87 days, difference described as not statistically significant but no P value or confidence interval presented) (<LINK REF="STD-Harley-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Harley 2004</LINK>). The methods used for estimating the time on treatment were not explained, and it was not clear whether mean or median values were reported. A chi-squared analysis of quintiles of healing times suggested no statistically significant association between treatment group and healing duration (P value 0.7), but this is not surprising given the very small numbers of participants in each time interval category per treatment group (maximum of five participants). In relation to adverse events, outcomes were better for participants treated with the 4LB for: the number of participants reporting at least one adverse event (63% versus 100%); average number of adverse events per participant (1.64 versus 0.75); and average number of incidents of inappropriate pressure (2.31 versus 5.43) (all differences were described as significant but P values and confidence intervals were not provided). Withdrawal rates favoured the 4LB (6% versus 43%, P value 0.018); reasons for withdrawal were not provided. The estimated costs of six week's treatment excluding dressings was AUD 35.00 for the two-component system and AUD 114.00 for the 4LB (price year appeared to be 1999 to 2000). The trial follow-up period was unclear (possibly three months).</P>
<P>The fourth trial (31 participants) compared a compression stocking with a two-component bandage system and the 4LB (<LINK REF="STD-Szewczyk-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Szewczyk 2010</LINK>); comparisons between the two types of bandage and the stocking are considered later (Section 2.6.3). No statistically significant differences were detected between groups at three months for mean percentage reduction in ulcer area (98% for the group receiving the two-component bandage system versus 94% for the 4LB) or mean healing rate (0.55 and 0.63 cm<SUP>2</SUP> per week respectively).

<P>Four of the five RCTs with available IPD were classified as being at overall high risk of bias because of non-blinded outcome assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Scriven-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Scriven 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ukat-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ukat 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 2004</LINK>). The remaining RCT was deemed to be at low risk of bias, confirming healing from photographs at the trial office by an investigator blinded to treatment allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>). Checks on the IPD for each RCT suggested that baseline comparability was generally satisfactory and that data were mostly complete, free of duplication, consistent and feasible. The small number of queries raised were resolved through discussion with the relevant trialist.</P>
<P>The results of model-checking procedures indicated that the proportional hazards assumption was upheld for all potentially predictive covariates. The only continuous covariate included in the final models (baseline ulcer surface area) was entered as a natural log transformation. Outcomes were similar for early and late accruals when we took into account differences between study centres in four trials assessed (<LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ukat-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ukat 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 2004</LINK>). To assess the adequacy of model fit, we assessed the number of events (an event being a healed wound) against the number of covariates entered at the start of each model. At least 10 events per variable are required in logistic regression to reduce bias in regression coefficients (<LINK REF="REF-Peduzzi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peduzzi 1996</LINK>). All models generated from the meta-analysis data set met this recommendation.</P>

<I>Primary outcomes: findings from preliminary analyses of IPD</I>
</P>
<P>When data were pooled for the outcome of complete healing (unadjusted) during the trial period (797 participants from five RCTs), no significant difference between treatment groups was observed: fixed-effect RR 0.96 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.05), P value 0.34 (chi-squared test for heterogeneity P value 0.54, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>). For the trial without available IPD, complete healing at three months was similar for the 4LB and the SSB (NB unit of analysis was limbs, not participants): RR 1.10 (95% CI 0.57 to 2.11), P value 0.77 (<LINK REF="CMP-012.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duby-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Duby 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The median time to healing (based on IPD) estimated from unstratified Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (797 participants) was 90 days (95% CI 79 to 101) for the 4LB and 99 days (95% CI 82 to 116) for the SSB, P value 0.133 for logrank test for difference between survival curves (<LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>).</P>
<P>An initial Cox proportional hazards model was generated from the IPD with time to healing (days) as the dependent variable, healing as the event, study centres as strata, and bandage type as the only covariate. The result of this unadjusted analysis indicated no significant difference between bandage types: HR 1.15 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.37), P value 0.11.</P>
<P>
<I>Primary outcomes: findings from main analyses of IPD</I>
</P>
<P>The final Cox model contained type of bandage, ulcer duration,and ulcer area (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). The HR for bandage type was 1.31 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.58), P value 0.005, indicating that the estimated probability of healing with the 4LB was around 1.3 times that of healing with the SSB, assuming similar values for other covariates. There was significant evidence that larger ulcers (P value &lt; 0.001) and ulcers of longer duration (P value &lt; 0.001) predicted longer time to healing independently of one another and of treatment. The chance of healing was reduced by a factor of 0.44 for each 10-fold increase in area. Baseline ulcer duration was divided into the following four categories: a month or less; more than one month up to and including six months; more than six months up to and including 12 months; and over 12 months. The data suggested that the hazard of healing was reduced for each step up to a longer duration interval. We found no significant interactions between bandage and baseline ulcer area, and bandage and baseline ulcer duration.<BR/>

<LINK REF="CMP-012.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.3</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK> illustrate the relative contribution of each RCT to the meta-analysis, showing HR estimates for each trial individually and for all trials when pooled. The estimates were derived from the IPD and were adjusted for baseline ulcer area and baseline ulcer duration. The pooled HR estimate was very close to that derived from the Cox regression: fixed-effect HR 1.32 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.60) P value 0.004. Some heterogeneity between trials was detected: chi-squared P value 0.11, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 48%. When the analysis was repeated using a random-effects model no statistically significant difference was detected between bandages: HR 1.30 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.80) P value 0.11 (<LINK REF="CMP-012.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.4</LINK>). Visual inspection of the forest plot suggested that one trial was likely to be the source of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2001</LINK>). When this trial was removed, a sensitivity analysis showed the heterogeneity was eliminated and the observed treated effect was in favour of the 4LB in both fixed-effect (<LINK REF="CMP-012.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.5</LINK>) and random-effects models (<LINK REF="CMP-012.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.6</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Cox proportional hazards model was re-run on a subset of four trials (747 participants) for which additional covariates were available: primary or recurrent ulceration and participants' mobility (<LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ukat-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ukat 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 2004</LINK>). The final model contained bandage type, ulcer area, ulcer duration and primary or recurrent ulceration. The estimated HR for type of bandage was similar to the model based on five trials: 1.29 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.57), P value 0.011. The model suggested that larger ulcers (P value &lt; 0.001), ulcers of longer duration (P value &lt; 0.001) and previous ulceration (P value &lt; 0.005) were independent predictors of longer time to healing (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). No significant interaction was found between: bandage and baseline ulcer area; bandage and baseline ulcer duration; and bandage and primary or recurrent ulceration.</P>
<P>
<I>Secondary outcomes: findings from IPD - adverse events and recurrence </I>
</P>
<P>IPD for adverse events were retrieved for two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 2004</LINK>).  For incidence of any type of adverse event, the pooled OR (fixed-effect) was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.81 to 1.62), P value 0.43, providing no evidence of a difference between bandage types (<LINK REF="CMP-012.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.7</LINK>). Some heterogeneity was detected (chi-squared test P value 0.24, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 28%) and so the analysis was repeated using a random-effects model which showed a similar estimate: OR 1.11 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.72), P value 0.64 (<LINK REF="CMP-012.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.8</LINK>).</P>
<P>The two trials differed in their definitions of bandage-related adverse events.  In one, maceration, allergic reaction, eczema of peri-ulcer skin and infection were coded as bandage-related (<LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>).  The second trial, comparing primary dressings as well as bandages, attributed these events to dressings (<LINK REF="STD-Franks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 2004</LINK>).  In view of this difference, data were not pooled.  ORs were estimated for each trial individually and neither demonstrated a statistically significant between-group difference: 1.41 (95% CI: 0.94 to 2.11) (<LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>), and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.30 to 2.04) (<LINK REF="STD-Franks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 2004</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-012.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.9</LINK>).</P>
<P>Analysis of the number of all types of adverse events per participant did not show a difference between the two bandage systems: pooled difference in means (fixed-effect) -0.10 (95% CI &#8722;0.32 to 0.12), P value 0.38 (<LINK REF="CMP-012.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.10</LINK>). Since some heterogeneity was detected (chi-squared test P value 0.12, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 58%) the meta-analysis was repeated using a random-effects model which generated a similar estimate: difference in means -0.21 (95% CI -0.68 to 0.27), P value 0.39 (<LINK REF="CMP-012.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.11</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Data were not pooled for the number of adverse events related to bandaging for the reasons mentioned above. No significant differences were detected between groups for the trials individually: difference in means -0.45 (95% CI -1.01 to 0.11) (<LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>), and 0.04 (-0.09 to 0.17) (<LINK REF="STD-Franks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 2004</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-012.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.12</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data on time to recurrence were provided for one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>); the trial authors had previously published a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for recurrence. No statistically significant difference was detected between the survival curves for time to recurrence for 4LB and SSB (27 versus 29 recurrences respectively, log rank test P value 0.22).  No further analyses were performed by the original investigators due to the low event rate precluding exploration of the impact of covariates.  Since the meta-analysis data set did not contain any additional information on time to recurrence relative to this trial&#8217;s findings, no further analyses were undertaken.</P>
<P>
<I>Secondary outcomes: findings from aggregate data - health-related quality of life, costs and withdrawals</I>
</P>
<P>Two trials included an assessment of quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Franks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>). One used the Nottingham Health Profile and observed no statistically significant differences between treatment groups for scores for any domain at six months (<LINK REF="STD-Franks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 2004</LINK>). The other trial had a large amount of missing data for this outcome and so reported a descriptive analysis of findings obtained using the SF-12 and the Hyland Leg and Foot Ulcer Questionnaire (<LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>). Overall, there did not appear to be marked differences between treatment groups.</P>
<P>Three trials included an analysis of costs (<LINK REF="STD-Scriven-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Scriven 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ukat-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ukat 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>), but only one reported a rigorously conducted cost-effectiveness analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>). Cost estimates were based on NHS and Personal Social Services costs and health benefits were measured as differences in ulcer-free days and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The following estimates were reported, all in favour of the 4LB: mean between-group difference in healing time 10.9 days (95% CI -6.8 to 29.1); difference in mean in QALYs -0.02 (95% CI -0.08 to 0.04); and difference in mean in total cost (price year 2001): GBP 227.32 (95% CI 16.53 to 448.30) per patient per year. Sensitivity analyses showed the cost-effectiveness estimate to be robust to variation in the number of bandages used and unit costs of compression systems. The 4LB emerged as the dominant treatment strategy. The second trial calculated the cost per patient and cost per ulcer healed, based on costs of bandages and other disposables (e.g. primary dressings, wadding) and 30 minutes of nursing time per bandage change (<LINK REF="STD-Ukat-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ukat 2003</LINK>). Costs per patient were EUR 587 for the 4LB and EUR 1345 for the SSB; and per ulcer healed EUR 1845 and EUR 5502 respectively. Statistical tests for between group differences and price year were not reported. The third trial estimated the cost of treatment over six months as GBP 392.60 for the 4LB and GBP 184.56 for the SSB (estimates based on cost of bandage systems only, price year not stated) (<LINK REF="STD-Scriven-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Scriven 1998</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summary of evidence from Section 2.4.2: Comparison between the 4LB and multi-component systems that include an inelastic bandage (the SSB)</HEADING>
<P>Analysis of IPD from five trials indicated that the estimated probability of healing with the 4LB was around 1.3 times that of healing with the SSB (statistically significant difference). One trial included a rigorous cost-effectiveness analysis that indicated that the 4LB was the dominant (more cost-effective) treatment strategy (<LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>). The adverse event profile, recurrence rates and changes in health-related quality of life scores were similar for the two bandage types. Withdrawal rates were approximately similar between groups. Risk of bias was high in four RCTs because of non-blinded outcome assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Scriven-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Scriven 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ukat-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ukat 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 2004</LINK>); the other RCT had low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>). One RCT recruited groups which may not have been comparable at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Scriven-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Scriven 1998</LINK>); the Cox regression performed on the IPD took account of between-group differences in prognosis.</P>

In all studies, the 4LB consisted of orthopaedic wool, a crepe bandage, an elastic bandage and an elastic cohesive bandage as the final retaining component.

The paste-bandage system (sometimes referred to as Unna's Boot) varied between trials, consisting of: paste bandage applied over a foam primary dressing with no other compression components (<LINK REF="STD-Knight-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Knight 1996</LINK>); a two-component system with an elastic cohesive bandage applied after the paste bandage (<LINK REF="STD-Polignano-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Polignano 2004a</LINK>); three-component systems comprising either a paste, a crepe, and an elastic tubular bandage (<LINK REF="STD-Duby-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Duby 1993</LINK>), or a paste, an elastic, and an elastic tubular bandage (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>); and finally, a four-component system consisting of a paste, a crepe and an elastic-cohesive bandage and a class II compression sock (<LINK REF="STD-Colgan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Colgan 1995</LINK>).</P>

<B>2.5.1 Adjustable compression boots compared with paste bandages</B>
</P>
<P>The first trial (38 participants) evaluated an adjustable compression boot consisting of a series of interlocking, non-elastic bands that encircled the leg, held in place by hook and loop fasteners, together with a foot-piece made of very low stretch bands (<LINK REF="STD-DePalma-1999" TYPE="STUDY">DePalma 1999</LINK>). Participants were instructed to adjust the straps in order to maintain compression. This was compared with a paste-bandage system. Three different estimates of healing rate were reported: mean area healed (cm<SUP>2</SUP>) per day; mean area healed (%) per day; and the linear healing rate of the wound edge towards the wound centre (mean cm per day). No statistically significant differences were observed for any of these outcomes (<LINK REF="CMP-014.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.1</LINK>). The mean total cost per patient completing the trial based on costs of clinician time and materials suggested a lower cost for patients receiving the adjustable compression boot: USD 559.41 versus USD 901.73, P value 0.05 (price year not stated). Two participants withdrew from the group receiving the adjustable boot, and five withdrew from the paste bandage group.</P>

<P>The second study entailed within-individual randomisation whereby 12 participants with bilateral venous leg ulcers were recruited (<LINK REF="STD-Blecken-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Blecken 2005</LINK>). One limb per participant was randomised to receive the adjustable compression boot, similar to the device used in the above study, except that the adjustable bands were made of Velcro. Application of the boot was preceded by a paraffin-impregnated gauze primary dressing, sterile absorbent gauze, and a felt pad cushion, all retained with a cotton stockinette. An elastic anklet was applied over the boot. The second limb was allocated a four-component compression system; this differed from the traditional 4LB, consisting of paraffin-impregnated gauze primary dressing, sterile absorbent gauze, felt pad, gauze bandage and elastic bandage. At 12 weeks, four limbs out of 12 healed in each group, these limbs belonging to the same participants in each group. There were no withdrawals.</P>

<P>Compression stockings are usually garments which are fashioned to the shape of the lower leg, with open or closed, tailored toes and heels. Different sizes are available to correspond to varying limb sizes. They are designed to provide graduated compression, with higher pressures exerted at the ankle, diminishing up to the top of the calf. Tubular compression devices are usually available as lengths of close weave stretch cotton, open at the toe and sometimes also at the heel; they can provide either uniform or graduated compression, depending on device specifications. Again, different sizes are available to fit different size limbs.</P>
<P>Compression stockings were compared with paste bandages (<LINK REF="STD-Hendricks-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hendricks 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koksal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koksal 2003</LINK>), the SSB (<LINK REF="STD-J_x00fc_nger-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Jünger 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polignano-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Polignano 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mariani-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mariani 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taradaj-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Taradaj 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brizzio-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Brizzio 2010</LINK>), a two-component bandage system (<LINK REF="STD-Szewczyk-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Szewczyk 2010</LINK>), and the 4LB (<LINK REF="STD-Szewczyk-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Szewczyk 2010</LINK>).

In the <LINK REF="STD-Hendricks-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hendricks 1985</LINK> trial (21 participants), the device was designed to provide graduated compression from 24 mm Hg at the ankle to 16 mm Hg at the calf. In the <LINK REF="STD-Koksal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Koksal 2003</LINK> trial (60 participants), the stocking was designed to provide 30 to 40 mm Hg compression.</P>

The estimated cumulative proportions healed at 18 months were 73% for participants randomised to the stocking and 90% for those allocated to the paste-bandage system. The estimates for median time to healing were 18 weeks versus seven weeks respectively (P value 0.39, log rank test).

Median days to healing were similar in both groups (56 days for the group receiving stockings and 60 days for SSB). Analyses of quality of life scores (using the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Quality of Life questionnaire) did not detect any statistically significant between group differences at 35 days, or at final assessment in participants with healed ulcers. Four participants withdrew from the group allocated the stocking (one death, one did not attend clinic and two had systemic infections), whilst one withdrew from the group allocated SSB because his/her condition deteriorated rapidly.</P>

<P>Data from all four trials (317 participants) were pooled using a fixed-effect model and showed that significantly more participants achieved complete healing with stockings at two to four months than with the SSB: RR 1.62 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.10), P value 0.0002 (test for heterogeneity P value 0.06, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 60%) (<LINK REF="CMP-017.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 17.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-J_x00fc_nger-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Jünger 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polignano-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Polignano 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mariani-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mariani 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taradaj-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Taradaj 2009</LINK>).

The same trial reported no significant difference between groups for median (range) days to healing: 47 (10 to 83) for stockings versus 52 (6 to 80) for SSB (P value 0.82, Mann-Whitney U-test). The other two trials reported the less useful mean time to healing: 72 days for stockings versus 101 days for SSB (P value 0.027, log rank test) (<LINK REF="STD-Polignano-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Polignano 2004b</LINK>), and 56 versus 61 days respectively (P value 0.52) (<LINK REF="STD-Mariani-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mariani 2008</LINK>).</P>

In <LINK REF="STD-Polignano-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Polignano 2004b</LINK>, both decrease in ulcer pain during the trial and comfort while wearing compression were significantly better for the group receiving stockings (P value 0.017 and P value 0.038, respectively). A higher withdrawal rate was noted in the SSB group in this trial (38% versus 15%). Of five participants withdrawing from the SSB group, one was considered to be related to compression (bullous dermatitis); there were no reported withdrawals due to adverse events in the group receiving stockings. The <LINK REF="STD-J_x00fc_nger-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Jünger 2004b</LINK> trial reported 29 adverse events (two serious) in 20 of the 65 (31%) participants receiving stockings and 42 adverse events (four serious) in 26 of the 67 (39%) participants receiving the SSB. Withdrawal rates were similar between groups. This trial also estimated cost of procedures including labour and associated resources. The estimated mean cost per percentage reduction in wound area (price year 2003) was EUR 2.57 for the group receiving stockings and EUR 4.58 for the SSB group. The <LINK REF="STD-Mariani-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mariani 2008</LINK> trial reported significantly worse performance for the SSB for inhibition of activities (P value 0.025), pain at donning and removal of device (P value 0.001), and number of problems reported in terms of pain, discomfort and hindrance of activities (P value &lt; 0.0001). No significant differences, however, were detected between groups for daytime pain and discomfort.

Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested a median estimate of 42 days to healing in both groups and found no significant difference in probability of healing derived from survival curves (P value 0.41). In terms of adverse events, 14% of participants receiving tubular compression complained of pain or tightness during treatment which was resolved in all cases by using a larger-sized device; the participants receiving the SSB did not experience such problems, and no other adverse events were reported.

The first trial compared two four-component systems consisting of gauze bandage, crepe bandage, a graduated tubular device and an elastic bandage versus gauze bandage, crepe bandage and two elastic bandages (<LINK REF="STD-Milic-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Milic 2007</LINK>). The second trial included three arms and compared: gauze bandage, crepe bandage and a tubular device; gauze bandage, crepe bandage, a tubular device and an elastic bandage; gauze bandage, crepe bandage, a tubular device and two elastic bandages (<LINK REF="STD-Milic-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Milic 2010</LINK>). In both trials, the tubular devices provided an ankle pressure of 30 to 40 mmHg; all participants wore compression day and night and received mechanical debridement using sterile gauze, a dry dressing for non-exuding wounds and application of boric acid in cases of exudation. At first scrutiny the participant populations from these two RCTs appear very similar; the trial authors confirmed that the two RCTs are entirely separate (personal communication).</P>
<P>In the first trial (150 participants) the cumulative proportions of participants healed at 16 months were 93% for tubular compression and 51% for the system including two elastic bandages (P value &lt; 0.01) (<LINK REF="STD-Milic-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Milic 2007</LINK>). This trial also reported shorter median days to healing for the group receiving tubular compression: 133 (range 28 to 464) versus 211 (range 61 to 438) , P value not reported. There were significantly lower recurrence rates at one year for the group receiving tubular compression (24% versus 53%, P value &lt; 0.05). Amongst the participants who received tubular compression, 17% experienced skin excoriation of the ankle or leg and 47% experienced pressure or pain caused by slippage of the device; details of adverse events were not provided for the group that received compression bandages. There were fewer withdrawals in the tubular system group (4% versus 12%), with the majority of withdrawals (8/9 participants) from the bandage group being due to participants requesting change to the alternative treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Milic-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Milic 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the second trial (131 participants) that evaluated the effects of adding elastic bandages to a base system of gauze bandage, crepe bandage and tubular compression (<LINK REF="STD-Milic-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Milic 2010</LINK>), the number of participants experiencing complete healing at six months was significantly greater for the addition of both one and two elastic bandages. The respective RR estimates were 0.46 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.75), P value 0.002 (88 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-021.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 21.1</LINK>), and 0.42 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.68), P value 0.0004 (85 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-022.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.1</LINK>). No significant difference, however, was detected between the addition of one versus two elastic bandages: RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.18), P value 0.47 (89 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-023.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 23.1</LINK>). Median weeks to healing were similar in all three groups: 12 weeks (range 5 to 24) in the group receiving the base system; 11 weeks (range 3 to 25) with one elastic bandage added; and 14 weeks (5 to 24) for two additional elastic bandages. The trial authors reported that estimates from adjusted Cox regression indicated significantly higher probability of healing among participants receiving two added elastic bandages when compared with the other two groups (P value &lt; 0.001 versus the base system, and P value 0.017 versus one elastic bandage).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-20 12:10:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence suggests that venous ulcers heal more rapidly with compression than without, and that multi-component bandage systems achieve better healing outcomes than single-component bandages. When competing systems comprising two-component bandages were compared, there was some evidence to suggest that those that included an elastic component might be more effective; a similar finding was noted for alternative three-component bandage systems. No differences were observed in terms of healing between a two-component bandage system and the 4LB, nor between different variations of the original 4LB. Estimates from survival analyses of IPD indicated faster healing for the 4LB compared with the SSB. No differences were observed between the 4LB and paste-bandage systems, but interpretation could have been hampered by differential performance of variants of the paste bandages. There was no difference in healing outcomes between the adjustable compression boot and compression bandages, nor between a single-layer stocking and a paste-bandage system, however, overall the evidence was not of high quality and had low statistical power for detection of clinically important differences. When high-compression stocking systems were compared with the SSB, healing outcomes were in favour of the stockings, but there was no difference seen between low compression stockings and the SSB. One small trial compared stockings with two-component bandages and the 4LB and found no between-group differences between stockings and bandages. A large ongoing trial comparing compression stockings with the 4LB will inform this comparison further (<LINK REF="STD-Dumville-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dumville 2009</LINK>). Less pain was observed for all types of stockings when compared with bandages. There was no difference between tubular compression and the SSB for healing. Better healing outcomes were achieved when elastic bandages were added to tubular compression. In terms of cost-effectiveness, most evaluations were of costs only. One trial conducted a rigorous cost-effectiveness analysis in which the 4LB emerged as the dominant treatment strategy when compared with the SSB.</P>
<P>There was limited evidence on ulcer recurrence, with three trials reporting this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Colgan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Colgan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morrell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Morrell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milic-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Milic 2007</LINK>). One reported no cases of recurrent ulceration in participants receiving single-component elastic compression, the 4LB or four-component compression comprising a paste bandage when rates were assessed during a six-month follow-up period following 12 weeks of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Colgan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Colgan 1995</LINK>). Another trial that compared application of the 4LB in the context of a specialist clinic with usual care by the district nurse did not detect a statistically significant difference between groups for recurrence rates, or time to recurrence, during the one-year trial period (<LINK REF="STD-Morrell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Morrell 1998</LINK>). In an evaluation of tubular compression versus compression bandages, significantly lower recurrence rates were detected in the group receiving tubular compression at one year (<LINK REF="STD-Milic-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Milic 2007</LINK>). It is likely that the majority of included trials lacked the statistical power and duration of follow-up required to detect meaningful recurrence rates following treatment with compression therapy.</P>
<P>This review has attempted to take account of recent recommendations concerning the classification and description of different systems of compression (<LINK REF="REF-Partsch-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partsch 2008b</LINK>). This update refers to the numbers of components in compression systems rather than the number of layers, as it has been argued that the number of components is more meaningful.</P>

<P>The study selection criteria stipulated that the bandages being studied should be the only systematic difference between treatment groups. In practice, this criterion has been difficult to apply without excluding many trials of important types of compression therapy from the review. One example of this is where a specialised package of care incorporating multi-component compression is compared with usual care that does not routinely include compression (<LINK REF="STD-Charles-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Charles 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morrell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Morrell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 2003</LINK>). In these trials, application of the bandage is not the only difference between treatment arms since the characteristics of care providers vary between groups with compression in one arm being provided by staff with specialist training and experience who could advise patients more generally about the management of their venous leg ulcer, for example, regarding limb elevation and mobility. The evaluations of paste bandages and Unna's boot also introduce an additional, non-bandage difference between groups (for example <LINK REF="STD-Duby-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Duby 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Colgan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Colgan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knight-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Knight 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polignano-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Polignano 2004a</LINK>). These devices normally provide a primary wound contact layer as well as compression bandaging. The alternative study arm is likely to receive a different type of primary dressing (e.g. foam dressing or hydrocolloid) prior to application of bandages or stockings. Factors such as additional aspects of care used together with compression, or different primary dressings between treatment arms may obscure the treatment effect due to the compression, and so hinder the interpretation of findings.</P>
<P>In many of the included trials, the observed treatment effect may have been influenced further by imbalance of treatment groups at baseline with respect to independent prognostic factors. The literature on healing prognosis has shown consistentIy that baseline ulcer area and ulcer duration are significant independent predictors of delayed healing (<LINK REF="REF-Skene-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skene 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Franks-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franks 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Margolis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margolis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Margolis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Margolis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2004</LINK>). Some of the more recent trials addressed this by using stratified randomisation and undertaking analyses that adjusted for covariates, such as Cox proportional hazards models (for example <LINK REF="STD-Franks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brizzio-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Brizzio 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milic-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Milic 2010</LINK>), or logistic regression (<LINK REF="STD-Brizzio-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Brizzio 2010</LINK>). When such methods are not used, and particularly when trials are small in size, the estimated treatment effect may be prone to bias because of chance differences in the baseline prognostic profiles of treatment groups.</P>
<P>Several trial reports stated that venous leg ulcers above certain dimensions would not be eligible for inclusion, for example, maximum eligible baseline ulcer surface area 15 cm<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="STD-Szewczyk-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Szewczyk 2010</LINK>), and 50 cm<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="STD-Cordts-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cordts 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brizzio-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Brizzio 2010</LINK>). Six RCTs with this type of restriction reported comparisons involving compression stockings or tubular devices (<LINK REF="STD-J_x00fc_nger-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Jünger 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00fc_nger-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Jünger 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polignano-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Polignano 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mariani-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mariani 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brizzio-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Brizzio 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szewczyk-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Szewczyk 2010</LINK>); other comparisons were alternative single-component bandages (<LINK REF="STD-Cordts-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cordts 1992</LINK>), and three-component bandage systems (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2002</LINK>), also paste bandages compared with an adjustable compression boot (<LINK REF="STD-DePalma-1999" TYPE="STUDY">DePalma 1999</LINK>) and the four-layer bandage (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2003</LINK>). Patients with much larger wounds may present in clinical practice and so some findings may have limited external validity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of bandage application</HEADING>
<P>It has been suggested that the clinical effect of compression is partly dependent on the skill of the bandager in achieving the correct amount of sub-bandage pressure and a pressure graduated from toe to knee (<LINK REF="REF-Feben-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feben 2003</LINK>). Findings from an online survey of 304 clinicians in the UK, USA and Germany suggested that challenges in the use of compression included difficulty in obtaining precise pressures; also, the need for training in application of compression bandages was highlighted. The survey authors also observed variation in the use of different types of compression systems across the countries studied (<LINK REF="REF-Cullen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullen 2009</LINK>). It is possible that the performance of certain compression systems may be enhanced because of greater staff familiarity and experience in that setting. The differential effects of 4LB and SSB seen in the IPD meta-analysis could be partly explained by skill and experience of bandagers; three out of the five included trials (representing 75% of included participants) were based in the UK, where the 4LB is standard (<LINK REF="STD-Scriven-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Scriven 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>), whilst the others were based in continental Europe, where the SSB is standard treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ukat-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ukat 2003</LINK>). Information regarding bandager skill was not collected during these trials, and so the effect of this variable could not be investigated further. As far as we could ascertain, the methods used for application of both types of bandage were in line with manufacturers&#8217; recommendations, relevant clinical guidelines, and expert guidance. It would be useful if future trials could collect data on staff skills at baseline, and this information could be included as a covariate in the modelling of treatment effect.</P>
<P>It is also difficult to estimate what influence staff skills may have had on the observed estimates of treatment effect for other comparisons in this review . Some trials indicate a possible move towards compression systems that are less dependent on practitioner skill, where patients and their relatives may contribute more to application of devices, namely compression stockings (<LINK REF="STD-Hendricks-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Hendricks 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00fc_nger-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Jünger 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polignano-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Polignano 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mariani-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mariani 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>A related aspect which may influence the effectiveness of treatment is patient concordance with compression regimens. A mixed methods study combining semi-structured interviews with clinicians with an online survey found that patient concordance with compression is a major concern amongst care providers (<LINK REF="REF-Cullen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullen 2009</LINK>). A literature review of studies evaluating patient concordance with compression therapy for ulcer healing reported rates of non-concordance from observational studies in the range of 10% to 80% and also suggested that healing was delayed in patients defined as having lower levels of concordance. It should be noted that these findings were based on a small number of studies of uncertain methodological quality (<LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 2009</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-08-10 13:42:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of evidence in this field is variable. All RCTs except one were classified as being at high or unclear overall risk of bias. A general observation is that quality appears to be improving over time, with trials published within the last ten years more likely to have taken important steps to reduce bias in estimates of treatment effect by using proper methods of randomisation (i.e. unpredictable allocation to treatment groups), allocation concealment, blinded outcome assessment and performing analysis by intention to treat. More recent trials are more likely to be larger and to have been based on prior estimation of the required sample size to detect a defined difference in outcome between groups. Interpretation of older trials is often difficult because of small sample sizes and problems with methodological quality. Furthermore small trials are more likely to result in chance estimates of treatment effect because of imbalances between treatment groups for prognostic factors such as ulcer surface area or duration. The possible impact of such baseline imbalances is usually difficult to interpret post hoc, and ideally would be adjusted for in the primary analysis (an approach more commonly taken in more recent, high-quality studies). Shortcomings in the statistical analysis of trial data were frequently encountered. Some studies report the mean (rather than median) time to healing which could result in biased estimates as such analysis is based on all participants having healed and/or the survival curve having an assumed shape (the shape is not assumed in non-parametric survival analysis). For continuous outcomes such as healing rate and change in ulcer area, data are likely to be skewed but transformation is usually not mentioned. Again, this could have influenced the derived estimates of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 2000</LINK>). More recent trials include survival analyses for time to healing (for example <LINK REF="STD-Scriven-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Scriven 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Franks-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Franks 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iglesias-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Iglesias 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00fc_nger-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Jünger 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00fc_nger-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Jünger 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brizzio-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Brizzio 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milic-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Milic 2010</LINK>), and this provides a more meaningful estimate of treatment effect, particularly if HR estimates are provided, adjusted for prognostic factors. All future trials should incorporate such analyses.</P>
<P>Frequently interventions are not described comprehensively in trial reports, so it can be difficult to judge the degree of compression being applied, and impossible for readers to apply the evidence directly. A typical example of this is the term "Unna's boot" which is used to characterise the compression system, but is often not described further. It is clear from studying the trials included in this review that the definition of Unna's boot varies, and there does not appear to be an agreed definition in the literature. The basis for this type of compression is a paste-impregnated bandage (usually zinc oxide and calamine) (<LINK REF="STD-Kikta-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kikta 1988</LINK>), and in some cases this is the sole component. However, the paste bandage can also be applied as part of a multi-component system comprising two, three or four components, all of which could perform differently. Trial reports should include details of the number and type of components, the materials used, the dimensions of bandages and the technique of application (e.g. spiral, figure-of-eight), as recommended by an expert consensus group (<LINK REF="REF-Rabe-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>Although the search strategy was comprehensive, it is possible that eligible unpublished trials could remain unidentified. One unpublished trial of compression came to light during a wound management conference (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2007b</LINK>). Communication with the trial authors confirmed that: the trial was small (40 participants), compared the 4LB with SSB, and had terminated prematurely (personal communication, Professor Charles McCollum). Since no baseline or outcome data were available, it is not possible to judge the potential effect of including this trial in the review. Other eligible unpublished evaluations may exist that have not been identified by the review process. Therefore, the effect of publication bias on this review should not be discounted.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-08-20 12:10:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review includes new evidence concerning competing multi-component bandage systems (two-component bandage versus the 4LB) as well as comparisons between compression bandages and stockings. In addition, a rigorously conducted and informative IPD meta-analysis of the comparison between four-layer and SSBs has been incorporated into the review. The findings of the previous version of this review are largely upheld, and this update provides some additional evidence to indicate that multi-component systems that include an elastic bandage are more effective in terms of wound healing compared with multi-component systems with inelastic constituents. This finding conflicts with some aspects of consensus-based recommendations of compression classification, where it was suggested that multi-component systems that include elastic constituents will perform similarly to inelastic systems overall because of friction between different elements (<LINK REF="REF-Partsch-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partsch 2008b</LINK>). The findings of this review suggest that compression stockings may perform better than the SSB in terms of wound healing; however, data are still lacking on the important comparison of compression stockings versus the 4LB. A large RCT addressing this comparison is ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-Dumville-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dumville 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Updates of this review, in contrast with the parent review, have included only those trials where treatment allocation was described as random. Consequently two studies that were included in the original version of the review are now excluded. The comparisons involved were: compression (Unna's Boot) versus no compression (dressing alone) (<LINK REF="STD-Sikes-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Sikes 1985</LINK>); and compression stockings versus SSB (<LINK REF="STD-Horakova-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Horakova 1994</LINK>). A third trial that evaluated two different three-component systems was excluded because we became aware that participants in one treatment arm also received steroids (<LINK REF="STD-Northeast-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Northeast 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>We identified two other systematic reviews of compression therapy for venous leg ulceration (<LINK REF="REF-Palfreyman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palfreyman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Amsler-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amsler 2009</LINK>). The study selection criteria of the Palfreyman review differed from this review in that quasi-randomised studies, evaluations of intermittent pneumatic compression and those with recurrence as the primary outcome were included, whereas studies where venous disease was not confirmed by vascular assessment were excluded. In addition, the literature search was restricted to English language articles. This resulted in eight trials being identified as eligible for inclusion and these were sub-grouped for meta-analysis purposes according to the type of compression evaluated. Some findings reflected those of the current review in terms of healing: multi-component compression was more effective than single-component systems (based on <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1995</LINK>, a secondary reference to <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2007a</LINK> in this Cochrane review); and multi-component compression comprising an elastic bandage performed better than that consisting of non-elastic devices (based on <LINK REF="STD-Callam-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Callam 1992b</LINK>, included as a primary reference in this review). However, the Palfreyman review included only one trial in the comparison of compression versus no compression (<LINK REF="STD-Kikta-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kikta 1988</LINK>), estimating no statistically significant difference between groups. Two further studies were described as comparing Unna's Boot with 'other therapies', whereas in the current review these were included within the following comparisons: compression versus no compression (non-compressive bandages) (<LINK REF="STD-Rubin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rubin 1990</LINK>); and competing single-component compression systems (<LINK REF="STD-Cordts-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cordts 1992</LINK>). Of the remaining studies included in the Palfreyman review, one focused on ulcer recurrence and the other two evaluated the effectiveness of intermittent pneumatic compression. We took the view that it was more helpful to include studies not reporting vascular assessment of venous disease since methods of diagnosis vary between studies and are also likely to vary in clinical practice, meaning that a standardised definition may not be realistic.</P>
<P>The second review included comparisons of compression bandages with compression stockings in patients with venous leg ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Amsler-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amsler 2009</LINK>). This review had some systematic elements but did not include a structured assessment of risk of bias and did not mention checking of study selection decisions and data extraction by a second, independent reviewer. Eight trials were included, seven of which were also included in our review. We excluded the eighth trial because it used quasi-randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Horakova-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Horakova 1994</LINK>); Amsler and colleagues also expressed concern about the quality of randomisation for this trial. The reviewers confidently concluded that stockings were significantly better than bandages in terms of complete healing at 12 to 16 weeks, time to healing and pain scores. However, there were problems with the analyses underpinning these conclusions. The meta-analysis of complete healing pooled all eight included studies, despite substantial clinical heterogeneity in terms of the types of stockings and bandages used across the group of trials. Time to healing was analysed as a continuous outcome and survival analyses were not considered. The meta-analysis of pain scores was based on three trials, and showed significant statistical heterogeneity. We feel that slightly more cautious conclusions are warranted, given the methodological quality and clinical heterogeneity of this group of trials.</P>

<P>Compression increases the healing rates of venous leg ulcers compared with no compression. Multi-component compression systems are more effective than single-component systems. Multi-component systems containing an elastic bandage appear to be more effective than those composed mainly of inelastic constituents. Two-component bandage systems appear equivalent to the four-layer bandage (4LB) in terms of healing. Variations of the 4LB achieve similar outcomes. The 4LB heals ulcers faster and is more cost-effective than multi-component systems comprising a short stretch bandage (SSB). There does not appear to be any difference between the 4LB and paste-bandage systems, but interpretation of data is impaired by differences in the paste-bandage systems. There is currently no evidence of a difference in the effectiveness of adjustable compression boots and compression bandage systems, or between single-layer stockings and paste-bandage systems. Two-layer stockings appear to be more effective than the SSB. The relative effectiveness of compression stockings and the 4LB is currently unclear. The relative effectiveness of tubular compression and compression bandages is currently unclear. The limited evidence on the effects of different compression systems on venous ulcer recurrence precludes definitive conclusions at the current time. The performance of any type of compression bandage might be influenced by operator skill; this is likely to be less of an issue for compression stockings.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-08-10 13:44:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some of the research concerning management of venous leg ulceration is of poor quality, but methodological improvements are seen in more recent trials, possibly as a result of the CONSORT Statement, a document that provides guidance regarding the reporting of randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>). The following are recommended for future studies:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Recommendations outlined in the CONSORT Statement should be adopted as far as possible.</LI>
<LI>If possible, future trials should be conducted in collaboration with a clinical trials unit in order to provide the optimal infrastructure for trial design, conduct, data management and analysis.</LI>
<LI>Recruitment numbers should be based on an <I>a priori</I> sample size calculation. In many trials the sample size is too small to detect clinically important differences between treatments as statistically significant. In order to recruit sufficient patient numbers, multicentred trials should be considered more frequently. When these trials are commissioned, a strong infrastructure will be required to provide support and promote collaboration.</LI>
<LI>A proper method of randomisation should be used and reported (e.g. computer-generated list), and allocation to treatment should be concealed (e.g. using remote telephone randomisation service).</LI>
<LI>The primary endpoint of treatment trials should be complete ulcer healing, and, preferably, the primary outcome should be time to healing. Assistance should be sought from a suitably qualified statistician regarding the design and analysis of the trial in relation to survival analysis. In addition, the length of follow-up needs to be of sufficient duration to capture a meaningful proportion of events. If time-to-event analysis is not feasible, other outcomes could include frequency of complete healing during the trial period, or (less preferably) healing rate and change in ulcer surface area.</LI>
<LI>A single reference ulcer should be selected for each patient. Multiple ulcers on a patient should not be studied unless the trial has been specifically designed to accommodate this, and appropriate statistical analysis prespecified to account for clustering.</LI>
<LI>Treatment groups should be comparable at baseline for prognostic factors such as ulcer area and duration. In small RCTs randomisation alone may not achieve balance for prognostic factors. Statistical analysis should adjust for baseline imbalance.</LI>
<LI>A complete and thorough description of concurrent treatments, including primary dressings, should be given in trial reports.</LI>
<LI>Assessment of outcomes should be undertaken either by assessors masked to trial treatment, or independently confirmed by assessors masked to treatment.</LI>
<LI>Analysis should be according to intention to treat.</LI>
<LI>Evaluations should provide sufficiently full details of the interventions used, including descriptions of all components of compression, such that readers would be able to apply the treatments described (with training where necessary).</LI>
<LI>Evaluations should report the skill level of staff providing care.</LI>

<LI>Previously the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Rubin-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rubin 1990</LINK> was described as comparing compression with primary dressing alone. Further study of the report suggested that the comparison group received a primary dressing plus elastic bandage used as a retaining wrap. Comments in the trial authors' discussion section suggest that these bandages did not provide compression. Therefore, this trial has now been reviewed in a section comparing compression with non-compressive bandages</LI>

<P>Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses: perspective was UK NHS and Personal Social Service; time horizon was 1 year after recruitment; price year 2001; health benefit measured as differences in ulcer-free days (Kaplan-Meier estimate) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated from patients' responses to the EuroQol-5D questionnaire. To account for censoring, QALYs were adjusted by the Kaplan-Meier survival estimate over the 1-year time horizon. Mean difference in healing time for ulcers was 10.9 days (95% CI -6.8-29.1) in favour of Group 1: MD between treatment groups in QALYs was -0.02 (95% CI -0.08-0.04). The MD in total cost between compression systems was GBP 227.32/patient/year (95% CI 16.53-448.30) in favour of Group 1. Sensitivity analyses showed cost-effectiveness estimate to be robust to variation in number of bandages used and unit costs of compression systems. The 4LB emerged as the dominant strategy.</P>

<P>When patients had multiple ulcers, the limb with the largest eligible ulcer was studied. Healing defined as complete epithelial cover in the absence of a scab. At healing, the ulcer was photographed and healing was confirmed at the trial office by an investigator blind to treatment allocation. Training in the application of both types of bandages was provided during trial set-up.</P>
<P>This trial included an assessment of health-related quality of life. Since there was a large amount of missing data for this outcome, a descriptive analysis of findings was reported. The instruments used for data collection were the SF-12 and the Hyland Leg and Foot Ulcer Questionnaire. For the SF-12, scores between treatment groups appeared similar at baseline and over time for physical and mental components. For the Hyland Leg and Foot Ulcer Questionnaire, the scale was scored using 2 factors: practical, and emotional. Baseline and follow-up scores were similar between groups for both factors.</P>

<P>Primary outcome of trial was bandage slippage measured at each bandage change (significant difference in favour of 2-component system, mean slippage 2.48 vs 4.17 cm, P &lt; 0.001). Secondary outcomes were wound healing (assessed with tracings and computerised planimetry), health-related quality of life, bandage wear time (no significant difference between groups), patient mobility (available data were limited but suggested no significant difference between groups), and patient preference (72% preferred 2-component system, 22% preferred 4LB, 6% had no preference).</P>
<P>Compression bandages applied by a trained study co-ordinator under supervision of the study investigator for each centre. Investigators selected on the basis of prior knowledge and experience of using the 4LB. 4LB applied according to manufacturer's instructions and additional training deemed unnecessary. All staff and investigators were provided with training in applying the 2-component system by manufacturer's regional technical expert; staff had to demonstrate proficiency in bandaging technique prior to start of enrolment.</P>

<P>The search strategy of the Cochrane Wounds Group was used to identify RCTs and CCTs of bandages or stockings in the treatment of venous leg ulcer trials (see Scope of Wounds Group). This includes electronic searches of MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, as well as hand searches of conference proceedings and wound care journals.<BR/>Experts in wound care and pharmaceutical companies were contacted to enquire about unpublished, ongoing and recently published trials.<BR/>Citations within obtained reviews and papers were scrutinised to identify additional studies.An Advisory Panel was established at the outset of a series of reviews of which this is one. They assisted by checking our lists of trials for any omissions, and to inform us of any unpublished, ongoing or recently completed trials.</P>
