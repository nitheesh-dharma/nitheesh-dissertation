<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-02 13:25:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>&#8216;Dual diagnosis&#8217; is the term used to describe people who have a mental health problem and also have problems with drugs or alcohol. In some areas, over 50% of all those with mental health difficulties will have problems with drugs or alcohol. For people with mental illness, substance misuse often has a negative and damaging effect on the symptoms of their illness and the way their medication works. They may become aggressive or engage in activities that are illegal. Substance misuse can also increase risk of suicide, hepatitis C, HIV, relapse, incarceration and homelessness.<BR/>
</P>
<P>People who have substance misuse problems but no mental illness can be treated via a variety of psychosocial interventions. These include motivational interviewing, or MI, that looks at people&#8217;s motivation for change; cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT, which helps people adapt their behaviour by improving coping strategies; a supportive approach similar to that pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous; family psycho-education observing the signs and effects of substance misuse; and group or individual skills training. However, using these interventions for people with dual diagnosis is more complex.</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to assess the effects of psychosocial interventions for substance reduction in people with a serious mental illness compared to care as usual or standard care. A search for studies was carried out in July 2012; 32 studies were included in the review with a total of 3165 people. These studies used a variety of different psychosocial interventions (including CBT, MI, skills training, integrated models of care). In the main, evidence was graded as low or very low quality and no study showed any great difference between psychosocial interventions and treatment as usual. There was no compelling evidence to support any one psychosocial treatment over another. However, differences in study designs made comparisons between studies problematic. Studies also had high numbers of people leaving early, differences in outcomes measured, and differing ways in which the psychosocial interventions were delivered. More large scale, high quality and better reported studies are required to address these shortcomings. This will better address whether psychosocial interventions are effective and good for people with mental illness and substance misuse problems.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-09-26 12:01:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update (2013), the Trials Search Co-ordinator of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group (CSG) searched the CSG Trials Register (July 2012), which is based on regular searches of major medical and scientific databases. The principal authors conducted two further searches (8 October 2012 and 15 January 2013) of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. A separate search for trials of contingency management was completed as this was an additional intervention category for this update.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychosocial interventions for substance misuse with standard care in people with serious mental illness.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:32:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We independently selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) between groups. For all meta-analyses we pooled data using a random-effects model. Using the GRADE approach, we identified seven patient-centred outcomes and assessed the quality of evidence for these within each comparison.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-25 13:29:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Glenn E Hunt">
<P>We included 32 trials with a total of 3165 participants. Evaluation of long-term integrated care included four RCTs (n = 735). We found no significant differences on loss to treatment (n = 603, 3 RCTs, RR 1.09 CI 0.82 to 1.45, <I>low quality of evidence</I>), death by 3 years (n = 421, 2 RCTs, RR 1.18 CI 0.39 to 3.57, <I>low quality of evidence</I>), alcohol use (not in remission at 36 months) (n = 143, 1 RCT, RR 1.15 CI 0.84 to 1.56,<I> low quality of evidence</I>), substance use (n = 85, 1 RCT, RR 0.89 CI 0.63 to 1.25, <I>low quality of evidence</I>), global assessment of functioning (n = 171, 1 RCT, MD 0.7 CI 2.07 to 3.47, <I>low quality of evidence</I>), or general life satisfaction (n = 372, 2 RCTs, MD 0.02 higher CI 0.28 to 0.32, <I>moderate quality of evidence</I>).</P>
<P>For evaluation of non-integrated intensive case management with usual treatment (4 RCTs, n = 163) we found no statistically significant difference for loss to treatment at 12 months (n = 134, 3 RCTs, RR 1.21 CI 0.73 to 1.99, <I>very low quality of evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Motivational interviewing plus cognitive behavioural therapy compared to usual treatment (7 RCTs, total n = 878) did not reveal any advantage for retaining participants at 12 months (n = 327, 1 RCT, RR 0.99 CI 0.62 to 1.59, <I>low quality of evidence</I>) or for death (n = 493, 3 RCTs, RR 0.72 CI 0.22 to 2.41, <I>low quality of evidence)</I>, and no benefit for reducing substance use (n = 119, 1 RCT, MD 0.19 CI -0.22 to 0.6, <I>low quality of evidence</I>), relapse (n = 36, 1 RCT, RR 0.5 CI 0.24 to 1.04, <I>very low quality of evidence</I>) or global functioning (n = 445, 4 RCTs, MD 1.24 CI 1.86 to 4.34, <I>very low quality of evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Cognitive behavioural therapy alone compared with usual treatment (2 RCTs, n = 152) showed no significant difference for losses from treatment at 3 months (n = 152, 2 RCTs, RR 1.12 CI 0.44 to 2.86, <I>low quality of evidence</I>). No benefits were observed on measures of lessening cannabis use at 6 months (n = 47, 1 RCT, RR 1.30 CI 0.79 to 2.15, <I>very low quality of evidence</I>) or mental state (n = 105, 1 RCT, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale MD 0.52 CI -0.78 to 1.82, <I>low quality of evidence</I>).</P>
<P>We found no advantage for motivational interviewing alone compared with usual treatment (8 RCTs, n = 509) in reducing losses to treatment at 6 months (n = 62, 1 RCT, RR 1.71 CI 0.63 to 4.64, <I>very low quality of evidence</I>), although significantly more participants in the motivational interviewing group reported for their first aftercare appointment (n = 93, 1 RCT, RR 0.69 CI 0.53 to 0.9). Some differences, favouring treatment, were observed in abstaining from alcohol (n = 28, 1 RCT, RR 0.36 CI 0.17 to 0.75, <I>very low quality of evidence</I>) but not other substances (n = 89, 1 RCT, RR -0.07 CI -0.56 to 0.42, <I>very low quality of evidence</I>), and no differences were observed in mental state (n = 30, 1 RCT, MD 0.19 CI -0.59 to 0.21, <I>very low quality of evidence</I>).</P>
<P>We found no significant differences for skills training in the numbers lost to treatment by 12 months (n = 94, 2 RCTs, RR 0.70 CI 0.44 to 1.1, <I>very low quality of evidence</I>).</P>
<P>We found no differences for contingency management compared with usual treatment (2 RCTs, n = 206) in numbers lost to treatment at 3 months (n = 176, 1 RCT, RR 1.65 CI 1.18 to 2.31, <I>low quality of evidence</I>), number of stimulant positive urine tests at 6 months (n = 176, 1 RCT, RR 0.83 CI 0.65 to 1.06, <I>low quality of evidence</I>) or hospitalisations (n = 176, 1 RCT, RR 0.21 CI 0.05 to 0.93, <I>low quality of evidence</I>).</P>
<P>We were unable to summarise all findings due to skewed data or because trials did not measure the outcome of interest. In general, evidence was rated as low or very low due to high or unclear risks of bias because of poor trial methods, or poorly reported methods, and imprecision due to small sample sizes, low event rates and wide confidence intervals.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:32:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Glenn E Hunt">
<P>We included 32 RCTs and found no compelling evidence to support any one psychosocial treatment over another for people to remain in treatment or to reduce substance use or improve mental state in people with serious mental illnesses. Furthermore, methodological difficulties exist which hinder pooling and interpreting results. Further high quality trials are required which address these concerns and improve the evidence in this important area.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:32:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Substance misuse among people with a severe mental illness is a major concern, with prevalence rates over 50%. This figure varies across studies, depending on location and methodologies and by the way substance misuse problems and severe mental illness are defined (<LINK REF="REF-Carra-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carra 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Green-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gregg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregg 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lai-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lai-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 2012b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lowe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Regier-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regier 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Todd-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Todd 2004</LINK>). Improving services for these patients (often labelled as having a 'dual diagnosis') is a priority as using drugs or consuming alcohol, even at low levels, is associated with a range of adverse consequences, including higher rates of non-adherence, relapse, suicide, HIV, hepatitis, homelessness, aggression, incarceration, and fewer social supports or financial resources (<LINK REF="REF-Donald-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donald 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Green-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hunt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siegfried-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegfried 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsuang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsuang 2006</LINK>). Further co-morbidity places an additional burden on families, psychiatric and government resources and is particularly challenging to those providing services as these patients have lower rates of treatment completion and higher rates of relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Siegfried-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegfried 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tyrer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyrer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warren-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2007</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:32:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is important that co-occurring substance use is detected as early as possible and that appropriate and effective treatment is provided (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siegfried-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegfried 1998</LINK>). Treatment has traditionally been complicated by different approaches and philosophies among mental health and drug services as they may differ in their theoretical underpinnings, policies and protocols. Separate treatment programmes have been offered in parallel or sequentially by different clinicians, which may result in less than optimum patient care with the patient having to negotiate two separate treatment systems (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2007</LINK>). Another approach to care is the integrated treatment model where mental health and substance use treatments are brought together simultaneously by the same service, clinician or team of clinicians who are competent in both service areas and place similar importance on both (<LINK REF="REF-Drake-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drake 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Green-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2007</LINK>). Basic elements include an assertive style of engagement, techniques of close monitoring, comprehensive services (including inpatient, day hospital, community team and outpatient care), supportive living environments, flexibility and specialisation of clinicians, step-wise treatment, and a long-term perspective and optimism (<LINK REF="REF-Drake-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drake 1993</LINK>). Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) and residential programmes are generally long-term and can form a basis for integrated programmes.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-10-03 11:07:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As many substance users in the general population have benefited from a range of psychosocial interventions, it would follow that these same interventions should also benefit people with psychosis when their mental health problems are taken into account (<LINK REF="REF-Barrowclough-2006-a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrowclough 2006 a</LINK>). Most, if not all, substances of abuse increase dopaminergic activity in the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Koob-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koob 2010</LINK>). Given that schizophrenia and other forms of psychosis are characterised by heightened dopaminergic transmission and that neuroleptics decrease activity or block dopamine receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Kapur-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kapur 2005</LINK>), it stands to reason that most substances of abuse increase symptoms, the risk of relapse and compromise the beneficial effects of neuroleptics (<LINK REF="REF-LeDuc-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">LeDuc 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seibyl-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seibyl 1993</LINK>). This is especially true for stimulant drugs like amphetamine, cocaine and concentrated forms such as crack cocaine and methamphetamine ('ice') that can exacerbate or mimic psychotic symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Callaghan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callaghan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKetin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKetin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pluddemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pluddemann 2013</LINK>). Substance use is also related to poor compliance with treatment, further increasing the risk of relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Hunt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt 2002</LINK>). Interventions that reduce substance use are likely to improve symptoms, relapse rates, recovery and other outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Cleary-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleary 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drake-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drake 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horsfall-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horsfall 2009</LINK>). Common psychosocial interventions to reduce substance use and misuse include Twelve Step recovery, which adopts a supportive approach such as that used by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA); motivational interviewing, which aims to increase an individual's motivation for change; group and individual skills training; family psycho-education regarding the signs and effects of substance use; and individual or group psychotherapy involving cognitive or behavioural principles, or both, which aim to increase coping strategies, awareness and self-monitoring behaviour. All of these interventions can vary in intensity and duration, and can be offered in a variety of settings either individually or as part of an integrated programme. Integrated treatment ensures mental health and substance misuse services are available in the same setting and delivered in a coherent fashion.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:32:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While encouraging, results of trials assessing the effectiveness of these psychosocial interventions for mental health consumers are equivocal (for reviews, see: <LINK REF="REF-Bogenschutz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bogenschutz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cleary-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleary 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dixon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dixon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drake-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drake 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drake-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drake 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drake-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drake 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horsfall-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horsfall 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mueser-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mueser 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>). Many studies have been hampered by small heterogeneous samples, poor experimental design (for example non-random assignment), high attrition rates, short follow-up periods, lack of accuracy of measuring substance use, skewed data, use of non-standardised outcome measures and unclear descriptions of treatment components (<LINK REF="REF-Barrowclough-2006-a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrowclough 2006 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cleary-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleary 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ley 2000</LINK>). When assessing integrated programmes, it can also be difficult to determine exactly which part of the programme is the most effective, and control groups (particularly in the USA) may involve a certain level of service integration, making interpretations difficult (<LINK REF="REF-Drake-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drake 1996</LINK>). Moreover, study methodologies, interventions and outcome measures vary across studies, as do patterns of participants' readiness to change, severity and type of illness and substance use, all of which make combining results in a review problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Donald-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donald 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>This current review updates the 2008 Cochrane review on "Psychosocial treatment programmes for people with both severe mental illness and substance misuse". The previous review included any programme of substance misuse treatment and located 25 randomised controlled trials. The authors from two previous reviews found no evidence to support any one substance misuse programme as being superior to another (<LINK REF="REF-Cleary-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleary 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ley 2000</LINK>). We felt an update of this review was warranted as there are several new studies that have been conducted in the last five years.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:32:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Glenn E Hunt">
<P>We included all relevant, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with or without blinding if they utilised a psychosocial intervention to reduce substance use in patients with severe mental illness and substance misuse compared with standard care. We excluded quasi-randomised trials, such as those where allocation was alternate or sequential.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:32:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Glenn E Hunt">
<P>We included people with severe mental illness (for example, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and psychosis) and concurrent problem of substance misuse. We have defined people with 'severe' illness as those with a chronic mental illness like schizophrenia who present to adult services for long-term care. Those with an organic disorder, non-severe mental illness (for example, personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, depressive symptoms based on scores from a scale) or those who solely abused tobacco were, if possible, excluded. Trials that included a mixture of patients with a severe mental diagnosis were included if a large proportion had a schizophrenia-like illness or psychosis (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). For the current update, studies were excluded if all of the participants had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, so they do not overlap with affective disorder reviews.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:32:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We anticipated that studies included in the review would use a wide variety of psychosocial interventions for substance misuse, making direct comparisons difficult. In order to enhance the utility of the review, we developed a priori categories within which we made planned comparisons. These categories were developed from theoretical models of the types of behavioural and psychosocial interventions offered to clients and the context in which they are delivered. The types of interventions were grouped in two strata, based on duration and intensity of treatment. The first stratum describes long-term interventions for dual diagnosis patients that offered an array of services with different levels of integration and assertive outreach (taking place over years rather than weeks or months), and the second describes stand-alone psychosocial interventions that clients received over shorter periods. We did not include Interventions for informal carers (partner or family members) as separate categories, though we did sometimes include them as part of the treatments mentioned below.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Provider-oriented long-term interventions: integrated and non-integrated care by community mental health teams for dual diagnosis populations</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.1 Integrated models of care with assertive community treatment (ACT)</HEADING>
<P>Integrated treatment models for patients with a dual diagnosis unify services at the provider level rather than forcing clients to negotiate separate mental health and substance abuse treatment programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Drake-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drake 1993</LINK>). The range of services provided varies according to client needs and should be able to handle patients at differing stages of readiness to change (<LINK REF="REF-Tsuang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsuang 2006</LINK>). Substance abuse treatments are integrated into an array of direct services, such as frequent home visits, crisis intervention, housing skills training, vocational rehabilitation, medication monitoring, and family psycho-education. Integrated treatment means that the same clinicians or teams of clinicians in the one setting provide long-term treatments in a co-ordinated fashion (<LINK REF="REF-Barrowclough-2006-a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrowclough 2006 a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Green-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2007</LINK>). Teams consist of three to six clinicians and attempt to remain faithful to a specified model of care. To the client, the services should appear seamless with a consistent approach, philosophy and set of recommendations. Usually the caseloads of dual diagnosis teams are lower (approximately 10 to 15 clients shared within a team) than for standard case managers (approximately 20 to 30). Integrated treatment is a process that takes place over years rather than weeks or months. Studies included in this category must have clearly demonstrated the following: 1) assertive community outreach to engage and retain clients and to offer services to reluctant or uncooperative clients, 2) staged interventions to reduce substance use, and 3) adherence to the integrated team philosophy. The intervention could be community-based or provided for special populations, such as homeless people or forensic patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.2 Non-integrated models of care or intensive case management</HEADING>
<P>Non-integrated treatment entails similar interventions by community teams, as described above, except the same members do not deliver them in a co-ordinated fashion and assertive community outreach is not included. Normally, case managers in this category are better trained and have higher clinical qualifications and better therapeutic skills than standard case managers. Intensive case management is defined as lower case load size (approximately 10 to 15 clients) than for standard case managers and tends to have a 'psychodynamic'<B> </B>flavour (see <LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1998</LINK>). To be included in this category, part of the intervention had to address the client's drug and alcohol misuse.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Patient or client focused short-term interventions for substance misuse</HEADING>
<P>These interventions can be broadly grouped into individual and group modalities. They are offered in addition to routine care (treatment as usual, standard case management) and are based on different theoretical models. Although they could be part of the provider-oriented packages described above, studies included here were easier to evaluate since they described a simplified intervention that can be easily reproduced. As some studies used more than one intervention (for example, cognitive behavioural therapy combined with motivational interviewing), these were included in a separate category.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.1 Individual approaches</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.1.1 Cognitive behavioural therapies</HEADING>
<P>Cognitive behavioural approaches include a variety of interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Rector-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rector 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Work-Group-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Work Group 2007</LINK>). The defining features are: 1) emphasis on functional analysis of drug use, understanding the reasons for use and consequences; and 2) skills training for recognising the situations where a person is most vulnerable to drug use and avoiding these situations. A cognitive behavioural intervention seeks to establish links between drug misuse, irrational beliefs, and misperceptions at a personal level and endeavours to correct the thoughts, feelings and actions of the recipient with respect to and the promotion of alternative ways of coping (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2012</LINK>). The target symptom that is usually focused on is reducing problematic substance use or harm minimisation, such as reducing the risk of contracting HIV.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.1.2 Motivational interviewing</HEADING>
<P>Motivational interviewing takes a non-confrontational approach to treating substance misuse and is intended to enhance the individual's intrinsic motivation for change, in patients who often find it difficult to commit to change (<LINK REF="REF-Tsuang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsuang 2006</LINK>). It matches the patient's level of problem recognition to change with specific strategies and goals and can be delivered in brief sessions or over a number of weeks. It is based on four key principles: 1) expressing empathy, 2) developing discrepancy, 3) supporting self-efficacy, and 4) rolling with resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Chanut-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chanut 2005</LINK>); and is directed at five stages: 1) pre-contemplation, 2) contemplation, 3) preparation, 4) action, and 5) maintenance (<LINK REF="REF-Tsuang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsuang 2006</LINK>). A key hypothesis is that the patient's perspective on the importance of change is fundamental to the patient's readiness to address the problem. Developing the patient's confidence in their ability to achieve the desired change is also a key issue of motivational interviewing. This treatment is delivered individually or in small group settings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.1.3 Contingency management</HEADING>
<P>Based on principals of operant conditioning, contingency management (CM) offers incentives or rewards to reinforce specific goals (reduced substance use, risky behaviours etc). Typically, rewards are provided if a negative substance test is provided (urine test or breath test). Rewards can vary widely, ranging from encouraging statements ('keep up the good work') to large or small financial prize (vouchers for food, cash etc). This approach has shown consistent success with various drug use disorders: cannabis, opiate and cocaine dependence and polysubstance use disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Dutra-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dutra 2008</LINK>). Contingency management has also been 'bundled' with other psychosocial interventions, for example, motivational interviewing plus cognitive behavioural therapies (<LINK REF="STD-Bellack-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bellack 2006</LINK>). Thus, contingency management was added to the current review due to the number of current and ongoing trials using this intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Group approaches</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2.2.1 Social skills training</HEADING>
<P>These groups are aimed at helping clients develop interpersonal skills for establishing and maintaining relationships with others, dealing with conflict, and handling social situations involving substance misuse (<LINK REF="REF-Mueser-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mueser 2004</LINK>). They are taught in a highly structured way by using role play, corrective feedback and homework. This usually occurs in a group format, although the methods can also be employed in individual work as a type of cognitive behavioural counselling.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Standard care or treatment as usual</HEADING>
<P>This was defined as the care that a person would normally receive had they not been included in the research trial. This could include standard case management (see <LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1998</LINK> for definition). Standard care varies between settings and can be supplemented by additional components, including psycho-educational material, family therapy, or referral to self-help groups (for example, Alcoholics Anonymous) or other agencies for substance abuse treatment.</P>

<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and</LI>
<LI>the measuring instrument has not been written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Ideally the measuring instrument should either be: i) a self-report or ii) completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided to primarily use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we used mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, Chapter 9.4.5.2).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aimed to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion:</P>
<UL>
<LI>standard deviations and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors;</LI>
<LI>when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>));</LI>
<LI>if a scale started from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) which can have values from 30 to 210), we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD &gt; (S - S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and endpoint and these rules can be applied. We entered skewed endpoint data from studies of fewer than 200 participants as 'other data; within <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK> rather than into a statistical analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at mean if the sample size is large; we entered such endpoint data into the syntheses.</P>
<P>When continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not; we entered skewed change data into analyses regardless of size of study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (for example, mean days per month).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we made efforts to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into &#8217;clinically improved&#8217; or &#8217;not clinically improved&#8217;. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1987</LINK>) this could be considered as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005b</LINK>). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.7 Direction of graphs</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for the treatment intervention. Where keeping to this made it impossible to avoid outcome titles with clumsy double-negatives (for example, 'Not improved') we reported data where the left of the line indicates an unfavourable outcome.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). The Number Needed to Treat or Harm (NNT or H) statistic with its CIs is intuitively attractive to clinicians but is problematic both in its accurate calculation in meta-analyses and interpretation (<LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2009</LINK>). For binary data presented in the 'Summary of findings' tables, where possible, we calculated illustrative comparative risks.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous outcomes we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups. We would prefer not to calculate effect size measures (standardised mean difference (SMD)). However, if scales of very considerable similarity were used, we presumed there was a small difference in measurement, and we would have calculated effect size and transformed the effect back to the units of one or more of the specific instruments.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the presently included trials used cluster randomisation. For the purposes of future updates of this review, where clustering is not accounted for in primary studies we planned to present data in a table with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review, should we include cluster RCTs, we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we plan to present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) (design effect = 1 + (m - 1)*ICC) (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC is not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If we had identified cluster trials, we would have analysed them taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report. Synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>None of the presently included studies employed a cross-over trial design. For the purposes of future updates of the review, a major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (for example, pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we proposed to only use the data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>Where a study involves more than two treatment arms, if relevant, we presented the additional treatment arms in comparisons. If data are binary we simply added these and combined them within the two-by-two table. If data were continuous we combined data following the formula in section 7.7.3.8 (Combining groups) of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, we did not reproduce these data.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Overall loss of credibility</HEADING>
<P>At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Xia-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xia 2009</LINK>). We chose that, for any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for we would not reproduce these data or use them within the analyses. If, however, more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we would address this within the 'Summary of findings' tables by down-rating quality. Finally, we would also downgrade quality within the 'Summary of findings' tables should loss be 25% to 50% in total.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Binary</HEADING>
<P>In the case where attrition for a binary outcome is between 0 and 50% and where these data are not clearly described, we presented data on a 'once-randomised-always-analyse' basis (an intention to treat analysis). Those leaving the study early were all assumed to have the same rates of negative outcome as those who completed, with the exception of the outcome of death and adverse effects. For these outcomes the rate of those who stay in the study - in that particular arm of the trial - was used for those who did not. We undertook a sensitivity analysis testing how prone the primary outcomes are to change when data only from people who complete the study to that point were compared to the intention to treat analysis using the above assumptions.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>If standard deviations are not reported, we first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there are missing measures of variance for continuous data but an exact standard error and confidence intervals available for group means, and either a P value or t value available for differences in mean, we can calculate them according to the rules described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). That is, when only the standard error (SE) is reported, standard deviations (SDs) are calculated by the formula SD = SE * square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, t or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae did not apply, we calculated the SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless examined the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis by excluding the imputed values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.3 Last observation carried forward</HEADING>
<P>We anticipated that in some studies the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) would be employed within the study report. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2007</LINK>). Therefore, where LOCF data have been used in the trial, if less than 50% of the data have been assumed we would present and use these data and indicate that they are the product of LOCF assumptions.</P>

The importance of the observed value of I<SUP>2 </SUP>depends on: i) magnitude and direction of effects, and ii) strength of evidence for heterogeneity (for example, P value from Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test, or a confidence interval for I<SUP>2</SUP>). An I<SUP>2 </SUP>estimate greater than or equal to around 50% accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was interpreted as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). When substantial levels of heterogeneity were found in the primary outcome, we explored reasons for the heterogeneity (<LINK TAG="SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</LINK>).</P>

<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). These are described in section 10 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects. We did not plan to use funnel plots for outcomes where there were 10 or fewer studies, or where all studies were of similar sizes. As no meta-analyses of more than five studies were undertaken, we did not conduct funnel plot analysis.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:32:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model: it puts added weight onto small studies, which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We chose the random-effects model for all analyses. The reader is, however, able to choose to inspect the data using the fixed-effect model.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>If inconsistency was high, we have reported this. First, we investigated whether data had been entered correctly. Second, if data were correct, we visually inspected the graph and successively removed studies outside of the company of the rest to see if homogeneity was restored. For this review we decided that should this occur, with data contributing to the summary finding of no more than around 10% of the total weighting, we would present the data. If not, then we did not pool the data and discussed the issues. We know of no supporting research for this 10% cut-off, but we use prediction intervals as an alternative to this unsatisfactory state.</P>

<P>We conducted sensitivity analyses on outcomes of comparisons with four or more trials where studies with different quality were combined to ascertain if there were substantial differences in the results when lesser quality trials or those comprising patients with schizophrenia (or other psychoses) were compared to trials of higher quality or using mixed diagnostic groups. We applied all sensitivity analyses to the primary outcomes based on randomised sequence, allocation concealment and blinding of outcome measurement.

<P>The OTI has six domains reflecting treatment outcomes of: drug use, HIV risk-taking behaviour, social functioning, criminality, health status and psychological adjustment (<LINK REF="REF-Darke-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darke 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Darke-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darke 1992</LINK>). The drug use domain consists of 11 items measuring drug use over the last three days (recent drug use) or previous month (28 days) for alcohol, cannabis, amphetamines, cocaine, opiates and other drugs. Clients are asked to estimate the number of drinks or usage of drugs on the two most recent use days in the previous month. The quantity over the two days (q1 + q2) is divided by day interval (t1 + t2). Thus, an OTI score of 1.0 indicates one drink, injection or joint per day; 0.14 to 0.99 more than once a week; 0.01 to 0.13 once a week or less, and 2.0 or more indicates use more than once a day. Higher scores indicate a greater degree of dysfunction or substance use. <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2006</LINK> used the OTI to measure substance use over the previous month.</P>

<P>The Global Assessment of Functioning is a revised version of the Global Assessment Scale (GAS) (<LINK REF="REF-Endicott-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Endicott 1976</LINK>). The (GAF) scale allows the clinical progress of the patient to be expressed in global terms using a single measure. The GAF allows the clinician to express the patient's psychological, social and occupational functioning on a continuum extending from superior mental health, with optimal social and occupational performance, to profound mental impairment when social and occupational functioning is precluded. Developed by DSM-IV to report global assessment of functioning on the Axis V (<LINK REF="REF-DSM_x002d_IV" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM-IV</LINK>) it ranges from 1 to 100 (zero is used to acknowledge inadequate information). Higher scores indicate a better outcome; scores ranging from 1 to 20 indicate a person unable to function independently; 21 to 40 indicate major impairment, severely impaired by delusions; 41 to 60 moderately impaired, having serious symptoms and these patients usually need continuous treatment in a partial hospitalisation or outpatient setting; 61 to 80 indicate slight or mild impairment with transient symptoms; and 81 to 100, good or superior functioning. <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Barrowclough-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barrowclough 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Barrowclough-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Barrowclough 2010,</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Bechdolf-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bechdolf 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bonsack-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bonsack 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Essock-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Essock 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Madigan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Madigan 2013</LINK> used this scale.</P>

The scale has 30 items and each item can be defined on a seven-point scoring system, varying from one (absent) to seven (extreme), so total scores range from 30 to 210. This scale can be divided into three subscales for measuring the severity of general psychopathology (range 16 to 112), positive symptoms (PANSS-P, range 7 to 49) and negative symptoms (PANSS-N, range 7 to 49).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Random generation</HEADING>
<P>All 32 studies were stated to be randomised. Some used blocking or stratification methods in the sequence to obtain evenly balanced groups or different proportions (2:1) for each intervention, site, or to control for various demographic variables (type or degree of substance use, gender or psychiatric diagnosis). Ten studies stated the sequence was computer generated (<LINK REF="STD-Barrowclough-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barrowclough 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barrowclough-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Barrowclough 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bonsack-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bonsack 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chandler-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chandler 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Essock-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Essock 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hjorthoj-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hjorthoj 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madigan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Madigan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maloney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Maloney 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naeem-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Naeem 2005</LINK>), but often it was unclear how the sequence was generated (for example, random number table). Six studies used urn randomisation or placed cards in envelopes that were shuffled to produce a random sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Bellack-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bellack 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerrell-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Jerrell 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerrell-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Jerrell 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kemp-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kemp 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lehman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDonell-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McDonell 2013</LINK>).

The 20 studies listed above (with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Maloney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Maloney 2006</LINK>) were classified as low risk of selection bias as they provided some details of the allocation process or further particulars were provided by the researchers. Some participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Maloney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Maloney 2006</LINK> study were not randomised due to procedural difficulties.

<P>One study provided a full description of the methods used to generate the random sequence and allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Barrowclough-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Barrowclough 2010</LINK>). Seven studies provided some details or made explicit their method used for allocation concealment. Four other studies used urn method randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Jerrell-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Jerrell 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerrell-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Jerrell 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lehman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDonell-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McDonell 2013</LINK>), which has a low risk of bias if used properly, and some confirmed this via personal emails. Five trials stated that allocation concealment was achieved by a third party or researcher who was independent of the treating team (<LINK REF="STD-Barrowclough-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barrowclough 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chandler-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chandler 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hjorthoj-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hjorthoj 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madigan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Madigan 2013</LINK>) but often no further details were provided. The 10 studies listed above were judged as low risk as it was implied that the allocation concealment was adequate. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Maloney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Maloney 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swanson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 1999</LINK>) were judged high risk of bias as the researcher or therapist was involved with allocating patients. Four studies used sealed envelopes or patients selected a card (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bonsack-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bonsack 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kemp-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kemp 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naeem-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Naeem 2005</LINK>). However, it was not clear if the envelopes were opaque or if other measures were taken to ensure concealment, so these were judged as unclear risk. The remaining studies were classified as of unclear quality with a moderate risk of selection bias and overestimate of positive effect as no details were provided regarding allocation concealment, but this may be due to incomplete reporting and not how the study was conducted.</P>

Due to intervention characteristics, that is being a therapy or model of service, we assumed the participants and clinicians as being implicitly not blind to treatment assignment when considering performance bias. Therefore, we judged performance bias of all trials to be of unclear risk.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Detection bias</HEADING>
<P>Overall, 15 studies stated that independent raters were blinded to allocation when assessing clinical ratings of mental state or substance use. For 13 other studies it was unclear if the raters were blind to treatment as this was not stated. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Graeber-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Graeber 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kemp-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kemp 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maloney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Maloney 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagel-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nagel 2009</LINK>) were judged at high risk of bias because it was stated that the outcome assessors were not blind to treatment allocation and it was therefore possible to assess the risk of bias in these studies with higher confidence for clinical-based ratings. In three of these studies blinding status would not influence the primary outcome data as these were administrative measures (hospital readmissions, convictions, time to first outpatient appointment etc), however they were still judged high risk as less effort may have been made to follow-up those in the control arm.</P>

<P>We only rated risk of incomplete outcome data in respect to the primary outcome. The number of participants lost to treatment or evaluation across studies ranged from 0% to 57%. Four trials were judged as adequately addressing incomplete outcome data and were rated as low risk of attrition bias because there were no missing outcome data (<LINK REF="STD-Hickman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hickman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lehman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swanson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 1999</LINK>) and for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Graeber-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Graeber 2003</LINK>) there were no missing values for the primary outcome.</P>
<P>The following trials were rated as high risk. <LINK REF="STD-Bellack-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bellack 2006</LINK> excluded 46 of 175 participants after they were randomised, a further 19 participants because they did not become engaged in treatment, and a further 27 were lost to follow-up. Therefore, a significant proportion of participants (92/175, 53%) were excluded from the analysis, which may have a clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimates. The attrition rate was greater than 50% for <LINK REF="STD-Bond-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Bond 1991a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Godley-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Godley 1994</LINK> (at 18 months) and <LINK REF="STD-Hellerstein-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hellerstein 1995</LINK> (at 8 months) so data from these trials were excluded from the analysis as per protocol. In the <LINK REF="STD-Chandler-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chandler 2006</LINK> trial the attrition rate for the primary outcome measure was 37% (68/182); and for the controls no interviews were conducted to ascertain their whereabouts (moved from area, reincarcerated or died) and this may have led to severe bias. Three further trials were rated as high risk as more than 40% of patients were lost to follow-up; no reasons were given for them being missing and a full intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerrell-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Jerrell 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerrell-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Jerrell 1995b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many, but not all, included studies provided reasons for attrition. Reasons given included: some of the participants died during the trial, some could not be contacted or moved elsewhere, and some withdrew. Seven studies reported their results based on a full ITT analysis with all missing data imputed for primary outcomes using appropriate methods (<LINK REF="STD-Barrowclough-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Barrowclough 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bechdolf-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bechdolf 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bonsack-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bonsack 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hjorthoj-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hjorthoj 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naeem-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Naeem 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagel-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nagel 2009</LINK>). These were rated as unclear as all imputation strategies can bias study results. The remaining trials were rated as 'unclear'. They either did not address this issue, presented insufficient information of attrition or exclusions to permit judgement (that is, no reasons for missing data provided or numbers lost to evaluation not stated for each group) or did not report a full ITT analysis with imputed missing values (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barrowclough-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barrowclough 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bond-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Bond 1991b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burnam-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Burnam 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drake-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Drake 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Essock-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Essock 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kavanagh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kavanagh 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kemp-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kemp 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madigan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Madigan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maloney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Maloney 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDonell-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McDonell 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morse-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Morse 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tracy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tracy 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>The risk of other potential sources of bias was rated as low as no evidence of other bias was apparent. Most were publicly funded trials. No declaration of interest was made by authors, and we assume there was none to be made. However, many study authors were active pioneers in developing and the implementation of the experimental intervention model across the scientific community and clinical world. This raises the issue of how researcher beliefs could affect the entire process of evaluating an intervention in an RCT. Although conscious of this issue, we decided not to make any attempt to rate it as it is very difficult to judge, and erroneous quantification could drive bias into our conclusions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1: integrated models of care versus treatment as usual</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. Overall there was low quality evidence of no difference between integrated models of care and treatment as usual in terms of numbers lost to treatment or deaths by 36 months, although individually some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Burnam-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Burnam 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Essock-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Essock 2006</LINK>) showed some effect for retaining participants in evaluation during the early stages of each study. At the end of each treatment period differences were no longer apparent. All four studies had sample sizes greater than 100 participants, drawn from homeless (<LINK REF="STD-Burnam-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Burnam 1995</LINK>), forensic (<LINK REF="STD-Chandler-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chandler 2006</LINK>) and community populations (<LINK REF="STD-Drake-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Drake 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Essock-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Essock 2006</LINK>). Modified scales were used by <LINK REF="STD-Burnam-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Burnam 1995</LINK>, precluding inclusion.</P>
<P>There was low quality evidence of no difference in alcohol or substance use between integrated models of care and treatment as usual in terms of, or not, of remission by 36 months.</P>
<P>Moreover, there was low quality evidence of no difference between integrated models of care and treatment as usual in terms of average general global functioning or satisfaction with quality of life.</P>
<P>Outcome measures of jail and hospital days, arrests and hours of medication service were all skewed in <LINK REF="STD-Chandler-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chandler 2006</LINK>. This resulted in attrition being the only clear outcome measure which could be analysed. We were able to include data from <LINK REF="STD-Essock-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Essock 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Drake-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Drake 1998a</LINK>. They provided both treatment and controls groups with a certain level of integrated care, the difference being that that the ACT teams provided most outpatient services themselves while standard case management (treatment as usual) brokered services to other clinicians. The null results found in this review suggest that providing services by the same team may not be crucial to successful integration of services, although readers are advised that the quality of evidence is low overall.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 2: non-integrated models of care or intensive case management versus treatment as usual</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>. There was very low quality evidence of no difference between non-integrated models of care or intensive case management and treatment as usual in terms of being lost to treatment by 12 months. Death was not measured in any of the trials. There was very low quality evidence of no difference between non-integrated models of care or intensive case management and treatment as usual in terms of alcohol or drug use as data were skewed or not reported.</P>
<P>Moreover, there was very low quality evidence of no difference between non-integrated models of care or intensive case management and treatment as usual in terms of mental state, average general global functioning or general life satisfaction.</P>
<P>The results showed no support for retaining participants in non-integrated treatment over standard case management at any time period. We were only able to include little data as attrition rates were high (<LINK REF="STD-Bond-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Bond 1991a</LINK>), adapted scales were used, and the data were skewed or reporting was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Bond-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Bond 1991b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lehman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerrell-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Jerrell 1995b</LINK>). The role functioning (RFS) data provided by <LINK REF="STD-Jerrell-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Jerrell 1995b</LINK> by the end of the study (18 months) favoured the Twelve Step recovery control group, with a small but significant difference. The social adjustment scores were similar between groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 3: cognitive behavioural therapy + motivational interviewing (CBT+MI) versus treatment as usual</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>. There was low quality of evidence of no difference between CBT+MI and treatment as usual in terms of numbers lost to treatment or deaths by 12 months. All the data for alcohol use was skewed and evidence for substance use by 6 months was very low quality.</P>
<P>There was very low quality evidence of no difference between CBT+MI and treatment as usual in terms of mental state (relapse) and average global functioning at 12 months. Moreover, there was low quality evidence for quality of life at 6 months between treatment arms.</P>
<P>We found some support for the effectiveness of CBT+MI over standard care, yet, findings were inconsistent and, again, much data were unable to be used from all seven eligible studies. The <LINK REF="STD-Barrowclough-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barrowclough 2001</LINK> was a small study but showed an increased likelihood of relapse in the control group up until 18 months. Global functioning was slightly lower in the control group by nine months, although this difference was not sustained at later time periods (up to 18 months). <LINK REF="STD-Bellack-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bellack 2006</LINK> showed slightly decreased general life satisfaction scores and a 51% increased likelihood of being arrested in their reasonably sized control group by six months. By contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2006</LINK> showed that participants were more likely to drop out of the treatment group by three months. The treatment group also seemed to have a slightly higher mean number of drugs used by three months; this difference was not apparent by six months and <LINK REF="STD-Madigan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Madigan 2013</LINK> showed no difference in cannabis use at three or six months. The largest study to date (<LINK REF="STD-Barrowclough-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Barrowclough 2010</LINK>) reported no significant differences between interventions and death or hospitalised versus not admitted to hospital and alive by 24 months. Nor did this study report any differences in substance use, mental state (PANSS), or other outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Hjorthoj-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Hjorthoj 2013</LINK> reported higher satisfaction scores by 10 months but no difference were reported in quality of life or other outcomes.</P>
<P>Further research is required to determine whether long-term cognitive behavioural therapy combined with motivational interviewing is useful and cost-effective.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 4: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) versus treatment as usual</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>. There was low quality evidence of no difference between CBT and treatment as usual in terms of numbers lost to treatment by three months. Death was not measured in any of the trials. Neither trial reported alcohol use separately, so this effect could not be estimated and evidence for substance use by six months was very low quality.</P>
<P>There was low quality evidence of no difference between CBT and treatment as usual for mental state (BPRS) at six months, and evidence was very low for global functioning at six months. No study reported life satisfaction.</P>
<P>Support for retention in CBT was from the pooled results of <LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Naeem-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Naeem 2005</LINK>. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Edwards-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 2006</LINK>) found a 30% increased likelihood of cannabis use by those in the treatment group after 10 weekly sessions of CBT. No other differences were observed on measures of substance use or mental state and functioning, but again much of the data were unusable.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 5: cognitive behavioural therapy + psychological rehabilitation versus treatment as usual</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>. All of the outcomes for this comparison were very low quality or the outcome was not measured. It is problematic to interpret the skewed data and all data were from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Maloney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Maloney 2006</LINK>) allocating less than 100 people to this comparison. It is feasible that a subtle difference between treatment groups could not be highlighted because of the limited power of the trial but, from what data we have, there is no indication that the number of arrests is less in the cognitive behavioural therapy plus psychosocial rehabilitation group over all the time periods. This also applies to the number of convictions and the number of days in jail.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 6: combined cognitive behavioural therapy + intensive case management versus treatment as usual</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>. All of the outcomes for this comparison were very low quality or the outcome was not measured. Again <LINK REF="STD-Maloney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Maloney 2006</LINK> reports useful outcomes relating to functioning in society but again the data are skewed and difficult to interpret. Unlike the preceding comparison, however, there is a suggestion that there may be some positive effect for people allocated to the cognitive behavioural therapy + intensive case management group. The number of arrests is less in the cognitive behavioural therapy + intensive case management group over all time periods, and this also applies to the number of convictions at 12 and 30 months. However, the number of days in jail for each group is not noticeably different. This may give some hope that the very intensive approach does have some benefit in terms of these important outcomes but, again, these findings from such a small study should be replicated before making any change in policy. Economic analyses would also be of interest for this package of care that is likely to be expensive.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 7: intensive case management versus treatment as usual</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-07" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 7</LINK>. All of the outcomes for this comparison were very low quality or the outcome was not measured. The intensive case management on its own did not produce results that give the impression of there being any major real effect in terms of functioning. Again, these skewed data are difficult to interpret and come from one small study (<LINK REF="STD-Maloney-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Maloney 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 8: motivational interviewing versus treatment as usual</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-08" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 8</LINK>. There was very low quality evidence of no difference between motivational interviewing and treatment as usual in terms of numbers lost to treatment (six months), lost to evaluation (12 months) or deaths (18 months). There was very low quality evidence of not abstaining from alcohol (6 months) or polydrug use (12 months).</P>
<P>There was very low quality evidence of no difference between motivational interviewing and treatment as usual in terms of mental state (SCL-90, three months) and average global functioning at 12 months. None of the trials measured general life satisfaction.</P>
<P>Some support was found for the effectiveness of motivational interviewing in reducing substance use, even though studies were generally small, interventions brief, and follow-up times shorter than for other comparisons. <LINK REF="STD-Graeber-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Graeber 2003</LINK> found that there was more likelihood that patients in the treatment group would abstain from alcohol after only three sessions of motivational interviewing; by three months and six months this increased. <LINK REF="STD-Bonsack-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bonsack 2011</LINK> reported that individual sessions of motivational interviewing for up to 6 months reduced the number of joints consumed at three and six months, but not at 12 months follow-up. Similarly, patients in the treatment group of <LINK REF="STD-Kavanagh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kavanagh 2004</LINK> showed they were more likely to be abstaining or had improved on all substances by 12 months after three hours of motivational interviewing over six to nine sessions. More patients in the treatment group of <LINK REF="STD-Swanson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 1999</LINK> attended their first aftercare appointment after one 15 minute and one one-hour session. <LINK REF="STD-Bechdolf-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Bechdolf 2011</LINK> also reported higher chances of attending outpatients over a period of six months. In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2002</LINK> reported little differences between groups after one 45 minute session, which was more apparent at 12 months than at three months when the treatment showed some benefit. <LINK REF="STD-Hickman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hickman 1997</LINK> showed little difference in mental state scores after one brief session. The results indicate that multiple sessions of motivational interviewing may lead to short-term reductions in substance use and increased attendance at outpatient appointments.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 9: skills training versus treatment as usual</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-09" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 9</LINK>. There was very low quality of evidence of no difference between skills training and treatment as usual in terms of numbers lost to treatment by 12 months. Death was not measured in any of the trials.

<P>Moreover, there was very low quality evidence of no difference between skills training and treatment as usual for mental state (relapse) at eight months and for global functioning at 12 months. Neither trial reported on general life satisfaction.</P>

<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-10" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 10</LINK>. All of the outcomes for this comparison were very low quality or the outcome was not measured. One small study (<LINK REF="STD-Godley-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Godley 1994</LINK>) presents data by site and, clearly, practice by site does differ considerably. There is not really a clear pattern in the data suggesting an effect, and where there is some suggestion of a difference between groups the data are based on very few people.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 11: integrated assertive community treatment versus assertive community treatment team versus standard care</HEADING>
<P>No 'Summary of findings' table was conducted for this comparison. All of the outcomes for this comparison were very low quality or the outcome was not measured. <LINK REF="STD-Morse-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Morse 2006</LINK> was a three-arm study with about 50 people in each arm. Interesting data were presented for important outcomes but all were continuous and skewed. None gave the impression of a real difference occurring between the two packages of care and the standard care. Again, considering the huge effort that must have gone into the integrated assertive community treatment and assertive community treatment, this might indicate how difficult this group of people are to treat, or how standard care has as good an effect as anything in terms of substance misuse and general housing outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 12: contingency management versus standard care</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="SOF-11" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 11</LINK>. There was low quality evidence of no difference between contingency management and treatment as usual in terms of numbers lost to treatment by three months. Death was not measured in any of the trials. There was also little evidence for differences in alcohol use (data skewed) or substance use (stimulant-positive urine tests) by six months.</P>
<P>Moreover, there was low quality evidence of no difference between contingency management and treatment as usual for mental state (number hospitalised) at six months. Neither trial reported on global assessment of functioning and general life satisfaction.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-McDonell-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McDonell 2013</LINK> reported fewer patients with a stimulant-positive urine at the end of treatment (three months) for the contingency management arm compared to standard care. However, by six months (three months post-treatment) this was no longer significant. Moreover, they also reported less injection use at the end of treatment (three months) for the active arm compared to standard care, and again this was no longer significant at six months. Over the six month trial, fewer patients in the contingency managed arm were hospitalised compared to standard care.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were conducted to ascertain if there were substantial differences in the results when lesser quality trials were excluded. There were relatively few trials to conduct the sensitivity analysis due to the small numbers of trials in each intervention and the large number of outcome measures at variable time points. There was no indication that trials of lesser quality or those recruiting patients with severe mental illness other than schizophrenia influenced the overall outcomes in this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:32:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many of the included studies were described as pilot studies which included small samples sizes. Fourteen trials involved more than 100 participants and two of these involved more than 200 participants after randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Barrowclough-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Barrowclough 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drake-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Drake 1998a</LINK>). However, the overall power for a particular common outcome and comparison was low due to the variety of interventions and outcomes measured.</P>
<P>Examination of the summary of findings indicates that several critical or important outcomes were not measured by any of the studies, and therefore no power exists. Future research could examine these comparisons in order to bring to light any potential benefits in the management of patients with a dual diagnosis.</P>
<P>The majority of studies presented medium-term data; with six months to one year follow-up. This is a reasonable length of time to assess differences in the intervention effects. Longer-term studies (one to three years) employed integrated and assertive community care interventions. These types of studies are important to engage patients in treatment programmes that help recovery from serious mental illness.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:32:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Primary outcome measures selected for this review were: remaining in treatment, substance use, and mental state. Pooled results demonstrated no consistent evidence to support any one treatment intervention over standard care. Some support for motivational interviewing was found from individual studies for substance use reduction. When motivational interviewing was offered in conjunction with cognitive behavioural therapy there was little support for improved mental state. These findings suggest that motivational interviewing is a crucial component to the effectiveness of treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy. However, it was challenging to identify the key aspects of each intervention given that these are mostly complex, multi-faceted interventions. Little attention was paid to reporting the fidelity of the delivery of each intervention.</P>
<P>A limitation of this review is that there was substantial variation between studies as to what constituted standard care, in addition to some differences between the interventions themselves. For example, fidelity, duration, and intensity of treatment conditions varied, furthermore the outcome reporting periods also differed. This resulted in difficulties in grouping and interpreting data. There was a high volume of problematic data due to skew, use of non-validated scales, or unclear reporting. Further high quality randomised trials are required which employ large samples, use validated and clinically relevant measures, and present data in a way that can be incorporated into a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>All study participants had a diagnosis of severe mental illness and substance misuse. Participants were from a wide range of settings, so the results of this review will be applicable to similar patients, particularly those in the USA, as trials from the USA (21) were included in all comparisons. Some generalisation can be assumed for the UK (three trials) and Australia (six trials) for cognitive behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing as the studies from these areas examined these interventions. Integrated, non-integrated, and skills training intervention findings may apply elsewhere only if the intervention is delivered in a similar manner. However, as there are differences between the USA and other countries' services, including education and training of health service staff, generalisation to other areas must be interpreted with caution (<LINK REF="REF-Donald-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donald 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lowe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tyrer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyrer 2004</LINK>). This is also true for resource-constrained settings. We did not identify any trials from low or middle income countries.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Missing outcomes or too few data</HEADING>
<P>Out of the primary outcome measures, studies only reported numbers lost to treatment clearly enough to allow pooling of results in each of the comparisons. Often the other primary outcome measures (substance use, mental state) were reported as continuous rather than binary data and much of these data were problematic. With this particular population, skewed data may be unavoidable and, as such, is problematic to present and manage in a meta-analysis. However, opportunities were missed to report simple and useful binary outcomes.</P>

<P>It is possible that we failed to identify small negative trials, and we would be most interested if readers know of these. We endeavoured to reduce this potential bias by conducting a wide search, duplicate extraction, multiple checking, and handsearching key references and journals. We also contacted many of the authors of these trials over the years, and for this review we asked if they knew of any recently completed or ongoing trials. The introduction of websites and journals to register trials hopefully will reduce the 'file drawer' phenomenon, as negative trials are less likely to be published.</P>
<P>It is possible that our consideration of these data have been biased by our foreknowledge of the past work (<LINK REF="REF-Cleary-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleary 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ley 2000</LINK>).

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-09-25 12:47:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is larger than the previous or original review (32 as opposed to 25 and six studies, respectively), although all three have similar results. The findings reveal no compelling evidence to support any one psychosocial treatment to reduce substance use or to improve mental state for people with severe mental illnesses. Some support for substance use reduction came from one small study assessing motivational interviewing, where more participants receiving this treatment abstained from alcohol. Further, more participants receiving motivational interviewing attended their first aftercare appointment. In combination with cognitive behavioural therapy, motivational interviewing also improved mental state, life satisfaction and social functioning. Little support was found for integrated, non-integrated, or skills training programmes being superior to standard care. A recent study (<LINK REF="STD-McDonell-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McDonell 2013</LINK>) reported reduced stimulant use in homeless people randomised to contingency management. This intervention was combined in another study (<LINK REF="STD-Bellack-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bellack 2006</LINK>) with motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy, with some positive outcomes.</P>
<P>However, methodological difficulties exist which hinder pooling and interpreting results and include high attrition rates; varying fidelity of interventions; varying outcome measures, settings and samples (sample size, participant level of substance use, motivation to change, diagnoses, age, gender, cultural, socioeconomic and contextual influences); and, in some cases, comparison groups may have received higher levels of treatment than usual standard care. Therefore, it is not yet possible to reach clear conclusions, although it is pleasing to see that the field is developing with an increase in high quality randomised controlled trials offering high-fidelity programmes and reporting more usable data. However, the largest trial to date (<LINK REF="STD-Barrowclough-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Barrowclough 2010</LINK>) did not find that motivational interviewing combined with cognitive behavioural therapy significantly improved patient outcomes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. For people with severe mental illness and substance misuse problems, and their carers</HEADING>
<P>People with both severe mental health and substance misuse problems should be aware that at present there is little evidence to support any particular psychosocial intervention over another. This does not mean that particular treatments do not help, but that data are few and the little supportive evidence found in these studies should be replicated. No-one can suggest to people entering a service that one form of support should really take precedence over another.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>Clinicians need to keep up-to-date on the latest research findings in this area because as new trials are published, the evidence base should rapidly build to support particular interventions for this challenging group of patients. Interventions for substance reduction may need to be further developed and adapted for people with a serious mental illness. Clinicians who seek to offer existing interventions over and above standard care should take the opportunity to work with trial researchers to generate useful data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. For policy makers and commissioners of care</HEADING>
<P>Developments in specific treatments and in models of service delivery are still taking place. While there is no evidence that the innovative integrated services that have been developed in the USA are helpful, conversely there is also no convincing evidence that they lead to a worse outcome. The development of such services may be unlikely in other countries, such as the UK where the general policy is to build on the existing links and to use mainstream services as far as possible (<LINK REF="REF-Seivewright-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seivewright 2005</LINK>). This may be a function of methodological problems within the studies or it may be that there is, in fact, no effect. Policies in this difficult area are needed. These policies should be either based on good evidence or in their implementation should generate the relevant evidence.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. General</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.1 Reporting of outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Only validated and non-adapted scales should be used in future trials. Clear reporting of data during treatment and at various follow-up periods with an indication that they meet the assumptions of the analyses undertaken would be helpful. Wherever possible, dichotomous data should be reported in addition to continuous data, as the use of outcomes such as retention in treatment, relapse, hospitalisation and abstinence rates are relevant to the topic and are preferable to reporting skewed data (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.2 Methodology</HEADING>
<P>Clear and strict adherence to the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turpin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turpin 2005</LINK>) for methodology and all outcomes should be the goal of future trials. A full description of the number of participants lost to treatment and evaluation after the randomisation process should be completed at each time point for both treatment arms. A clear description of the randomisation process and blinding is also not difficult and is now necessary. The use of intention-to-treat analysis can assist with minimising bias resulting from missing data. Double-blind evaluation of outcomes of psychosocial interventions is not possible due to the nature of the intervention. However, researchers should take every precaution to minimise the effect of bias by at least using raters blind to group assignment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Specific</HEADING>
<P>Consistent with our suggestions for more quality randomised controlled trials, other recently published reviews advocate a need for more consistent and methodologically rigorous trials on this topic to test both individual components and integrated programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Donald-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donald 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drake-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drake 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lubman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lubman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mueser-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mueser 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murthy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murthy 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tiet-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tiet 2007</LINK>). Also worth noting are recent treatment recommendations on psychosocial interventions for substance reduction modified for people with a mental illness (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dixon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dixon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Work-Group-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Work Group 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ziedonis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziedonis 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Future high quality trials in this area will contribute to the growing body of data and will allow future reviews to tease out findings. Assessing brief interventions (such as motivational interviewing) over standard care will allow the identification of cost-effective and easy to implement components that can be quickly integrated into standard care. New trials should aim to recruit sufficiently large sample sizes and collect data that can be reported and, if appropriate, synthesised in meta-analyses. Informed consent of participants should include statements that all anonymous data will be publicly available. The use of measurement scales should be of clinical value, in common use, and have demonstrated reliability and validity. We suggest a design for a future trial with the key methodological points highlighted in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. Future reviews may explore differences between subgroups (determined a priori), such as differences between levels of substance use (misuse versus dependence), differences between substances used, and differences between age groups (for example, first episode schizophrenia versus older patients).</P>

<P>1. We have added contingency management to the list of interventions as there were no studies with usable data until now. The authors feel that this is an area of research of fundamental value that merits inclusion as indicated by several ongoing trials using this intervention; and should not be overlooked.</P>
<P>2. The Schizophrenia CRG currently excludes studies that do not involve any patients with schizophrenia in reviews, and those studies that soley recruit patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder are no longer included. Consequently, search terms for depression and bipolar disorder have been dropped. We removed two studies from this 2013 update which were included in prior review updates as they did not conform to this new guideline.</P>
<P>3. Where the protocol did not define the primary outcome of interest, this update has specified primary and secondary outcomes - this decision was not influenced by examination of the results to date.</P>
<P>4. The addition of SOF (Summary of Findings) tables using GRADE criteria were included in this update to conform to the new format of Cochrane reviews.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>1. The Intensive Jail (IJ) group received a minimum of 3 weeks of specialised treatment during their qualifying incarceration. Housed in a mental observation dormitory, IJ was a hybrid of psychosocial rehabilitation, cognitive-behavioral, and harm reduction approaches. Individual supportive counselling twice per week, crisis intervention services and a series of 12 to 15 one-hour groups per week. Groups included 12 step sobriety maintenance, relapse prevention, symptom and medication management, crime prevention, parenting, and independent living. N=18.<BR/>2. The Intensive Community Treatment (IC). IC treatment approach provided intensive case management. Transition planning, which began while participants were still in custody and continued after release, consisted of housing placement, pursuit of public entitlements, linkage to psychiatric care, and transportation to pharmacy and residential placement post-release. In addition, on-going consultations to ensure continuity of care, and interventions aimed at substance recovery maintenance, relapse prevention, psychiatric stability and reduction of re-arrests were provided. IC treatment was carried out in conjunction with a number of community agencies, including those specializing in dual recovery, rehabilitation, housing, entitlement benefits, and childcare and parenting etc. N=58.<BR/>3. Combined treatment (COB) group received both intensive jail and intensive community interventions as described above. N=16.<BR/>4. Standard care.

<P>
<SUP>1</SUP> Risk of bias: Rated as SERIOUS: The single trial which reported on 12 month loss to treatment had adequate random generation and allocation concealment. However, we down-graded it for possible performance bias as participants and clinicians were not blinded. Detection bias was a low risk as outcome assessors were blinded.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP> Imprecision: Rated as SERIOUS: The event rate is low and the confidence interval is wide and includes the line of no effect and appreciable harm.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP> Risk of bias: Rated as SERIOUS: The three trials included in this meta-analysis were well-conducted. A lack of blinding is unlikely to affect measurement of death. However, attrition was &gt; 20% in all three trials and although missing data was balanced across groups, there is an unclear risk of bias due to attrition bias.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP> Risk of bias: Rated as SERIOUS: Random generation and allocation concealment were unclear and blinding was not possible for participants or clinicians. Attrition was high at 20% at 12 months, but missing outcome data was balanced between groups.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP> Imprecision: Rated as SERIOUS: The sample size is small and the confidence interval is wide.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP> Risk of bias: Rated as SERIOUS: The risk of attrition bias is unclear (22% across both groups at 18 months) despite missing outcome balanced between groups. A lack of blinding of participants and clinicians may result in performance bias.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP> Imprecision: Rated as VERY SERIOUS: The event rate is extremely low in this very small single trial (N = 36) and the confidence interval is wide.<BR/>
<SUP>8</SUP> Risk of bias: Rated as SERIOUS: Attrition was &gt; 20% in all four trials and although missing data was balanced across groups, there is an unclear risk of bias due to attrition bias.<BR/>
<SUP>9</SUP> Inconsistency: Rated as SERIOUS: Heterogeneity was present (ChiÂ² = 5.20, df = 3 (P = 0.16); IÂ² = 42%). One trial (Barrowclough) showed significant improvement in the treatment group compared with the others, but we were unable to explain the reason for this.<BR/>
<SUP>10</SUP> Imprecision: Rated as SERIOUS: Four trials provided data for this meta-analysis. The confidence interval is wide.<BR/>
<SUP>11</SUP> Risk of bias: Rated as SERIOUS: Blinding of participants and clinicians was not possible and performance bias may be a risk. Attrition was 25% at 6 months and missing data were not balanced across interventions. Missing outcomes are enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observed effect size.<BR/>

<P>
<SUP>1</SUP> Risk of bias: Rated as VERY SERIOUS: Although the random generation is reported as computer-generated the numbers in the arms vary. The report states that group sizes were not equivalent due to early jail releases, which necessitated the discontinuation of new participants being randomly assigned to the treatment groups after May 2003. Allocation concealment was not conducted. Blinding was not done and performance bias may be unclear and detection bias is high risk as the assessors were not blinded. There is a high risk of selective reporting bias as few outcomes are reported per arm and mainly by site.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP> Imprecision: Rated as SERIOUS: The sample size is small and any estimate of effect (had it been reported per arm) is likely to be imprecise.</P>

<SUP>1</SUP> Risk of Bias: Rated as VERY SERIOUS: This small study was conducted in 6 sites but only 2 sites were randomised. In these sites, the risk of selection bias was unclear as random generation and allocation concealment were not reported and performance and detection bias were unclear as blinding was not reported. Risk of attrition was high as loss to follow-up was 37% at 12 months and &gt; 50% at 18 months. There is a high risk of selective reporting bias as many results were reported per site rather than by randomised arms.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP> Imprecision: Rated as VERY SERIOUS: The sample size of the available denominators for the outcome of days of admission for the two randomised sites is very small (N = 36 and 28) and any estimate of effect is likely to be imprecise.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP> Inconsistency: Rated as SERIOUS: In one site there were fewer days in the specialised case management group (mean = 8.36 (SD: 22.36) vs 1.86 (SD: 4.20) and in the second site there were many more days in the specialised group (mean = 37.06 (SD: 40.50) vs 76.91 (SD: 110.34).</P>

<P>diagnosis-dual-psychiatry.mp (CINAHL, PsychINFO); dual diagnosis.mp (EBM Reviews); and schizo$ and (randomised or randomized) and (drug or substance).mp (Ovid Medline). Other searches included the phrases; (RCT or randomised or randomized) and (motivational or CBT or program or services) on (Ovid Medline)</P>
<P>1.3 ISI database - Social Sciences Citation Index<BR/>We sought each of the studies which went into the pool as a cited reference on the above database. Reports of articles that had cited these studies were then inspected in order to identify further trials.</P>
<P>1.4 We hand searched Schizophrenia Bulletin (January 1990 - December 1998) and British Journal of Psychiatry (October 1989 - December 1998).</P>
<P>1.5 Additional search strategy by current authors<BR/>For the 2007 update, we performed an additional search in 2006-2007. The previous draft (2004) yielded 13 studies, and the updated search yielded an additional 12 randomised controlled trials (n=25). The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register 19-05-06 found 65 new references since the last search on 02-11-2004. CENTRAL: The Cochrane Librarys register of Clinical Trials Substance Misuse Search 19-05-2006. It is worth noting that the word 'drug' generates a large number of false positives. It also makes the search technically difficult on large databases such as Medline and Embase. We undertook the EMBASE search without the word 'drug', as were searches of The Cochrane Library and the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register.</P>
<P>We undertook a further final search using the same search strategy as above in March 2007 during the study write-up by one of the authors [GH]. In addition, we searched for all authors listed in the included trials using Ovid Medline, PubMED and ISI Web of Science (citation search).</P>
<P>1.6 Reference lists<BR/>We inspected reference lists of all the studies and unpublished reports to identify any further relevant trials [MC, GH, SM] up until April 2007.</P>
<P>1.7 Personal contact<BR/>We contacted the authors of all studies initially selected for inclusion in order to identify further relevant trials. We simultaneously conducted a Delphi survey of opinion of informed professionals in the UK who had knowledge and experience of people with severe mental illness and substance misuse. As part of the recruitment letter, individuals were asked if they had conducted or knew of any ongoing, published or unpublished trials. We contacted authors, during November and December 2006, of research studies rated at risk of low, medium or high risk bias (A, B or C) to ascertain whether they knew of any relevant published, unpublished or currently ongoing trials [MC, GH, SM].</P>

<P>2.1. Selection of trials<BR/>In the initial draft of this review (2004), AL performed the search for trials (original version of review) and the preliminary update was carried out by MF. Nandi Siegfried (NS) inspected both included and excluded citations, in order to cross check according to the inclusion criteria. For the (2007) update, JW performed the search, updated by GH. We read the titles, abstracts and descriptor terms of all downloaded material from the electronic searches and discarded irrelevant reports. We (MC, GH, and SM) independently inspected all citations to establish relevance of the article and whether or not it should be acquired. Where doubt remained we sought further information from authors and added these trials to the list of those awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>2.2. Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>We allocated trials to one of three categories described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>) This system is based on the evidence of a strong relationship between the potential for bias in the results and allocation concealment (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). We included only those trials that stated they were randomised with randomisation methods described or implied (categories A or B, not C). When trials were included in the review, but provided no usable data for the analysis, we allocated these to Category D and did not assign them to an intervention. Where disagreement occurred regarding which category a trial should be allocated, we attempted to resolve this by discussion. If doubt remained we contacted authors for further information.</P>
<P>In this review, we included randomised controlled trials that did not ensure blinded participants, clinicians and outcome raters due to the nature of some self-report measures and the psychosocial treatments involved. However, we noted those randomised controlled trials which did not specify or which stated specifically that raters were not blind due to the possibility of bias in these studies (see Characteristics of Included Studies Table). We were not blind to the names of the authors, institutions, journal of publication or results of the trials.</P>
<P>2.3. Data extraction<BR/>We (MC, GH and SM) extracted data from the selected trials independently. Again, we resolved any disputes by discussion. When it was not possible to extract data, or further information was needed, we attempted to contact the authors.</P>
<P>2.4. Data synthesis<BR/>4.1 Data analysis<BR/>We analysed data using RevMan, The Cochrane Collaboration software for preparing and maintaining Cochrane reviews.</P>
<P>2.5 Incomplete data<BR/>Except for the analysis of lost to treatment, we did not use data from studies where overall attrition was greater than 50% because of the strong likelihood of bias.</P>
<P>2.6 Dichotomous/binary data<BR/>Due to expected high heterogeneity between studies, we used a standard estimation of the random effects risk ratio (RR) with the 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate.</P>
<P>2.7 Continuous data<BR/>2.7.1 Summary statistic: again, due to expected high heterogeneity, we estimated the weighted mean difference (MD) between groups using a random effects model.</P>
<P>2.7.2 Skewed data: continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, the following standards are applied to all data: (a) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; and (b) when a scale started from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); (c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), which can have values from 30 to 210), the calculation described above was modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases, skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. Many of the studies included in this review reported skewed data that fell outside of the above standards and as such were unable to be included in the analysis. We have, however, included skewed data in tables and have reported any significant results from non-parametric tests (e.g. Mann-Whitney) applied by the authors.</P>
<P>2.7.3 Valid scales: continuous data from rating scales were included only if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal and the instrument was either self-report or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). It has been shown that the use of rating scales which have not been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>) are associated with bias, therefore we excluded the results of such scales.</P>
<P>2.7.4 Change data: when continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change on a scale), there is no way of telling whether data are non-normally distributed (skewed) or not. It is thus preferable to use endpoint data, which typically cannot have negative values.</P>
<P>2.7.5 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ cluster randomisation (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a unit-of-analysis error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes Type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a design effect. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation co-efficient (ICC) [Design effect=1+ (m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intra-class correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, we synthesised these with other studies using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>2.8 Investigation for heterogeneity<BR/>Consideration of all the included studies within any comparison was undertaken to judge clinical heterogeneity. Visual inspection of graphs was used to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This was supplemented employing, the I-squared statistic which provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I-squared estimate was &gt;75%, this was interpreted as evidence of high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>2.9 Addressing publication bias<BR/>We aimed to enter data from all included trials into a funnel graph (trial effect versus trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias. We were unable to undertake this due to the very limited number of trials included in the analysis.</P>
<P>2.10 General<BR/>Where possible, we entered data into RevMan in such a way that the area to the left of the 'line of no effect' indicated a 'favourable' outcome for the psychosocial interventions. Where this was not possible, we labelled the graphs in MetaView accordingly so that the direction of any effects was clear.</P>

<P>Dual diagnosis is the name often given to people who have a severe mental health problem and a drug and/or alcohol problem as well. While the number of people with these problems varies, in some urban areas it can be over 50% of all those with mental health difficulties. Although individuals may feel they are self-medicating when using these substances, drugs and alcohol can have a detrimental effect on the symptoms of their illness, the way their medication works and their interaction with the wider world. They can also make people more vulnerable to suicide, hepatitis C, HIV and homelessness, and can cause them to be aggressive or to do something that moves them into the criminal justice system.</P>
<P>People who have a substance abuse problem but no mental health problem can be helped by a variety of interventions that look at their motivation for change (motivational interviewing - MI), how to adapt their behaviour by improving coping strategies (cognitive behavioural therapy - CBT), a supportive approach similar to the one used by Alcoholics Anonymous and skills training. These are all examples of psychosocial interventions. However, using these interventions on people with mental health problems is more complex, because it is unclear whether the intervention for the substance abuse should be offered with that for the mental health problem and whether the same team should be responsible for both (integrated intervention).</P>
<P>This review attempts to assess all trials using psychosocial interventions compared to care as usual where they are used to help those who have a substance abuse problem and a severe mental illness. Thirty-four studies were identified containing a total of 3397 people. Three trials were based in a hospital, 21 in the community, eight in hospital and the community and two in the community and in jail. They used different psychosocial interventions, with four trials using integrated models of care, four using non-integrated, seven combining MI and CBT, two using CBT, eight using MI, two using contingency management and two using skills training. Trials lasted from three months to three years. No trial showed any definitive difference between the psychosocial intervention and the usual treatment, although the difference in the study designs made it difficult to compare one trial to another. There are also problems caused by high dropout rates, differences in the outcome measures and dependability in the way psychological interventions were delivered. To allow more thorough assessment of whether psychosocial interventions work for people with substance abuse problems and severe mental illnesses, more high quality trials are needed which address these problems.</P>
