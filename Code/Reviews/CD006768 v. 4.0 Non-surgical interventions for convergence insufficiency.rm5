<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-09 10:05:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-02-09 02:06:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Convergence insufficiency is a common binocular vision disorder (eye muscle co-ordination problem) in which the eyes have a strong tendency to drift outward (exophoria) when reading or doing close work. As a result the eyes do not converge adequately and this condition may lead to symptoms including eye strain, headaches, double vision, print moving on the page, frequent loss of place when reading, inability to concentrate, and short attention span. Convergence insufficiency is diagnosed when exophoria is greater at near than at distance and the patient has one or both of the following: a remote near point of convergence or decreased positive fusional vergence.</P>
<P>There is considerable variability in the reported prevalence of convergence insufficiency. The estimates of prevalence based on population studies range from 2.25% to 8.3% (<LINK REF="REF-Letourneau-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Letourneau 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Letourneau-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Letourneau 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Porcar-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porcar 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rouse-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rouse 1999</LINK>). There is a paucity of data regarding whether the prevalence of convergence insufficiency varies by ethnicity, race, age, sex, geographic location, or socioeconomic status.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-02-09 10:05:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Various non-surgical treatments are prescribed for treating convergence insufficiency including base-in prism reading glasses, home-based convergence exercises (or pencil push-ups as used in the US), home-based vision therapy/orthoptics, and outpatient (or office-based as used in the US) vision therapy/orthoptics (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gallaway-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallaway 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griffin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grisham-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grisham 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hugonnier-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hugonnier 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pratt_x002d_Johnson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pratt-Johnson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Press-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Press 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheiman-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheiman 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheiman-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheiman 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-von-Noorden-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Noorden 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-von-Noorden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Noorden 1996</LINK>). Although surgery is a potential treatment option for convergence insufficiency, it is rarely used because of the comparative invasive nature of surgery with its potential complications.  </P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Base-in prism reading glasses</HEADING>
<P>There are various methods for determining the amount of prism to prescribe (<LINK REF="REF-Scheiman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheiman 2008</LINK>). In a Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial (CITT) trial of children nine to 17 years of age (<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005a</LINK>), the investigators prescribed prism based on Sheard's Criterion (<LINK REF="REF-Sheard-1930" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheard 1930</LINK>). This criterion states that the magnitude of the prism should be sufficient to insure that the compensatory fusional vergence is equal to twice the magnitude of the phoria. The adult base-in prism study (<LINK REF="STD-Teitelbaum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Teitelbaum 2009</LINK>) based the prescription of prism on the associated phoria measurement.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Home-based convergence exercises</HEADING>
<P>The home-based convergence exercises are described by Duke-Elder (<LINK REF="REF-Duke_x002d_Elder-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duke-Elder 1973</LINK>). "Exercises to improve the near point of convergence are carried out simply by the subject holding a target at arm's length and then gradually bringing it towards the eye, all the time maintaining bifoveal fixation. These exercises should be carried out several times each day for a few minutes." Use of a target providing physiological diplopia is often recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Hugonnier-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hugonnier 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Press-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Press 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheiman-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheiman 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheiman-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheiman 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-von-Noorden-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Noorden 2001</LINK>). Recent studies surveying the ophthalmic community suggest that home-based convergence exercises is the most commonly prescribed treatment by both ophthalmologists and optometrists (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheiman-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheiman 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheiman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheiman 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In two CITT trials (<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005c" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CITT-2008" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2008</LINK>), the home-based convergence exercises procedures (referred to as pencil push-ups in the trials) used a pencil with 20/60 size letters and a white index card placed in the background to provide a suppression check by using physiological diplopia awareness. The goal of the procedure was to move the pencil to within 2 cm to 3 cm of the brow, just above the nose on each push up while trying to keep the target single and clear. Patients were instructed to perform the pencil push-ups procedure 15 minutes per day, five days per week. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Home-based computer vergence/accommodative therapy</HEADING>
<P>Some clinicians recommend home-based therapy that is more intensive than pencil push-ups (<LINK REF="REF-Scheiman-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheiman 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheiman-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheiman 2002b</LINK>). Additional home-based techniques include the use of prism, stereoscopes, and computer software programs designed for vision therapy/orthoptics (<LINK REF="REF-Scheiman-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheiman 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheiman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheiman 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the large-scale CITT trial (<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2008" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2008</LINK>) patients in this group were taught to perform the aforementioned pencil push-up procedure as well as procedures on the Home Therapy System (HTS/CVS; <A HREF="http://www.visiontherapysolutions.com">www.visiontherapysolutions.com</A>) computer software. Using this program, the patients performed fusional vergence and accommodative therapy procedures. These procedures were designed to improve convergence and divergence amplitudes and accommodative ability. Patients were instructed to do pencil push-ups five minutes per day and the HTS software program for 15 minutes per day.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outpatient vision therapy/orthoptics</HEADING>
<P>Outpatient vision therapy/orthoptics involves a sequence of activities prescribed and monitored by an eye care professional to develop efficient visual skills. It incorporates purposeful, controlled manipulation of target blur, disparity, and proximity, with the aim of normalizing the accommodative and vergence systems and their mutual interactions (<LINK REF="REF-Ciuffreda-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciuffreda 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In two CITT trials (<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CITT-2008" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2008</LINK>), patients in the outpatient (referred to as office-based in the trials) vergence/accommodative therapy group received weekly 60-minute in-office therapy with additional prescribed procedures to be performed at home for 15 minutes a day, five days per week. At each office-based therapy session, the patient performed four to five procedures with constant supervision and guidance from the therapist. The therapist followed a detailed and specific protocol from the CITT Manual of Procedures (accessed at <A HREF="http://www.optometry.osu.edu/research/CITT/4363.cfm">www.optometry.osu.edu/research/CITT/4363.cfm</A>); this document describes each procedure, amount of time used, expected performance, and criteria for ending the procedure and advancing to a more difficult level.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-02-09 08:40:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The two main categories of intervention for convergence insufficiency are base-in reading glasses and vision therapy/orthoptics. Vision therapy/orthoptics can be subdivided into convergence exercises (i.e., pencil push-ups), more intensive home-base vision therapy/orthoptics, and outpatient vision therapy/orthoptics, as described above.</P>
<P>Patients with convergence insufficiency are often symptomatic because they need to use excessive convergence to compensate for high exophoria at near. Base-in prism reading glasses are believed to work by relieving the need to use this excessive convergence, thereby relieving discomfort. While the exact mechanism is not known for how vision therapy works, the hypothesis is that vision therapy increases positive fusional vergence and convergence ability, thereby relieving the symptoms associated with convergence insufficiency.</P>
<P>The three vision therapy/orthoptics treatment approaches (home-based convergence exercises, home-based computer vergence/accommodative therapy, and outpatient vision therapy/orthoptics) differ in: 1) ability to control/manipulate stimulus parameters; 2) dosage; 3) mode of administration; 4) use of motor learning theory and patient feedback; and 5) cost.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Controlling/manipulating stimulus parameters</HEADING>
<P>To increase fusional vergence amplitudes a therapy procedure must either maintain accommodation at the plane of regard and change the vergence stimulus, or maintain vergence at the plane of regard and change the stimulus to accommodation (<LINK REF="REF-Scheiman-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheiman 2002b</LINK>). Instrumentations using a variety of stimuli are available that allow manipulation of these variables to create a vergence demand that is appropriate for an individual patient.</P>
<P>The three vision therapy/orthoptics treatment approaches described above vary significantly in their ability to allow the manipulation of stimulus parameters. With home-based convergence exercises, the stimulus is a small letter on a pencil that is moved closer to the patient. To maintain single vision, a combination of proximal, accommodative, and fusional vergence is used with accommodation and convergence synchronized. In contrast, outpatient vision therapy/orthoptics uses a wide variety of instrumentation that is designed to improve the dynamics of the fusional vergence and accommodative systems, typically using stimuli that require an accommodative demand different from the vergence demand. Hence, fusional vergence must be used while proximal and accommodative vergence is minimized. Home-based convergence exercises plus computer-based vergence/accommodative therapy provides an intermediate level of manipulation of the vergence/accommodative relationship, but lacks the variety of stimuli available with outpatient vergence/accommodative therapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Dosage</HEADING>
<P>More time is generally spent in outpatient vision therapy/orthoptics than either home-based option. In all three therapy approaches the patient must practice procedures at home. In the outpatient treatment there is an additional 60 minutes per week of therapy in the doctor's office. Total therapy time prescribed tends to be least with home-based convergence exercises and most with outpatient vision therapy/orthoptics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Mode of administration</HEADING>
<P>In outpatient vision therapy/orthoptics a trained therapist administers the treatment, providing the patient with motivation and feedback regarding performance and varying procedures based on the patient's progress. In the two home-based vision therapy/orthoptics approaches, close supervision from a trained therapist is not available, although parents are expected to supervise children prescribed this therapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Motor learning principles and patient feedback</HEADING>
<P>Learning is a set of internal processes associated with practice or experience that results in a relatively permanent change in responding (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 1988</LINK>). These processes are believed to be central nervous system phenomena in which sensory and motor information is organized and integrated (<LINK REF="REF-Aikon-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aikon 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arbib-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arbib 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lisberger-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lisberger 1988</LINK>) with an ultimate goal of transferring the motor learning outside of the therapy setting.</P>
<P>For motor learning, numerous variables are considered important determinants. These include use of feedback, modeling and demonstration, transfer of training, part to whole task practice, variability in practice, and positive reinforcement. Of the three therapy approaches, outpatient vision therapy/orthoptics uses these principles of motor learning and patient feedback most frequently and consistently (<LINK REF="REF-Birnbaum-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birnbaum 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheiman-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheiman 2002b</LINK>).</P>

<P>Although various treatments are prescribed for patients with convergence insufficiency there is a lack of consensus regarding the most effective treatment. Significant differences exist in the time commitment for the patient, number of office visits, cost, and complexity of the treatment. A systematic review of clinical trials will help summarize the available evidence on the effectiveness of interventions for patients with convergence insufficiency and will help clinicians select the most appropriate treatments for patients with this condition.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of participants</HEADING>
<P>We included six trials with a total of 475 participants with convergence insufficiency. All six trials were conducted in the United States. The trials varied in size with the smallest enrolling 29 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Teitelbaum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Teitelbaum 2009</LINK>) and the largest enrolling 221 participants (<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2008" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2008</LINK>). Four of the six trials were conducted by the Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial (CITT) Study Group (<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005c" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CITT-2008" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2008</LINK>). These four CITT trials randomized 81.3% (386/475) of all participants included in this systematic review. Symptomatic convergence insufficiency was defined consistently across the four CITT trials and the eligibility criteria were comparable. Of the remaining trials, <LINK REF="STD-Birnbaum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Birnbaum 1999</LINK> enrolled 60 adult male participants from a Veterans Medical Center, and <LINK REF="STD-Teitelbaum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Teitelbaum 2009</LINK> enrolled 29 patients affected by presbyopia (a condition in which the lens of the eye loses its ability to focus, making it difficult to see objects up close) from a private practice.</P>
<P>We found clinical heterogeneity in several aspects, mainly in the age distribution of trial participants. Three trials were conducted in children nine to 17 or 18 years old (<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CITT-2008" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2008</LINK>); one trial was conducted in adults 19 to 30 years old (<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005c" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005c</LINK>); the remaining two trials were conducted in adults aged 40 years or older (<LINK REF="STD-Birnbaum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Birnbaum 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Teitelbaum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Teitelbaum 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Birnbaum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Birnbaum 1999</LINK> did not report explicitly the baseline characteristics of included participants.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005b</LINK> included participants with higher accommodative amplitude (a measurement of the eye's ability to focus clearly on objects at near distances) and less exophoria at distance than the other three trials. The lower accommodation is due to the age difference since accommodation is indirectly related to age. The baseline refractive error also varied across trials.</P>
<P>Because of potential differences in accommodation and accommodative vergence with aging, it is important to analyze findings for children separately from young adults and presbyopes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of test interventions and comparison interventions</HEADING>
<P>The included trials evaluated a variety of interventions, including passive treatment with base-in prism reading glasses, and active treatments such as a specific outpatient vision therapy/orthoptics called office-based vergence/accommodative therapy, home-based convergence exercises, home-based computer vergence/accommodative therapy plus convergence exercises, and placebo or sham procedures. The interventions and comparison interventions are described in detail in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table and <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. We kept the same terms that were used in the trials to refer to each intervention (e.g., instead of convergence exercises, we used pencil push-ups to describe the intervention tested in the CITT trials).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005a</LINK> randomly assigned 72 children nine to18 years of age with symptomatic convergence insufficiency to wear either base-in prism reading glasses or placebo reading glasses. Patients assigned to base-in prism reading glasses received glasses that corrected for the patient's refractive error, when necessary, and base-in prism. Patients in the placebo reading glasses group received glasses that corrected their refractive error, or plano lenses for those who did not require refractive correction. Patients were asked to wear these glasses for all reading and near tasks requiring more than five minutes for six weeks.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Teitelbaum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Teitelbaum 2009</LINK> randomly assigned 29 presbyopic patients aged 45 to 68 years with symptomatic convergence insufficiency to either base-prism in a progressive addition lens or progressive addition lenses with no prism. Participants wore each pair of glasses for three weeks and completed the CISS at the end of three weeks.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005b</LINK> was considered as a pilot study by the CITT Study Group. In this study, 47 children were randomly assigned to receive a 12-week program of home-based pencil push-ups, office-based vision therapy/orthoptics, or office-based placebo therapy. The same treatment modalities were further tested in 46 adults in <LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005c" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005c</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2008" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2008</LINK> randomly assigned 221 children to receive a 12-week program of home-based pencil push-ups, home-based computer vergence/accommodative therapy plus pencil push-ups, office-based vergence/accommodative therapy with home reinforcement, or office-based placebo therapy. The home-based computer vergence/accommodative therapy plus pencil push-ups group was considered a more intensive regimen than pencil push-ups alone, sometimes used by both ophthalmologists and optometrists. The other three treatment modalities were essentially the same as those in the aforementioned CITT trials.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Birnbaum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Birnbaum 1999</LINK> randomly assigned 60 male adult patients to receive office-based vision therapy/orthoptics with supplemental home therapy, home vision therapy, or no treatment.

<P>The four CITT Study Group trials and <LINK REF="STD-Teitelbaum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Teitelbaum 2009</LINK> used a consistent method to measure outcomes.</P>
<P>The primary outcome measure for four CITT trials was the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS) V-15 (<LINK REF="REF-Borsting-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borsting 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005a</LINK> measured the primary outcome after six weeks of therapy, and the other three CITT trials (<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005c" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CITT-2008" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2008</LINK>) measured the primary outcome after 12 weeks of therapy. Secondary outcome measures in these four trials were near point of convergence and positive fusional vergence at near. <LINK REF="STD-Teitelbaum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Teitelbaum 2009</LINK> measured symptoms with CISS V-15 after three weeks of therapy.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Birnbaum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Birnbaum 1999</LINK> did not specify the primary or secondary outcome, although the author reported "success" and "failure" for each individual participant on the basis of improvement shown with respect to the asthenopia (eye strain) and functional criteria.</P>

<P>Two of the six trials included in the review reported data for the comparison between base-in prism reading glasses and other reading glasses; the remaining four trials reported data for the comparisons between various types of vision therapy (office- and home-based vision therapy/orthoptics).

<P>We reported difference in change scores between two arms whenever possible except for Analysis 2, where only follow-up values were available to us. Patients with more severe signs and symptoms would have higher baseline values for the CISS score and near-point of convergence, and a lower value for positive fusional vergence at near. If an intervention is effective, one would expect CISS score and near-point of convergence go from a higher value to a lower value, while positive fusional vergence at near goes from a lower to a higher value. To facilitate interpretation of the treatment effect based on a difference in change scores between two arms, change in near-point of convergence and CISS score was defined as baseline value minus follow-up value, and change in positive fusional vergence at near was defined as follow-up value minus baseline value. Using this definition, if the test intervention is more effective than the comparison intervention, all three estimates would be greater than 0.</P>

In the base-in prism study (<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005a</LINK>) compliance was assessed by asking the patient "What percentage of the time did you wear the glasses we gave you while you were reading or doing near work (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%)?" The child was also asked "How sure are you about this answer (very sure, pretty sure, somewhat sure, a little sure, not sure at all)?" Parents were asked the same questions about their child's wearing of the reading glasses. In the base-in prism group, 90% of patients reported wearing their glasses at least 75% of the prescribed time and 81% of parents said their child wore his or her glasses at least 75% of the prescribed time. There was agreement between child and parent on percentage of time worn for 55% of the responses. In the placebo group, 79% of patients reported wearing their glasses at least 75% of the prescribed time and 79% of parents said their child wore his or her glasses at least 75% of the prescribed time. Patient and parent agreed on the percentage of time the placebo glasses were worn 42% of the time. Reported wearing time was not statistically different between the two reading glasses groups using the patients' (P = 0.18) or parents' responses (P = 0.24).</P>
<P>In the three studies in which office- and home-based vision therapy/orthoptics were evaluated, the therapist asked the patient questions about the home-based treatment component and then answered the following question on the CITT follow-up form "What percent of the time do you feel the patient adhered to the treatment protocol?" The choices were: 0%, 1% to 24%, 25% to 49%, 50% to 74%, 75% to 99% or 100%.</P>
<P>In the CITT pilot study (<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005b</LINK>), there were no differences in the therapist's assessment of patient compliance between the three treatment groups at any visit. After 12 weeks of treatment, the therapists estimated that 73% of patients in the office-based vision therapy/orthoptics group, 92% of patients in the placebo office-based vision therapy/orthoptics group, and 73% of the patients in the pencil push-ups group were performing their home therapy at least 75% of the time (Kruskal-Wallis P = 0.3454). </P>
<P>In the larger CITT study (<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2008" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2008</LINK>), at 12 weeks the percentage of CITT patients rated by therapists as compliant with the home therapy protocol at least 75% of the time was 67.3% in the home-based computer therapy group, 84.9% in the pencil push-ups group, 87% in the office-based placebo group, and 91.4% in the office-based vision therapy group. Accounting for the observed differences in estimated adherence did not affect the results of the treatment group comparisons for symptom score, near point of convergence, and positive fusional vergence.</P>

<P>The cost of materials and equipment is lowest for home-based pencil push-ups and estimated to be equivalent for base-in prism reading glasses, home-based computer vision therapy/orthoptics, and office-based vision therapy/orthoptics. If office visits are considered, costs are expected to be highest for office-based vision therapy/orthoptics, followed by home-based vision therapy/orthoptics and least expensive for base-in reading glasses. Although cost analysis data were not reported from any of the studies, it is possible to estimate the cost of office-based vision therapy/orthoptics, the most effective treatment option based on findings from this systematic review. The office visit fee varies from $75 to $100 per session across regions in the United States. Twelve sessions would, therefore, cost about $900 to $1200 per patient. Office-based vision therapy/orthoptics is a covered service by most insurance companies in the United States. The direct patient cost would be reduced significantly depending on insurance coverage.</P>

<P>This systematic review aimed to identify and synthesize available RCT evidence on the effectiveness of various non-surgical treatments for symptomatic convergence insufficiency in children and adults.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Summary of main results in children</HEADING>
<P>The CITT Study Group, a group of almost 100 investigators (optometrists, pediatric ophthalmologists, and orthoptists), completed four randomized clinical trials (all assessed as having low potential for bias) in recent years investigating the effectiveness of non-surgical treatments for convergence insufficiency in children. Treatments evaluated included both passive therapy (base-in prism reading glasses) and active therapy (office or home-based vision therapy/orthoptics).</P>
<P>In this systematic review, evidence from the CITT clinical trials suggests that office-based vision therapy/orthoptics with home reinforcement is more effective than home-based pencil push-ups and home-based computer vision therapy/orthoptics for improving both the clinical signs and symptoms of children with symptomatic convergence insufficiency. Base-in prism was found to be no more effective than placebo reading glasses for improving either clinical signs or symptoms.</P>
<P>The evidence also shows that home-based computer vision therapy/orthoptics was more effective than home-based pencil push-ups for improving near point of convergence and positive fusional vergence. However, home-based computer vision therapy/orthoptics was no more effective than home-based pencil push-ups for improving symptoms. In fact, neither home-based treatment option was more effective than placebo treatment for improving symptoms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Summary of main results in adults</HEADING>
<P>Data from three clinical trials were available for the adult population. However, only one of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005c" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005c</LINK>) was graded at low risk of bias. The other two (<LINK REF="STD-Birnbaum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Birnbaum 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teitelbaum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Teitelbaum 2009</LINK>) were graded at high risk of bias. In <LINK REF="STD-Teitelbaum-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Teitelbaum 2009</LINK>, base-in prism progressive addition lenses were more effective than placebo glasses for improving symptoms in presbyopic adults. Because the authors used a lens design that is not commercially available the ability to generalize their data is limited.</P>
<P>The two clinical trials of adults studied heterogeneous populations. The CITT study of adults (<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005c" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005c</LINK>) included young adults (19 to 30 years of age, mean age 24.4), while the <LINK REF="STD-Birnbaum-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Birnbaum 1999</LINK> included older adults only (40 and older, mean age 63.9 years).</P>
<P>Evidence from <LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005c" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005c</LINK> suggests that office-based vision therapy/orthoptics with home reinforcement is more effective than home-based pencil push-ups, and office-based placebo therapy/orthoptics for improving both the clinical signs of young adults with symptomatic convergence insufficiency. There was no difference among treatment groups for reducing symptoms in these patients. The trial investigators speculated (<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005c" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005c</LINK>) that perhaps young adults in college or in the work force spend more time reading or on computers; and/or experience more non-visually related symptoms that mimic symptoms tested on the CISS. Evidence for this speculation exists in the higher mean scores for patients 19 to 30 years compared to those patients nine to18 years and in the higher cut-point for an asymptomatic score on the CISS V-15.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Placebo effect</HEADING>
<P>Could the improvement in the office-based vision therapy/orthoptics group be due to patient-provider interaction or the patient's belief in the effectiveness of the treatment in the absence of full masking? The placebo effect is viewed as a change in a patient's condition or symptoms attributable to the symbolic aspect of a treatment and not to any specific pharmacologic or physiologic properties (<LINK REF="REF-Brody-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brody 1985</LINK>). Placebo response rates for a variety of medical conditions have been reported to range from15% to 58% with an average placebo effectiveness of 35% (<LINK REF="REF-Beecher-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beecher 1955</LINK>). While this rate is similar to the effectiveness rates found in the CITT office-based placebo therapy and placebo glasses groups, it is unknown how much of the effect in these groups was from the placebo effect versus regression to the mean and/or natural history of the disease because a no-treatment control group was not included. The effect sizes for all three outcome measures were large between the office-based vision therapy/orthoptics and placebo groups. Therefore, the presence of the office-based placebo group provide strong evidence for a real treatment effect with office-based vision therapy/orthoptics.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-01-10 20:28:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The four CITT clinical trials, graded at low risk of bias, used a consistent definition of convergence insufficiency, and consistent outcome measures. The most commonly prescribed clinical treatments were evaluated in these trials leading to high quality evidence that can be applied in clinical practice, particularly for children with symptomatic convergence insufficiency. Only one of the four CITT trials enrolled adult participants. This small trial was limited to participants aged between 19 and 30 years old (<LINK REF="STD-CITT-2005c" TYPE="STUDY">CITT 2005c</LINK>). Thus, the completeness and applicability of the evidence is limited for the adult population. In addition, the length of the treatment was purposely limited to 12 weeks in the four CITT trials because of the ethical and logistical challenges of successfully following a group of symptomatic patients in a placebo group. Thus, findings from these trials do not reveal the maximum treatment effect that could be achieved with the various treatments. Finally, none of the included trials reported changes in reading, attention, quality of life, or the cost utility of the various treatments for convergence insufficiency.</P>

<P>Findings from our systematic review are consistent with findings from recent narrative reviews on the same topic (<LINK REF="REF-Cacho-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cacho 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheiman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheiman 2009</LINK>).

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-02-09 10:36:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>This systematic review provides an up-to-date summary of the best available evidence for doctors, patients, and other decision makers about the effectiveness of various non-surgical interventions for symptomatic convergence insufficiency in children and adults. Current research suggests that office-based vision therapy/orthoptics is more effective than home-based pencil push-ups or home-based computer vision therapy/orthoptics for children. Evidence is less consistent for the adult population.</P>
<P>Evidence from the included trials suggests that:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Office-based vision therapy/orthoptics is more effective than either home-based pencil push-ups or home-based computer vergence/accommodative therapy in children and young adults.</LI>
<LI>Home-based computer vergence/accommodative therapy may provide greater improvement in positive fusional vergence than home-based pencil push-ups.</LI>
<LI>Base-in prism reading glasses are no more effective than placebo glasses in children.</LI>
<LI>Base-in reading glasses may be an effective treatment for symptomatic convergence insufficiency in presbyopic patients.</LI>
</UL>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-01-05 18:37:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review identified key gaps in research including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Would a longer duration of office- and home-based therapies have been effective in a higher percentage of children?</LI>
<LI>Are certain office-based vergence/accommodative therapy procedures more effective than others in treating convergence insufficiency? Is there an office-based therapy program that would be equally as effective or perhaps even more effective but could be administered for a shorter duration?</LI>
<LI>Would a protocol that more closely monitors and encourages adherence affect the outcome for home-based computer vergence/accommodative therapy groups?</LI>
<LI>Are there different home-based therapy combinations (e.g., computer therapy combined with therapy procedures such as loose prism or free-space fusion cards rather than pencil push-ups) and/or a modified computer therapy program that might be more effective than the combined computerized therapy and pencil push-up approach that has been prescribed?</LI>
<LI>Is there a better method of prescribing prism, such as based on fixation disparity testing, that might be more effective in reducing symptoms of convergence insufficiency?</LI>
<LI>What effect does successful treatment of symptomatic convergence insufficiency have on various aspects of reading performance?</LI>
<LI>What effect does the successful treatment of convergence insufficiency have on behavior rating scales in children with convergence insufficiency and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder whose behaviors are still an issue despite medical management for the latter?</LI>
<LI>What exactly is the cost utility of each of the various treatments for convergence insufficiency?</LI>

<P>Patients assigned to this group were scheduled for 24 weekly 45 minute office-based therapy sessions (some patients discharged earlier, once their treatment was successfully concluded; some patients required somewhat longer treatment periods). The office therapy procedures typically used include series of eye movement procedures and binocular fusion procedures. Procedures were assigned for practice at home to supplement office therapy.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Intervention regimen #2: home therapy group</LI>
</UL>
<P>Patients were seen for one office visit for instruction on the home therapy procedures. The home therapy procedures include four-corner oculomotor calisthenic fixations; Brock string; eccentric circles base-in and base-out; red-green lifesaver cards, base-in and base-out; and pointer-straw.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Intervention regimen #3: control group</LI>
</UL>
<P>Patients were given a handout "Care of Your Eyes" (which was also given to patients in the two treatment groups). This handout provided general information on ocular health, but provided no specific information relative to convergence insufficiency.</P>

<P>Patients in this group received glasses that corrected for the patient&#8217;s refractive error, if necessary, and base-in prism. The amount of prism was based on the minimum amount necessary to meet Sheard&#8217;s criterion with no less than 1 D prescribed. To determine the amount of prism necessary to achieve this relationship he proposed the following formula: prism to be prescribed = 2/3 phoria -1/3 compensating fusional vergence. The amount of prism was rounded up to the nearest half prism diopter and split equally between the two eyes if the magnitude exceeded 1 D. The patient was asked to wear these glasses for all reading and near tasks requiring more than 5 minutes.</P>

<LI>Intervention regimen #1: pencil push-ups</LI>
</UL>
<P>Patients in the pencil push-ups group were taught a pencil push-up procedure that included monitoring for suppression. Patients were instructed to hold a pencil at arm&#8217;s length directly between their eyes, and an index card, serving as a suppression control, was placed on the wall 6 to 8 feet away. Patients were instructed to look at the very tip of the sharpened pencil and to try and keep the pencil point single while moving it toward their nose. If one of the cards in the background disappeared, patients were instructed to stop moving the pencil and blink their eyes until both cards were present. Patients were told to continue moving the pencil slowly toward their nose until it could no longer be kept single and then to try and get the pencil point back into one. If patients were able to regain single vision, they were asked to continue moving the pencil closer to their nose. If patients could not get the pencil back to one, they were instructed to start the procedure again. Patients were instructed to do three sets of 20 pencil push-ups per day at home, 5 days per week for 12 weeks, and this treatment required an average of 15 minutes per day. Prior to doing the procedure at home, children had to demonstrate their understanding and ability to perform the procedure according to protocol.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Intervention regimen #2: office-based vision therapy/orthoptics</LI>

<P>The vision therapy/orthoptics group received therapy administered by a trained therapist during a weekly, 60-minute office visit, with additional procedures to be performed at home for 15 minutes a day, five times per week for 12 weeks. The items are listed in the article. In addition, treatment procedures were practiced at home. During a typical office-based treatment session, the patient practiced four to five procedures with constant supervision and guidance from the therapist. There were no diagnostic tests performed during these sessions. The therapist followed a very detailed and specific CITT protocol from the manual of procedures, which described the proper treatment technique, amount of time the technique was to be used, expected performance, and criteria for ending the procedure and advancing to a more difficult level.</P>

<LI>Intervention regimen #1: home-based pencil push-ups</LI>
</UL>
<P>The pencil push-ups procedure involved using a pencil with 20/60 reduced Snellen letters and a white index card placed in the background to provide a suppression check by using physiological diplopia awareness. The goal of the procedure was to move the pencil to within 2 to 3 cm of the brow, just above the nose on each push-up while trying to keep the target single and clear. Patients were instructed to perform the pencil push-ups procedure 15 minutes per day, 5 days per week. They maintained home therapy logs, recording the closest distance that they could maintain fusion after each 5 minutes of therapy.</P>

</UL>
<P>Patients in this group were taught to perform the pencil push-up procedure as well as procedures on the Home Therapy System/Computerized Vergence System (HTS/CVS) computer software system (Computer Orthoptics, Gold Canyon, Arizona). Using this program, they performed fusional vergence and accommodative therapy procedures, including vergence base-in, vergence base out, autoslide vergence, and jump ductions vergence programs using random-dot stereopsis targets. The accommodative rock program was used for accommodative therapy. Much like a clinician would do at each follow-up visit, this computer program automatically modified the therapy program after each session based on the patient&#8217;s performance. Patients were instructed to do pencil push-ups 5 minutes per day, 5 days per week, and the HTS software program for 15 minutes per day, 5 days per week, and to save their data on a disk provided by the study and to bring the disk to each follow-up visit.</P>

The therapist followed a detailed and specific protocol from the CITT manual of procedures (<A HREF="http://optometry.osu.edu/research/CITT/4363.cfm">http://optometry.osu.edu/research/CITT/4363.cfm</A>); this document describes each procedure, amount of time procedure was performed, expected performance, and criteria for ending the procedure and advancing to a more difficult level.</P>

<LI>Intervention regimen #4: office-based placebo therapy with home reinforcement</LI>
</UL>
<P>Patients in the OBPT group received therapy during a weekly 60-minute office visit and were prescribed procedures to be performed at home for 15 minutes per day, 5 days per week. The placebo therapy program consisted of 16 in-office therapy procedures and 4 home therapy procedures, which were designed to look like real vergence/accommodative therapy procedures yet not to stimulate vergence, accommodation, or fine saccadic eye movement skills beyond normal daily visual activities. The therapist followed a detailed protocol from the CITT manual of procedures. Five procedures were performed during each office therapy visit and 2 procedures were assigned for home therapy each week. Objectives and goals were established for each placebo procedure to simulate real therapy. For motivational purposes, the therapist told the patient the objective of each procedure before beginning the technique.</P>
