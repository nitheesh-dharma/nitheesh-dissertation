<P>Too little evidence from trials to show whether women have less pain if they have ultrasound treatment for perineal pain after childbirth.</P>
<P>A woman's perineum (area between the vagina and anus) may bruise, tear or be artificially cut (episiotomy) during childbirth. This may cause perineal pain or pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), sometimes lasting more than a year. Ultrasound treatment involves using a probe to apply sound waves onto the woman's perineal area. The review of trials found too little evidence to show whether women have less perineal pain or dyspareunia if they have ultrasound treatment for pain. There is some evidence from studies that it may be beneficial, but further research is needed.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-01-22 16:38:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Ultrasound refers to sound waves (above 16 to 18 kHz) that are not audible to the human ear. It can be used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Therapeutic ultrasound using frequencies up to 3 MHz are used clinically to promote healing. 'In vivo' and 'in vitro' studies of the early application of therapeutic ultrasound following soft tissue injury and fracture demonstrate some evidence of benefit in the rate of wound and bone healing, and the quality of repair (for example, improved mechanical properties of scar tissue and callus). Thus, therapeutic ultrasound is widely used by physiotherapists to promote healing following acute musculoskeletal injury. </P>
<P>Spontaneous and/or iatrogenic perineal trauma (for example, episiotomy) are common sequelae of childbirth. In developed countries as few as 4% to 15% of primiparae may have an intact perineum following delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Abraham-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abraham 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bansal-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bansal 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thranov-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thranov 1990</LINK>). In consequence, it is not surprising many women report perineal pain after childbirth. A survey of 2000 postnatal women by the National Childbirth Trust in the United Kingdom found that perineal pain and discomfort following delivery were a distressing problem for mothers and may significantly affect their function and experience of early motherhood (<LINK REF="REF-Greenshields-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenshields 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>Perineal pain is commonly treated with oral analgesia but the use of a variety of local or 'topical' applications, such as therapeutic ultrasound, is also widespread (<LINK REF="REF-Sleep-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleep 1988</LINK>). Although the treatment of pain is not a primary indication for the use of therapeutic ultrasound, proponents suggest that pain is decreased as the resolution of the inflammatory process is accelerated, and compression of pain sensitive structures by haematoma and oedema is reduced. The first known trial report of therapeutic ultrasound for the relief of acute perineal pain following childbirth was published in 1980 (<LINK REF="REF-Foulkes-1980a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foulkes 1980a</LINK>). </P>
<P>Women may also experience persistent perineal pain or dyspareunia, or both, following childbirth. Glazener (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 1995</LINK>) reported 10% of women experienced persistent perineal pain (more than two months) after delivery, increasing to 30% after assisted vaginal delivery. In longer-term follow up there appeared to be a strong association between persistent perineal pain and problems with sexual intercourse (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 1997</LINK>). Studies of postnatal morbidity suggest a small but significant proportion of women continue to experience persistent perineal pain and dyspareunia more than a year after childbirth (<LINK REF="REF-Abraham-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abraham 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hay_x002d_Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay-Smith 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robson 1981</LINK>). The possible benefits of ultrasound on acute injury seem to have been extrapolated to include long-standing conditions, as ultrasound has also been widely used to treat chronic musculoskeletal dysfunctions and pain (<LINK REF="REF-Feine-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feine 1997</LINK>). The first known report of therapeutic ultrasound used to treat persistent perineal pain was published in 1979 (<LINK REF="REF-Fieldhouse-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fieldhouse 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>Physiotherapists are aware that further evidence to support the use of ultrasound in clinical practice is required (<LINK REF="REF-Pope-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pope 1995</LINK>) and the effects of therapeutic ultrasound on inflammation are considered a high priority for research by experienced and newly-qualified physiotherapists alike (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 1994</LINK>). Despite some uncertainty about the most appropriate use of ultrasound, surveys show that ultrasound has been, and continues to be, used widely (<LINK REF="REF-CEHD-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">CEHD 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindsay-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindsay 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pope-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pope 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ter-Haar-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ter Haar 1988</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Participants with acute perineal pain receiving active ultrasound were more likely to report improvement in pain with treatment than those receiving placebo treatment. Those women receiving ultrasound were more likely to have bruising at ten days compared with those receiving pulsed electromagnetic energy, however those treated with ultrasound were less likely to have experienced perineal pain at ten days and three months. The trials included in this review suggest that there is no benefit or only limited benefit of active over placebo ultrasound, or ultrasound over pulsed electromagnetic energy. However, at present there is insufficient evidence to make any real conclusions about the benefits or harms of ultrasound for the relief of perineal pain or dyspareunia, or both. </P>
<P>This view is supported by other authors (<LINK REF="REF-Chapman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feine-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feine 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gam-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gam 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schlapbach-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlapbach 1991</LINK>) who have noted the lack of high-quality randomised controlled trials investigating ultrasound that are necessary to make judgements about the efficacy of this modality in the treatment of acute or chronic pain in a variety of musculoskeletal conditions.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to make any definite conclusion about the benefits, or otherwise, of therapeutic ultrasound for the treatment of acute or persistent perineal pain and dyspareunia.</P>
<P>Where therapeutic ultrasound is currently in use for the treatment of either acute or persistent perineal pain there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the practice be discontinued, but the use of this modality should not be further instituted until further evidence of its efficacy is forthcoming.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Promising findings from 'in vivo' and 'in vitro' studies on the effects of therapeutic ultrasound applied in the inflammatory, proliferative and remodelling phases of wound repair suggest there is potential benefit (acceleration of healing, improved cosmetic appearance and mechanical properties of the scar tissue) in treating acute wounds with this modality. More rapid resolution of oedema etc may result in decreased pain but there is no evidence ultrasound acts directly on pain mechanisms.</P>
<P>In view of the potential benefit of ultrasound in wound healing it seems that further large, high quality, randomised controlled trials are warranted although a more appropriate focus of research would be to investigate the effect of ultrasound on rate and quality of wound healing rather than on perineal pain. </P>
<P>If further studies are planned the inclusion of a no-treatment group is indicated to investigate the extent of the placebo effect created by extra attention from a healthcare professional. In addition, further trials need to examine the effect of different ultrasound treatment parameters (frequency, intensity, duration, pulse intervals etc) and longer periods of follow up are suggested.</P>
