<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is widely used for treating fever in children. Like ibuprofen, aspirin, and physical methods (such as fanning), paracetamol aims to provide relief from symptoms and prevent febrile convulsions. Uncertainty exists about the benefits of using it to treat fever in children. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of paracetamol for treating fever in children in relation to fever clearance time, febrile convulsions, and resolution of associated symptoms.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (May 2004), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2004), EMBASE (1988 to May 2004), LILACS (May 2004), Science Citation Index (May 2004), and reference lists of articles. We also contacted researchers in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized and quasi-randomized trials of children with fever from infections comparing: (1) paracetamol with placebo or no treatment; and (2) paracetamol with physical cooling methods (eg, sponging, bathing, or fanning). The primary outcomes were fever clearance time and febrile convulsion. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-11-09 19:57:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two reviewers independently extracted data on methods, types of participants, interventions, and outcomes. The meta-analysis was conducted using risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals for discrete variables, and mean differences for continuous outcomes.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-09 19:56:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>12 trials (n = 1509 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Outcomes varied between trials. No data were available on the primary outcome. There is insufficient evidence to show whether paracetamol influenced the risk of febrile convulsions. In a meta-analysis of two trials (n = 120), the proportion of children without fever by the second hour after treatment did not differ significantly between those given paracetamol and those sponged (risk ratio 1.84; confidence interval 0.94 to 3.61, random effects model). The statistical test showed significant heterogeneity between the groups receiving paracetamol or physical methods. No severe adverse events were reported. The number of children with mild adverse events did not differ significantly between paracetamol and placebo, or paracetamol and physical methods, but numbers were small.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-10 11:28:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are few trials that have directly compared the antipyretic properties of paracetamol against placebo or physical methods. Data on adverse events are limited. Establishing standard outcomes will help comparisons between studies and better meta-analysis.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-10 14:26:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-10 11:30:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fever is common within infections. It is caused by the body responding to disease or invasion by pathogens (<LINK REF="REF-Kluger-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluger 1992</LINK>). Fever results in people feeling unwell, and occasionally in children, a rapidly rising temperature results in a convulsion (<LINK REF="REF-Behrmann-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behrmann 2000</LINK>). Febrile convulsions are the most common type of convulsions in childhood, and are known to affect about two to five per cent of all children (<LINK REF="REF-Verity-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verity 1985</LINK>). About 30 per cent of those who have had an episode of febrile convulsions have additional convulsions (<LINK REF="REF-Stuijvenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuijvenberg 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The physiological mechanism that results in fever is not clear. However, several immunological factors are known to interact in the process that leads to fever, notably the chemical factors called cytokines produced by white blood cells. Experts suggest that cytokines act on the centre in the brain that regulates temperature (thermoregulatory centre) to initiate the physiological responses that result in fever (<LINK REF="REF-Kwiatkowski-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwiatkowski 1995</LINK>). Fever also increases the rate at which the body uses its energy reserve, especially when it occurs with chills and rigor (<LINK REF="REF-Mackowiak-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackowiak 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The drugs most commonly used for treating fever are paracetamol, aspirin, and ibuprofen (<LINK REF="STD-Autret-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Autret 1997</LINK>). These drugs exert their effects by blocking different points in the chemical pathway that leads to fever. While aspirin and ibuprofen exert their effects on the central pathway (in the brain) as well as the peripheral (in other parts of the body), paracetamol is believed to act only on the central pathway (<LINK REF="REF-Mackowiak-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackowiak 1998</LINK>). The action of these drugs on the temperature control pathway results in the peripheral blood vessels dilating to dissipate heat (<LINK REF="REF-Meyers-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyers 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mackowiak-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackowiak 1998</LINK>). People also use physical cooling methods, such as fanning and tepid sponging, which conduct heat from the skin (<LINK REF="STD-Agbolosu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Agbolosu 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the disease process that leads to fever is obviously harmful, some experts suggest that fever may have a beneficial effect of enhancing host resistance to infection (<LINK REF="STD-Kramer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kluger-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluger 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1991</LINK>). Some of these experts argue that interventions specifically targeted at resolution of fever may interfere with the beneficial role of fever during illness and adversely affect the outcome of the illness. One report suggests that treatment with antipyretic drugs could increase mortality in severe infections, prolong viral shedding, and impair antibody response to viral infection (<LINK REF="REF-Shann-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shann 1995</LINK>). Another researcher has observed that giving paracetamol to African children with malaria fever prolonged the parasite clearance time (<LINK REF="STD-Brandts-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brandts 1997</LINK>). A Cochrane review has however shown that there is insufficient evidence to support the view that paracetamol prolongs parasite clearance in people with malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Meremikwu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meremikwu 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition to the potentially harmful effects of reducing fever, there are harms associated with specific drugs. The ingestion of a high dose of paracetamol is known to cause liver damage (<LINK REF="REF-Meredith-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meredith 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Plotz-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plotz 1981</LINK>). For instance, paracetamol toxicity from overdosing is the commonest cause of acute liver failure in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Newsome-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newsome 2001</LINK>). Paracetamol overdose has also been reported to cause disorders of the kidneys, heart, blood cells, and metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1997</LINK>). Aspirin is reported to cause metabolic acidosis (which presents with rapid breathing), very low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia), lethargy, coma, and fits; symptoms which are common in severe malaria. Therefore its use in malaria patients may lead to diagnostic confusion, complications, and increase the risk of death (<LINK REF="REF-English-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">English 1996</LINK>). Another major limitation to the use of aspirin in children is its association with Reye's syndrome, a rare adverse event that may lead to coma and death in children. The association of aspirin with Reye's syndrome has led to official ban on the use of aspirin for treating children in the United Kingdom and many other countries (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Porter-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porter 1990</LINK>). Other reported adverse effects of antipyretic drugs (including ibuprofen) are gastrointestinal bleeding, heartburn, dyspepsia, nausea, and vomiting (<LINK REF="REF-Done-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Done 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Meyers-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyers 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>The common adverse effects of physical methods include shivering, crying, and discomfort. Sponging with cold water may cause peripheral cooling but the constriction of the blood vessels can actually cause heat conservation (<LINK REF="REF-Mackowiak-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackowiak 1998</LINK>). The axillary temperature will fall and the rectal temperature will rise.</P>
<P>The uncertainties associated with antipyretic drugs and physical methods have led to a debate about the benefits and harms of methods of reducing fever (<LINK REF="REF-Choonara-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choonara 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Done-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Done 1983</LINK>). Most caregivers and many clinicians believe that treatment of fever will relieve symptoms and prevent harmful effects such as febrile convulsions (<LINK REF="REF-Stuijvenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuijvenberg 1998</LINK>). A recent study has shown that parental fear about presumed harmful effects of fever in children (also called "fever phobia") is still common, and in most cases, due to misconceptions (<LINK REF="REF-Crocetti-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crocetti 2001</LINK>). Given that these drug and physical methods are widely recommended for treating children with a fever, we sought to examine reliable research evidence of the benefits and harms for each method through the following individual reviews.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Paracetamol for treating fever in children</HEADING>
<P>Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is widely used for treating fever in children. This drug is reputed to be both effective and well tolerated (<LINK REF="STD-McIntyre-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McIntyre 1996</LINK>). On the other hand, some experts argue that the use of paracetamol may prolong the duration of certain infections (<LINK REF="STD-Brandts-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brandts 1997</LINK>). Some epidemiological reports suggest that the incidence of acute paracetamol poisoning may have increased in recent times owing probably to widespread use of the drug for treating fever (<LINK REF="REF-Meredith-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meredith 1981</LINK>). Children may develop paracetamol toxicity due to unintended inappropriate dosing, giving standard dose of the drug to children at increased risk of toxicity, or giving paracetamol concurrently with other drugs that are also capable of damaging the liver (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are obvious reasons for concern about the safety of this drug and uncertainties about its actual benefits in the treatment of childhood fever. We have addressed these questions in this systematic review with a view to providing reliable evidence for clinical practice and identifying areas for further research.</P>

The only trial with a relatively high dropout rate (<LINK REF="STD-Kramer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 1991</LINK>) performed an intention-to-treat analysis thereby minimizing the attrition bias associated with high losses to follow up. Since none of the other trials provided a detailed trial profile it is difficult to ascertain the actual magnitude of losses to follow up. All the trials stated the frequency of observation.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-01 15:45:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found a small number of trials that tested paracetamol against placebo or physical methods for treating fever. Some of these studies were carefully conducted, while in others a lack of detail in the methods made it difficult to evaluate them.</P>
<P>Most studies were small, none identified primary outcomes in their research design, and the outcomes varied considerably between studies. In addition, data were often incomplete, with few providing standard deviation on mean measures or details of the statistical tests used by the authors.</P>
<P>We have not systematically assessed observational data of paracetamol efficacy, as we aimed to focus on more reliable comparisons between paracetamol and mechanical methods or placebo from randomized controlled trials. The comparative data were surprisingly sparse, and it is not clear whether paracetamol is effective when compared to placebo or physical methods in (1) reducing fever reduction and (2) reducing risk of febrile convulsions.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-10-01 15:38:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This systematic review shows that inconsistent and weak evidence supports the use of paracetamol to reduce fever in children. This does not mean that paracetamol is ineffective, but simply that the number of reliable studies evaluating it against placebo or physical methods are too few to be sure it has a therapeutic effect. </P>
<P>In the absence of any obvious harms, a campaign to alter practice is not justifiable. Caregivers and doctors have faith in paracetamol, but its continued use needs to be justified in terms of benefit through future research or the outcome of the related Cochrane Reviews (see description in the 'Background') of the effects of other antipyretic drugs in the management of fever. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-10-01 15:38:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have not demonstrated any convincing direct evidence that paracetamol is effective in reducing fever or preventing febrile convulsions in children. This has the following research implications.</P>
<P>1. Further research in this area warrants larger studies measuring a few simple pragmatic outcomes, such as febrile convulsions; mean time to resolution of fever; and number of participants without fever by one hour.</P>
<P>2. A systematic review of the effects of paracetamol in adults could provide some evidence that clinicians may generalize for all age groups in the interim. Trials including only adults will however not provide any useful information on febrile convulsion since this is a childhood problem.</P>
<P>3. Further reviews of antipyretic drugs need to compare, in the first instance, the drug against placebo. Head to head comparisons against paracetamol presume that paracetamol is the standard treatment.</P>
<P>4. Monitoring of common adverse events and occasional rare events needs to be considered in all evaluations of antipyretic drugs in children.</P>
