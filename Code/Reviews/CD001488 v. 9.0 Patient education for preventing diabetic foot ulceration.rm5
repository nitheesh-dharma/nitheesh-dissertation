<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-04-20 08:03:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Foot ulcers (open sores) are common in people with diabetes, especially those with problems in the nerves (peripheral neuropathy), the blood supply to their legs (peripheral vascular disease (PVD)), or both. People with ulcers due to diabetes sometimes need an amputation (surgical removal of part of the limb). Foot ulcers not only lead to physical disability and loss of quality of life but also to economic burden (healthcare costs, industrial disability). The aim is therefore to prevent foot ulcers occurring. This review of high-level studies found that educating people with diabetes about the need to look after their feet seems to improve people's foot care knowledge and behaviour in the short term. There is insufficient evidence that education alone, without any additional preventive measures, will effectively reduce the occurrence of ulcers and amputations.</P>

<P>Of the 12 RCTs included, the effect of patient education on primary end points was reported in only five. Pooling of outcome data was precluded by marked, mainly clinical, heterogeneity. One of the RCTs showed reduced incidence of foot ulceration (risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.66) and amputation (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.76) during one-year follow-up of diabetes patients at high risk of foot ulceration after a one-hour group education session. However, one similar study, with lower risk of bias, did not confirm this finding (RR amputation 0.98, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.34; RR ulceration 1.00, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.44). Three other studies, also did not demonstrate any effect of education on the primary end points, but were most likely underpowered. Patients' foot care knowledge was improved in the short term in five of eight RCTs in which this outcome was assessed, as was patients' self-reported self-care behaviour in the short term in seven of nine RCTs. Callus, nail problems and fungal infections improved in only one of five RCTs. Only one of the included RCTs was at low risk of bias.</P>

<P>In some trials, foot care knowledge and self reported patient behaviour seem to be positively influenced by education in the short term. Yet, based on the only two sufficiently powered studies reporting the effect of patient education on primary end points, we conclude that there is insufficient robust evidence that limited patient education alone is effective in achieving clinically relevant reductions in ulcer and amputation incidence.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-04-20 08:04:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ulceration of the foot is one of the major health problems for people with diabetes mellitus. It is estimated to affect 15% to 25% of people with diabetes at some time in their lives (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2005</LINK>). Foot ulceration can result in marked physical disability and reduction of quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Nabuurs_x002d_Franssen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabuurs-Franssen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vileikyte-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vileikyte 2001</LINK>), not to mention limb loss and even death (<LINK REF="REF-Robbins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robbins 2008</LINK>). Diabetic foot ulcers precede 25% to 90% of all amputations (<LINK REF="REF-Global-Lower-Extremity-Amputation-Study-Group-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Global Lower Extremity Amputation Study Group 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pecoraro-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pecoraro 1990</LINK>). The risk of a lower extremity amputation in people with diabetes is therefore much higher than in people without diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Canavan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canavan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Icks-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Icks 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several factors are involved in the development of foot ulcers, including peripheral neuropathy, PVD, limited joint mobility and repeated trauma from abnormal load distribution on the foot (<LINK REF="REF-Dinh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dinh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2006</LINK>). The underlying causes of foot ulcers are usually irreversible and chronically progressive. Therefore, 70% of healed foot ulcers recur within five years (<LINK REF="REF-Apelqvist-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Apelqvist 1993</LINK>). Moreover, treatment itself is very challenging and often needs to be long lasting. It requires not only expert interference, orthopaedic appliances and antimicrobial drugs but also costly topical dressings and inpatient care (<LINK REF="REF-Boulton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cavanagh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cavanagh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jeffcoate-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeffcoate 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2005</LINK>). Not surprisingly, this leads to substantial economic burden. Healing of a single ulcer costs approximately USD17,500 (1998 US dollars) (<LINK REF="REF-Ragnarson-Tennvall-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ragnarson Tennvall 2004</LINK>). In cases where lower extremity amputation is required, health care is even more expensive: USD30,000 to USD33,500 (<LINK REF="REF-Ragnarson-Tennvall-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ragnarson Tennvall 2004</LINK>). These costs do not even represent the total economic burden, since costs related to loss of productivity, preventive efforts, rehabilitation and home care should also be considered. When all this is taken into account, 7% to 20% of total expenditure on diabetes in North America and Europe might be attributable to diabetic foot ulceration (<LINK REF="REF-Boulton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulton 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 1989 one of the main five-year targets of the European Declaration of St. Vincent was to reduce amputations caused by diabetes mellitus by 50% (<LINK REF="REF-St-Vincent-Declaration-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">St Vincent Declaration 1989</LINK>). In order to reach these goals, international guidelines underline the need to reduce the incidence of foot ulceration by preventive efforts. This not only includes optimising metabolic control and identification and screening of people at high risk for diabetic foot ulceration, but also patient education in order to promote foot self-examination and foot care knowledge (<LINK REF="REF-American-Diabetes-Association-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">American Diabetes Association 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frykberg-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frykberg 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IDF-clinical-guidelines-task-force-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">IDF clinical guidelines task force 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Population-based research suggests that a meaningful reduction in the incidence of amputations caused by diabetes mellitus has already been achieved. Before the European Assembly in St. Vincent, the risk ratio (RR) of a lower extremity amputation was still 15 times higher in people with diabetes mellitus than in people without diabetes mellitus (<LINK REF="REF-Most-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Most 1983</LINK>). This RR has since dropped to 8.8 (95% CI 7.3 to 10.7) in men and 5.7 (95% CI 4.3 to 7.6) in women in one study (<LINK REF="REF-Icks-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Icks 2009</LINK>) and to 7.7 (95% CI 5.0 to 12.9) in another (<LINK REF="REF-Canavan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canavan 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, it cannot be inferred from these figures that current preventive efforts are effective, since the reduction in amputation incidence may also have resulted from improvements in ulcer treatment. In this review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) we, therefore, evaluate the effect of education of people with diabetes aiming to promote foot self-care and to prevent the occurrence of foot lesions. Although this type of prevention is nowadays widely advocated and implemented in standard practice, the evidence for the effectiveness is still scarce. Several review articles on the diabetic foot, which include education among the prevention strategies discussed, have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Assal-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assal 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bild-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bild 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boulton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulton 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bowering-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowering 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Larsson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Majid-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majid 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mason-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mayfield-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayfield 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rith_x002d_Najarian-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rith-Najarian 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2007</LINK>). However, only three of these reviews were systematic (<LINK REF="REF-Majid-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majid 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mason-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2005</LINK>) and most of these reviews dealt primarily with uncontrolled studies. Furthermore, only two of these reviews assessed the methodological quality of the included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Majid-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majid 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mason-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 1999</LINK>). The overall conclusion of these review articles was that education is effective for the prevention of diabetic foot ulceration, but consequently this conclusion must be treated with care; especially since previous systematic reviews of patient education for adults with, for example, asthma and neck pain, have suggested that health outcomes were unlikely to be improved by limited patient education (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haines-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haines 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thus, after reviewing the available evidence, we decided to perform a systematic review of the effectiveness of (components of) education programmes targeted at people with diabetes with the aim of preventing foot ulceration.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-11-25 17:16:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assigned two review authors (JD and DK or GV) to assess each study independently using The Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool addresses six specific domains, namely: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues (e.g. extreme baseline imbalance) (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for details of criteria on which the judgement was based). Because blinding of patients and healthcare providers does not appear to be feasible considering the nature of the interventions studied, judgement was solely based on the information provided about blinding of outcome assessors. Blinding and completeness of outcome data were assessed for each outcome separately. Any disagreements were discussed in a consensus meeting. We completed a 'Risk of bias' table for each eligible study (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>We assessed risk of bias using a 'Risk of bias summary' figure (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>), which presents all of the judgements in a cross-tabulation of study by entry.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants' risk of foot ulceration</HEADING>
<P>In four of the 12 included RCTs, patients were at high risk of foot ulceration (<LINK REF="STD-Cisneros-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cisneros 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malone-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Malone 1989</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Malone-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Malone 1989</LINK> all patients were referred to podiatry or vascular surgery prior to study entry and had foot infection, ulceration or prior amputation. In <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2008</LINK> all participants had newly healed diabetic foot ulcers. In <LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2003</LINK> patients were excluded if they had a history of foot amputation, but it follows from the presence of important risk factors at baseline that the studied population was at high risk for foot ulceration: loss of protective sensation was present in 70%, impaired lower extremity circulation in 67% and foot deformity in 50%. Finally, in <LINK REF="STD-Cisneros-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cisneros 2010</LINK> all patients had diabetic neuropathy and most had additional risk factors such as plantar overpressure, deformity and previous foot ulceration. In four RCTs patients were at low or medium risk of foot ulceration (<LINK REF="STD-Barth-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barth 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bloomgarden-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bloomgarden 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frank-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Frank 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnemaa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnemaa 1997</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnemaa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnemaa 1997</LINK> patients were even excluded if they had any need for podiatry.

<P>Three RCTs compared the effectiveness of a patient education programme on diabetes in general (which included a component of foot care education) compared with usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Bloomgarden-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bloomgarden 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazzuca-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzuca 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rettig-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Rettig 1986</LINK>). In one of these studies, the content of the educational programme was preset and consisted of nine group patient education sessions, one of which was about foot care and skin hygiene (<LINK REF="STD-Bloomgarden-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bloomgarden 1987</LINK>). In the other two studies, the content of the educational programme was tailored to patients' individual needs (<LINK REF="STD-Mazzuca-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzuca 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rettig-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Rettig 1986</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Mazzuca-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzuca 1986</LINK> those educational needs were identified using a set of safety-level objectives selected by a multidisciplinary group of healthcare professionals. These objectives covered seven areas of patient education, of which foot care was one. In the other study areas of diabetes self-management, patients most in need of improvement were determined using an assessment instrument (100 short answer and yes-no questions, brief patient demonstrations of urine testing and insulin injection techniques) (<LINK REF="STD-Rettig-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Rettig 1986</LINK>). In both studies, participants received a variable number of educational sessions.</P>
<P>In addition to <LINK REF="STD-Mazzuca-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzuca 1986</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rettig-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Rettig 1986</LINK>, there were two more RCTs that adopted the concept of education tailored to patients' individual needs, but in these studies the educational interventions were only directed at improving foot care (<LINK REF="STD-Borges-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borges 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2003</LINK>) and they were less intensive than in <LINK REF="STD-Mazzuca-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzuca 1986</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rettig-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Rettig 1986</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2003</LINK> a single 10- to 20-minute educational session, combined with written instructions, was compared with no intervention, and in <LINK REF="STD-Borges-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borges 2004</LINK> a 15-minute educational session after a risk assessment for foot ulceration was compared with risk assessment alone and with no intervention at all.</P>
<P>In the remaining six RCTs, an intensive foot care education programme was compared with a less proactive intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Barth-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barth 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cisneros-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cisneros 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frank-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Frank 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kruger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kruger 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malone-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Malone 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnemaa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnemaa 1997</LINK>). This, however, does not mean that the interventions in these studies were all similar. In two studies the intervention was only one hour of patient education, reinforced by hand-outs (<LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malone-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Malone 1989</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Malone-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Malone 1989</LINK>, this was compared with routine patient education, and in <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2008</LINK> with written instructions only. In <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnemaa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnemaa 1997</LINK>, patients in the intervention group also received 45 minutes of foot care education, but this was combined with a variable number of follow-up visits at a podiatry clinic. The control intervention consisted of written instructions on foot care only. In the other studies, the educational interventions were more comprehensive, more intensive or both. In <LINK REF="STD-Frank-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Frank 2003</LINK>, for example, the intervention comprised viewing a videotape about proper foot care, a 30- to 40-minute individualised educational session, a foot ulceration risk assessment, hand-outs, a foot care checklist, a bag of foot care supplies and weekly reminder telephone calls. Control group patients received a foot ulceration risk assessment only. In <LINK REF="STD-Cisneros-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cisneros 2010</LINK> people in the intervention group received four 90-minute therapeutic education sessions on the complications of diabetes, disease treatment, inspection and foot hygiene and choice and use of proper footwear. In addition, participants received footwear after completion of the educational programme. This was compared with routine care. In two other studies a basic educational programme on diabetes in general was provided to all study participants and supplemented by specific foot care education in the intervention group (<LINK REF="STD-Barth-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barth 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kruger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kruger 1992</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Barth-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barth 1991</LINK>, the general diabetes education consisted of 14 hours of group education and included a one-hour lecture on foot care. In addition to that, the intervention group followed nine hours of group education about the diabetic foot (<LINK REF="STD-Barth-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barth 1991</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Kruger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kruger 1992</LINK>, the general diabetes education consisted of a one-week course, which included viewing an instructional videotape on foot care. In the intervention group this was supplemented with a 'hands-on' foot care approach, a patient education kit and daily foot care sheets (<LINK REF="STD-Kruger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kruger 1992</LINK>).</P>

A marked reduction in ulcer incidence (intervention 8, control 26) and amputation rate (intervention 7, control 21) was observed in the intervention group. It should be noted, however, that outcomes were reported per limb (n = 354) instead of per person (n = 182). Therefore, a single person could have had two events, although multiple events on the same limb were reported as one. This may have resulted in overestimation of the effect sizes (RR foot ulceration 0.31, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.66; 354 limbs, one trial, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, and RR amputation 0.33, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.76, 354 limbs, one trial, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-18 10:31:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A wide range and combinations of patient educational interventions have been evaluated for the prevention of diabetic foot ulceration. These interventions varied from brief patient education to intensive patient education including demonstration and 'hands-on' teaching.</P>
<P>The ultimate aim of foot care education for people with diabetes is to prevent foot ulceration and amputations. However, these end points were assessed in only five of the 12 RCTs (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The results of this review are presented in a study-by-study qualitative synthesis. Pooling of the results was precluded by marked heterogeneity (mainly clinical), because participants, types of interventions, types of control interventions, outcome measures, outcome assessment tools, duration of follow-up and risk of bias varied widely between studies.</P>
<P>Only one RCT showed that, after one-year follow-up, the incidence of foot ulcers and amputations was lower in the group who received one hour of group education on the diabetic foot by a podiatrist compared with the group who received routine foot care education (<LINK REF="STD-Malone-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Malone 1989</LINK>). In this RCT, the number of legs instead of the number of people was taken as the unit of analysis (so-called 'unit of analysis error') leading to an overestimation of the precision of the study and thus the ability to reach statistical significance. Moreover, an inadequate quasi-randomised method was used for group allocation and it was not clear if baseline variables were comparable. Also, blinding of the outcome assessor and co-interventions were not reported and ITT analysis was not attempted (<LINK REF="STD-Malone-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Malone 1989</LINK>). More importantly, the positive findings of this study are contradicted by the results of a more recent study that was included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2008</LINK>), which also studied a population at high risk for foot ulceration. Most other characteristics of this study were also similar to <LINK REF="STD-Malone-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Malone 1989</LINK>, although regular care, which was available to both the intervention and the control groups of both studies might have improved between 1989 and 2008 when the latter study was published. It can be argued that in <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2008</LINK>, the educational intervention and the control intervention did not contrast enough to result in significantly different outcomes. Nevertheless, the risk of bias in <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2008</LINK> was very low. This study concluded that one hour of patient education compared with written instructions only had no beneficial effects on the incidence of foot ulceration and amputation rate after 12 months of follow-up. The other three RCTs that reported the effect of patient education on foot ulceration and amputation demonstrated no effect either (<LINK REF="STD-Bloomgarden-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bloomgarden 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cisneros-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cisneros 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnemaa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnemaa 1997</LINK>). However, the overall event rate in the populations studied showed that these two studies were underpowered to show any effect on these primary outcome measures.</P>
<P>The present review demonstrates a positive short-term effect of education on patients' foot care knowledge, which improved in five of the eight RCTs in which this outcome was assessed (<LINK REF="STD-Barth-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barth 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frank-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Frank 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rettig-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Rettig 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnemaa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnemaa 1997</LINK>). However, in the one RCT with longer follow-up, the difference in foot care knowledge between intervention and control group had disappeared at seven years (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnemaa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnemaa 1997</LINK>). Similarly patients' behaviour at 6 to 18 months improved in seven of the nine RCTs in which this outcome was assessed (<LINK REF="STD-Barth-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barth 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borges-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borges 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frank-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Frank 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kruger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kruger 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnemaa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnemaa 1997</LINK>). Although behaviour assessment scores were still improved after seven years of follow-up compared with the baseline measurements, the control group had made up arrears (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnemaa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnemaa 1997</LINK>). The assessment tools for measuring foot care knowledge and self-care behaviour varied between studies, because there is currently no single standardised validated tool widely used for these purposes. We were therefore unable to evaluate the importance (clinical relevance) of the reported statistically significant improvements in foot care knowledge scores and self-care behaviour assessment scores.</P>
<P>The effects on callus, nail problems and/or fungal infections were described in five studies. In only two of them were some positive effects at short-term follow-up reported (<LINK REF="STD-Barth-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barth 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnemaa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnemaa 1997</LINK>), but the differences between intervention and control group were not maintained until final follow-up. In three additional studies no benefit on these outcomes was achieved (<LINK REF="STD-Bloomgarden-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bloomgarden 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kruger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kruger 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rettig-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Rettig 1986</LINK>). It may be possible that co-interventions, such as podiatry care, influenced these outcomes. In <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnemaa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnemaa 1997</LINK> podiatry care was part of the experimental intervention. Therefore, people in the intervention group were reported to have seen a podiatrist more often (mean number of visits 4.7) than people in the control group (mean number of visits 0.4) after one year of follow-up, and consequently an improvement on callus, nail problems and fungal infections was reported in the intervention group. During the last year of follow-up, only 30.8% of the people in the intervention group still visited a podiatrist compared with 25.2% of the control group. The initial advantage of the intervention group had disappeared. A similar explanation accounts for the initial benefit of the intervention group in <LINK REF="STD-Barth-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barth 1991</LINK>: after one month of follow-up, 17 people in the intervention group compared with seven in the control group had consulted a podiatrist. Between the third and sixth month of follow-up, these figures levelled to seven and eight people in each group, respectively. These examples show the importance of adequate reporting of co-interventions, which was one of the shortcomings of the other three studies that reported these outcomes.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-07-18 10:32:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies in this review that included people with diabetes at low or medium risk for foot ulceration recruited too few participants and followed them up for too short a period of time to be able to detect clinically important differences in primary outcomes. For example, in order to detect a 50% reduction in the incidence of diabetic foot ulceration, 430 to 870 participants would be required per treatment group (based on an annual incidence of foot ulceration in the general diabetes population of 2% to 4% per year or 4% to 8% over two years) (<LINK REF="REF-De-Sonnaville-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Sonnaville 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reenders-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reenders 1993</LINK>). The mean size of studies in this review that included people at low or medium risk for foot ulceration was 138 people per treatment group, ranging from 25 (<LINK REF="STD-Kruger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kruger 1992</LINK>) to 266 (<LINK REF="STD-Mazzuca-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzuca 1986</LINK>) and with six months median time to follow-up, indicating that none of these studies were actually sufficiently powered to detect differences in the long term on one of the primary outcomes. Unfortunately, the trials included in this review do not share a common set of characteristics (participants, educational methods, intensity of education to intervention and the control group, outcome measures, duration of follow-up), thereby hindering present and future pooling.</P>
<P>Of the studies that reported the effect of foot care education on primary outcomes in a population at high risk, two were well-powered (<LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malone-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Malone 1989</LINK>). However, in these studies the educational programme under study was very limited, comprising only a single one-hour educational session, reinforced by hand-outs, compared with either routine patient education (<LINK REF="STD-Malone-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Malone 1989</LINK>) or written instructions only (<LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2008</LINK>). The conclusions of these studies were contradictory, but because the risk of bias was lower in <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2008</LINK>, more weight should be given to the outcomes of this study. It shows that a limited educational intervention is not likely to result in improvement of ulcer incidence and amputation incidence. This, however, does not rule out effectiveness of more comprehensive and/or more intensive educational strategies, but these strategies were not studied.</P>
<P>In summary, evidence on the effectiveness of comprehensive and intensive patient education programmes to prevent diabetic foot ulceration is still needed. Below we make suggestions for future research (<LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-04-20 08:08:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One of the most important findings of the present review is the high or unclear risk of bias in all but one of the included RCTs. This was mainly caused by insufficient reporting. Usually methodological flaws lead to an overestimation of the effect size. Therefore, the few positive effects that were found should be interpreted with caution. In addition, unknown and unregistered co-interventions in the control groups of the included trials (e.g. podiatry care, unstructured patient education by the care provider) could have led to reductions in the effects of the experimental educational interventions. Finally, it must be stressed that foot care knowledge and patient behaviour were measured using subjective outcome measures and are therefore also prone to bias.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-07-18 10:33:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The clinical heterogeneity of the RCTs meant it was not possible to produce a funnel plot to assess the presence of publication bias. However, in general, publication bias would be likely to lead to an overestimation of the effects. In this review, most of the RCTs identified reported non-significant findings and it is therefore unlikely that we overestimated any effect.</P>
<P>The availability of co-interventions to those participating in the studies may have influenced the outcomes of the trials in this review. For example, in <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnemaa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnemaa 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Barth-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barth 1991</LINK> the incidence of callus, nail problems and fungal infection were probably influenced by the availability of podiatry care (see <LINK TAG="SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Summary of main results</LINK>). In most other studies, it is not reported which co-interventions were available and whether they have influenced the outcomes. Furthermore, 'care as usual' has greatly improved and must no longer be mistaken for 'doing nothing'. Therefore, a limited educational intervention may add little to the existing knowledge of patients to result in any beneficial effects. This especially accounts for more recent studies like <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2008</LINK>.</P>
<P>The studies included in this review used different tools to assess care knowledge and self-care behaviour. Therefore, it was not possible to evaluate the importance (clinical relevance) of the reported statistically significant improvements in foot care knowledge scores and self-care behaviour assessment scores. Foot care knowledge improved to some extent in five of eight studies, but consequently, this does not provide proof of effectiveness.</P>

According to these review articles, there was enough evidence to support the effectiveness of patient education for the prevention of diabetic foot ulceration. This systematic review of RCTs, however, provides a more complete and well-considered overview of the available evidence, incorporating an evaluation of the risk of bias of the included studies.</P>
<P>This review was written in close conjunction with another review on the effectiveness of complex interventions for preventing diabetic foot ulceration (New Reference). That review included only five RCTs that were at high or unclear risk of bias. In agreement with this review, it was concluded that there is also no evidence to support the effectiveness of a multilevel integrated care approach for the prevention of diabetic foot ulceration (complex intervention, some of which included patient education), although this should be interpreted as a lack of evidence rather than evidence of no effect.</P>
<P>The RCTs included in this review show the same shortcomings as the RCTs included in a systematic review about the effectiveness of individual patient education for improvement of general metabolic control of people with diabetes mellitus (<LINK REF="REF-Duke-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duke 2009</LINK>). The RCTs in that review were also small and had too many methodological flaws from which to draw firm conclusions.</P>

<P>Overall, it appears that little evidence is available to support the effectiveness of patient education for the prevention of diabetic foot ulceration or amputations. The RCTs that have been conducted on the topic of patient education for preventing diabetic foot ulceration are generally underpowered and at high or unclear risk of bias. Consequently, while some results are suggestive of positive effects, this must be viewed with caution. Foot care knowledge and patient behaviour seem to be positively influenced by education in the short term, but the ultimate goal of educational interventions (improving knowledge and behaviour) is preventing foot ulceration and amputation. One RCT with good methodological quality showed that limited patient education did not result in any beneficial effect on these primary outcomes. The effectiveness of more comprehensive and/or more intensive educational programmes, however, remains to be further investigated.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-12-11 11:11:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If future randomised trials are conducted, the focus should be on comparing comprehensive and intensive educational interventions with usual care. Because standard care nowadays usually comprises basic and unstructured patient education on the diabetic foot, limited education is unlikely to result in marked improvement of clinical outcome. Thus, experimental educational interventions should clearly contrast with standard education and the content of 'usual care' that is provided to the control group should be explicitly described. Furthermore, the main shortcomings of the studies included in this review that need to be avoided in future trials are: (1) insufficient power and duration of follow-up to detect clinically relevant improvements in foot ulceration and amputation incidence, (2) marked clinical heterogeneity and (3) high risk of bias.</P>
<P>First, the ultimate aim of preventive strategies is to reduce the incidence of foot ulceration. This means that randomised trials that include people with diabetes at average risk for foot ulceration need at least 430 to 870 people per treatment arm in order to detect a 50% reduction in the incidence of foot ulceration (based on an annual incidence of foot ulceration in the general diabetes population of 2% to 4% per year or 4% to 8% over two years) (<LINK REF="REF-De-Sonnaville-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Sonnaville 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reenders-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reenders 1993</LINK>). For studies including people at high risk for foot ulceration, fewer participants are needed. Most RCTs included in this review were underpowered to show any effects of the intervention on amputation and/or foot ulceration incidence.</P>
<P>Second, to facilitate meta-analysis of studies evaluating the effects of patient education programmes, more homogeneity of study characteristics and study reporting is desirable. To facilitate pooling of similar studies, future RCTs need to be reproducible. This could, for example, be achieved by standardising patient education on the diabetic foot by formulating clear and commonly accepted learning objectives is recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Colagiuri-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colagiuri 2009</LINK>). Furthermore, future RCTs studying the effect of patient education for preventing diabetic foot ulceration should at least report the incidence of foot ulceration and amputation. An outline of the costs associated with each intervention is vital to assess cost-effectiveness. If changes in foot care knowledge and self-care behaviour are reported, these should be measured with standardised and validated tools. However, such standard sets of outcomes, like those available in rheumatology research (OMERACT) and low back pain research (<LINK REF="REF-Deyo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyo 1998</LINK>), still need to be developed for research on the diabetic foot.</P>
<P>Third, efforts must be made to reduce risk of bias of future studies. Methods of randomisation and allocation concealment, for example, should be explicitly described. Blinding of participants and healthcare providers is often not possible due to the nature of the intervention, but blinding of outcome assessors must be ensured. Also, more pragmatic study design options like the Zelen's design (in which the control group is not informed) might be an option (<LINK REF="REF-Schellings-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schellings 2005</LINK>). Co-interventions need to be registered and reported accurately. Furthermore, loss to follow-up should be avoided because this may lead to underestimation of the intervention results. If loss to follow-up is notable, reasons for study withdrawal should be reported in order to reveal any causality. Finally, RCTs must be reported in accordance with CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Schultz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 2010</LINK>) and its extension to cluster randomised trials (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>We realise that trials of this magnitude are costly, but the benefits in terms of potential reduction in costs associated with effective treatment are potentially significant. Still, since most of the RCTs in this review with low risk of bias did not find any positive effects or only marginal improvements, it may be that patient education alone is not sufficient for achieving clinically relevant risk reductions. Therefore above all, we recommend the study of the effect of educational interventions when combined with other interventions for the prevention of diabetic foot ulceration (complex interventions). In <LINK REF="REF-Dorresteijn-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorresteijn 2010a</LINK>, an overview is provided of the existing RCTs on complex interventions for the prevention of diabetic foot ulceration.</P>

<P>In this updated review, we have excluded studies in which the intervention consisted of multiple combined strategies for the prevention of diabetic foot ulceration, where patient education was not the main comparator with the control intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Litzelman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Litzelman 1993</LINK>). We have developed and published a further Cochrane review that provides a more comprehensive overview of the effects of such integrated prevention strategies (complex interventions) (<LINK REF="REF-Dorresteijn-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorresteijn 2010a</LINK>). In addition, we have redefined the previously used primary outcome 'infection' into the secondary outcome 'fungal infection'. Furthermore, while the Amsterdam-Maastricht consensus list was used to score risk of bias in previous versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>), we have adopted The Cochrane Collaboration's recommended tool for assessing risk of bias in this update (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2014-12-11 10:53:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.  Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.  Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement, for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.  Blinding - was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken.</LI>
<LI>Either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, but outcome assessment was blinded and the non-blinding of others unlikely to introduce bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Any one of the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
