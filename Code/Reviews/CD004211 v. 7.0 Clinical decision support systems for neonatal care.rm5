<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-21 09:01:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are computer systems that bring together medical and patient information to help doctors make decisions about health care. Support systems may be helpful for managing illness and the survival of newborns in the first 28 days of life. They may also influence the performance of doctors treating these newborn infants. The review authors searched the medical literature and contacted experts to find studies on CDSS used with newborns. They identified three randomised controlled studies that met the criteria for the review. Two of these three studies were on computer-aided drug prescribing and one was on computerized physiological monitoring of newborns. One of the studies on computer-aided prescribing showed that the CDSS used resulted in fewer drug dosage errors. The studies found no other benefits. The studies did not consider long-term outcomes in the newborns, just short-term effects. Also, with rapid changes in computer technology, current CDSS are more advanced than those used in the three studies. The Cochrane review authors conclude that there is not enough data to determine whether or not CDSS are beneficial for newborn care.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-05-21 08:34:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are computer-based information systems used to integrate clinical and patient information to provide support for decision-making in patient care. They may be useful in aiding the diagnostic process, the generation of alerts and reminders, therapy critiquing/planning, information retrieval, and image recognition and interpretation. CDSS for use in adult patients have been evaluated using randomised control trials and their results analysed in systematic reviews. There is as yet no systematic review on CDSS use in neonatal medicine.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine whether the use of clinical decision support systems has an effect on <BR/>1. the mortality and morbidity of newborn infants and <BR/>2. the performance of physicians treating them</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The standard search method of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. Searches were made of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (from 1966 to July 2007), EMBASE (1980 - July 2007), CINAHL (1982 to July 2007) and AMED (1985 to July 2007).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials which compared the effects of CDSS versus no CDSS in the care of newborn infants. Trials which compared CDSS against other CDSS were also considered. The eligible interventions were CDSS for computerised physician order entry, computerised physiological monitoring, diagnostic systems and prognostic systems.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Studies were assessed for eligibility using a standard pro forma. Methodological quality was assessed independently by the different investigators.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-21 08:34:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two studies fitting the selection criteria were found for computer aided prescribing and one study for computer aided physiological monitoring.</P>
<P>Computer-aided prescribing: one study (Cade 1997) examined the effects of computerised prescribing of parenteral nutrition ordering. No significant effects on short-term outcomes were found and longer term outcomes were not studied. The second study (Balaguer 2001) investigated the effects of a database program in aiding the calculation of neonatal drug dosages. It was found that the time taken for calculation was significantly reduced and there was a significant reduction in the number of calculation errors.</P>
<P>Computer-aided physiological monitoring: one eligible study (Cunningham 1998) was found which examined the effects of computerised cot side physiological trend monitoring and display. There were no significant effects on mortality, volume of colloid infused, frequency of blood gases sampling (samples per day) or severe intraventricular haemorrhage (Papile Grade IV). Published data did not permit us to analyse effects on long-term neurodevelopmental outcome.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There are very limited data from randomised trials on which to assess the effects of clinical decision support systems in neonatal care. Further evaluation of CDSS using randomised controlled trials is warranted.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-21 09:02:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-21 09:02:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The body of new medical information is growing at a seemingly exponential rate. As computers can process immense quantities of data with great speed, they are indispensable tools for helping to manage information (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1995</LINK>). Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are computer-based information systems used to integrate clinical and patient information to provide support for decision-making in patient care (<LINK REF="REF-NLM-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NLM 2001</LINK>). The medical tasks in which CDSS have been successfully used included diagnostic assistance, the generation of alerts and reminders, therapy critiquing/planning, information retrieval, and image recognition and interpretation (<LINK REF="REF-Coiera-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coiera 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The first computerised systems for medical decision support included a system for the diagnosis of congenital heart diseases that used Bayes theorem (<LINK REF="REF-Warner-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warner 1961</LINK>) and MYCIN, a system for providing advice on antibiotic use in patients with hospital acquired sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Wraith-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wraith 1976</LINK>). Three types of CDSS have been developed so far: rule based systems, probabilistic systems, and cognitive models (<LINK REF="REF-Delaney-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delaney 1999</LINK>). Computerised physician order entry (CPOE) systems have been promoted heavily to aid in drug prescribing, as these systems have been shown to lower the incidence of adverse drug events (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1998</LINK>). In adult patients on warfarin, computerised dosing has led to better oral anticoagulation (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzmaurice-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzmaurice 1998</LINK>). Other major areas for CDSS include aiding the diagnostic process; for example, in patients with possible surgical acute abdomens (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1986</LINK>) and in the intensive care environment for intelligent monitoring and the operation of infusion devices (<LINK REF="REF-Hanson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanson 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Computerised systems have been developed to assist the care of newborn infants since <LINK REF="REF-Perlstein-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlstein 1976</LINK> first described their system for incubator temperature control. Indeed, CDSS have been created for many areas of neonatal care including management of the ventilated neonate (<LINK REF="STD-Carlo-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Carlo 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snowden-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Snowden 1997</LINK>) and in prescriptions, for example of parenteral nutrition solutions (<LINK REF="REF-Ball-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ball 1985</LINK>). Systems have also been used for the prediction of length of inpatient stay (<LINK REF="STD-Zernikow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zernikow 1999</LINK>) as well as prognosis of respiratory distress syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Hermansen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermansen 1987</LINK>). These systems were generally reported to have beneficial effects on neonatal care.</P>
<P>Any information system, including CDSS, ought to be systematically evaluated before being introduced for patient care (<LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 2000</LINK>). The use of randomised controlled trials for evaluation of CDSS has been questioned. It was thought that, in a fast changing environment, other approaches to evaluation might also be required (<LINK REF="REF-Mowatt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mowatt 1997</LINK>). Other pertinent issues are that CDSS may influence the behaviour of a physician, which then carries over when treating control patients (contamination of the control group) and it is sometimes impossible to blind patients and staff to the presence of a CDSS (<LINK REF="REF-Randolph-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randolph 1999</LINK>). The de Dombal system for aiding diagnosis of abdominal pain in adult patients was evaluated in a large multi-centre study in over 16,000 patients using a "before-after" study design (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1986</LINK>). It showed increase in accuracy of diagnosis, reduction in complications and mortality as well as significant cost savings.</P>
<P>A number of CDSS, have been successfully evaluated using the randomised controlled trial design (<LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 1990</LINK>). A systematic review of these rigorously conducted studies showed that CDSS were effective in improving physician performance and patient outcome, but this review did not investigate systems developed for use in newborn infants (<LINK REF="REF-Hunt-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt 1998</LINK>). Although there are general reviews on the use of CDSS in pediatrics, like the effect of CPOE on prescribing (<LINK REF="REF-Kaushal-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaushal 2001</LINK>), there are no systematic reviews on the effects of CDSSs on care of newborn infants.</P>
<P>The aim of this systematic review is to review the evidence from controlled clinical trials on the effects of CDSS on neonatal care.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine whether the use of clinical decision support systems (or different types of CDSS) has an effect on: <BR/>1. the mortality and morbidity of infants within the first 28 days of life within the neonatal unit, hospital wards and community and <BR/>2. the performance of physicians treating them</P>

</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies of CDSS design for use in newborn infants, or for conditions arising in the first 28 days of life were included. Eligible studies could include CDSS for the care of neonates admitted to intensive care/special care units, not admitted to a neonatal unit, or managed in the community.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Studies comparing the use of computerised systems versus no CDSS for clinical decision support in neonatal care or studies comparing different types of CDSS. </P>
<P>Studies describing CDSS for the following indications were specifically included:<BR/>1. computerised physician order entry (CPOE)<BR/>2. computerised physiological monitoring <BR/>3. diagnostic systems<BR/>4. prognostic systems.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary outcome measures: <BR/>i. mortality within the first 28 days of life<BR/>ii. mortality within the first year of life<BR/>iii. effects (e.g. improvement, or otherwise, in diagnostic accuracy, time-saving, more efficient use of resources) on physician or nursing staff performance</P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures: <BR/>i. staff's satisfaction or compliance <BR/>ii. costs (cost of introducing the system, cost reduction in patient care)</P>
<P>Outcome measures specific to the type of CDSS:<BR/>1. CPOE systems - incidence of adverse drug events<BR/>2. computerised physiological monitoring - short-term physiological parameters (e.g. arterial blood gases, blood pressure) within the follow-up period<BR/>3. diagnostic systems - accuracy (level of agreement with physicians) and reliability<BR/>4. prognostic systems - accuracy (level of agreement with physicians) and reliability</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-21 09:02:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Computer decision support systems (CDSS) comprise a heterogeneous group of interventions. The definition of CDSS in MeSH states that CDSS incorporate information systems that use patient specific data and other clinical data to assist decision-making for an individual patient (<LINK REF="REF-NLM-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NLM 2001</LINK>). In our search, we found that even though most of the studies identified fall within this definition, there are some systems that are borderline - they have features both of CDSS and of computerised medical equipment where human decisions are not involved. That said, it was useful to begin the process of categorising computer systems for decision support as they will undoubtedly become ubiquitous in the future.</P>
<P>Besides being a heterogeneous group in terms of their underlying software or logic engine, it was also clear that the functions for which the CDSS had been designed are also heterogeneous. Again, it was useful to have a priori definitions on the areas of neonatal medicine where CDSS could be important.</P>
<P>The search strategy was comprehensive. One criticism may be the choice of databases that were searched. The search involved predominantly clinical databases, less so computer science and engineering databases. However, the question to be answered in the protocol was the effectiveness of CDSS vis-a-vis clinical care of newborn infants; hence the choice of databases searched was appropriate.</P>
<P>It is pertinent to consider the issue of outcome measures. While there is ongoing debate regarding the outcomes that should be measured, it is clear that the bottom line is improvement to either patient outcomes or physician performance. Indeed, improvement in these outcomes is precisely the raison d'etre for CDSS. Although we did not assess outcomes such as performance of the CDSS within the organisation, ultimately it is the clinical outcomes such as survival and staff performance that are most important.</P>
<P>

<B>Computer-aided prescribing</B>

<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Cade-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cade 1997</LINK> was a short-term study investigating the effects on computer-aided PN ordering on short-term measures. It did not address longer-term outcome like survival, growth, and morbidity. There was also no measurement of the effect of CDSS on the performance of the doctors when using the software. In particular, there were no attempts to study the effect on error rates. Although useful for measuring short-term outcomes, this study suffered from small sample size and did not address long-term outcome issues.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Balaguer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Balaguer 2001</LINK> was a study that used simulated clinical cases rather than actual patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of both medical and nursing staff in the neonatal setting in calculating drug dosages and drug dilutions, respectively. It did study the important issue of drug errors, particularly in dosaging errors. Although the cases were simulated, they did mirror actual clinical practice on any neonatal unit. Furthermore, in the original protocol for this review, the use of simulated or hypothetical cases was not a criterion for exclusion.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Computer-aided monitoring</B>
</I>
<BR/>Overall, <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1998</LINK> was a well-conducted large, single-centre randomised controlled trial. However, there were some methodological issues in this study. Approximately one quarter (23.6%) of the infants were randomised into two groups where computerised trend monitoring was used on alternate days (i.e. on odd and even days, respectively). Although the aim of this design was to test if just monitoring itself had any short-term effects (and it did not), the net result was that there were fewer infants available for analysis for the short and medium-term outcomes. It was not possible to include data on a few outcomes such as days ventilated, days on oxygen supplementation in the meta-analysis as they were not published in a suitable format. There were problems with the outcome measures at one and two years even though follow-up was available in 93% of the cases. Twenty-two percent of the infants were assessed by pediatricians who were not involved in the study, and who used different measures of neurodevelopment from the research group who had used the Denver II scale. These important data was not included in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>It was not possible to analyse the effect on staff performance of the computerised monitoring as the study only set out to assess staff (and the infants' parents) attitudes and acceptance of the system through structured questionnaires. The frequency of blood gas samples was used as a proxy measure of impact on staff behaviour, i.e. in the ordering of blood gas analysis. A study (<LINK REF="REF-Griffith-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffith 1997</LINK>) had shown that less experienced medical staff ordered more blood gas analysis.</P>
<P>The search strategy also revealed some reports of computerised monitoring of newborn infants in intensive care, but none of them was a randomised controlled study. These reports were mainly of systems in the prototype stage of development (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1996</LINK>) or clinical experience with computerised monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Dugdale-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dugdale 1983</LINK>). It is often difficult to conduct a randomised control trial with enough power (by implication, usually requiring large numbers of subjects) with computerised systems because software and hardware upgrades and modifications occur constantly.</P>
<P>Finally, the conclusions from this review are probably limited in applicability. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 1998</LINK> used technology that was developed some years ago. Information technology is constantly evolving. In the future, there will be more advanced and sophisticated systems (using genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks) that would have greater capability. These systems would be expected to have different impact on the clinical care of the child. However, they should still be evaluated in randomised control studies.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There are insufficient data from randomised trials to determine the benefits or harms of CDSS in neonatal care.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Before CDSS are introduced the effects of the technology should be systematically studied using the randomised controlled study design (with either cluster randomisation or randomisation at the individual patient level).</P>

This study did not meet selection criteria as it used case simulations in measuring the effect of ES-MVN on the self-perceived performance of neonatal nurses (n=16). Furthermore, it used a pretest-posttest (before-after) design, not a randomised control study.</P>

<P>A study of AFES (Apgar expert system) a program using fuzzy logic, to assign Apgar scores for newborn infants. Three versions of AFES was devised, from the knowledge of inexperienced obstetrician, experienced obstetrician and experienced neonatologist. This study described 267 infants who were assessed by an obstetrician 1 minute after birth, and given their Apgar scores. The performance of the AFES in giving the Apgar scores was compared to that of the obstetrician. The performance of the AFES derived from the knowledge of neonatologists performed significantly better than the other AFES. This was not a randomised control study.</P>
