<P>No trials to say if specific programs in the workplace help to increase the duration of breastfeeding.</P>
<P>Breastfeeding is beneficial for mothers and their infants. However, working mothers may return to work early after giving birth for various reasons. If not supported by their employers, they can be separated from their babies, have difficulty expressing and storing milk and thus not be able to maintain breastfeeding. Workplace programs could help women to continue to breastfeed, and some programs may help women to initiate breastfeeding. By promoting and supporting the programs, employers may be able to influence the duration of breastfeeding (including exclusive breastfeeding) and so improve the health of mother and baby, but also benefit from less work absenteeism, high productivity and increased employee morale and retention. This review aimed to assess workplace programs to promote breastfeeding among employed women returning to work after the birth of their child. There were no randomised controlled trials identified that evaluated this important public health intervention in a workplace. Trials are needed to establish the impact of workplace interventions (including creches and nurseries) to support or facilitate continuation, duration and exclusiveness of breastfeeding for employed women returning to work after giving birth.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>In recent years there has been a rise in the participation rate of women in employment. Some may become pregnant while in employment and subsequently deliver their babies. Most may decide to return early to work after giving birth for various reasons. Unless these mothers get support from their employers and fellow employees, they might give up breastfeeding when they return to work. As a result, the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding to the recommended age of the babies would be affected. </P>
<P>Workplace environment can play a positive role to promote breastfeeding. For women going back to work, various types of workplace support interventions are available and this should not be ignored by employers. Notably, promoting breastfeeding in a workplace may have benefits for the women, the baby and also the employer.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-09-07 13:30:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Women of childbearing age constitute a high proportion of the workforce and make significant contributions to national economies. In industrialised countries where the collection of organised statistics allows the easy estimation of their numbers, women of childbearing age represent anywhere from 45% to 60% of the total labour force (<LINK REF="REF-ABS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ABS 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Statcan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Statcan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UK-Office-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK Office 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-US-Census-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">US Census 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Women of childbearing age may become pregnant during employment and many of them may decide to return to work after the birth of their babies. Unless supported by their employers, this return to employment can be a barrier to breastfeeding because they can be separated from their babies and it may impact on the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Osis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Visness-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Visness 1997</LINK>). If they are not supported, women may decide to entirely wean their children when returning to work (<LINK REF="REF-Arthur-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arthur 2003</LINK>). It is encouraging to know that most women report the desire to continue breastfeeding after returning to work if they have access to facilities, work flexible hours and take rest breaks during working hours (<LINK REF="REF-Kosmala_x002d_Anderson2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosmala-Anderson2006</LINK>). In addition, a large number of working mothers can continue breastfeeding for six months (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ortiz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortiz 2004</LINK>) if the workplace is ideal and supportive. </P>
<P>Workplace intervention may also have a positive impact on breastfeeding initiation. A study from the US showed that among working mothers enrolled in an employer-sponsored lactation program, breastfeeding was initiated by 97.5% of the women (<LINK REF="REF-Ortiz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortiz 2004</LINK>). Hence, workplace interventions could have a positive impact on both initiation and duration of breastfeeding.</P>
<P>The range of health benefits of breastfeeding for infants and mothers are well documented. The benefits of breastfeeding also extend to employers, as it reduces work absenteeism and increases employee morale and retention (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1995</LINK>). Similarly, if employers support breastfeeding in the workplace, women who continue to breastfeed after returning to work miss less time from work because of baby-related illnesses, and have shorter absenteeism when they do miss work (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1995</LINK>). The public health benefits of continued breastfeeding are improved maternal (<LINK REF="REF-CGHFBC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">CGHFBC 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Labbok--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Labbok 2001</LINK>) and infant health (<LINK REF="REF-Bick-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bick 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dewey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dewey 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gillman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mortensen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mortensen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Exclusive breastfeeding for at least the first six months of life is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). This recommendation is evidence-based and adherence to it improves infants' outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2001</LINK>), such as decreased risk of gastrointestinal tract infections and atopic eczema in the first year of life (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2001</LINK>). Unfortunately, a minority of the world's infants (35%) are exclusively breastfed beyond the first three to four months of age (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>), and even this is short of the duration recommended by the WHO. Information about breastfeeding by employed versus unemployed women is not available. However, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding rates for all women varies worldwide. In industrialised countries like Australia and the US, 54% and 41.1% of women exclusively breastfeed for three months, and 32% and 14.2% for six months, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-ABS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ABS 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2004</LINK>). In developing countries such as Kenya, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Turkey, the exclusive breastfeeding rate for three months by working mothers ranges from 13% to 59% (<LINK REF="REF-Dearden-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dearden 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haider-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haider 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lakati-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lakati 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yilmaz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yilmaz 2002</LINK>). Overall, these rates are low. </P>
<P>To reach the WHO's recommendation of six months of exclusive breastfeeding, women need a supportive environment (at home and work) that protects and promotes breastfeeding. For women in the workforce, merging breastfeeding and paid work is difficult. Undoubtedly, workplaces are excellent settings for interventions to encourage and assist the initiation and continuation of exclusive breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NSW-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSW 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ortiz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortiz 2004</LINK>). However, women face various barriers in the workplace, and the type of support and information needed to encourage them to continue breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Zinn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zinn 2000</LINK>) has yet to be fully identified and addressed by all parties. In this regard, policies at the level of both the government and employers may be warranted.</P>
<P>Various types of workplace strategies are available to support the promotion of breastfeeding. They include maternity leave provisions; flexible employment practices; lactation breaks; and physical facilities such as private rooms and access to refrigeration (<LINK REF="REF-NSW-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSW 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rea-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rea 2004</LINK>). To date, few workplace interventions have been implemented and their findings reported in the literature. In one study conducted at two separate sites, 75% of participants in a program which involved access to a worksite breast pump room, along with counselling from a lactation professional, continued to breastfeed their children to six months of age (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1994</LINK>). Another study demonstrated that 58% of women provided with access to a worksite breast pump room, services of a certified lactation consultant and a class on the benefits of breastfeeding continued to breastfeed their children to six months of age (<LINK REF="REF-Ortiz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ortiz 2004</LINK>). In addition, a description of a breastfeeding promotion program targeted at fathers has been described in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2002</LINK>). None of these studies, however, were experimental, as they did not compare the interventions to control groups. In general, to achieve high rates of both breastfeeding and women's employment, socio-cultural support and labour market, health and early childhood policies are vital (<LINK REF="REF-Galtry-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galtry 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The WHO and UNICEF have initiated the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding. The strategy highlights the priority actions, duties and responsibilities of various organisations and calls for governments to pass imaginative legislation to protect the rights of working women to breastfeed, and to establish the means to enforce these policies, which are consistent with international labour standards (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_UNICEF-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/UNICEF 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>To date, various systematic reviews addressing issues associated with breastfeeding have been conducted and reported in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, including 'Early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy newborn infants' (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2003</LINK>), 'Interventions for promoting the initiation of breastfeeding' (<LINK REF="REF-Dyson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyson 2005</LINK>), 'Optimal duration of exclusive breastfeeding' (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2002</LINK>), and 'Breastfeeding or breast milk for procedural pain in neonates' (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2006</LINK>). In addition, one other review, on 'Breast feeding and development of childhood wheeze', is currently underway (<LINK REF="REF-Ram-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2002</LINK>). However, none of these reviews are explicit to mechanisms for facilitating breastfeeding among women in employment. This review assessed the interventions in the workplace to support, encourage and promote breastfeeding among working mothers. </P>

<P>
<BR/>We planned to conduct subgroup analyses classifying whole trials by interaction tests as described by <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>, and by trial quality (trials with adequate concealment of allocation versus others). We considered using funnel plots to examine publication bias as recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>We planned to explore the effects of trial quality. This would have involved analysis based on an A, B, C or D rating of selection bias and attrition bias. We would have excluded studies of poor quality in the analysis (those rating B, C or D) in order to assess for any substantive difference to the overall result. If the trial quality was related to selection bias alone, the plan was to perform sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of trial quality assessed by concealment of allocation, by excluding studies with clearly inadequate allocation of concealment (rated C).</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>We identified no randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared the effects of workplace intervention on initiation, continuation, duration or exclusiveness of breastfeeding among employed women returning to work after giving birth. Likewise, the impact of such intervention on outcomes related to mothers, infants or employers, are unknown.</P>
<P>This systematic review has some potential limitations. First, we excluded workplace interventions during pregnancy and focused only on interventions postdelivery. Second, we only searched for published trials and did not attempt to identify or search for unpublished or ongoing trials. However, the strengths of this review have to be highlighted: first, our search was comprehensive and included several social science databases; second, we applied no language restrictions; third, we planned to consider both randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials for inclusion. </P>
<P>There are several questions to be answered regarding workplace interventions for promoting breastfeeding in employed women returning to work after delivery. Explicitly, the type of intervention most effective in assisting women to continue breastfeeding their babies until six months of age, as recommended by the WHO. </P>
<P>In conclusion, supporting and promoting breastfeeding in the workplace carries a range of benefits to working mothers, and to their infants and employers as well. There is a need for methodologically rigorous randomised controlled trials to provide evidence on the relative benefits of workplace interventions to promote breastfeeding for mothers returning to work after the birth of a child. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials to indicate the effectiveness of any type of workplace intervention to promote breastfeeding among employed women returning to paid work after the birth of a child. Current sources of information on this important public health topic are limited to two US-based nonexperimental studies (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1995</LINK>). In both studies, the participants were self-selected and there were no true control groups. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>In most industrialised countries, there is workplace-related legislation or regulation, or both, to support women employees to continue breastfeeding when they return to work. Legislation has been passed to have an effect on breastfeeding. However no systematic evaluation has yet been done to assess the effects expected from the existing legislation and regulation. Hence, randomised controlled trials are required to evaluate and provide reliable evidence on the effectiveness of workplace-support intervention to promote breastfeeding among working mothers, in particular on the rate and duration, and whether breastfeeding is exclusive or partial. Future trials should also compare workplace intervention with no intervention, or two or more workplace interventions against each other, and assess the impact of the intervention on employer-related, mother-related and infant-level outcomes.</P>
