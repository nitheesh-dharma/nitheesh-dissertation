<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>ARF is a common complication of critically ill patients. Death rates are high despite technological advances in kidney replacement treatments, including the use of a dialyzer or artificial kidney to remove toxins from the blood. Dialyzers are manufactured with different materials and are classified as bioincompatible (BICM) or biocompatible (BCM), as they elicit different biological responses when they come into contact with blood. An initial reported benefit of BCM over BICM, was not confirmed by subsequent studies. In this systematic review, a meta-analysis combining results of several studies of patients with dialysis-requiring ARF, no clinical advantage was demonstrable with the use of BCM.<U>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Acute renal failure (ARF) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Some studies have reported a survival advantage among patients dialyzed with biocompatible membranes (BCM) compared to bioincompatible membranes (BICM). These findings were not consistently observed in subsequent studies.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To ascertain whether the use of BCM confers an advantage in either survival or recovery of renal function over the use of BICM in adult patients with ARF requiring intermittent hemodialysis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>), MEDLINE (from 1966), EMBASE (from 1980), the Mexican Index of Latin American Biomedical Journals IMBIOMED (from 1990), the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database LILACS (from 1982), and reference lists of articles.<BR/>
<I>Search date: January 2007</I>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing the use of a BCM with a BICM in patients &gt; 18 years of age with ARF requiring intermittent hemodialysis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors extracted the data independently. Cellulose-derived dialysis membranes were classified as BICM, and synthetic dialyzers were considered as BCM. The main outcomes were all-cause mortality and recovery of renal function by type of dialyzer. We further explored these outcomes according to the flux properties (high-flux or low-flux) of each of these dialyzers. A meta-analysis was conducted by combining data using a random-effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Ten studies were included in the primary analysis of mortality, with a total of 1100 patients. None of the pooled risk ratios (RRs) reached statistical significance. The pooled RR for mortality was 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.07). The overall RR for recovery of renal function, which was inclusive of 1038 patients from nine studies, was 1.09 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.31). The pooled RR for mortality by dialyzer flux property was 1.05 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.37). The pooled RR for recovery of renal function by flux property was 1.30 (95% CI 0.83 to 2.02). A meta-analysis of mortality among kidney transplant recipients was not possible, however the analysis of recovery of renal function in this patient population revealed an RR of 1.05 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.26). Results of sensitivity analyses did not differ significantly from the primary analyses.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no demonstrable clinical advantage to the use of BCM versus BICM in patients with ARF who require intermittent hemodialysis.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-28 17:05:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Acute renal failure (ARF) is a syndrome characterized by a rapid decline (hours to weeks) in glomerular filtration rate and retention of nitrogenous waste products such as blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. ARF complicates approximately 5% of hospital admissions and up to 30% of admissions to intensive care units (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2004</LINK>), and is associated with a substantial morbidity and mortality. Current mortality rates range from 40% to 80% when renal replacement therapy (RRT) is required (<LINK REF="REF-Karsou-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karsou 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nolan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thadhani-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thadhani 1996</LINK>). This high mortality has not significantly decreased in the last 40 years despite advances in dialysis therapy, probably due to increasing disease complexity and patient age (<LINK REF="REF-Liano-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liano 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pascual-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascual 1997</LINK>). No conclusive evidence exists on the use of pharmacological agents to ameliorate recovery from ARF (<LINK REF="REF-Pascual-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascual 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Modalities of RRT include hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration. Intermittent hemodialysis is the most commonly used modality of RRT in ARF. Continuous therapies such as hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration have important international variations.</P>
<P>During hemodialysis, several factors may have an impact on outcomes in ARF. These factors include dialysis modality, type and performance characteristics of the dialysis membrane, and timing of initiation and adequacy of dialysis. Except for the type of dialysis membrane and the adequacy of dialysis, the link between these dialysis related factors and clinical outcomes remain largely unexplored.</P>
<P>Dialysis membranes are manufactured with different materials. They can be classified as biocompatible membranes (BCM) or as bioincompatible membranes (BICM), depending on the degree of complement and leukocyte activation that occurs when they come into contact with blood. However, neither all membranes considered as BCM nor all of those considered as BICM are equally biocompatible, as they elicit different degrees of biological responses.</P>
<P>Some clinical studies initially reported a survival advantage among patients dialyzed with BCM compared to BICM (<LINK REF="REF-Hakim-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hakim 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Himmelfarb-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Himmelfarb 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1995</LINK>). However, these findings have not been confirmed by subsequent studies (<LINK REF="STD-Albright-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Assouad-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Assouad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gastaldello-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gastaldello 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00f6_rres-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jörres 1999</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Kurtal-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kurtal 1995</LINK>). Furthermore, two published meta-analyses comparing the impact of dialysis membranes on clinical outcomes of patients with ARF yielded conflicting results (<LINK REF="REF-Jaber-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaber 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Subramanian-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subramanian 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Teehan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teehan 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>As a consequence, there is no consensus regarding the preferred dialysis membrane among patients with ARF requiring dialysis.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this meta-analysis was to ascertain whether the use of BCM confers an advantage in either survival or recovery of renal function over the use of BICM to adult patients with ARF requiring intermittent hemodialysis.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2008-08-28 17:05:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Published and unpublished reports of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (studies in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) of patients with ARF (as defined in the individual studies) requiring intermittent hemodialysis, comparing biocompatible to bioincompatible dialyzer membranes.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>The studies were restricted to hospitalized patients older than 18 years of age with ARF requiring intermittent hemodialysis and presumable hemodynamic stability, otherwise patients would have required continuous RRT. Patients were drawn from either medical or surgical services (wards and intensive care units). A subgroup analysis included kidney transplant recipients with delayed allograft function.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Studies comparing cellulose-derived membranes to synthetic membranes were retained. For the purpose of this review, all synthetic dialyzers were defined as biocompatible, and all cellulose-derived dialyzers as bioincompatible.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome of this analysis was mortality within the study period. Although not uniformly reported in the individual studies, we considered recovery of renal function (defined by the discontinuation of dialysis) as a secondary outcome.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>We searched the medical literature for clinical studies examining the effect of dialysis membranes in humans with ARF. The following data sources were searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in <I>The Cochrane Library - </I>Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2007), EMBASE (1980 to January 2007), the Mexican Index of Latin American Biomedical Journals IMBIOMED (1990 to January 2007) and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database LILACS (1982 to January 2007).</P>
<P>Medical subject headings and key words used for search included: acute kidney failure, acute renal failure, ARF, biomaterial, biocompatible material, artificial membrane, hollow fiber membrane, dialysis, dialysis membrane, and combinations of these terms. (See Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> - <I>Electronic search strategies).</I>
</P>
<P>We also manually searched references cited in review articles and published studies, as well as abstracts published in proceedings of meetings related to nephrology, dialysis and artificial organs.</P>
<P>To minimize the effect of publication bias, both full-length published articles as well as abstracts were included in the review. If the same group of authors published more than one paper of the same study, data from the most inclusive report were retrieved to avoid duplication bias. Location and language biases were minimized by including non-English language and Latin American databases in our searches. Finally, data from an unpublished study was also included in some of the analyses.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-28 16:42:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Two authors (AA and BLJ) extracted the data independently, and differences were resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>Cellulose-derived dialysis membranes with high complement-inducing potential were classified as BICM. These dialyzers are made of unsubstituted cellulose (cuprophan, CU) and substituted cellulose (cellulose acetate, CA) material. Although CA has a lower complement-activating potential compared with CU (<LINK REF="REF-Pascual-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascual 1997</LINK>), this membrane was classified as bioincompatible, because complement levels during dialysis with this membrane are higher than with synthetic membranes. Dialysis membranes manufactured with synthetic polymers including polysulfone (PS), polyamide (PA), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), were classified as BCM due to minimal complement activation.</P>
<P>The flux intervention was defined by the porosity of the dialysis membrane: the flux was classified as low if the manufacturer's mean &#946;<SUB>2</SUB>-microglobulin clearance was less than 10 mL/min and as high if the ultrafiltration coefficient was more than 14 mL/h/mm Hg and the mean &#946;<SUB>2</SUB>-microglobulin clearance was more than 20 mL/min.</P>

<P>The primary outcome was death within the study period, by group of membrane composition. This outcome was summarized for each treatment group in each individual study. We retrieved the total number of patients in each selected study. The proportion of patients who died was calculated in each dialyzer group. Analyses were performed to obtain the pooled risk ratio (RR) with the use of a random-effects model. Studies were sorted by dialyzer type for subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>We have also attempted to assess the recovery of renal function. This secondary outcome was not uniformly reported in the individual studies, and was either not evaluated, or was defined as the duration of dialysis (in days), or as the number of dialysis sessions performed before the need for dialysis support ceased. For the purpose of this meta-analysis, recovery of renal function was defined by discontinuation of dialysis during the study period.</P>
<P>The analysis on flux property was performed on studies that compared low-flux with high-flux dialyzers. For studies inclusive of kidney transplant recipients with delayed allograft function we assessed both mortality and recovery of renal function.</P>
<P>A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess all cause mortality and recovery of renal function including all the studies. In separate sensitivity analyses, we excluded a study that has not been published in neither full-text nor abstract form, and included and excluded the studies of transplant recipients. Two other sensitivity analyses were performed by including a study comparing biocompatible membranes with different flux properties. Finally, the covariates described above were extracted and tabulated.</P>
<P>We subdivided outcomes into CU and CA for the analyses in the BICM group, to assess if those would have any difference.</P>
<P>We also performed sensitivity analyses using a fixed-effect model and the same combinations and pooling of data described above.</P>
<P>The data are presented as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
<P>Heterogeneity was analyzed using a Chi² test on N-1 degrees of freedom, with an alpha of 0.1 used for statistical significance and with the I² test (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>Of note, Schiffl published two articles involving overlapping patient populations. The first report (<LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1994</LINK>) had a total of 52 patients and was inclusive of data on recovery of renal function.

Despite a questioned validity of the data of the second report (<LINK REF="STD-Shaldon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Shaldon 1997</LINK>), we used the first report in the analyses of recovery of renal function and the second report for the analyses of mortality. Hence, 10 studies described in a total of 11 articles were left for the primary analyses.</P>
<P>Finally, one study comparing low-flux to high-flux BCMs (<LINK REF="STD-Ponikvar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ponikvar 2001</LINK>) was included in sensitivity analyses to further explore the influence of the flux property of the dialyzer membrane on clinical outcomes.</P>

<P>The characteristics of the included studies are described in the table - <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>The studies included in the primary analyses used a randomized or quasi-randomized, controlled study design. Two studies were multicenter studies (<LINK REF="STD-Himmelfarb-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Himmelfarb 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00f6_rres-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jörres 1999</LINK>). Seven studies used appropriate randomized allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Assouad-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Assouad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Balasubramaniam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Balasubramaniam 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gastaldello-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gastaldello 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00f6_rres-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jörres 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kes 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1995</LINK>), and two studies assigned patients to the treatment or control group by alternating order (<LINK REF="STD-Himmelfarb-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Himmelfarb 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kurtal-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kurtal 1995</LINK>). One study initially randomized patients appropriately, but subsequently allocated dialyzers using an alternating order (<LINK REF="STD-Albright-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 2000</LINK>). Only one study attempted to minimize intentional and unintentional biases by the creation of a separate randomization facility for the dialyzer allocation procedure (<LINK REF="STD-J_x00f6_rres-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jörres 1999</LINK>). None of the studies were blinded, therefore, despite the elimination of the influence of confounding variables that were present at the time of randomization, all studies were confounded by variables that developed during the follow-up period.</P>
<P>Most studies included both medical and surgical adult patients with ARF. Uniformly reported exclusion criteria for patients included acute glomerulonephritis, previous hemodialysis, need for continuous RRT, or pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD). The definition of pre-existing CKD was heterogeneous and was reported in only four of the studies: serum creatinine &#8805; 2.5 mg/dL (<LINK REF="STD-Gastaldello-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gastaldello 2000</LINK>), serum creatinine &#8805; 3 mg/dL (<LINK REF="STD-J_x00f6_rres-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jörres 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Albright-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 2000</LINK>) or estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 40 mL/min (<LINK REF="STD-Himmelfarb-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Himmelfarb 1998</LINK>). The study by Schiffl <I>et al</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1995</LINK>) excluded patients with sepsis at baseline. There was no available data on sepsis at study entry in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Assouad-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Assouad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kes 2003</LINK>). Similarly, there was no available data on oliguria at the study entry in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Assouad-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Assouad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kes 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kurtal-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kurtal 1995</LINK>). Finally, one study included only patients with diarrhea-induced ARF (<LINK REF="STD-Balasubramaniam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Balasubramaniam 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five studies compared the use of a BCM versus a CA-BICM (<LINK REF="STD-Albright-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Assouad-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Assouad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gastaldello-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gastaldello 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kes 2003</LINK>). The remaining five studies compared BCM to CU membranes (<LINK REF="STD-Balasubramaniam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Balasubramaniam 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Himmelfarb-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Himmelfarb 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00f6_rres-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jörres 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kurtal-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kurtal 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1995</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Himmelfarb-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Himmelfarb 1998</LINK>) used two types of BCM dialyzers (PMMA and PS) compared to CU-BICM. One study failed to indicate the type of BCM dialyzers that were used (<LINK REF="STD-Kes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kes 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The studies differed in the flux properties of the dialyzers. While three studies evaluated a high-flux BCM with a low-flux BICM (<LINK REF="STD-Albright-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kurtal-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kurtal 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1995</LINK>), two studies compared a low-flux BCM with a low-flux BICM (<LINK REF="STD-Jaber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00f6_rres-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jörres 1999</LINK>). Two studies failed to provide data on the flux property of the BCM dialyzer (<LINK REF="STD-Assouad-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Assouad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Balasubramaniam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Balasubramaniam 1998</LINK>). In one study, there were three groups of patients randomized to a low-flux BICM, a low-flux BCM and a high-flux BCM (<LINK REF="STD-Gastaldello-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gastaldello 2000</LINK>). Other study had four groups, two groups of either flux property of both BCM and BICM (<LINK REF="STD-Kes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kes 2003</LINK>). For the purpose of this meta-analysis, the BCM groups were combined for comparison with the BICM groups for mortality and recovery of renal function by membrane composition, and the low and high-flux groups were combined for comparison of the outcomes by flux property of the dialyzer. Therefore, for the purpose of flux property analyses, only high-flux groups compared with low-flux groups were pooled, leaving only five studies available for this particular type of analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Albright-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gastaldello-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gastaldello 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kes 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kurtal-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kurtal 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1995</LINK>), whereas 10 studies were available for analyses of mortality and recovery of renal function.</P>
<P>In the studies included in the primary analyses, the mean age of patients ranged from 57 to 70 years. The mean follow up ranged from 21 to 90 days. The mean APACHE II score ranged from 21 to 28. Differences of these variables were not statistically significant between the two groups.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analyses of studies inclusive of kidney transplant recipients</HEADING>
<P>We analyzed the four studies inclusive of kidney transplant recipients with delayed allograft function (<LINK REF="STD-Michael-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Michael (Tx) 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romao-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Romao (Tx) 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valeri-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Valeri (Tx) 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woo-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Woo (Tx) 2002</LINK>). All four studies were randomized appropriately. They excluded patients with acute rejection and primary non-function. Two used a PS-BCM dialyzer (<LINK REF="STD-Romao-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Romao (Tx) 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woo-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Woo (Tx) 2002</LINK>) and two used a PMMA-BCM (<LINK REF="STD-Michael-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Michael (Tx) 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valeri-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Valeri (Tx) 1996</LINK>). All four studies used a CU dialyzer in the BICM group. For the assessment of mortality we used data from the intention-to-treat analysis of one study (<LINK REF="STD-Valeri-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Valeri (Tx) 1996</LINK>). The other studies did not report deaths, and were therefore excluded from the pooled analysis of mortality, as there was no estimable data available.</P>
<P>For the analysis of recovery of renal function, we used data from the intention-to-treat analysis of <LINK REF="STD-Valeri-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Valeri (Tx) 1996</LINK> and data from the initial randomization of the study by <LINK REF="STD-Woo-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Woo (Tx) 2002</LINK>. We considered patients with rejection from the study of <LINK REF="STD-Romao-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Romao (Tx) 1999</LINK>, as patients who failed to recover their renal function and included them in the pooled analysis.</P>
<P>Follow up ranged from 21 to 30 days. One study had a long-term patient and allograft survival re-assessment at two years after transplantation (<LINK REF="STD-Valeri-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Valeri (Tx) 1996</LINK>). Mean age in these studies ranged from 35 to 50 years. Of interest, age was significantly different between the BCM and the BICM groups of <LINK REF="STD-Romao-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Romao (Tx) 1999</LINK>. No other baseline characteristics were different in the three studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>We decided to include kidney transplant recipients in the sensitivity analyses of both all-cause mortality and recovery of renal function.</P>
<P>One study has not been published in either full-text or abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-Jaber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 2004</LINK>). We therefore decided to perform sensitivity analyses (1) excluding this study and, (2) excluding this study but including the studies of kidney transplant recipients.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Jaber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 2004</LINK> and the studies of kidney transplant recipients (<LINK REF="STD-Michael-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Michael (Tx) 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romao-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Romao (Tx) 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valeri-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Valeri (Tx) 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woo-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Woo (Tx) 2002</LINK>) compared low-flux BCM with low-flux BICM. Therefore, none of these five studies were included in the flux modality analyses. Sensitivity analyses of flux assessment including or removing these studies were not necessary.</P>
<P>Finally, sensitivity analyses of mortality and recovery of renal function were performed including a study comparing a low-flux PS-BCM with a high-flux PAN-BCM (<LINK REF="STD-Ponikvar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ponikvar 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the sensitivity analyses using the fixed-effect model, we used the same studies and combinations and pooling of data described in the methods section.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analyses of covariates</HEADING>
<P>We attempted to evaluate the following covariates that may have influenced the results of individual studies: age at study entry, APACHE II score, number of patients with oliguric ARF (defined as urine output of less than 400 mL/d), and sepsis at time of randomization. These variables have been described above. However, we found inconsistent reporting of these covariates in independent studies, and analyses with these covariates were not possible.</P>
<P>Four studies did not provide data on mean age of patients (<LINK REF="STD-Assouad-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Assouad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Balasubramaniam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Balasubramaniam 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kes 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michael-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Michael (Tx) 1995</LINK>). One study did not provide mean age, but provided ranges (<LINK REF="STD-Albright-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 2000</LINK>); the median age in this study was in the range between 60 and 70 years.</P>
<P>Eight studies did not provide APACHE II scores (<LINK REF="STD-Assouad-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Assouad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Balasubramaniam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Balasubramaniam 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kes 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michael-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Michael (Tx) 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romao-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Romao (Tx) 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valeri-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Valeri (Tx) 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woo-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Woo (Tx) 2002</LINK>).

<P>The one study included in the sensitivity analyses of membrane flux (<LINK REF="STD-Ponikvar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ponikvar 2001</LINK>) provided information on all of the covariates. However, these covariates were not tabulated, as this study did not compare a BCM to a BICM.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>All studies included in the primary analyses were RCTs or quasi-RCTs. For studies included in the primary analyses, randomized allocation was appropriate in seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Assouad-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Assouad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Balasubramaniam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Balasubramaniam 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gastaldello-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gastaldello 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00f6_rres-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jörres 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kes 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1995</LINK>), whereas in the remaining three studies, patients were assigned to the treatment or control group by alternating order (<LINK REF="STD-Himmelfarb-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Himmelfarb 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kurtal-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kurtal 1995</LINK>), or through partial randomization and alternating order (<LINK REF="STD-Albright-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Albright 2000</LINK>). It is remarkable to mention that not a single study was blinded. The four studies inclusive of kidney transplant recipients with delayed allograft function had appropriate randomization (<LINK REF="STD-Michael-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Michael (Tx) 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romao-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Romao (Tx) 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valeri-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Valeri (Tx) 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woo-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Woo (Tx) 2002</LINK>).

<I>)</I>, with a total of 1100 patients. There were 575 patients in the BCM group and 525 patients in the BICM group. The number of deaths was 241 and 228, respectively. The pooled RR for mortality was 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.07), a trend in favor of BCM. Only one study had a significant RR favoring the use of a BCM (<LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1995</LINK>).

<P>In subgroup analyses, the RR for mortality of the BCM versus CA dialyzer was 1.03 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.23). The RR for mortality of the BCM versus CU was 0.82 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.03).</P>
<P>A total of nine studies with 1038 patients were available for analysis of recovery of renal function <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

The overall RR for recovery of renal function was 1.09 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.31).

The pooled RR was 1.05 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.37). <LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1995</LINK> appeared to be an outlier, as it was the only study that reached a significant difference in favor of high-flux membranes.</P>
<P>A total of 631 patients from five studies were assessed for recovery of renal function (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).

<P>One study did not report mortality data (<LINK REF="STD-Michael-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Michael (Tx) 1995</LINK>) and two studies of kidney transplant recipients had no analyzable data on mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Romao-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Romao (Tx) 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woo-_x0028_Tx_x0029_-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Woo (Tx) 2002</LINK>). Therefore, a pooled analysis of mortality was not possible. Only one study reported deaths (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>) with a non-significant RR of 0.22 (95% CI 0.03 to 1.79) in the direction of favoring BCM. On the other hand, all four studies, with a total of 163 patients were available for pooled analysis of recovery of renal function (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>).

<P>A sensitivity analysis for mortality (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>) including data from the 13 estimable studies, with a total of 1240 patients, showed a RR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.06).</P>
<P>We evaluated 1201 patients of the 13 studies available for analysis of recovery of renal function (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). The RR was 1.07 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.38).</P>
<P>Further analyses excluding <LINK REF="STD-Jaber-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 2004</LINK>, with or without including studies of kidney transplant recipients did not differ significantly from the former analyses of mortality and recovery of renal function.</P>
<P>The sensitivity analyses of flux property with the inclusion of the study comparing two BCMs (<LINK REF="STD-Ponikvar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ponikvar 2001</LINK>) did not reveal differences.

<P>We also included analyses of the same groups of data using a fixed-effect model. There was no difference in the analyses of all-cause mortality by either membrane composition or flux property. Interestingly, for the outcome of recovery of renal function by membrane composition, in the subgroup of studies comparing a synthetic (BCM) versus CU (BICM), there was a statistically significant advantage favoring BCM membranes over CU membranes, with a RR of 1.26 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.51). The pooled analysis including the CA studies was not significant, however. Similarly, there appeared to be an advantage of high-flux membranes over low-flux membranes for the outcome of recovery of renal function, with a RR of 1.46 (95% CI 1.28 to 1.67). When we incorporated the studies of kidney transplant recipients, the CU versus synthetic subgroup became statistically significant for the outcome of all-cause mortality, favoring BCM, with a RR of 0.80 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.99). Regardless, the pooled analysis inclusive of the CA studies remained without statistical significance. Those differences were also seen for recovery of renal function when we included kidney transplant recipients, with a RR of 1.19 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.35), favoring BCM over CU membranes. Again, when all the studies were included, there was no statistically significant difference between BCM and BICM.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-28 16:43:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>During hemodialysis, exposure of blood to the dialysis membrane can elicit biological responses of circulating cells and plasma components. The magnitude of leukocyte activation has been used as an index of biocompatibility (<LINK REF="REF-Pereira-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pereira 1999</LINK>). These blood-membrane interactions have been linked to adverse clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Bloembergen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloembergen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hakim-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hakim 1996</LINK>). Unlike patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), in whom these interactions have been primarily studied (<LINK REF="REF-Pereira-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pereira 1999</LINK>), patients with ARF who require dialysis are often critically ill and have sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Breen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breen 1998</LINK>). Consequently, the biological responses to membrane biocompatibility among patients with ARF are more difficult to decipher, compared to patients with ESRD.</P>
<P>In 1994, <LINK REF="REF-Hakim-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hakim 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1994</LINK> published the initial results of two clinical studies examining the effect of BCM on clinical outcomes among patients with ARF. Both studies observed a significant recovery of renal function and a trend towards superior survival among patients dialyzed with BCM compared to BICM. The publication of these studies was followed by a major shift toward the use of synthetic membranes for patients with dialysis-requiring ARF. However, over the past decade, the benefit of synthetic membranes has not been validated in subsequent studies.</P>
<P>The contradictory conclusions drawn from the individual studies examined in this meta-analysis might result from an insufficient sample size, lack of standardization of protocols, and absence of blinding. Possible sources of variability include the definition of BCM and BICM, age, co-morbid conditions, severity of acute illness, etiology of ARF, presence of oliguria, dialysis membrane characteristics (e.g. surface area, efficiency and flux property), timing of dialysis initiation, intensity and adequacy of dialysis, follow-up duration, sample size and allocation concealment.</P>
<P>In addition, the purity of the dialysate might be another potential confounding factor influencing the lack of difference between the different dialyzer membranes. Studies in vitro demonstrate that the composition and flux property of the membrane can affect the permeability to bacterial endotoxin and other cytokine-inducing bacterial substances when a standard dialysate is used. This is particularly true with high-flux BCMs. By contrast, low-flux BICMs are less permeable to endotoxin and might be associated with less activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vivo studies suggest that higher dialysate purity is required if dialyzer membranes are more permeable to endotoxin. Nevertheless, while reduced targets for bacterial and endotoxin contamination improve the quality of dialysis, large randomized clinical studies are still needed to determine the true value of ultrapure dialysate and its impact on clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Bommer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bommer 2006</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Meta-analyses of the published literature allow similar clinical studies to be combined quantitatively, thereby, increasing the power and precision of the estimation of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Giatras-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giatras 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lau-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 1992</LINK>). Hence, we performed a meta-analysis to examine the effect of biocompatibility of dialysis membranes on mortality among patients with ARF.</P>
<P>Our meta-analysis failed to demonstrate a mortality or recovery of renal function difference between the two types of dialysis membranes. <LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1995</LINK> appeared to be an outlier in most analyses. In fact, this study included a large number of surgical patients that may have skewed the results. The validity of this study has been a matter of debate (<LINK REF="REF-Vanholder-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanholder 1999</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Himmelfarb-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Himmelfarb 1998</LINK>, only after adjusting the analysis for APACHE II score were the original authors able to demonstrate a significantly lower mortality rate among patients dialyzed with BCM. Although such finding warrants the need for meta-regression analyses to explore for interactions between the outcome and covariates, no such analyses were performed due to inconsistent reporting of the covariates, and insufficient variation in the reported values.</P>
<P>The choice of a random-effects model versus a fixed-effect model was based on our prior belief that heterogeneity was present. We included, however, some exploration of the data using a fixed-effect model as part of our sensitivity analyses. The fact that there were some discrepant results, mainly in the subgroups of studies comparing CU versus BCM, further strengthens the belief that the data comes from heterogeneous populations, and that the possibility of subgroup effects cannot be excluded. The random-effects model provides wider confidence intervals when heterogeneity is present. More future data, however might change that estimate or, if future studies of specific sub-populations are published (e.g. comparing CU versus BCM), meta-analyses of subgroups should be the focus. In summary, for the current meta-analysis, adding fixed-effect analyses and the data found with this model, enforces the idea that heterogeneity is present. As heterogeneity is present, the use of a random-effects model is more appropriate for the main analyses of the current meta-analysis. Given that limited current data exists, future studies would need to focus on subpopulations to confirm or refute the observations seen with the use of a fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>Publication bias may affect the results of pooled analyses. We attempted to partially account for this limitation by including abstracts, because negative studies may be more likely to remain unpublished after being presented in abstract form (<LINK REF="REF-Krzyzanowska-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krzyzanowska 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are several limitations to our meta-analysis that are worthy of mention. First, the definition of BCM and BICM adopted in this analysis assumes that all cellulose-derived and synthetic membranes behave similarly. Second, we included data derived from abstracts that had not undergone a peer review process, as well as an unpublished report. However, by doing so, we tried to minimize publication bias by including data derived from more studies. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that our results may have been affected by differences in the quality of studies, the inconsistent randomization process, the absence of a dialyzer blinding process, and the incomplete documentation of statistical procedures in the case of the abstracts. Finally, this meta-analysis is limited to summary measures of unadjusted mortality rates and to the duration of follow-up presented in each published report. Indeed, it does not allow for the use of survival analyses, which can consider the incomplete follow-up of individual persons. Pooled analyses of individual patient data would provide the opportunity to obtain information on potential confounding factors and adjust mortality analyses for the variables that are potentially important predictors of outcome such as age, APACHE II score, presence of sepsis or co-morbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, pulmonary or cardiac disease.</P>
<P>Although two studies suggested that the use of CU - considered the most bioincompatible membrane in terms of complement activation - was associated with higher mortality rates when compared with BCM (<LINK REF="STD-Himmelfarb-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Himmelfarb 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiffl-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schiffl 1995</LINK>), the biological mechanisms behind these potential benefits have not yet been elucidated. Many investigators have questioned the clinical relevance of blood-membrane interactions in the setting of ARF. In fact, the acuity of the illness that accompanies ARF is often associated with the activation of various pro- and anti-inflammatory cascades, which may obscure the consequences of these interactions between blood components and the dialysis membrane. In an attempt to address this concern, a study comparing the effect of a PS-BCM with a CA-BICM on leukocyte functions in patients with ARF failed to demonstrate an impact of these dialysis membranes on several cellular responses (<LINK REF="STD-Jaber-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results of this meta-analysis call into question the preferential use of BCM over BICM dialysis membranes for patients with ARF who require dialysis. However, this meta-analysis does not exclude the hypothesis that CU may indeed be the most bioincompatible membrane, and may be associated with worse outcomes in ARF.</P>
<P>A national survey of practicing nephrologists in the United States demonstrated that there was a trend towards the use of BCM for patients with ARF who require dialysis (<LINK REF="REF-Eid-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eid 1996</LINK>). In addition, these authors observed that high cost and unavailability of BCM were associated with their restricted, in-hospital use.</P>
<P>In summary, this meta-analysis did not demonstrate a survival advantage conferred by the use of BCM versus BICM dialyzers in patients with ARF who require hemodialysis. However, pooled analysis of individual patient-level data will be required to assess sources of variability among studies and to examine fatal and non-fatal outcomes of ARF, in particular, adjusted all-cause mortality rates, septic deaths and recovery of renal function. In the interim, there is no evidence of a survival disadvantage associated with the use of BICM. Consequently, if the cost between BCM and BICM does not require consideration, the use of either a BCM or a CA BICM would appear appropriate.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Discussion of other meta-analyses</HEADING>
<P>Two meta-analyses on this specific topic have previously been published with discordant results (<LINK REF="REF-Jaber-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaber 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Subramanian-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subramanian 2002</LINK>). In the first meta-analysis, <LINK REF="REF-Jaber-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaber 2002</LINK> examined seven studies, comprising two randomized controlled trials and five non-randomized controlled trials. Unsubstituted and substituted cellulose membranes were grouped together as BICM and compared to synthetic membranes, which were categorized as BCM. A total of 722 patients were examined, after selecting the most inclusive and updated studies in order to maximize the sample size. Overall death rate was not different between BCM and BICM (45% versus 46%). Using a random-effects model, the RR of death was not significantly lower among patients dialyzed with BCM (RR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.13; P = 0.44). The difference in the meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Jaber-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaber 2002</LINK> and the ensuing meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Subramanian-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subramanian 2002</LINK> is the addition of <LINK REF="STD-Neveu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Neveu 1996</LINK>, which markedly affected the overall result. Indeed, this publication was a prospective cohort study of patients with ARF, where dialysis modality was not limited to intermittent hemodialysis, and where dialysis membrane use reflected on the practice pattern of the participating centers. Of note, this observational study had more patients examined than any clinical study (N = 169). The inclusion of this study carried significant weight in the compiled meta-analysis, resulting in a statistically significant overall lower relative risk of death among patients dialyzed with BCM compared with BICM (RR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.98; P = 0.03). Neither meta-analysis demonstrated an overall impact of dialysis membranes on recovery of renal function.</P>
<P>The results of these two meta-analyses highlight the issue of study selection in systematic reviews. The rationale for selecting RCTs in a meta-analysis of treatments is to limit confounding factors and to insure more reliable estimates of treatment effects. RCTs provide the highest level of evidence, minimize bias, and help establish causality. Both meta-analyses are limited by the use of quasi-RCTs and non-RCTs. Although they may help reveal associations, non-RCTs are unable to overcome hidden confounders.</P>
