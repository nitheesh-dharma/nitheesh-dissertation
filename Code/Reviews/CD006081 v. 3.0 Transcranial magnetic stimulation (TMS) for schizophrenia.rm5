<B>Review Question</B>
<BR/>Is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) useful in treating people with schizophrenia?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a relatively new and sophisticated device-based therapy. TMS involves the skilful application of a strong magnetic field close to the surface of the scalp. The TMS device delivers strong and very brief magnetic pulses that stimulate the brain and its network of neurons. TMS is a relatively painless and non-invasive technique that stimulates parts of the brain (the cerebral cortex). Brain activity has been shown to differ in people with schizophrenia compared to other people.</P>
<P>People with schizophrenia often experience symptoms, such as hearing voices or seeing things (hallucinations), which fail to fully respond to medication. TMS has been proposed as a new treatment for people with schizophrenia, especially those who experience persistent auditory hallucinations. Antipsychotic medication also often has debilitating side effects, such as weight gain, apathy or lack or drive, and shaking. TMS could be an alternative treatment for people who do not cope well with standard medication.</P>
<P>
<B>Description of Studies</B>
</P>
<P>A search for trials was run in 2013 and 41 randomised controlled studies are now included in this review. The studies included people diagnosed with schizophrenia and randomised participants to receive either temporoparietal TMS, prefrontal TMS, sham TMS or standard care.</P>
<P>
<B>Results </B>
</P>
<P>At this time, there is not strong evidence to support the use of TMS to treat schizophrenia. Some very low-quality evidence appears to tentatively indicate that TMS may improve global state and certain symptoms such as hearing voices, compared to sham TMS. However, the research at present is not robust, consistent and standardised enough to support any firm conclusions about using TMS for schizophrenia.</P>
<P>There was no evidence to indicate TMS may improve symptoms of schizophrenia when used alongside the standard treatment of antipsychotic medication. There were also limitations related to differing TMS techniques. It was difficult to compare the results of studies in this review, as there were various different TMS procedures used, different symptom measures of schizophrenia, and data were limited. More robust and consistent research is therefore required. The authors of the review suggest that in the future, with more research, there is the possibility that TMS may be useful for treating some of the symptoms of schizophrenia.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-08-03 16:24:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2006, June 2008, April 2013). This register is compiled by methodical searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, CINAHL, Dissertation abstracts, LILACS, PSYNDEX, PsycINFO, RUSSMED, and Sociofile, and is supplemented with handsearching of relevant journals and numerous conference proceedings.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-06-17 13:49:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials recruiting at least five participants and comparing TMS with sham TMS or any other treatment for people with schizophrenia.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-08-03 16:24:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% CI. We used a fixed-effect model. We assessed overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-08-04 13:14:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 41 studies with 1473 participants in the review. We found significant differences in favour of temporoparietal TMS compared to sham TMS for global state measured on the CGI scale (7 RCTs, n = 224, MD -0.5, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.23, <I>very low-quality evidence</I>) and positive symptoms measured on the PANSS scale (5 RCTs, n = 127, MD -6.09, 95% CI -10.95 to -1.22, <I>very low-quality evidence</I>). Participants experienced significantly more headaches in the temporoparietal TMS group (10 RCTs, n = 392, RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.56 to 4.50, <I>very low-quality evidence</I>). However, no more participants left the study early from the TMS group than from the sham group (<I>very low-quality evidence</I>). Cognitive state was assessed using 39 different measures, and all were equivocal (<I>very low-quality evidence</I>)<I>.</I>
</P>
<P>We included only two trials which compared temporoparietal TMS with standard treatment. In both trials the participants received first- and second-generation antipsychotic medication in both treatment groups, therefore TMS was used an adjunctive therapy to medication. We found no significant differences in the number of participants that showed clinical improvement in global state (1 RCT, n = 100, RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.57) or left the study early (2 RCTs, n = 140, RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.46) (both <I>very low-quality evidence</I>). No studies reported on global state score, mental state, cognitive state and adverse effects.</P>
<P>For prefrontal TMS compared to sham TMS, global state was measured on three different scales, all of which presented equivocal results (<I>very low quality evidence</I>). We could not pool data for mental state on the PANSS scale due to high heterogeneity. Cognitive state was assessed using 19 different measures, with 15/19 being equivocal (<I>very low-quality evidence</I>)<I>.</I> Prefrontal TMS caused more headaches (6 RCTs, n = 164, RR 2.77, 95% CI 1.22 to 6.26, <I>very low-quality evidence</I>) but there was no difference in the number of participants leaving the study early (<I>very low-quality evidence</I>). No studies reported data for clinical improvement.</P>
<P>We found a significant difference in favour of prefrontal theta burst stimulation TMS compared to sham TMS for mental state on the PANNS scale (3 RCTs, n = 108, MD -5.71, 95% CI -9.32 to -2.10, <I>very low evidence</I>). We found no difference for clinical improvement, cognitive state, number of headaches, and leaving the study early (<I>very low-quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>None of the included studies reported satisfaction with care.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-08-03 16:24:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on this review, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of TMS to treat symptoms of schizophrenia. Although some evidence suggests that TMS, and in particular temporoparietal TMS, may improve certain symptoms (such as auditory hallucinations and positive symptoms of schizophrenia) compared to sham TMS, the results were not robust enough to be unequivocal across the assessment measures used. There was insufficient evidence to suggest any added benefit with TMS used as an adjunctive therapy to antipsychotic medication.</P>
<P>The overall quality of evidence was graded as <I>very low </I>due to risk of bias, and this was accompanied by an imprecision in estimates due to the relatively small number of participants in the studies. Thus, consideration is required in improving the quality of trial processes, as well as the quality of reporting of ongoing and future TMS trials, so as to facilitate accurate future judgements in assessing risk of bias. Differences in TMS techniques in relation to stimulation intensity, stimulation length, brain areas stimulated and variations in the design of sham TMS all contributed to the heterogeneity of study findings and limited the interpretation and applicability of the results. In addition, the trials assessed their outcomes with a variety of scales, and usable data were limited. Therefore, to better evaluate the treatment effects of TMS in people with schizophrenia, we favour the use of standardised treatment protocols and outcome measures.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-06-01 09:54:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lisa M McDermott">
<P>People with schizophrenia typically experience auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) or delusions (false beliefs) during acute episodes. Although several effective treatments are available, many patients have intractable symptoms that do not recover between acute episodes. In addition, motivation and social behaviour may also be adversely affected (negative symptoms). Relatively high numbers of people with schizophrenia have persistent symptoms in spite of apparently adequate drug treatment. In some cases treatment failure is associated with non-adherence, although it is understood that many people have enduring symptoms in spite of adequate treatment. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) could prove an alternative treatment for patients who do not cope well with standard medication.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-08-03 16:24:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a relatively new sophisticated device-based therapy which involves the skilful application of a strong magnetic field close to the surface of the scalp. The procedure is a non-invasive and relatively painless technique for stimulating the cerebral cortex and altering neuronal function (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 2003</LINK>). The device uses specifically-designed insulated wire coils which deliver strong and very brief magnetic pulses, passing from carefully chosen surface landmarks without hindrance into underlying brain regions. The magnetic field then induces small transient electrical currents in the neural circuitry of treated individuals. By varying the intensity, duration and frequency of the magnetic field, the neuronal systems may be excited or inhibited for as long as the current pulses in the coil (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 2002</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-08-03 16:24:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Brain activity has been shown to differ in people with schizophrenia compared to the brain activity of people who do not have this condition. Whereas activity in the temporoparietal cortex (TPC) appears to increase in people with schizophrenia experiencing auditory hallucinations (<LINK REF="REF-Shergill-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shergill 2000</LINK>), activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) appears to be reduced in people with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Weinberger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinberger 1996</LINK>). Reduced activity also appears to be correlated with negative symptoms (e.g. decreased motivation and social function) experienced by the patient. It is possible that by normalising activity in these brain regions, auditory hallucinations and negative symptoms would also improve.</P>
<P>Transcranial magnetic stimulation has been applied in several trials in two main paradigms: high-frequency TMS and low-frequency TMS. Low-frequency TMS (1 Hz) is typically applied to the left TPC of patients, aiming to decrease brain activity and reduce auditory hallucinations. High-frequency TMS is applied to left DLPFC in an attempt to increase activity and reduce negative symptoms. Low-frequency TMS is considered to inhibit cortical activity (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1997</LINK>) and high-frequency TMS generally increases cortical activity in stimulated areas (<LINK REF="REF-Pascual_x002d_Leone-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascual-Leone 1998</LINK>). Positive (<LINK REF="STD-Hoffman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffman 2005</LINK>) and negative (<LINK REF="STD-McIntosh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McIntosh 2004</LINK>) controlled studies have been published using both treatment approaches, and it is unclear whether TMS represents a significant treatment advance.</P>
<P>In schizophrenia, there is evidence of both decreased and increased cortical activity compared to unaffected controls, and in some cases the altered activity correlates with the presence of a known symptom of cognitive deficit. Studies have demonstrated an association between temporal lobe activity and auditory hallucinations in people with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Alfonso-2002" TYPE="STUDY">D'Alfonso 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poulet-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Poulet 2005</LINK>). Active stimulation has been found to significantly reduce hallucinations in comparison to sham stimulation (<LINK REF="STD-Hoffman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffman 2000</LINK>). Not all attempts at replication have unequivocally supported Hoffman's findings (<LINK REF="STD-McIntosh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McIntosh 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saba-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saba 2006b</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-08-03 16:24:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Placebo arms of TMS trials often use sham treatments. There are limitations to this approach; no satisfactory placebo condition has been established and individuals may not have identical expectations of real or sham TMS. Placebo or sham TMS should result in scalp and noise sensation identical to active TMS, without the cortical stimulation. Although noise sensation can be mimicked, generating the scalp sensation may also produce a therapeutic cortical stimulation. Avoiding the confounding of cortical stimulation with sham TMS yields a control arm of the trial which typically controls for noise sensation but not for scalp sensation. In trials which implement sham TMS, double-blinding of observer and participant is not guaranteed and estimated efficacy rates of TMS will possibly be confounded if participants are aware which treatment arm they are in.</P>
<P>Bearing in mind the limitations of the trial methodology and in the absence of an entirely inactive sham condition that mimics real TMS, this systematic review aims to evaluate the current evidence base of TMS in the treatment for schizophrenia. We wish to ascertain the efficacy and safety of TMS, explore sources of heterogeneity that might explain contradictory positive and negative effects, investigate whether pooled effect sizes can be derived and whether they are statistically robust, and lastly, provide recommendations where possible for future research.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Scale-derived data</HEADING>
<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if: a) the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and b) the measuring instrument is not written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial. Ideally the measuring instrument should either be a self report or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint) which can be difficult in unstable and difficult-to-measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided to primarily use endpoint data and only use change data if the former were not available. We combined endpoint and change data in the analysis as we used weighted mean differences rather than standardised mean differences throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>, chapter 9.4.5.2). All data in the analyses are endpoint data unless specifically noted as change data in the footnote of the analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we applied the following standards to all data before inclusion: a) standard deviations (SDs) and means were reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors; b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); c) if a scale started from a positive value (such as the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) which can have values from 30 to 210) we modified the calculation described above to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD &gt; (S - S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and endpoint and these rules can be applied. When continuous data were presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data were skewed or not. We entered skewed data from studies of fewer than 200 participants in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large, and we entered them into syntheses.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.5 Common measure</HEADING>
<P>To facilitate comparison between trials, we intended to convert variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we tried to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This could be done by identifying cut-off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. We generally assumed that if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>), we could consider this as a clinically significant response (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005b</LINK>). Data based on these thresholds were not available, so we used the primary cut-off presented by the original authors.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-08-03 16:24:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>ND and AM independently allocated trials from the 2006 and 2008 searches to Categories A or B in the review. When upgraded criteria for risk of bias became available, LMcD correspondingly upgraded the trial quality assessments using criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>). Two members of the Enhance Reviews team assessed the risk of bias of studies included from the 2013 search, also using the upgraded criteria. This set of criteria is based on evidence of associations between overestimate of effect and high risk of bias of the article, such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. When the raters disagreed, they made the final rating by consensus, with the involvement of another member of the review team. When there were inadequate details of randomisation and other characteristics of trials, we contacted authors of the studies in order to obtain further information. We reported non-concurrence in quality assessment, but if disputes arose as to the appropriate category to which a trial should be allocated, we resolved the matter by discussion. We noted the level of risk of bias in both the text of the review and in the 'Summary of findings' tables.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data pose problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. physiological or pharmacological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state, despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in schizophrenia, we only used data from the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>

The importance of the observed value of I² depends on: a) magnitude and direction of effects, and b) strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P value from Chi² test, or a confidence interval for I²). An I² estimate greater than or equal to 50% accompanied by a statistically significant Chi² statistic, we interpreted as possibly evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (Section 9.5.2 - <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>).

<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). These are described in Chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases, but are of limited power to detect small-study effects. We did not use funnel plots for any outcomes as there were 10 or fewer studies, or where all studies were of similar sizes; in the case of the adverse effect headache, we did not produce a funnel plot, as this outcome was not systematically reported by all studies. Had we used funnel plots, we would have sought statistical advice in their interpretation.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-08-06 13:13:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The fixed-effect model assumes each trial makes an estimate of a common effect size of the same population. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. The random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model. It puts added weight onto small studies, which are often the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. For this reason we favoured using fixed-effect models, employing random-effects only when investigating heterogeneity.</P>

For this review, we decided that should this occur with data contributing to the summary finding no more than around 10% of the total weighting, we would present the data. If not, we did not pool data, but discussed the issues. We know of no supporting research for this 10% cut-off but are investigating the use of prediction intervals as an alternative to this unsatisfactory state. When unanticipated clinical or methodological heterogeneity was obvious, we simply stated hypotheses regarding these for future reviews or versions of this review.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">5.1 Temporoparietal TMS</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-two studies used temporoparietal TMS, most using the left temporoparietal region, <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2005</LINK> also using right temporoparietal TMS, and <LINK REF="STD-NCT00308997" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00308997</LINK> using Wernicke's area and right homologous area. Most studies used low-frequency TMS with 1 Hz at 80 to 110% motor threshold; <LINK REF="STD-Hao-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hao 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2008</LINK> both used 10 Hz at 110% motor threshold, <LINK REF="STD-Saba-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Saba 2006a</LINK> used 1 Hz at 20% of motor threshold and <LINK REF="STD-Klirova-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Klirova 2010</LINK> used 0.9 Hz at 100% motor threshold. <LINK REF="STD-Blumberger-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberger 2012</LINK> included two TMS groups, one with priming TMS of 6 Hz at 90% motor threshold.</P>
<P>In regards to length of TMS stimulations, a wide variety were reported across studies, ranging from five sessions of one minute, with one minute gaps (<LINK REF="STD-Saba-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Saba 2006a</LINK>) to 12 sessions of 20 minutes each a day (<LINK REF="STD-Vercammen-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Vercammen 2009a</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Blumberger-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Blumberger 2012</LINK> used MRI-targeted TMS, and <LINK REF="STD-Klirova-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Klirova 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Slotema-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Slotema 2011</LINK> both included an MRI-targeted TMS arm and a non-targeted TMS arm. <LINK REF="STD-De-Jesus-2011" TYPE="STUDY">De Jesus 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoffman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffman 2005</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-McIntosh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McIntosh 2004</LINK> reported using the 10 - 20 EEG electrode position system. <LINK REF="STD-Rosenberg-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenberg 2012</LINK> used deep H1 coil TMS with single pulse stimulation, which allows stimulation of deeper brain areas.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">5.2 Prefrontal TMS</HEADING>
<P>Nineteen studies used prefrontal TMS, with most using left prefrontal TMS or left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex TMS. <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1999</LINK> reported using right prefrontal TMS and <LINK REF="STD-Barr-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Barr 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fitzgerald-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzgerald 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ren-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ren 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ren-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ren 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wing-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 2012</LINK> reported using bilateral prefrontal TMS.

Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2010</LINK>) used theta burst stimulation (TBS) TMS, in which 50 Hz are applied in bursts, and <LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2012</LINK> used three arms of TMS 10 Hz, 20 Hz and TBS (50 Hz).</P>
<P>In terms of stimulation length for each session of TMS, there was much variation reported across the studies. TMS ranged from two trains of one minute with a three-minute gap (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1999</LINK>), to 40 trains of 2.5 seconds with a 30-second gap (<LINK REF="STD-Novak-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Novak 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Barr-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Barr 2013</LINK> used MRI-targeted TMS and <LINK REF="STD-Guse-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Guse 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Poulet-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Poulet 2005</LINK> reported using the 10 - 20 EEG electrode position system.</P>

<P>Very low-quality evidence from one small trial showed no evidence of effect of temporoparietal TMS compared to sham TMS for clinically improving global state. However, there is some very low-quality evidence to show that global state scores on the CGI scale are superior with temporoparietal TMS. There is also very low-quality evidence from the PANSS scale that temporoparietal TMS is superior to sham TMS in improving mental state. While there may be some benefits with TMS over sham TMS, the clinical significance of some of the scale-driven data is unclear. Very low-quality evidence shows that temporoparietal TMS does not affect cognitive state; however, participants receiving temporoparietal TMS experienced more headaches than those in the sham TMS group. No more participants left the study early in the temporoparietal TMS than the sham TMS group, but again, this is very low-quality evidence.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Duration</HEADING>
<P>Studies reported substantial differences in the length of trials, which ranged from four days (<LINK REF="STD-McIntosh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McIntosh 2004</LINK>) to 10 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 2012</LINK>). This issue is therefore potentially problematic for comparison, and caution should be considered in relation to any conclusions. Difference in study length may arise from the nature of the population samples in terms of the associated high attrition rates. The lack of consistency across studies in relation to study length may also reflect the novel aspect of the intervention and the lack of a standardised procedure. We did not stratify the data by the different time periods specified in <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK> in the protocol, as there were not enough data (see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Participants</HEADING>
<P>Participants were consistently classified with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, with most studies using a diagnosis according to the DMS-IV. <LINK REF="STD-Prikryl-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prikryl 2007</LINK> reported the ICD-10, and <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2008</LINK> reported the use of both a diagnosis of schizophrenia with at least one year prior hospitalisation. The sample groups included for review were therefore well matched.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. Control condition</HEADING>
<P>A wide variety of sham TMS techniques were reported across the included studies. Although most studies reported use of the same stimulation as for active TMS, additional descriptions of this procedure varied from the edge of the coil resting at a 45 degree angle, a 90 degree angle, with one wing touching or with both wings touching. In addition further descriptions included a sham coil which produced identical sounds to the active TMS, and a sham coil which had a magnetically non-translucent headpiece. Drawing a comparison across results and the interpretation of findings is therefore hindered.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, there is very little information on TMS compared to other treatments for schizophrenia. No studies compared TMS with other physical methods of treatment such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and two (out of 41 included) studies compared TMS with standard treatment. The standard treatment in these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bagati-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bagati 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2011</LINK>) was antipsychotics, although those given TMS also received them.</P>
<P>One trial out of the 18 ongoing trials compares TMS with treatment as usual, and the remaining studies compare TMS with sham TMS, although one trial (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01370291" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01370291</LINK>) plans to compare both treatments with and without the use of risperidone. This indicates that the evidence base for TMS is still being studied against sham TMS, before comparisons with active treatments can be envisaged.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4. Intervention</HEADING>
<P>The active TMS intervention in both the prefrontal and temporoparietal conditions varied substantially across studies in terms of stimulation intensity, length of stimulation, and location of TMS. Studies which conducted prefrontal TMS reported the greatest variations. Stimulation intensity included ranges of 1 Hz, 10% above threshold to 20 Hz at 80% motor threshold, and three studies used TBS of 50 Hz. Length of stimulation for prefrontal TMS studies ranged from two trains of one minute with a three-minute gap (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1999</LINK>), to 40 trains of 2.5 seconds with a 30-second gap (<LINK REF="STD-Novak-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Novak 2006</LINK>) with a number of different variations across studies. Location of prefrontal TMS stimulation also differed, with reports of left prefrontal TMS, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex TMS, right prefrontal TMS, and bilateral prefrontal TMS. For studies which used temporoparietal TMS, there was some consistency in that all but two studies reported using TMS stimulations of 1 Hz. However the level of motor threshold did vary, with reports of 20% below motor threshold to 100% motor threshold. As with the prefrontal TMS studies, in the case of temporoparietal TMS a wide variety of stimulation length was reported, which ranged from five sessions of one minute with one-minute gaps (<LINK REF="STD-Saba-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Saba 2006a</LINK>) to two session of 20 minutes each a day (<LINK REF="STD-Vercammen-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Vercammen 2009a</LINK>).There was also more consistency with studies of temporoparietal TMS in regards to location, as all but one study reported left temporoparietal TMS, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2005</LINK> which reported also using right temporoparietal TMS. Comparing data within each intervention is therefore problematic, particularly for the prefrontal TMS for which the procedure varied more widely.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">5. Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Of the seven categories of predefined outcomes, six were addressed in both the prefrontal TMS and temporoparietal TMS interventions. No data were available for analysis in the categories of hospital and service outcomes, satisfaction with care, and economic outcomes. There was a lack of data for quality of life, with only one study reporting this outcome for temporoparietal TMS. Future trials should consider including mechanisms for collecting these additional data; however, the authors acknowledge the tension between doing limited good-quality data collection at the expense of quantity.</P>

<P>This review includes 41 studies with 1473 participants. Although all studies were reported as randomised, most studies reported unclear allocation concealment (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). There is therefore a risk of selection bias due to a possible lack of good methods to conceal the allocation. Overall, only seven papers reported adequate allocation concealment. Most studies included in the review were described as double-blind. However, only seven studies reported an adequate blinding procedure. This can influence both performance and attrition bias, and is of particular importance in such study designs, due to the use of subjective measures. In many studies data were not fully reported and we had to contact authors in order to obtain both means and standard deviations for individual measures.</P>
<P>Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence to be low to very low. In general, the results were consistent, although scale data results for mental state showed some heterogeneity.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. For people with schizophrenia</HEADING>
<P>At present there is not strong evidence to support the use of TMS (temporoparietal or prefrontal) to treat or manage symptoms of schizophrenia. There was some evidence that TMS may help reduce some symptoms (such as auditory hallucinations and negative symptoms, which include apathy), compared to sham TMS, although the results were unclear and the findings were not the same across all of the small studies identified in the review. Moreover, very few studies compared TMS with standard treatments, including antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine that are often used when troublesome symptoms persist. However, in the future once more high-quality studies have been conducted, there is a possibility that TMS may be useful for treating and managing some symptoms of schizophrenia in addition to usual care.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>Based on this review, we can make no recommendations for the use of TMS to treat symptoms of schizophrenia. The review found that temporoparietal TMS may help reduce auditory hallucinations and positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and that prefrontal TMS helps to reduce some negative symptoms of schizophrenia. However, any significant results were not consistent across various symptom measures, and there were a limited number of studies for each finding. Although the evidence does not support the use of TMS as a treatment option at present, further research with consistent protocols may lead to the development of an effective procedure for its use in future practice.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. For managers/policy makers</HEADING>
<P>Findings from this review do not provide robust data to support the use of TMS in clinical practice for schizophrenia. However there was a suggestion that TMS may improve some symptoms of schizophrenia, although this was equivocal. Future research that uses routine protocols for both TMS and sham treatment procedures should therefore be supported where possible.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. General</HEADING>
<P>There are 18 studies currently ongoing, which plan to include 790 participants, and all but one compare TMS to sham TMS. Future studies should aim to adhere to more standardised procedures for both TMS and sham protocols. However, given the range of procedures in the included and ongoing studies, it appears that we are still at an exploratory stage and no clear evidence-based protocol has emerged. Research should aim for the use of standardised outcomes and measures with which to analyse findings, with publication of analysis protocols before completion of the study itself. This would improve comparability of results across studies and provide a clearer insight into the potential benefits of TMS.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Specific</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.1 More studies</HEADING>
<P>In order to clarify some of the findings presented in this review, we require further research to investigate the possibility of TMS as a viable treatment option for schizophrenia. Research should specifically aim to identify which symptoms would benefit from the technique and which methods could be most effective. This will need both more high-quality studies and the recruitment of samples with sufficient statistical power to address the primary questions posed by the research teams.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.2 Duration</HEADING>
<P>There should be standardised procedures in terms of study duration in order to improve compatibility of findings. Although we acknowledge that there are difficulties about adherence for the participant group, research should aim to be more consistent to allow a greater basis for comparison and to extend the clinical data collection period beyond the duration of the treatment phase itself, so as to assess the sustainability of any observed effect.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.3 Sham protocol</HEADING>
<P>The protocol for sham treatment should be standardised to reduce variation and ensure that the control condition refers to a similar procedure across research. Efforts should be made to ensure that the experience of the treatment procedure using the sham protocol is indistinguishable from the active intervention, to improve blinding of participants and their carers.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.4 Intervention protocol</HEADING>
<P>For both temporoparietal and prefrontal TMS, a consistent protocol in relation to stimulation intensity, length of stimulation, and location of treatment should be developed. This would reduce the large variation in procedures and greatly improve the comparability of findings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.5 Randomisation</HEADING>
<P>There should be clear reporting of study design, in particular the methods to guarantee allocation concealment and double-blinding, to provide comprehensive information on study procedures which can be compared. There should be good-quality blinding at allocation, to reduce any risk of selection bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.6 Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Research should aim to provide consistency of outcome measures for both the type of measure (e.g. endpoint or change score) and the scales used. Comparison of findings is greatly hindered by differences in outcome measures, and consistency in this area would provide a stronger basis for informed conclusions.</P>

<P>Three new review authors were added to the review (LM, NM, KSW) and one (KPE) was withdrawn.</P>
<P>The protocol was prepared in RevMan 4 with the review converted to RevMan 5 format. There is no substantive difference in the text itself between the protocol and review. However the text was reconfigured to fit under the RevMan 5 sub-headings.</P>
<P>We have updated the sections on <LINK TAG="STUDY_SELECTION" TYPE="SECTION">Selection of studies</LINK>, <LINK TAG="CONTRIBUTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Contributions of authors</LINK> and <LINK TAG="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" TYPE="SECTION">Acknowledgements</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>'Risk of bias' tables and 'Summary of findings' tables: </B>These were introduced as standard for Cochrane reviews after this protocol was published, see <LINK TAG="DATA_EXTRACTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data extraction and management</LINK> and <LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK> for the methods used.</P>
<P>
<B>Types of outcome measures: </B>The outcome measures published in the protocol were classified into seven categories and made no distinction between primary and secondary outcome measures; primary outcomes were determined by measures of Global state and all other categories were designated secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>We have added 'Quality of life' as an outcome.</P>
<P>We had planned in the protocol to divide outcomes into immediate (within two hours), short-term (greater than two hours and up to 24 hours) and medium-term (greater than 24 hours and up to two weeks). However, the majority of studies reported only that outcomes were measured after treatment and did not specify exactly how long after treatment, and so we did not classify the data this way.</P>
<P>
<B>Measures of treatment effect: </B>For statistically significant results we had planned to calculate the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome/harmful outcome statistic (NNTB/H), and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using Visual Rx (<A HREF="http://www.nntonline.net/">www.nntonline.net/</A>), taking account of the event rate in the control group. This, however, has been superseded by the 'Summary of findings' tables and calculations therein, and hence we did not estimate this statistic.</P>
<P>Had there been cluster-randomised trials in which clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we would have presented data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering had been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we would have presented these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intra-class correlation coefficient [Design effect = 1 + (m - 1) * ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC is not reported we will assume it to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies had appropriately analysed their data, taking into account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>
<B>Standard deviations: </B>Where there are missing measures of variance for continuous data but an exact standard error (SE) and confidence interval are available for group means, and either the P value or t value are available for differences in means, we will calculate them according to the rules described in the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins 2011). When only the standard error is reported, standard deviations (SDs) can be calculated by the formula SD = SE * &#8730;(n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>) present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, t or F values, confidence intervals, and ranges or other statistics. If these formulae do not apply, we will calculate SDs according to a validated imputation method which is based on the SDs of the other included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>). Some of these imputation strategies can introduce error. The alternative would be to exclude a given study&#8217;s outcome and thus to lose information. We will nevertheless examine the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.</P>
