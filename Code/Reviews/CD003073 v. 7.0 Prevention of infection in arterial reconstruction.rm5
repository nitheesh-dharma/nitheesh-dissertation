<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Prevention of infection with surgery for peripheral arterial reconstruction</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Reconstruction of an artery with prosthetic graft materials or vein may be necessary to treat poor circulation. Surgery is used to bypass a blockage in an artery or prevent rupturing (as with aneurysms). Graft or deep wound infections are a serious complication that can be limb threatening and often life threatening. Most infections appear to be caused by bacteria from the patient's skin entering the wound at the time of surgery. Resistant bacteria have increased in prevalence and measures to prevent infection are therefore, essential. These methods include hair removal, pre-operative skin cleanliness and painting with antiseptics, theatre antisepsis procedures, surgical techniques, use of antibiotics and post-operative wound management. The review authors made a thorough search of the literature and identified thirty-five randomised controlled trials for inclusion in this review. Prophylactic treatment with systemic antibiotics, commenced immediately pre-operatively, reduced the risk of wound infection and almost certainly early graft infection by between three-quarters and two-thirds (RR 0.25 and 0.31, respectively). These conclusions are based on 10 studies that randomised 1297 patients to receive either prophylactic antibiotic or placebo. Antibiotic prophylaxis for greater than 24 hours appeared to be without added benefit, from three studies.</P>
<P>Other interventions intended to reduce the risk of infection in arterial reconstruction, including suction groin-wound drainage or pre-operative bathing or shower regimen with antiseptic agents over unmedicated bathing, lack evidence of effectiveness. There was no evidence from two studies (857 patients) that impregnating Dacron grafts with the antibiotic rifampicin, reduced graft infections over a two year follow-up period.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-10-04 14:46:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Welch">
<P>Thirty-five RCTs were included. Of these, 23 were trials of prophylactic systemic antibiotics, three of rifampicin-bonded grafts, three of preoperative skin antisepsis, two of suction wound drainage, two of minimally invasive in situ bypass techniques, and individual trials of intraoperative glove change and wound closure techniques. Wound infection or early graft infection outcomes were recorded in all trials. Only two trials, both of rifampicin bonding, followed up graft infection outcomes to two years.</P>
<P>Trials of antibiotics versus placebo were of highest quality with six double-blind studies of the ten included.</P>
<P>Prophylactic systemic antibiotics reduced the risk of wound infection (RR) 0.25, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.38) and early graft infection in a fixed-effect model (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.85, P = 0.02). Antibiotic prophylaxis for greater than 24 hours appears to be of no added benefit (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.98).</P>
<P>There was no evidence that prophylactic rifampicin bonding to dacron grafts reduced graft infection at either one month (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.49) or two years (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.40).</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a beneficial or detrimental effect on rates of wound infection with suction groin-wound drainage (RR 0.96 95% CI 0.50 to 1.86) or of any benefit from a preoperative bathing or shower regimen with antiseptic agents over unmedicated bathing (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.36).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is clear evidence of the benefits of prophylactic broad spectrum antibiotics. Many other interventions intended to reduce the risk of infection in arterial reconstruction lack evidence of effectiveness. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-09-23 15:02:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Welch">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Arterial reconstruction is usually undertaken to treat or to prevent signs or symptoms of poor circulation (where the blood supply is inadequate for the tissue needs), or to prevent occlusion or rupture of dilated arteries (i.e. aneurysms) (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1993</LINK>). In the absence of available veins, and in some cases out of necessity, prosthetic (artificial) material is required. Infection of either biological or prosthetic material can have catastrophic effects ranging from loss of limb to death. Many manoeuvres are used in an attempt to reduce infection in arterial reconstruction, but there are no clear guidelines as to the most appropriate or effective. Although the presence of infection around the graft or operation site is of the greatest clinical significance, consideration needs to be given to the prevention and management of wound infection as this may lead to deeper graft related infections. This review will help guide clinicians in the prevention of infection as well as highlight areas of deficient knowledge for future investigation.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of pre-, peri-, and post-operative manoeuvres, including antimicrobial therapy, antisepsis and wound management, in the prevention of infection, at or around the operative site, in patients undergoing any peripheral (i.e. not cardiac or thoracic) arterial reconstruction.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Rifampicin-bonded graft</HEADING>
<P>The results of three large studies of rifampicin bonding are reported in four papers (<LINK REF="STD-Braithwaite-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Braithwaite 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Addato-1996" TYPE="STUDY">D'Addato 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Addato-1997" TYPE="STUDY">D'Addato 1997</LINK>). All trials used an identical method of rifampicin bonding, with soaking of a gelatin-coated Dacron graft in 1mg/ml rifampicin for 15 minutes before insertion. The Joint Vascular Research Group trial (<LINK REF="STD-Braithwaite-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Braithwaite 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2000</LINK>) included only patients undergoing extra-anatomical grafts (axillofemoral, femorofemoral and iliofemoral crossover grafts) whereas the Italian study (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Addato-1996" TYPE="STUDY">D'Addato 1996</LINK>) included patients undergoing mono-, bifemoral or iliofemoral grafts. Only patients with rifampicin allergy were excluded from either study and both studies reported results up to two years. The European study included patients undergoing aortofemoral grafts. One month wound and early graft infection results of this study are reported in a review article (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Addato-1997" TYPE="STUDY">D'Addato 1997</LINK>).</P>

One study randomised a single groin wound in patients undergoing arterial surgery through a longitudinal groin incision to suction drainage or no drainage (<LINK REF="STD-Dunlop-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dunlop 1990</LINK>). Identical dressings were applied after removal of the drains at 48 hours. Wound assessment was carried out thereafter by a blinded assessor. The other identified study (<LINK REF="STD-Healy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Healy 1989</LINK>) randomised either right or left side drainage in patients undergoing arterial surgery with bilateral groin incisions.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prophylactic antibiotics</HEADING>
<P>Studies of systemic antibiotics versus placebo showed a homogeneous pattern demonstrating a consistent benefit in reduction of wound infection in 1297 patients (Relative Risk (RR) fixed 0.25, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.38, P &lt; 0.00001). Although no single study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in early graft infection with prophylactic systemic antibiotics, the results of included studies appeared homogeneous and in a fixed-effect model a reduction in early graft infection is evident on meta-analysis (RR fixed 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.85, P = 0.02). Using a random-effects model, the 95% confidence intervals were wider and lost statistical significance (RR random 0.36 95% CI 0.12 to 1.03, P = 0.06). Late graft infections were not identified in any study.</P>
<P>Continuing prophylactic antibiotics for longer than 24 hours did not appear to confer any additional benefit in reducing wound infection over a 24-hour regimen (RR fixed 1.28, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.98). In one study of single dose antibiotics versus a 24-hour regimen with relatively few patients, insignificantly fewer wound infections were recorded in the multidose regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Oostvogel-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Oostvogel 1987</LINK>). Topical instillation of cephradine in a single small study resulted in fewer wound infections than administration of placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Pitt-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pitt 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no evidence of a significantly greater reduction in wound infection with comparable regimens of first or second generation cephalosporins, penicillin/ß-lactamase inhibitor, aminoglycosides, or the glycopeptides vancomycin or teicoplanin.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Rifampicin graft bonding</HEADING>
<P>Three multicentre studies of rifampicin bonding to gelatin-coated dacron grafts reported early graft infection outcomes in 3379 patients. Two of these studies (857 patients) reported graft infection outcomes to two years. There was no evidence from these studies of a reduction in graft infection at either one month (RR fixed 0.63, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.49) or two years (RR fixed 1.05, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.40).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Suction wound drainage</HEADING>
<P>There was no evidence that suction drainage of groin wounds conferred either a beneficial or detrimental effect on rates of wound infection (RR fixed 0.96 95% CI 0.50 to 1.86). The effect of suction wound drainage on early or late graft infection has not been studied.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<P>A preoperative bathing or shower regimen with antiseptic agents did not confer any benefit in reducing wound infection (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.36). The effect on subsequent early or late graft infection has not been studied.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other measures</HEADING>
<P>Wound infection outcomes were measured in two studies of in situ lower limb bypass surgery using techniques to minimise length of skin incisions. The outcomes of these two small studies differed with the trial of angioscopically-assisted vein branch identification failing to report any effect on wound infection (RR fixed 0.84 95% CI 0.06 to 12.86) and the trial of coil embolisation of vein branches reporting a significant reduction of wound infection complications (RR fixed 0.47 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73). Wound observers in this latter trial were unblinded and the findings of this single study should therefore be treated with some caution.</P>
<P>Single studies of intraoperative glove change (<LINK REF="STD-Zdanowski-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zdanowski 2000</LINK>) and methods of wound closure (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1995</LINK>) failed to show any reduction in superficial wound infection.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-13 11:52:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Graft infection remains a serious limb-threatening and often life-threatening complication of arterial reconstruction. Most deep wound infections or graft infections appear to be caused by bacteria from the patient's skin entering the wound at the time of surgery, either intraoperatively or in the early postoperative period. Recently, resistant bacteria such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have increased in prevalence and now appear to account for the majority of Szilagyi type II and III wound infections in the UK and Ireland (<LINK REF="REF-Naylor-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naylor 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Szilagyi-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szilagyi 1972</LINK>). Optimising measures to prevent infection are therefore essential in arterial reconstruction. Research on prevention of infection has mainly concentrated on antibiotic prophylaxis with 22 of the 34 included papers studying the effects of systemic antibiotics. Many other interventions aimed to minimise operative infection have been poorly studied</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Preoperative measures</HEADING>
<P>Patients undergoing arterial reconstruction often have pre-existing risk factors for wound complications. Poor diabetic control, dependent limb oedema and poor nutrition may increase the risk of a significant wound and graft infection postoperatively. It seems sensible that these factors should be optimised prior to elective surgery although we were unable to identify any trials of specific interventions for these risk factors. Increased bacterial colonisation particularly in groin creases, and colonisation with resistant bacteria such as MRSA may also increase the risks of infection. There is no evidence from this review of any additional benefit with a more aggressive bathing or showering regimen using antiseptics over simple bathing with non-medicated soap. No trials of the effect of MRSA decolonisation preoperatively were identified.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Operative and post operative measures</HEADING>
<P>This review demonstrated prophylactic treatment with systemic antibiotics commenced immediately preoperatively reduced the risk of wound infection and almost certainly early graft infection by between three quarters and two thirds. Broad spectrum cephalosporins, penicillin/ß-lactamase inhibitors or aminoglycosides would appear to confer similar benefits. A high local prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms or pre-existing colonisation with these organisms may necessitate use of vancomycin or teicoplanin. A 24-hour regimen of antibiotics appears as effective as continued prophylaxis beyond 24 hours.</P>
<P>Basic theatre asepsis procedures are a prerequisite for arterial surgery. Evidence of the benefit of other theatre interventions is however very sparse. In particular no RCTs of choice of skin antisepsis before surgery or use of bio-occlusive drapes over all exposed skin were identified and, although established practice for the insertion of orthopaedic implants, no trials of ultra clean theatre airflow for vascular surgery have been reported. Intraoperative glove change before handling prosthetic grafts did not seem to reduce contamination of graft material and no effect on wound infection was detectable in this small study (<LINK REF="STD-Zdanowski-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zdanowski 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>There appears to be no benefit from use of rifampicin impregnation of prosthetic graft material in preventing early or late graft infection and the prophylactic use of this technique should be abandoned.</P>
<P>No studies of postoperative wound management were identified.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In addition to basic skin cleanliness and theatre antisepsis procedures, patients undergoing arterial reconstruction should receive systemic antibacterial prophylaxis using an antibiotic with activity against staphylococcal and Gram-negative bacteria.<BR/> </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>With increasing prevalence of MRSA wound and graft infection there is a need for research into the benefit of MRSA decolonisation prior to surgery and choice of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with previous identified MRSA colonisation or active MRSA pedal infection . </P>
<P>Further research is also required to determine whether bio-occlusive drapes or ultra clean theatre airflow are of benefit in arterial reconstruction.</P>
