Thanks for making these changes. This can now go forward for submission.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;Dear Ahmed,&lt;br&gt;I cannot use the version of the review that you sent me because you have not worked from this version of the review. All the previous editing has therefore been lost!! PLEASE work from this version of the review. The responses that you made to the peer reviewer seem very sensible but the alterations MUST be to this version of the review not an old one that you have used before. I cannot unscramble the changes so we have no option but to ask you to make your revisions on THIS VERSION.&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Chris Cates&lt;br&gt;14 April 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;===================================================================&lt;br&gt;Peer Review comments 8 Feb 2005&lt;br&gt;1. Definition of disease and patient population ? Non-specific cough not defined anywhere. Further population enrolment described in table but not in text. Needs clearer definition in background as well as in text as many readers don't read the tables. &lt;br&gt;2. Selection of appropriate outcome measures ?&lt;br&gt;(i) Primary outcome &amp;quot;Days (or nights) without cough (assessment as defined by trialists&amp;quot;: doesn't quite make sense for the following reasons:&lt;br&gt;(a) It is more widely accepted to define success or failure and or present data as OR (and NNT if appropriate). Indeed the only paper included in the review measured success by a change in 70% of cough frequency.&lt;br&gt;(b) If one were to define days, it would be better to have &amp;quot;days to resolution of the cough.&lt;br&gt;(c) Night cough (unless objectively measured) is a bad outcome measure in cough studies as it has been repeatedly shown to be poorly/unreliably reported. This was shown by many groups as long as 20 years ago using a variety of recording cough. [L. N. J. Archer and H. Simpson. Night cough counts and diary card scores in asthma. Arch Dis Child 60:473-474, 1985][A. Falconer, C. Oldman, and P. Helms. Poor agreement between reported and recorded nocturnal cough in asthma. Pediatr Pulmonol 15:209-211, 1993][A. B. Chang, R. G. Newman, J. Carlin, P. D. Phelan, and C. F. Robertson. Subjective scoring of cough in children: parent-completed vs child-completed diary cards vs an objective method. Eur Respir J 11:462-466, 1998] etc.&lt;br&gt;(d) I doubt if one can find any papers that define the primary outcome as such. To do it in the manner suggested by the authors, one would envisage picking a time length and measure days cough free within that time period. It would be difficult to choose the dominator. Such a measure is erroneous as not only is the 'time to respond' variable but in most situations it is also unknown.&lt;br&gt;3. Secondary Outcomes: &lt;br&gt;&amp;#183;Change in spirometry as an outcome invalid and inconsistent with non-specific cough. Non specific cough is usually defined as having normal spirometry. &lt;br&gt;&amp;#183;Changes in cough meter- doesn't make sense as an outcome measure- should be change in objective cough indices (eg cough frequency, cough flow etc&lt;br&gt;4. Subgroup analysis (2-5 years vs 5-18 years)- clear overlap. It would make more sense for second age group to be 6-18 years.&lt;br&gt;5. Methodology ? Calculation of kappa mentioned in methods but not calculated in results. Also results wrongly interpreted. In the paper by Chang et al, under section 'Stats analysis', it was clearly stated that subjects Rx as intention to treat and figure 2 data numbers of failure and success presented as such. This makes Jadad score given questionable as well. &lt;br&gt;6. Discussion: Sets the results into the appropriate clinical context ?&lt;br&gt;Partially only. See point on clarity. The major problem with the study by Chang et al (and hence limited ability to generalise) is surely the 80% power of the study and that the dose was lower than standard asthma care as outlined in BTS guidelines on asthma (given that the authors has taken a pure asthma slant rather than other possible effects of salbutamol such as possible effects on cough receptors, cough pathway, airway clearance etc). &lt;br&gt;Clarity ?&lt;br&gt;The discussion section in both reviews (ie this review and the ICS one) are very similar and indeed exactly the same in some sections! This one even includes reference to inhaled corticosteroids which is not relevant at all her&lt;br&gt;7. Implications for practice. Consistent with the results ?&lt;br&gt;Not entirely. Authors included ICS here which seems odd. Possible adverse events (tachycardia, tremor, anxiety, cost, etc) should also be mentioned in this section. &lt;br&gt;8. Recommendations for further research ?&lt;br&gt;This can be substantially improved. No real specifics are given other than suggestion of larger doses and/or higher doses. If this is to be suggested than discussion of adverse events of tremor, tachycardia, anxiety etc should be addressed as well. Appropriate outcome measures not discussed. Reversibility of airway resistance/spirometric evidence of bronchodilator responsiveness is not non specific cough. This goes back to their definition of non-specific cough and the inappropriateness of the outcome measure of spirometry. If this is their definition of non specific cough then the search must include ALL ASTHMA publications that included cough as an outcome measure. &lt;br&gt;9. Additional comments&lt;br&gt;i). Grammar errors as some sections from the protocol version (future tense) were not altered to past tense eg last para pg 7&lt;br&gt;ii) Minor and few typo errors throughout. &lt;br&gt;iii) Clear problems with the review as outlined above. &lt;br&gt;iv) Some references in reference section were not referred to in text. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby please send these back to the authors for response. I think some modifications are needed in the light of the peer review feedback.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;_________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;CJC edit 23 dec 2004&lt;br&gt;Thanks for amending this. The labels on outcomes 4 and 5 are still wrong. Higher is better to I have put favours B2 agonists to the right of the null. This reads much better but please insert Tomrak as an additional reference and add the link. Then it can go out to peer review.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;==============================================================================&lt;br&gt;Ammendments of Chochrane review post comments by Dr Cates:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Authors' Contribution: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Fine but what about oral beta-agonist syrup that is commonly&lt;br&gt;used in this age-group. I think you need to explain why you excluded this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reply - TOBY - CAN YOU CHECK THE SEARCH TERMS - AM I CORRECT IN THINKING THAT WE WOULD HAVE PICKED UP PO BETA AGS IN THE SEARCH??&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

The sentence in red may be ok in the ICS review but I do not&lt;br&gt;think it is reasonable to expect 70% reduction in cough with bd salbutamol.&lt;br&gt;Do you? Since Chang 1998 is the one included study in this review is reads&lt;br&gt;badly at present (I think this has been pasted from the ICS review and&lt;br&gt;should be amended for this review). See 2 paras in red. Likewise the final&lt;br&gt;paragraph refers to studies. Please sort this out. - We have deleted this section as you are right that in was an unreasonable outcome to expect and the paragraph only confused the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. Did the included study look at AHR (red in conclusions?) - yes - AHMED YOPU NEED TO PUT SOMETHING IN 'OTHER OUTCOMES' IN THE RESULTS SECTION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10,. Contentious issues: You have 2 reviews on this topic relating to chronic&lt;br&gt;cough. What are the pros and cons of ICS v SABA? - comment is now passed in the conclusions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: not yet. - done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: Toby please send to Liz to check search descriptions and then&lt;br&gt;back to authors.

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The existence of cough variant asthma (cough as the only respiratory symptom without any evidence of airway obstruction) is controversial. This review raises the appropriateness of the common practice of using inhaled ß2 agonists in the treatment of children with cough without any other evidence of airway obstruction. The review found that there is nothing at present to suggest that treatment with ß2 agonists will be beneficial in treating nonspecific isolated cough in children.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-30 14:28:53 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Chronic cough is generally accepted as a cough that is persistent for more than 3 weeks. All children cough at some time, but for most this is just a normal response to common viral infections of the respiratory tract. Some, however, persist with a troublesome cough. In a child with isolated cough, a detailed history and examination, followed in a small number of cases by targeted investigations, should allow the child to be placed in one of five broad diagnostic categories. These are: a normal child who is chronically exposed to an irritant (e.g. smoke, fresh paints, new carpeting, dry air heating, old pillow, furry pet); a child with a serious illness such as cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis etc.; a child with non-serious, but treatable causes of cough, for example gastro-oesophageal reflux or postnasal drip; a child with an asthma syndrome; and a child where there is an overestimation of symptoms by either the child or family due to psychological or other reasons (<LINK REF="REF-Bush-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bush 2002</LINK>). There are those who do not fit into these categories and are labelled as having nonspecific chronic cough, that is isolated cough without any other associated manifestations that could be related to a background aetiology.</P>
<P>Inhaled ß2 agonists have long been used for the treatment of acute asthma symptoms in both adults and children. To maximize the amount of drug that reaches the airways and minimise systemic absorption and side effects, small doses of the drug can be inhaled in aerosol and powder form (<LINK REF="REF-Skoner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skoner 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pathophysiology of so called 'cough variant asthma' has not received a great deal of research interest and opinion lies divided as to whether it is really asthma or not. Currently there are proponents for (<LINK REF="REF-Doan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cloutier-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cloutier 1981</LINK>) and against (<LINK REF="REF-McKenzie-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenzie 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ninan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ninan 1995</LINK>) the diagnosis of asthma in children with cough as the sole respiratory symptom, so called 'cough variant asthma'. The proponents of the entity of cough variant asthma found that in patients presenting solely with chronic cough:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The diagnosis of asthma was confirmed by an exercise provocation test in some children (<LINK REF="REF-Konig-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konig 1981</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>Obvious clinical asthma developed in some patients after long-term follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Hannaway-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannaway 1982</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>Personal and family histories of atopy and blood eosinophilia suggested an allergic diathesis. Chest radiographs showed hyperinflation in many and spirometry showed bronchospasm (<LINK REF="REF-Yahav-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yahav 1982</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>They responded to a therapeutic trial of asthma medication (e.g. inhaled corticosteroids), and relapsed on stopping medications with a second response to recommencing them (<LINK REF="REF-Bush-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bush 2002</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>On this evidence the proponents of cough variant asthma suggest a therapeutic trial of medications usually used to treat asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Doan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doan 1992</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1996</LINK> on the other hand found that children with recurrent cough in isolation of other symptoms differ significantly from those with asthma, with or without cough, in airway hyperresponsiveness and atopy, among other factors. Another study found that children with persistent cough had less morbidity and less atopy compared with children with wheeze (<LINK REF="REF-Faniran-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faniran 1998</LINK>). Despite these differences and the unclear pathophysiology, for many general practitioners and paediatricians the most practicable approach to isolated chronic cough is a therapeutic trial of ß2-agonists and or inhaled corticosteroids. As ß2 agonists are one of the main therapies used for this condition we aim to conduct a systematic review of the evidence that supports their use in chronic cough.</P>

Airway responsiveness was assessed by inhalations of hypertonic saline (4.5%) using an ultrasonic nebuliser (the dose of hypertonic saline was increased successively by doubling the inhalation time). FEV1 was measured 60 seconds after each inhalation time and the test ceased when the FEV1 had fallen by more 15% or more or when a cumulative inhalation time of 15.5 minutes had been achieved.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review raises the appropriateness of the common practice of using inhaled ß2 agonists in the treatment of children with cough without any other evidence of airway obstruction. Identifying children who are unlikely to benefit from medications used for asthma could not only potentially prevent the diagnostic labelling of asthma in a large group of children but also save these children from the use of unnecessary medications and their associated side effects, as well as save their parents from any unnecessary expense.</P>
<P>The promotion of the diagnosis of asthma based on the symptom of cough alone has led to the overuse of ß2 agonists in children with recurrent cough (<LINK REF="REF-McKenzie-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenzie 1995</LINK>). The findings of a lack of response to inhaled medications used routinely for asthma, irrespective of the presence of AHR, are supported by epidemiological data (<LINK REF="REF-Clifford-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lombard-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lombard 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Clifford-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 1989</LINK> found no association between cough and either AHR or atopy after controlling for wheeze, and they suggested that, in the absence of wheeze, the significance of cough and dyspnoea for the diagnosis of asthma in epidemiological studies should be questioned.</P>
<P>This review supports growing epidemiological evidence that cough alone is a poor marker for asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Ninan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ninan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-McFadden-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFadden 1975</LINK> were the first to describe cough as a presenting symptom of asthma in adults. All subjects in this study had exertional dyspnoea and abnormal baseline expiratory flow volume loops consistent with moderate airways obstruction. Subsequent studies of cough variant asthma included adults and children without any abnormality of their baseline pulmonary function (<LINK REF="REF-Cloutier-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cloutier 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheriyan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheriyan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hannaway-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannaway 1982</LINK>). Many of these studies used asthma medications for adults and children with cough variant asthma but had no placebo arm, and results were based on subjective reporting of cough, which is known to be unreliable (<LINK REF="REF-Hsu-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsu 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Archer-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Archer 1985</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Cheriyan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheriyan 1994</LINK> was a retrospective study that reported eight of 10 adult patients free from cough while on either oral or inhaled corticosteroids after three months. In the earlier adult (<LINK REF="REF-Armitage-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armitage 1994</LINK>) and paediatric (<LINK REF="REF-Cloutier-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cloutier 1981</LINK>) studies, the subjects' cough responded to oral theophylline within 2-5 days, in contrast to the prolonged course of corticosteroids used by other studies (<LINK REF="REF-Cheriyan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheriyan 1994</LINK>). The study included in this review is not comparable to the study of <LINK REF="REF-Hannaway-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannaway 1982</LINK> that included children with abnormal baseline lung function or chest physical examination. The subjects in the included study had normal physical examination and spirometry. In the <LINK REF="REF-Hannaway-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannaway 1982</LINK> study, a third of the 32 children involved had abnormal physical examination of the chest and 12 of the children who were able to perform pulmonary function tests had abnormalities in the expiratory flow loop. Similarly, in another study (<LINK REF="REF-Konig-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konig 1981</LINK>) six of the eight children who were able to perform pulmonary function tests had FEV1 predicted values of approximately 85%.</P>
<P>Some children with persistent cough no doubt have unrecognised wheeze, either because it is poorly perceived by their parents or it is not present at the time they present to a physician. It has also been suggested that this group has a higher wheeze threshold (<LINK REF="REF-Koh-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koh 1993</LINK>). The fact that inhaled corticosteroid has helped the coughers in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1999</LINK> does not mean that they necessarily have asthma. It may be that children with recurrent, persistent, and isolated cough occupy an intermediate clinical position between children with no cough and those with wheeze with respect to atopy (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1989</LINK>), prognosis for asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Powell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1996</LINK>), family history of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Ninan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ninan 1995</LINK>), response to bronchodilator (<LINK REF="REF-Konig-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konig 1981</LINK>), and episodes of respiratory morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 1984</LINK>). However, coughers appear to have normal lung function measured by spirometry and airway responsiveness (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wright-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>A positive relation between isolated cough and atopic family history as markers for the later development of wheeze has been noted (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1996</LINK>), and others have also found that children with cough and no wheeze had more atopy than controls but less than asthmatics (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1989</LINK>). Eczema and hay fever, however, occurred no more in coughers than controls (<LINK REF="REF-Ninan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ninan 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although cough is often used as a marker of asthma instability (<LINK REF="REF-Isles-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isles 1993</LINK>) the severity of cough has been shown to be unrelated to the airway calibre as measured by FEV1, peak expiratory flow or its variability (<LINK REF="REF-Hsu-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hsu 1994</LINK>). In the laboratory, medications (e.g. cromolyn, atropine) that inhibit the bronchoconstriction that occurs with broncho- provocative challenges do not alter the cough response (<LINK REF="REF-Hansson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansson 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sheppard-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheppard 1983</LINK>). Conversely, other medications (lignocaine, codeine) that inhibit the induced cough have no effect on broncho-constriction (<LINK REF="REF-Hansson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fuller-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuller 1988</LINK>). In human airways, the pathways for cough and bronchoconstriction are distinctly different (<LINK REF="REF-Sheppard-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheppard 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fuller-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuller 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shimuzu-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shimuzu 1996</LINK>). While the trigger for cough and airway narrowing may be the same, the symptom of cough may persist despite adequate treatment of bronchoconstriction. It is, therefore, not surprising that the AHR positive children in <LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK> study responded to salbutamol and placebo in a similar manner to the AHR negative children.</P>
<P>The number of subjects included in the study included in our review was small, but did achieve a power of 80% based on an expected difference of 70% in the frequency of cough as measured by cough meter. Whether this is generalisable depends on two questions. Firstly, is it safe to assume in a small study that any differences between treatment and placebo would not have been missed? Secondly, is a 70% reduction in cough frequency a reasonable representation of treatment success? The primary outcome of improvement of cough and how it is measured is crucial to this issue. Clearly there are difficulties in measuring cough, especially at night. Any future studies should aim to design a validated tool for assessing cough in order to reduce uncertainty in the measurement of cough. Hence the major problem with the included study is the limited ability to generalise the results based on 80% power. In addition the dose was lower than standard asthma care as outlined in BTS guidelines on asthma (given that the authors has taken a pure asthma slant rather than other possible effects of salbutamol such as possible effects on cough receptors, cough pathway, airway clearance etc).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK> recorded cough over 24 hours using a cough diary. By using video recordings in <LINK REF="STD-Davies-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 1999</LINK>, as with other studies (<LINK REF="REF-Picciotto-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Picciotto 1998</LINK>), were able to make observations of children with nocturnal cough in their own homes. This method eliminates difficulties with diary card reporting and the problems associated with recording cough of co-sleepers. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 1998</LINK> found that inhaled salbutamol had no significant effect on cough frequency or score, irrespective of the presence of AHR. It could be argued that the infrequent use of salbutamol trial affected the outcome measures. Salbutamol was used twice a day rather than four times a day, with the aim of improving compliance. Moreover, regular use of ß2 agonists (three to four times a day) may worsen asthma symptoms, increase the risk of severe asthma or cause enhanced AHR (<LINK REF="REF-Busse-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busse 1994</LINK>). As compliance and treatment success were similar in both treatment arms, improved compliance and a larger daily dose of salbutamol are unlikely to alter the final results. In addition, there is no gold standard on acceptable compliance and devices that record the use of the medication cannot confirm if the medication was actually consumed (<LINK REF="REF-Rand-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rand 1994</LINK>). </P>
<P>A potential criticism for the study included in this review is that silent gastro-oesophageal reflux and sinusitis were not thoroughly investigated. In children, these diagnoses as a cause of cough, rather than an association, are controversial. In adults with gastro-oesophageal reflux (but no respiratory symptoms), reflux was found to be a cofactor and not the cause of cough (<LINK REF="REF-Ferrari-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferrari 1995</LINK>). The exclusion of sinusitis is extremely difficult. In a prospective study, 50% of the 137 children younger than 13 years (<LINK REF="REF-Diament-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diament 1987</LINK>) had computed tomography sinus scans consistent with sinusitis but all were asymptomatic. </P>
<P>One of the most important observations made in the studies included in this review is that children improved on placebo. Of those who were followed up, most continued with improved symptoms. Since follow up was six months to one year after the study, this could simply reflect the natural history of the tendency of cough to improve with time (<LINK REF="REF-Brooke-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooke 1995</LINK>). </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>While cough is associated with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-McFadden-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFadden 1975</LINK>), when no other evidence of airway obstruction is present one small study has shown that irrespective of the presence of AHR, inhaled salbutamol provided no advantage over placebo in reducing the frequency of cough measured objectively or scored subjectively. However, on the basis of one small trial we cannot exclude the possibility that in children with recurrent cough without other evidence of airway obstruction inhaled ß2-agonist might be beneficial. Until there is a greater body of evidence on the treatment of non-specific cough, no recommendation can be made.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The common problem of cough in childhood and its relation with airway obstruction deserves further investigation. </P>
<P>More randomised controlled studies are needed to study the efficacy of asthma medications in isolated chronic cough. <BR/>Since no benefit has been shown from 2 puffs twice a day (100 mcg salbutamol per puff) of inhaled salbutamol it might be worth undertaking a larger study using higher doses of inhaled salbutamol or other types of ß2 agonists to investigate whether a subgroup of children with non-specific chronic cough who have never wheezed, are likely to benefit. However the adverse events of using higher doses ( e.g. tachycardia, tremor, anxiety, etc) could be problematic. It might also be worth comparing the pros and cons of Inhaled corticosteroids versus inhaled ß2 agonists in these cases. Key to the successful study of non-specific cough is exclusion of asthma and it is recommended that in children able to perform lung function, reversible airways obstruction and/or airway hyper responsiveness is studied as part of assessment for suitability in a study of non-specific cough. </P>
