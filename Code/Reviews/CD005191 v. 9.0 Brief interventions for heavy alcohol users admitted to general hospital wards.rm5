<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-12 15:16:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Heavy or dangerous patterns of drinking alcohol can lead to accidents, injuries, physical and psychiatric illnesses, frequent sickness, absence from employment and social problems. Long term alcohol consumption has harmful effects on almost all organs of the body, particularly the brain and gastro-intestinal system. Healthcare professionals have the opportunity to ask people about how much alcohol they drink and offer brief interventions to heavy drinkers. These brief interventions involve a time limited intervention focusing on changing behaviour. They range from a single session providing information and advice to one to three sessions of motivational interviewing or skills-based counselling involving feedback and discussion on responsibility and self efficacy. Different health professionals who do not require to be alcohol specialists may give the intervention. Admission to hospital as an inpatient, in general medical wards and trauma centres, provides an opportunity whereby heavy alcohol users are accessible, have time for an intervention, and may be made aware of any links between their hospitalisation and alcohol. The review authors identified 14 randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials involving 4041 mainly male adults (16 years or older) identified as heavy drinkers in hospital, mainly in the UK and USA.</P>
<P>The main results of this review indicate that there are benefits to delivering brief interventions to heavy alcohol users in general hospital. Our results demonstrate that patients receiving brief interventions have a greater reduction in alcohol consumption compared to those in control groups at six month and nine month follow up but this is not maintained at one year. In addition there were significantly fewer deaths in the groups receiving brief interventions than in control groups at 6 months and one year. However, these findings are based on studies involving mainly male participants. Furthermore screening, asking participants about their drinking patterns, may also have a positive impact on alcohol consumption levels and changes in drinking behaviour and this is an area that requires further investigation.</P>
<P>Further research is required determine the optimal content and treatment exposure of brief interventions within general hospital settings and whether they are likely to be more successful in patients with certain characteristics.</P>

<P> </P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-07-01 10:41:38 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Around two billion people world wide consume alcoholic beverages and over 76 million people have alcohol use disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Lancet-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancet 2009</LINK>). Alcohol is responsible for about 2.3 million premature deaths world wide (<LINK REF="REF-Cherpitel-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherpitel 2009</LINK>). Sufficient evidence exists to indicate that alcohol is a significant threat to world health, with dangerous patterns of heavy drinking existing in most countries. Hazardous and harmful use of alcohol is a major contributing factor of ill health globally through alcohol dependence, liver cirrhosis, cancers and injuries and to others through dangerous actions of those intoxicated such as drink driving and violence or through the impact of drinking on fetus and child development (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). World wide alcohol is linked to 2.5 million deaths (3.8% of total) per annum with global alcohol consumption continuing to increase (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>).Clinical and epidemiological studies report a relationship between heavy drinking and certain clinical presentations such as injuries, physical and psychiatric illnesses, frequent sickness, absence from employment and social problems. The consequences of harmful alcohol use is a major concern to health care services with approximately 4.5% of the global burden of disease and injury attributable to alcohol (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). During peak times around 41% of all attendees at UK Accident &amp; Emergency departments test positive for alcohol consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Dobson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dobson 2003</LINK>). In the UK the number of alcohol-attributable hospital admissions for 2005-2006 was 909 per 100,000 men and 510.4 per 100,000 women (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Levels of heavy alcohol consumption have been widely defined into three categories: hazardous drinking, harmful drinking and alcohol dependence determined by the amount of alcohol consumed, together with the physical and psychological consequences (<LINK REF="REF-Kaner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaner 2007</LINK>). A large proportion of alcohol attributed morbidity and mortality in a population is as a result of large numbers of people with hazardous and harmful consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Freemantle-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freemantle 1993</LINK>). Binge drinking is defined as an episode of excessive drinking primarily with the intention of becoming intoxicated (<LINK REF="REF-Renaud-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renaud 2001</LINK>). There is currently no consensus world wide on how many drinks consist of a 'binge'. Binge drinking is considered harmful, regardless of a person's age, and there have been calls for healthcare professionals to give increased attention to their patients drinking habits, especially binge drinkers. In the USA, the term is often taken to mean consuming five or more standard drinks (male), or four or more drinks (female), in about two hours for a typical adult (<LINK REF="REF-Moreira-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moreira 2009</LINK>). In the United Kingdom, binge drinking is defined as drinking more than twice the daily limit, that is, drinking eight units (64 grams) or more for men or six units (48 grams) or more for women on one occasion (<LINK REF="REF-Stephans-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephans 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Long term alcohol consumption has a harmful effect on almost all organs of the body, particularly the brain and gastro-intestinal system (<LINK REF="REF-Hillman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillman 2003</LINK>). Alcohol consumption has also been linked with injuries and morbidity sustained through motor vehicle crashes, falls, drowning, fires, burns and violence. Alcohol is estimated to contribute to 20-30% worldwide oesophageal cancer, liver cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, homicide and epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). Its consumption is causally linked to a problems, including health issues and lower life expectancy, reduced workplace productivity, accidents, drink driving, violence and other forms of crime (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2008</LINK>). It is estimated that each alcoholic negatively affects an average of four other people(<LINK REF="REF-Scottish-Government-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scottish Government 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The world's highest alcohol consumption levels are found in the developed world, including western and eastern Europe, but alcohol consumption is increasing rapidly in Africa and Asia (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). The annual cost of alcohol abuse to the NHS in the UK is around £1.7 billion, incurring more direct costs to health, social and criminal justice systems than drug misuse, alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia or stroke, (<LINK REF="REF-AMS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">AMS 2004</LINK>). In Australia alcohol has been defined as a serious problem whose social costs in 2004/05 have been estimated to be over $15 billion (<LINK REF="REF-Australian-Government-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Australian Government 2008</LINK>) . Alcohol dependence and alcohol related diagnosis have been rising among patients discharged from General Hospitals (<LINK REF="REF-Scottish-Executive-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scottish Executive 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2010</LINK>). Unhealthy alcohol misuse is increasingly common in medical inpatients (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-07-01 10:42:32 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Health professionals working in general hospital environments have regular contact with individuals who abuse alcohol. Research suggests that a high number of patients who attend general hospitals experience alcohol related problems, often unrelated to the conditions with which they attend for treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Saunders-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Watson 2000</LINK>). Traditionally interventions were offered only when individuals were diagnosed as alcohol dependent, though recent evidence has suggested possible benefits from intervening earlier using screening and brief interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Nilsen-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsen 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilk-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilk 1997</LINK>). For health care professionals there is now much more expectation for them to identify and provide interventions when alcohol consumption exceeds recommended limits, where there is increased risk of physical, psychological and social harm (<LINK REF="REF-Nilsen-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsen 2008a</LINK>). Opportunities exist for health care professionals to routinely ask about alcohol consumption levels as part of their assessment, and offer brief interventions to those exceeding safe levels of alcohol consumption. An important element of brief interventions are that they can be delivered by non-specialist staff. Due to the minimal time taken to deliver a brief intervention and the simple training required to up skill health professionals in this area brief interventions are not resource intensive with admission to hospital cited as a potentially opportune time for intervention for those whose alcohol consumption exceeds safe recommended limits (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2010</LINK>). A brief intervention generally consists of between one and four short 5-20 minute counselling sessions with a trained health care worker for example a nurse, occupational therapist, physician, psychologist or social worker.</P>
<P>Brief interventions are targeted at non-treatment seeking, non-alcohol dependent hazardous and harmful drinkers and are intended as an early intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Nilsen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsen 2010</LINK>). Brief interventions consist of more than just advice on reducing alcohol consumption and focus more personally on the individual drawing on theories from person centred counselling and social psychology being motivational in nature through focusing on the benefits and drawbacks of behaviour change (<LINK REF="STD-McQueen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 2006</LINK>). They involve a time limited intervention and can range from five to ten minutes of information and advice to two or more sessions of motivational interviewing or counselling (<LINK REF="REF-Alcohol-Concern-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alcohol Concern 2001</LINK>). Previous work has evaluated a range of interventions categorised as brief interventions, with six key elements of brief interventions being widely summarised under the acronym FRAMES: feedback, responsibility, advice, menu of strategies, empathy and self efficacy originally described by (<LINK REF="REF-Bien-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bien 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Brief interventions are important for non-dependent heavy alcohol users in primary care where they have been shown to reduce total alcohol consumption, and binge drinking in hazardous drinkers for up to one year <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2003</LINK>. This is particularly important in limiting the progression of alcohol related pathologies such as alcohol dependence and limiting the damage that prolonged heavy drinking has to physical and mental health.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-07-01 10:35:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>A Cochrane review has indicated benefits from brief interventions in primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Kaner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaner 2007</LINK>) but the effectiveness of brief intervention in hospital inpatient environments remained unclear. Admission to hospital represents an opportunity where by heavy alcohol users are accessible, have time for an intervention and may be made aware of any links between their hospitalisation and alcohol (<LINK REF="STD-Saitz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Saitz 2007</LINK>). The acute post traumatic period may act as a catalyst for change representing a teachable moment to encourage heavy alcohol users to change (<LINK REF="STD-Soderstrom-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Soderstrom 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sommers-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sommers 2006</LINK>). A previous review and meta-analysis of brief interventions in the general hospital setting found evidence for effectiveness to be inconclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Emmen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emmen 2004</LINK>). This review is justified as the accumulation of fresh evidence through the inclusion of a further nine studies. If health professionals are to implement such interventions into practice then evidence on it's effectiveness and long term benefits is required.</P>

<P>
<BR/>The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias as described in chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions version 5.0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) was used for assessing risk of bias in studies. This two part tool addresses five specific domains, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, with the first part describing what was supposed to have happened in the study and the second assigning a judgement in relation to the risk of bias for that study. Three authors independently assessed the following: sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, blinding of participant and outcome assessor. The first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement, in terms of "low ", "high" or unclear, relating to the risk of bias for that entry. Criteria indicated by the handbook and adapted to the addiction field were used to make these judgements see Appendix 5. Any disagreement between authors was resolved by discussion, including input from a third independent reviewer if required.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-05-11 15:18:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where available and appropriate, quantitative data for the outcomes listed in the inclusion criteria are presented in the analysis tables (1.1 to 1.13). Where studies reported standard errors of the means (SEMs), standard deviations were obtained by multiplying standard errors of means by the square-root of the sample size. For each trial, relative risk and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, and weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals calculated for continuous outcomes (reporting mean and standard deviation or standard error of the mean). Standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated when combining results from studies using different ways of measuring the same concept. Change scores have been reported separately as these cannot be incorporated into meta analyses of standardised mean differences.</P>
<P>For each study reporting quantity of alcohol consumed in a specific time period data was converted into grams per week using either the conversion factor reported in the paper or appropriate to the country where the trial took place (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1991</LINK>).

<BR/>
</B>This systematic review assessed the effectiveness of brief interventions on alcohol consumption and other outcomes (death, driving offences, number of days hospitalised, accident and emergency visits and laboratory markers i.e. Gamma GT), for adults with heavy alcohol use admitted to general hospital wards not specifically for alcohol treatment. Fourteen studies involving 4041 participants were included.</P>
<P>
Our primary outcome measure was alcohol consumption. A meta-analysis of four studies showed a significant difference in favour of brief interventions in the reduction of alcohol consumption at six month follow up, MD -69.43 (95% CI -128.14 to -10.72). A sensitivity analysis (one study was removed due to methodological heterogeneity) also demonstrated a trend in this direction but the result become not statistically significant, MD -55.49 (95% CI -115.33 to 4.35). There was also a significant difference in favour of the brief intervention group based on the results of one study for alcohol consumption at nine months follow up. However there was no significant difference between the groups at one year follow up. Furthermore there was a significant difference in self reports of reduction of alcohol consumption at one year in favour of brief interventions, SMD -0.26 (95% CI -0.50 to -0.03), but there was no significant difference between the groups at 3 or 6 months.There was a statistically significant outcome in favour of the brief intervention group in relation to heavy drinking episodes in days per week at four months, MD -0.56; (95% CI -1.02 to -0.10), nine months MD -0.78 (95% CI -1.32 to -0.24) and one year follow up MD -0.71 (95% CI -1.26 to -0.16) though this was based on the results of one study. Again based on the results of one study the findings were statistically significant for number of heavy drinking episodes per week at four months MD -0.56 (95% CI -1.02 to -0.10), nine months MD -0.78 (95% CI -1.32 to -0.24) and one year MD -0.71 (95% CI -1.26 to -0.16) in favour of the brief interventions group.</P>
<P>There was also statistically significant differences for death rates at 6 months RR 0.42 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.94) and one year follow up RR 0.60 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.91) in favour of those who received the brief intervention. A sensitivity analysis - removing the physician delivered intervention group from one study - also demonstrated statistically significant difference RR 0.61 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.96) in favour of brief interventions.</P>
<P>However there were no significant differences between brief interventions and control groups at any time points for; alcohol consumption based on change scores from baseline, laboratory markers (GammaGT), number of binges, driving offences within 3 years, or for studies including only men mean alcohol consumption in grams per week. These findings are in line with other reviews of brief interventions in primary care primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Bertholet-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertholet 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaner 2007</LINK>) and hospital settings (<LINK REF="REF-Emmen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emmen 2004</LINK>). The absence for any change in laboratory markers (GammaGT) could be due to the fact that such tests do not show moderate reduction in alcohol consumption and appear to lack sensitivity for non alcohol dependent hazardous and harmful drinkers.</P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures of interest considered whether brief interventions improve quality of life and ability to function in society i.e. social relationships, employment, education and reduce alcohol related injuries (e.g. falls violence, suicide and motor vehicle accidents). Apart from one study (<LINK REF="STD-Schermer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schermer 2006</LINK>) which reported on driving offences none of the studies specifically measured these secondary outcomes.</P>

<P>
<B>Study Participants<BR/>
</B>The studies used a variety of methods to identify heavy alcohol users such as FAST, AUDIT, CAGE, retrospective drinking diaries, number of standard drinks per week. There was no consistency across the studies in baseline consumption levels for participants to be included. Seven of the fourteen studies attempted to exclude alcohol dependent participants through excluding those known to addiction services, evidence of chronic physical alcohol problems, those deemed to be alcohol dependent by medical staff or scoring positive for dependence on Short Form Alcohol Dependence data questionnaire. In the remaining six studies one intentionally included alcohol dependent participants with the remaining studies reporting no upper limit in terms of alcohol consumption with hazardous, harmful and dependent alcohol drinkers all being included. Brief interventions have been reported to be ineffective with alcohol dependent individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Bertholet-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertholet 2005</LINK>) though there is ongoing debate within the field. It is therefore anticipated that the inclusion of alcohol dependent participants in six out of 14 studies included in this review may have impacted upon the results. Whilst the authors of this review did consider conducting a sensitivity analysis based on the information contained in the studies alcohol dependence was difficult to definitively define. However further updates of this review should consider this aspect as more studies become available.</P>
<P>Four studies included male participants only (<LINK REF="STD-Antti_x002d_Poika-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Antti-Poika 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chick-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Chick 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heather-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Heather 1996</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2011</LINK>) with the remaining ten studies having a higher percentage of male participants typically around 80%. The Cochrane review on brief interventions in primary care reports that brief interventions reduced the quantity of alcohol consumed per week in men, but not women (<LINK REF="REF-Kaner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaner 2007</LINK>). However, no conclusions on gender effect can be drawn from our review.</P>
<P>
<B>Treatment exposure</B>
<BR/>Brief interventions were delivered by a number of different professionals ranging from physicians, nurses, psychologists, psychology students, occupational therapists and social workers. There is no evidence to suggest the outcomes were different depending on who delivered the intervention with an important element of brief interventions being that they can be delivered by non-specialist staff. There was some clinical heterogeneity between the trials in terms of the characteristics of brief interventions (number of sessions, duration). One study (<LINK REF="REF-Antti_x002d_Poika-1988a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antti-Poika 1988a</LINK>) was classified as higher intensity based on the number of sessions spent counselling participants in the intervention group. This study showed a greater reduction in alcohol consumption than trials with a less intensive treatment exposure. However these results should be interpreted with caution as they are based on one small study (N=120) and it should also be noted that the assessor was not blinded which may have led to bias. These findings fit with the earlier systematic review on brief interventions in primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Kaner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaner 2007</LINK>) which found weak evidence that a greater length of time spent counselling patients may result in greater reduction in alcohol consumption. The structure and content of brief interventions requires further research to evaluate effectiveness for hospital inpatients.</P>
<P>It is acknowledged that there are two categories of brief interventions, simple advice and extended brief interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Raistrick-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raistrick 2006</LINK>). Some studies included in this review would fit clearly into these categories but due to the limited number of studies with comparable outcomes a sub group analysis was not possible. Should further studies emerge during the updating of this review it would be important to consider undertaking a comparison of simple advice versus extended brief interventions. This has been identified as being a pressing issue in this field of research.</P>
<P>Within the studies included in this review it is acknowledged that there are differences in control groups &#8211; some studies had usual care, some gave a leaflet (which could be seen as advice) and some gave feedback on the results. Some of the studies included in this review reported a reduction in alcohol consumption even in the control group.The impact of screening should also be considered as the phenomenon of assessment (or screening) reactivity appears well-recognised in the alcohol field (<LINK REF="REF-Kypri-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kypri 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCambridge-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCambridge 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogborne-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogborne 1988</LINK>). Screening involves asking participants about their drinking patterns and this may have influenced drinking behaviour in the short term as may the provision of a health education leaflet or feedback on the results of screening. This view has also been acknowledged by <LINK REF="REF-Kaner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaner 2007</LINK> 'Effectiveness of Brief Interventions in Primary Care' which suggests that screening may impact on alcohol consumption and is an area that requires further investigation. However there are alternative explanations for example, regression to the mean or merely the fact that the participants were admitted to hospital . With the potential that admission to hospital acted as a catalyst for individuals to review and change their alcohol consumption.</P>
<P>
<B>Length of follow-up<BR/>
</B>The period of time between the delivery of brief interventions and follow up assessment ranged from three months to three years. Four studies reported outcomes following six months and six reported outcomes at one year. The results of this review demonstrate a significant difference in favour of brief interventions in the reduction of alcohol consumption at six month and nine month follow up, but there was no significant difference between the groups at one year follow up. However there was a significant difference in self reports of reduction of alcohol consumption at 1 year in favour of brief interventions. T</P>
<P>
<B>Completeness and applicability of evidence<BR/>
</B>The 14 studies included in this review were all written in English and originated mainly from America (N=5) and the United Kingdom (N=4). This may limit the applicability of the evidence to these healthcare systems and social environments. However evidence suggests that alcohol consumption levels have been identified as more prevalent in Western Europe and America (<LINK REF="REF-Leon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leon 2006</LINK>). The majority of the participants in the studies were male and four studies only included men, in the remaining ten studies the participants were mixed but predominately 80% were male. This may limit the generalizability of the results to female heavy alcohol users. It is also important to note that the largest multi-national study into brief interventions (<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1996" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1996</LINK>) was not included in this review; it included participants from a variety of primary care settings in addition to general hospital, it was not possible to separate the data to include only participants from general hospital.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-07-01 12:05:58 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laura Amato">
<P>Fourteen studies were included in this review seven of which were randomised control trials. Of the remaining seven, one was a cluster randomised control trial and six studies were controlled clinical trials. Lack of adequate allocation concealment is associated with bias (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) therefore the impact of this on results should be considered. In seven studies the participants were not randomised to control or brief intervention groups and it is unlikely that allocation up to the point of assignment was concealed. Whilst the methodological quality of the included studies was mixed the nature of brief interventions is subject to several potential methodological limitations. Due to the nature of this intervention i.e. individualised brief interventions it was not possible to blind the participants. Though blinding of outcome assessors was possible however outcome assessors were blinded in only nine studies.This is of major concern because most of the outcomes considered by the studies were subjective. Contamination between control and intervention participants may also have introduced the possibility of performance bias. However current evidence suggests that only adequate randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessor will influence effect size (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was also methodological heterogeneity in terms of the types of outcomes reported for self reported alcohol consumption and laboratory markers used which meant meta-analysis for these outcomes was limited.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Emmen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emmen 2004</LINK> focused specifically on general hospital settings identifying eight studies and concluded that the evidence for brief interventions in a general hospital setting for problem drinkers was still inconclusive. Our review has identified 14 studies and includes data up to 2011. <LINK REF="REF-Emmen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emmen 2004</LINK> also included four studies which were excluded from our review as the interventions did not fit with our definition of brief interventions (two as the brief intervention took place in an outpatient clinic, one as it was an audio-visual presentation rather than a face to face brief intervention and one as it was a confrontational interview to try and persuade alcohol abusers to accept treatment).</P>
<P>The Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Kaner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaner 2007</LINK>) which relates to brief interventions in primary care included a meta-analysis of 21 trials and reports strong evidence in favour of brief interventions. Both the review in primary care and the current review suggest that screening alone may result in reduced alcohol consumption and make recommendations to investigate this further.</P>

<P>The main results of this review indicate that there are benefits to delivering brief interventions to heavy alcohol users in general hospital. Our results demonstrate that patients receiving brief interventions have a greater reduction in alcohol consumption compared to those in control groups at six month and nine month follow up but this is not maintained at one year. In addition there were significantly fewer deaths in the groups receiving brief interventions than in control groups at 6 months and one year. However, these findings are based on studies involving mainly male participants. Furthermore screening, asking participants about their drinking patterns, may also have a positive impact on alcohol consumption levels and changes in drinking behaviour.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-10-19 15:18:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effect of brief interventions for heavy alcohol users in general hospitals requires further investigation to determine the optimal content of brief intervention and treatment exposure and whether they are likely to be more successful in patients with certain characteristics. To facilitate meta-analysis, future research should utilise primary outcome measures such as alcohol consumption reporting in either units or grams of alcohol consumed or changes in alcohol consumption from baseline. Surveillance post intervention should be at least one year. Future studies in this area should consider the CONSORT statement as a guide for both designing and reporting (www.consort-statement.org). Reporting should include the method of randomisation, the use of blinded assessors, and an intention to treat analysis and data presented as means and standard deviations for continuous measures or number of events and total numbers analysed for dichotomous measures. Future trials are required to add to the evidence base for brief interventions in general hospital. In addition research should consider the impact of screening and where possible investigate the effect on both males and females. Recent debates within the brief interventions field have also focused on wether brief interventions delivered within general hospital are more effective in certain populations such as young people or women or those with an alcohol attributed admission <LINK REF="REF-Saitz-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saitz 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2010</LINK>.</P>
