<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-01-30 11:53:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Julia Worswick">
<P>Long waiting times for non-urgent procedures are common in public healthcare systems, where care is provided free of charge and supply is limited by budget constraints. This may cause distress among patients as well as adverse health consequences.</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence on the effects of interventions in reducing waiting times. We found eight eligible studies (three randomised controlled trials and five interrupted time series studies) involving 135 primary care clinics, seven hospitals and one outpatient clinic. Different interventions, elective procedures and clinical conditions across included studies made pooling of data unfeasible. The quality of the included evidence (to November 2013) ranged from low to very low, as data were obtained from randomised controlled trials that for the most part suffered from serious bias, and from non-randomised studies without a control group.</P>
<P>The single study that evaluated an intervention aimed at prioritising demand showed that introducing a system for streamlining elective surgery reduced the number of semi-urgent patients waiting longer than recommended, but did not affect urgent or non-urgent groups.</P>
<P>Seven studies evaluated interventions aimed at restructuring the intake assessment/referral process. Three of four studies evaluating effects of open access or direct booking/referral showed beneficial effects: One study showed reduced waiting times for open access to sterilisation through keyhole surgery; another showed that open access to investigative services may lead to reduced waiting times for patients with urinary symptoms (but not for patients with microscopic blood in urine); and one study reported that same-day scheduling reduced waiting times for those seeking child health outpatient services. One study showed no effect of a direct booking system on the proportion of patients reported to have moderate or severe cell changes on the neck of the womb who received an appointment for further investigation within four weeks.</P>
<P>Two studies of distant consultancy (instant photography for skin conditions and telemedicine for ear, nose and throat conditions) showed no effect on waiting times to see a specialist. One study reported that using a pooled waiting list did not change the number of patients waiting for routine back surgery within the recommended time. We found no studies evaluating interventions aimed at increasing capacity or rationing demand.</P>
<P>As only a handful of low-quality studies are presently available, we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of the evaluated interventions in reducing waiting times. However, interventions involving the provision of more accessible services (open access or direct booking/referral) show some promise.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-01-22 05:51:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1946-), EMBASE (1947-), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ABI Inform, the Canadian Research Index, the Science, Social Sciences and Humanities Citation Indexes, a series of databases via Proquest: Dissertations &amp; Theses (including UK &amp; Ireland), EconLit, PAIS (Public Affairs International), Political Science Collection, Nursing Collection, Sociological Abstracts, Social Services Abstracts and Worldwide Political Science Abstracts. We sought related reviews by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE). We searched trial registries, as well as grey literature sites and reference lists of relevant articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-02-17 10:32:39 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before-after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series (ITS) designs that met EPOC minimum criteria and evaluated the effectiveness of any intervention aimed at reducing waiting times for any type of elective procedure. We considered studies reporting one or more of the following outcomes: number or proportion of participants whose waiting times were above or below a specific time threshold, or participants' mean or median waiting times. Comparators could include any type of active intervention or standard practice.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-01-20 06:37:42 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data from, and assessed risk of bias of, each included study, using a standardised form and the EPOC 'Risk of bias' tool. They classified interventions as follows: interventions aimed at (1) rationing and/or prioritising demand, (2) expanding capacity, or (3) restructuring the intake assessment/referral process.</P>
<P>For RCTs when available, we reported preintervention and postintervention values of outcome for intervention and control groups, and we calculated the absolute change from baseline or the effect size with 95% confidence interval (CI). We reanalysed ITS studies that had been inappropriately analysed using segmented time-series regression, and obtained estimates for regression coefficients corresponding to two standardised effect sizes: change in level and change in slope.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-22 06:11:36 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight studies met our inclusion criteria: three RCTs and five ITS studies involving a total of 135 general practices/primary care clinics, seven hospitals and one outpatient clinic. The studies were heterogeneous in terms of types of interventions, elective procedures and clinical conditions; this made meta-analysis unfeasible.</P>
<P>One ITS study evaluating prioritisation of demand through a system for streamlining elective surgery services reduced the number of semi-urgent participants waiting longer than the recommended time (&lt; 90 days) by 28 participants/mo, while no effects were found for urgent (&lt; 30 days) versus non-urgent participants (&lt; 365 days).</P>
<P>Interventions aimed at restructuring the intake assessment/referral process were evaluated in seven studies. Four studies (two RCTs and two ITSs) evaluated open access, or direct booking/referral: One RCT, which showed that open access to laparoscopic sterilisation reduced waiting times, had very high attrition (87%); the other RCT showed that open access to investigative services reduced waiting times (30%) for participants with lower urinary tract syndrome (LUTS) but had no effect on waiting times for participants with microscopic haematuria. In one ITS study, same-day scheduling for paediatric health clinic appointments reduced waiting times (direct reduction of 25.2 days, and thereafter a decrease of 3.03 days per month), while another ITS study showed no effect of a direct booking system on proportions of participants receiving a colposcopy appointment within the recommended time. One RCT and one ITS showed no effect of distant consultancy (instant photography for dermatological conditions and telemedicine for ear nose throat (ENT) conditions) on waiting times; another ITS study showed no effect of a pooled waiting list on the number of participants waiting for uncomplicated spinal surgery.</P>
<P>Overall quality of the evidence for all outcomes, assessed using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) tool, ranged from low to very low.</P>
<P>We found no studies evaluating interventions to increase capacity or to ration demand.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-01-22 05:55:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-01-22 05:55:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Elective health procedures are procedures that are programmed and are not delivered in emergency or urgent situations. Long waiting times for elective health procedures are observed in most health systems and are thought to occur when demand exceeds supply. They tend to occur in health systems that combine public health insurance with zero or low patient cost-sharing and constraints on capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Siciliani-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siciliani 2013</LINK>); some view them as a structural feature of those systems (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hurst-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurst 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kreindler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreindler 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siciliani-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siciliani 2013</LINK>). The mere existence of waiting lists is not necessarily a negative phenomenon, as it is sometimes considered a structural and inevitable way of rationing scarce supply (<LINK REF="REF-Appleby-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleby 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Black-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindsay-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindsay 1984</LINK>). Total absence of waiting times would certainly cause dysfunction, as planning of activities would be jeopardised and efficiency would greatly suffer if services were not used at their full capacity.</P>
<P>However, long waiting times can cause distress for patients, in some cases can have adverse health consequences (<LINK REF="REF-Kreindler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreindler 2010</LINK>) and are perceived by patients, the public and policy-makers as lack of appropriate delivery and planning of health care (<LINK REF="REF-Kreindler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreindler 2010</LINK>). This explains in part why long waiting times tend to catalyse the tensions between patients' and citizens' expectations on the one side, and health care providers' ability to meet those expectations on the other. The question is therefore how to find a way to keep waiting times at a safe and acceptable level while ensuring quality, equity and wise use of resources (<LINK REF="REF-Kreindler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreindler 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Extended studies of this phenomenon have not pinpointed specific health system determinants of waiting lists (<LINK REF="REF-Hurst-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurst 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siciliani-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siciliani 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siciliani-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siciliani 2013</LINK>). Besides a link between universalistic access to care and long waiting times, researchers have found associations with lower levels of health expenditure and lessened availability of curative beds and of physicians. However some data contradict these associations, and long waiting times are found in countries where health expenditure and availability of services and resources are high. Great variation between countries demonstrates that it is still very difficult to advance tenable inferences on causal relationships, and only descriptive associations can be put forward.</P>
<P>Evidence on how waiting times for elective procedures affect health outcomes appears less conclusive than for urgent procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Hirvonen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirvonen 2007</LINK>). This could be explained by the fact that patients on a waiting list whose health deteriorates while waiting tend to be shifted to an emergency list and "lost" from the elective procedure waiting lists.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-01-21 07:52:42 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Analysis of determinants and implications of waiting times, as well as of the impact of policies targeted at their reduction, has been the object of a number of reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Appleby-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleby 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Appleby-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleby 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hurst-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurst 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kipping-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kipping 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacMillan-Press-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacMillan Press 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siciliani-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siciliani 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siciliani-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siciliani 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yates-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yates 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Comparative data between countries and health systems experiencing or not experiencing long waiting times for elective procedures do not lend themselves to hypotheses that go beyond the imbalance between supply and demand. However causes of inadequate supply or excessive demand can be numerous and heterogeneous. An inadequate supply can be due to insufficient capacity or inefficient use of existing capacity, which in turn can be affected by several factors such as important changes in technology (<LINK REF="REF-Siciliani-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siciliani 2013</LINK>). Decreasing healthcare demand is quite problematic; probably only effective prevention of illnesses and/or their effective management within primary care would reduce the number of patients who need treatment. Clinical uncertainty and variations in clinical practice have been associated with inappropriate demand.</P>
<P>During the past decade, waiting time guarantees have become a frequent and popular policy tool to address waiting times. Recommended minimum waiting times are established for different types of elective procedures, and hospital incentives or penalties are associated with meeting the set targets. This policy has been successful in England, where publication of waiting times data was coupled with sanctions for poorly performing hospital managers. This strategy appeared to reduce maximum waiting times (<LINK REF="REF-Appleby-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleby 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dash-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dash 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Department-of-Health-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Department of Health 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mayor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayor 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Propper-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Propper 2008</LINK>), but, as it happened in other countries, it did not seem to affect average waiting times. To meet target waiting time as set by policies, health systems and organisations adopt specific interventions to reach the set target. These can be of three main types: interventions aimed at rationing and/or prioritising demand, at expanding capacity and at improving the organisational management of waiting lists or restructuring the intake assessment/referral process. Examples of interventions aimed at rationing and/or prioritising demand include patients' financial contributions to healthcare services (co-payment), development and implementation of explicit referral criteria or practice guidelines to increase appropriateness and use of tools that triage patients according to their clinical conditions (clinical priority scores). Interventions aimed at expanding capacity comprise additional funding to increase appointment slots in the public sector, thus subsidising or facilitating access to the private sector. Examples of interventions aimed at restructuring the intake assessment/referral process include queuing strategies, redesign of clinical pathways, open access (patients seen without an appointment), direct booking/referral (specialty visits booked directly by patients), pooled waiting lists (single and pooled waiting lists for different consultants, with patients assigned to the first available appointment) and telemedicine, among others.</P>
<P>All of the above strategies have been used alone or in combination (<LINK REF="REF-Hurst-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurst 2003</LINK>) in different settings and countries with heterogeneous results.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-01-22 05:51:34 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A lengthy waiting time is thought to result from a misalignment between the demand for procedures as expressed by citizens and the capacity of health systems to supply such procedures in adequate number and time. Therefore interventions implemented to enforce national or regional policies for reduction of waiting times may act on increasing supply or on reducing demand.</P>
<P>Interventions to increase supply involve raising funding/expenditures to buy additional personnel, equipment or time slots for extra numbers of procedures; to provide incentives for extra activity; or to buy extra activity from other providers.</P>
<P>Other interventions include improving efficiency and shortening patients' pathways by eliminating redundancies or obstacles in the process of care (<LINK REF="REF-Kreindler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreindler 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Interventions to reduce demand include taking actions to discourage inappropriate requests and promote appropriate use of procedures and prioritising patients, while taking into consideration both clinical (e.g. severity of condition, expected benefit, need, urgency) and non-clinical (e.g. ability to work) parameters (<LINK REF="REF-Kreindler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreindler 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>Numerous reports (<LINK REF="REF-Rachlis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rachlis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siciliani-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siciliani 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willcox-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willcox 2007</LINK>) and reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Kreindler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreindler 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2008</LINK>) have sought to assess and compare the impact of different national policies for regulating and containing length of waiting times, using mainly national administrative data. These reports represent a fundamental contribution to the debate on management of waiting times and waiting lists, but they rarely provide evidence on the effectiveness of interventions. It is therefore important to summarise and evaluate existing evidence to identify what interventions are most effective in reducing waiting times for elective procedures.</P>

<P>We restricted the review to include only studies that provided an objective measure of the impact of the interventions considered, expressed in terms of:</P>

The TSC searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) for related systematic reviews, as well as the databases listed below for primary studies. Major databases were searched in November 2013; other databases, from which the identification of trials is less likely, were searched in November 2012 (see notations below); exact search dates for each database are included with the search strategies in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> (MEDLINE) and <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> (other).</P>

<P>We calculated the effects of interventions by study design.</P>
<P>For RCTs, when available, we reported preintervention and postintervention values for outcomes of intervention and control groups, and we calculated the absolute change from baseline with 95% confidence interval (CI), or the effect (e.g. mean difference, ratio of means) with 95% CI.</P>
<P>We reanalysed ITS studies that were inappropriately analysed as simple before-and-after studies using segmented time-series regression techniques to estimate the effect of the intervention, taking into account the time trend and autocorrelation among observations. Adjustment for autocorrelation involved estimating the autocorrelation parameter and including it in the segmented regression model if necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Wagner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 2002</LINK>). We obtained estimates for regression coefficients corresponding to two standardised effect sizes for each study: a change in step or level, and a change in slope before and after the intervention. A change in step or level was defined as the difference between the predicted level al the first intervention time point and the level predicted by the preintervention time trend. A change in slope was defined as the difference between postintervention and preintervention slopes (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsay 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>A change in level and/or slope with a negative value may indicate:</P>
<UL>
<LI>an effect in terms of a reduction in waiting time (i.e. a beneficial intervention effect);</LI>
<LI>an effect in terms of a reduction in the number/proportion of participants waiting longer than the recommended time (i.e. a beneficial intervention effect); or</LI>

Median duration of intervention was 11.8 months, ranging from 7 months (<LINK REF="STD-Mallard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mallard 2004</LINK>) to five years (<LINK REF="STD-Hofstetter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hofstetter 2010</LINK>); for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Leggett-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leggett 2004</LINK>) the duration of the intervention was not specified.</P>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lukman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lukman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKessock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McKessock 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK>) explored direct booking/referral. McKessock et al (<LINK REF="STD-McKessock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McKessock 2001</LINK>) evaluated the impact of direct access to laparoscopic sterilisation in general practices against routine referral from GP to clinic. Thomas et al (<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK>) evaluated a direct booking urological investigation service for patients referred by their GPs for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or microscopic haematuria (MH) and compared it versus current practice, consisting of an initial outpatient appointment plus one further appointment for routine day case investigation. Lukman et al (<LINK REF="STD-Lukman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lukman 2004</LINK>) evaluated a direct booking system in a colposcopy clinic for women with abnormal cervical cytology versus referral and appointment made by GP: A "fail safe" pathway to retrieve patients failing to respond to the new referral system was set in place.</P>
<P>Distance consultancy interventions were evaluated in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hofstetter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hofstetter 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leggett-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leggett 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hofstetter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hofstetter 2010</LINK> assessed the introduction of telehealth for participants needing ear nose throat (ENT) specialty care in a rural area and compared the intervention versus ENT face-to-face visit in the main city hospital. In <LINK REF="STD-Leggett-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leggett 2004</LINK>, instant photography was introduced to diagnose and manage dermatology conditions in general practices located near a major teaching hospital, and was compared versus face-to-face index appointment with a dermatology consultant.</P>
<P>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Leach-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 2004</LINK>), the effects of introducing a generic waiting list and pooling all initial outpatient appointments and dates for routine spinal surgery were compared against current practice, consisting of each consultant managing his or her own waiting list. A second intervention was to integrate the MRI booking system with outpatient review appointments. However, it was unclear when this intervention was introduced.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Mallard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mallard 2004</LINK>) evaluated open access/same-day scheduling for paediatric outpatients attending a public health clinic and compared this approach with standard routine based on complex appointment guidelines and next place available schedule.</P>

<P>One study that evaluated an intervention aimed at <I>prioritising of demand</I> measured the absolute number of participants waiting longer than a recommended waiting time (<LINK REF="STD-Lowthian-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lowthian 2011</LINK>), that is, the number of urgent elective participants waiting longer than 30 days, semi-urgent participants waiting longer than 90 days and non-urgent participants waiting longer than 365 days.</P>
<P>Among the seven studies assessing interventions aimed at <I>improving the organisational management of waiting lists or restructuring the </I>intake assessment/<I>referral processes</I>, five studies measured the effects on waiting time (<LINK REF="STD-Hofstetter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hofstetter 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leggett-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leggett 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mallard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mallard 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKessock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McKessock 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK>); one study measured the proportion of participants obtaining an appointment within the recommended four weeks waiting time (<LINK REF="STD-Lukman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lukman 2004</LINK>) and one study the absolute number of participants waiting less than nine months, between nine and 18 months or longer than 18 months (<LINK REF="STD-Leach-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>One of the three included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK>) had an overall low risk of bias, and two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Leggett-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leggett 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKessock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McKessock 2001</LINK>) were at high risk of bias. In these trials high attrition and contamination were the main sources of bias: in <LINK REF="STD-Leggett-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leggett 2004</LINK>, 36.6% of intervention participants could not be diagnosed, and among those who received a diagnosis, 38.0% still needed to see a dermatologist face-to-face for management; in <LINK REF="STD-McKessock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McKessock 2001</LINK>, only 10 out of 75 participants allocated to the intervention group actually received the intervention.The <LINK REF="STD-McKessock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McKessock 2001</LINK> trial was also at high risk of contamination, as a large proportion of participants assigned to the intervention group were treated according to standard referral practice.

<BR/>In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Leggett-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leggett 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK>), both the sequence generation process and allocation concealment were adequate and at low risk of bias, and in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-McKessock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McKessock 2001</LINK>), risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment was unclear.

All trials had an unclear risk of selective outcome reporting, as no trial protocols were available. All trials were at low risk of bias for baseline outcome measures (as no baseline measure of outcomes can be provided for the outcome of interest), blinding (due to objective outcomes) and other risk of bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Intervention independent of other changes</HEADING>
<P>Risk of bias was low in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hofstetter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hofstetter 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mallard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mallard 2004</LINK>): In one, the number of available appointment slots was stable during the study period (<LINK REF="STD-Hofstetter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hofstetter 2010</LINK>); in another (<LINK REF="STD-Mallard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mallard 2004</LINK>), extra clinics were organised at the beginning of the intervention period, but as these data were not included in the analysis, risk of bias must be considered low. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Leach-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 2004</LINK>), risk of bias was unclear, as it was unclear whether a second intervention was implemented at the same time as the main intervention, or later during the intervention period, which may have affected the results. In two studies, risk of bias was high (<LINK REF="STD-Lowthian-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lowthian 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lukman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lukman 2004</LINK>): In one (<LINK REF="STD-Lowthian-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lowthian 2011</LINK>), three different interventions were implemented over time, of which the main intervention (streamlining of services) was one; this complicates interpretation of results; in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Lukman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lukman 2004</LINK>), extra clinics (of unclear duration) were introduced after the start of the main intervention to meet extra demand, and a second intervention (introduction of colposcopy nurse) was put in place during the intervention period.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data is reported for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lowthian-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lowthian 2011</LINK>), and unclear risk of attrition bias is reported for four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hofstetter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hofstetter 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leach-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lukman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lukman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mallard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mallard 2004</LINK>), as no information on number of participants who withdrew or were lost to follow-up was provided.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Selective outcome reporting</HEADING>
<P>Usually ITS studies do not have a study protocol with prespecified outcomes, and it is sometimes difficult to judge whether all important outcomes have been reported; therefore most of the included ITS studies had an unclear risk of bias for this item (<LINK REF="STD-Leach-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowthian-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lowthian 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lukman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lukman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mallard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mallard 2004</LINK>). Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Hofstetter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hofstetter 2010</LINK>) was at high risk of bias because of different waiting time outcomes measured in preintervention and postintervention periods: For preintervention, waiting time was measured by referral to a face-to-face specialist appointment, which, in many cases, involved treatment given to the participant, but in the postintervention period, waiting time was measured with referral until the consultant looked at participant data sent by store and forward telehealth, but not when the participant actually received feedback/treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other bias</HEADING>
<P>All five ITS studies had unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Hofstetter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hofstetter 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leach-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowthian-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lowthian 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lukman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lukman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mallard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mallard 2004</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Hofstetter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hofstetter 2010</LINK>, it was unclear whether all participants who received a telehealth specialist consultation could be diagnosed and subsequently treated, or if some had to see a specialist face-to-face to be diagnosed. Telemedicine techniques and equipment most likely improved over the study years, which may have had implications for whether consultations were successful. In <LINK REF="STD-Leach-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 2004</LINK>, it was unclear whether preintervention and/or postintervention data related to waiting times for all 10 surgeons, or for only the seven who agreed to the intervention. In <LINK REF="STD-Lowthian-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lowthian 2011</LINK>, it was unclear whether study authors each month added up the number of people who were currently waiting too long and were still waiting. If so, participants may appear on the graph for several consecutive months, that is, from the time they exceed the recommended time to the time they have surgery, and if so, this may have affected the results of the analysis. In <LINK REF="STD-Lukman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lukman 2004</LINK>, the source of data for analysis (Figure 2 in <LINK REF="STD-Lukman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lukman 2004</LINK>) seems to include data for all types of referrals (inadequate, abnormal or other), but the study aims to assess the impact of direct booking on waiting time from abnormal smear report to colposcopy clinic (direct booking available only for abnormal smears, not for the other referrals), but it is unclear how this may have affected the results. In <LINK REF="STD-Mallard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mallard 2004</LINK>, the definition of 'waiting time' was unclear, and it was unclear whether the analysis included also waiting time for prescheduled appointments, for which shorter waiting time presumably was not desired.</P>

<P>One ITS study (<LINK REF="STD-Mallard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mallard 2004</LINK>) showed that open access resulted in a direct reduction in mean waiting times for paediatric patients (total n = 7594) at health clinic appointments (step change: -25.20 days, SE 3.83, P value &lt; 0.001; slope change: -3.03 days/mo; SE 0.92, P value 0.005).</P>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Lowthian-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lowthian 2011</LINK> study, which evaluated a system using explicit referral guidelines for streamlining patients according to the urgency of their condition, showed a reduced number of semi-urgent patients waiting longer than the recommended time, but unchanged numbers of urgent and non-urgent elective patients waiting too long. However, no information was provided on how the number of patients not waiting too long was affected. Of concern in interpreting the results of this study are the discrepancies found between the numbers reported in text and in figures, which suggest that a participant may have been counted more than once. Another problem is that we cannot say how the results are affected by co-interventions introduced during the intervention period.</P>
<P>Among the seven studies that evaluated interventions aimed at restructuring the intake assessment/referral process, three studies showed decreased waiting time (<LINK REF="STD-Mallard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mallard 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKessock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McKessock 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK>), and four studies reported no effect (<LINK REF="STD-Hofstetter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hofstetter 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leach-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leggett-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leggett 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lukman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lukman 2004</LINK>). However, important caveats were related to all of these studies; their results should therefore be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-McKessock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McKessock 2001</LINK>, only 14/75 (18.7%) women referred from intervention practices for laparoscopic sterilisation were eligible for direct referral according to the inclusion criteria, and of these, only 10/14 women actually received the intervention. In the discussion, study authors highlighted that participants seemed to prefer the current referral system and suggest the need to conduct preliminary studies before implementing new services based on assumptions of acceptance of revised clinical pathways. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Mallard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mallard 2004</LINK>), it was unclear exactly what the definition of waiting time was, and if the waiting time reported also included prescheduled appointments (i.e. appointments for which shorter waiting time presumably was not desired). In another study (<LINK REF="STD-Lukman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lukman 2004</LINK>), extra clinics were introduced after the start of the main intervention to meet extra demand, and a dedicated colposcopy nurse was introduced halfway through the intervention period, which complicates the interpretation of results.</P>
<P>Distant consultancy resulted in no effect on improvement of mean waiting time (<LINK REF="STD-Hofstetter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hofstetter 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leggett-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leggett 2004</LINK>). However, in <LINK REF="STD-Hofstetter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hofstetter 2010</LINK>, outcomes measured in the preintervention and postintervention periods differed: For control participants, time from referral to specialist appointment and presumably also to treatment was measured, while for intervention participants, time from referral to examination/consultation was measured. It remains unclear when participants who received telehealth consultations received treatment. Also, study authors provided no information on the number of unsuccessful telehealth appointments for which a face-to-face appointment was required. In <LINK REF="STD-Leggett-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leggett 2004</LINK>, a large proportion of intervention participants could not be diagnosed through the use of instant photography, which indicates that this approach may not be suitable for some dermatological conditions. An intervention aimed at restructuring means of queuing using a generic waiting list showed no effect of the intervention on the number of participants waiting less than the recommended time threshold (<LINK REF="STD-Leach-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 2004</LINK>). In this study, seven out of 10 consultants participated, but it was not clear whether preintervention and/or postintervention data related to waiting times for all 10 surgeons, or for only the seven who agreed to the intervention, which may have affected results of reanalysis of this study.</P>
<P>We found no studies evaluating interventions directly aimed at rationing demand or increasing capacity.</P>
<P>On the basis of available evidence, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions to reduce waiting time.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-01-22 06:03:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite media and journal coverage given to waiting time policies implemented nationwide in different health systems, we could not find and include studies with usable empirical data measuring their impact. This was disappointing, as it implies failure of researchers to adequately evaluate policy initiatives to improve waiting times.</P>
<P>Most included studies were conducted in the UK (5/8) or in the USA (2/8) - both high-income countries but with different healthcare systems. No studies were conducted in low- and middle-income countries. All interventions targeted elective therapeutic or test-and-treat procedures.</P>
<P>Most of the evaluated interventions were aimed at improving the organisational management of waiting lists or restructuring the intake assessment/referral process. These studies however, did not cover all possible interventions, for example, resource sharing strategies or remuneration schemes. Only one study involved interventions aimed at prioritising demand, but no study evaluated interventions including co-payments, practice guidelines or clinical priority scores. No study evaluated the effects of interventions aimed at expanding capacity (e.g. providing additional funding to the public sector, subsidising or facilitating access to the private sector).</P>
<P>None of the included studies reported on adverse effects of the interventions (e.g. morbidity, mortality), and only two studies reported on costs.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-01-22 06:06:22 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More than half of the evidence included in this review was derived from non-randomised low-quality time series studies with no control groups, involving only one or two intervention sites, which we reanalysed to remove the risk of bias due to secular trends in uncontrolled data.</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence for all outcomes ranged from low to very low, which is why no robust conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the evaluated interventions can be drawn. The quality of evidence for the effectiveness of interventions aimed at rationing and/or prioritising demand was low, as only one reanalysed ITS study (<LINK REF="STD-Lowthian-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lowthian 2011</LINK>), conducted at a single site, was included in this review. Even though this study showed a beneficial effect of streamlining services for semi-urgent patients, the intervention was not independent of other changes, which made it difficult to isolate the effect of the main intervention. This type of intervention needs further investigation, during controlled conditions, to determine its effectiveness in reducing waiting times for elective surgery.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence on the effectiveness of direct booking/open access or same-day scheduling was low because of high risk of bias in most studies (3/4). Bias was mainly due to high attrition/contamination (<LINK REF="STD-McKessock-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McKessock 2001</LINK>) and other changes concurrent with the main intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Lukman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lukman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mallard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mallard 2004</LINK>). One of the four studies was at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK>). These interventions, all of which involve the provision of more accessible services, show some promise, as three of the four studies show a beneficial intervention effect in terms of reduced waiting times.</P>
<P>Data on the effectiveness of distant consultancy on waiting time were limited to two studies, which evaluated two different types of distance consultancy for two different conditions: one providing specialist consultations for ENT patients through telemedicine (<LINK REF="STD-Hofstetter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hofstetter 2010</LINK>), and the other using teledermatology for specialist consultations (<LINK REF="STD-Leggett-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leggett 2004</LINK>). Both studies were at high risk of bias - the first study because of selective reporting bias, as it appeared to measure and report different things in the preintervention and postintervention periods and did not provide information on the numbers of successful or failed teleconsultations; the latter had high risk of attrition bias, with only 25.4% of intervention participants who received a 'photo-diagnosis' not needing to be seen by a dermatologist, while 38.0% needed to be seen face-to-face for further management, and for 36.6%, photo-diagnosis was not possible. Neither study showed a significant intervention effect.</P>
<P>Finally, evidence on the effect of introducing a generic waiting list in spinal surgery on the number of patients waiting less than a recommended time threshold or within a recommended time period was limited to only one observational study with high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Leach-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Leach 2004</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-01-22 06:06:49 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The search strategy used in this review was carefully developed by an experienced information technologist, and a comprehensive search, involving a large number of databases, was performed. One review author sifted all references identified by the electronic searches, excluding papers that clearly were not eligible, and two review authors independently assessed all potentially eligible titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria to ensure that no important references were missed. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted study authors about other published or unpublished studies. In addition, we searched trials registers for ongoing trials, along with a number of sources of grey literature. Despite all this, we cannot exclude the possibility that important references may have been missed.</P>
<P>Few studies were identified for inclusion in this review, and none claimed negative results that could be suggestive of publication bias. Unfortunately, because too few studies were identified for inclusion in this review, we could not assess publication bias.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-01-22 05:19:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Decision-makers should be aware that for interventions aimed at prioritising demand (e.g. co-payment, explicit referral criteria or practice guidelines, clinical priority scores), evidence is incomplete, and for those aimed at rationing demand or expanding capacity (e.g. providing additional funding to the public sector, subsidising or facilitating access to the private sector), evidence is lacking. Thus, implementation of such interventions should be monitored for both effectiveness and possible drawbacks.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-01-22 06:08:36 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the importance of long waiting times as a relevant healthcare problem, only scarce evidence of low quality is presently available.</P>
<P>RCTs and cluster-RCTs are ideally the best study designs to be applied to fill in this knowledge gap. Large and robust experimental studies might be difficult and expensive to set up, and represent unfamiliar ground in policy-making. However robust and useful evidence on the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing waiting time could be obtained with good quality interrupted time series studies, which are both feasible and practical.</P>
<P>Some points must be taken into consideration before one can plan and embark on a study addressing the effectiveness of any intervention to reduce waiting times for elective procedures.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Greater attention should be paid to the quality of study designs, and cluster-RCTs should be carefully controlled for contamination bias across interventions among the included clusters.</LI>
<LI>Researchers designing ITS studies should adhere to the quality criteria described by the EPOC Group (<LINK REF="REF-EPOC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC 2013</LINK>), for example, allow a sufficient number of data points before as well as after the intervention to enable reliable statistical inference, and use formal tests for trend, taking into account any secular trends.</LI>
<LI>A reliable primary outcome should be chosen: It is still uncertain which could be the most appropriate outcome measure - among the many available - that could best depict the 'long waiting time phenomenon'; however the <I>proportion of patients waiting above a recommended time threshold</I> appears to be suitable in terms of practical relevance, effective communication of results and statistical reliability. As interventions tend to act on supply or on demand, process outcomes - such as increase in supply or decrease in demand - should also be monitored to evaluate tenure of the causal mechanism between variation on supply/demand and waiting time; if the number of participants waiting too long is provided, the number of participants not waiting too long should also be reported.</LI>
</UL>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Future research</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Research evaluating interventions aimed at rationing services and/or prioritising demands or interventions aimed at expanding capacity is lacking and therefore needed.</LI>
<LI>Future researchers should make greater efforts to collect and analyse data on undesired consequences of interventions, as well as on economic outcomes in different health settings.</LI>
<LI>Interventions showing some promise (e.g. direct booking, open access, same-day scheduling) but also streamlining of services needs further evaluation.</LI>
<LI>Interventions involving advanced technology (i.e. distance consultancy) (telemedicine or photo specialist consultations) may need reevaluation in the light of rapidly evolving new and better technology.</LI>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Quote:</P>
<P>"Randomization was by referring practice to encourage consistency of referral behaviour and to avoid administrative complications within practices. Participating practices were randomised into intervention and control groups stratified by list size, fund holding status and rural or urban location. The practices in the eight blocks were placed into different coloured envelopes (one colour for each block). A coin was flipped to decide to commence with intervention or control allocation. From the first block of small list practices an envelope was selected and at the same time an envelope from a large list block was selected. These practices were randomised to the same arm of the trial and this process continued, allocating control or intervention alternately until all practices in those two groups were allocated into one of the two arms of the trial: one receiving and implementing the guidelines (intervention arm) and one maintaining the status quo (control arm). This process was carried out for each of the eight blocks"</P>

<P>"However, control patients also experienced a reduction in waiting time.

<P>Study protocol not available - so outcomes reported in the paper cannot be checked against any prespecified outcomes. However, it appears that different details were measured during the preintervention and postintervention periods. Before intervention, the waiting time for the participant to see the consultant face-to-face, and presumably get treatment, was measured. After intervention, the waiting time until the consultant sees the store and forward participant data sent by telemedicine was measured. But this is not when the participant gets treatment because no information is available on when the consultant diagnosis and treatment are given to the participant</P>

Not clear whether preintervention and/or postintervention data relate to waiting times for all 10 surgeons, or only for the 7 who agreed to the intervention.

<P>Discrepancies noted between figures - Figure 2 plots the number of participants waiting too long for elective surgery. Figure 6 plots the number of elective surgery admissions. According to these figures, the number of admissions is lower than the number of participants who had to wait too long, which does not make sense, It is unclear whether study authors each month added up the number of people who were currently waiting too long and were still waiting. So a person may appear on the graph for several consecutive months, that is, from the time they went over the recommended time to the time they underwent surgery. We contacted the study authors for clarification but received no response</P>
