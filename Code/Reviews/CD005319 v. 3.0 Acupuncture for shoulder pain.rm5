<P>
<B>
<BR/>Does acupuncture work for treating shoulder pain?</B>
<BR/>To answer this question, scientists found and analyzed 9 research studies. The studies tested over 500 people who had shoulder pain. People had either acupuncture, a placebo (fake therapy), ultrasound, gentle movement or exercises usually for 20-30 minutes, two to three times a week for 3 to 6 weeks. Even though the studies were small and not of the highest quality, this Cochrane review provides the best evidence we have today.</P>
<P>
<B>What causes shoulder pain and how can acupuncture help?</B>
<BR/>Shoulder pain can be caused by a number of different conditions. It can be caused by rotator cuff disease, periarthritis or adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder). Shoulder pain can sometimes go away on its own but may last up to 12 to 18 months. Drug and non-drug treatments are used to relieve pain and/or swelling. Acupuncture is a non-drug therapy being used more and more to treat shoulder pain. It is thought that acupuncture works either by releasing chemical compounds in the body that relieve pain, by overriding pain signals in the nerves or by allowing energy (Qi) or blood to flow freely through the body. It is not known whether acupuncture works or is safe.</P>
<P>
<B>How well does acupuncture work?</B>
<BR/>The improvements with acupuncture for pain and function were about the same as the effects of receiving a fake therapy for 2 to 4 weeks.</P>
<P>One study showed that acupuncture improved shoulder function more than fake therapy after 4 weeks. But after 4 months, improvements were about the same with only an improvement of 4 more points on a scale of 0 to 100 with acupuncture.</P>
<P>One small study showed that acupuncture plus exercise was better than just exercise for improving pain, range of motion and function for up to 5 months.</P>
<P>
<B>How safe is it?</B>
<BR/>Side effects were not measured in many of the studies. One study showed that side effects such as fainting, headache, dizziness, swelling or leg weakness, were about the same with acupuncture or fake therapy.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>What is the bottom line?</B>
<BR/>There is not enough evidence to say whether acupuncture works to treat shoulder pain or whether it is harmful.</P>
<P>From the little evidence that there is, acupuncture may improve pain and function over the short term (2 to 4 weeks).</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>There are many commonly employed forms of treatment for shoulder disorders. This review of acupuncture is one in a series of reviews of varying interventions for shoulder disorders including adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder), rotator cuff disease and osteoarthritis. Acupuncture to treat musculoskeletal pain is being used increasingly to confer an analgesic effect and to date its use in shoulder disorder has not been evaluated in a systematic review. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of adults with shoulder pain.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched from inception to December 2003, and reference lists from relevant trials were reviewed. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised trials, in all languages, of acupuncture compared to placebo or another intervention in adults with shoulder pain. Specific exclusions were duration of shoulder pain less than three weeks, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, cervically referred pain and fracture. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently extracted trial and outcome data. For continuous outcome measures where the standard deviations were not reported it was either calculated from the raw data or converted from the standard error of the mean. If neither of these was reported, authors were contacted. Where results were reported as median and range, the trial was not included in the meta-analysis, but presented in Additional Tables. Effect sizes were calculated and combined in a pooled analysis if the study end-points population and intervention were homogenous. Results are presented separately for rotator cuff disease, adhesive capsulitis, full thickness rotator cuff tear and mixed diagnoses, and, where possible, combined in meta-analysis to indicate effect of acupuncture across all shoulder disorders.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nine trials of varying methodological quality met the inclusion criteria. For all trials there was poor description of interventions. Varying placebos were used in the different trials. Two trials assessed short-term success (post intervention) of acupuncture for rotator cuff disease and could be combined in meta analysis. There was no significant difference in short-term improvement associated with acupuncture when compared to placebo, but due to small sample sizes this may be explained by Type II error. Acupuncture was of benefit over placebo in improving the Constant Murley Score (a measure of shoulder function) at four weeks (WMD 17.3 (7.79, 26.81)). However, by four months, the difference between the acupuncture and placebo groups, whilst still statistically significant, was no longer likely to be clinically significant (WMD 3.53 (0.74, 6.32)). The Constant Murley Score is graded out of 100, hence a change of 3.53 is unlikely to be of substantial benefit. The results of a small pilot study demonstrated some benefit of both traditional and ear acupuncture plus mobilization over mobilization alone. There was no difference in adverse events related to acupuncture when compared to placebo, however this was assessed by only one trial</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Due to a small number of clinical and methodologically diverse trials, little can be concluded from this review. There is little evidence to support or refute the use of acupuncture for shoulder pain although there may be short-term benefit with respect to pain and function. There is a need for further well designed clinical trials. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-16 17:24:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Conditions causing shoulder pain are common and contribute substantially to the musculoskeletal morbidity of the community (<LINK REF="REF-Bjelle-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjelle 1989</LINK>). The prevalence of shoulder disorders has been reported to range from seven to 36% of the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Lundberg-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundberg 1969</LINK>). Shoulder disorders account for 1.2% of all general practice encounters in Australia, being third only to back and neck complaints as musculoskeletal reasons for primary care consultation (<LINK REF="REF-Bridges_x002d_Webb-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridges-Webb 1992</LINK>). In Dutch general practice the incidence of shoulder disorders has been estimated to be 11.2 per 1000 registered patients per year (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Windt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Windt 1995</LINK>). The shoulder is frequently injured, particularly in competitive sports with eight to 13% of athletic injuries involving the shoulder (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prevalence of shoulder disorders has been shown to increase with age (<LINK REF="REF-Badley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badley 1992</LINK>). This finding has implications for the provision of health care in view of the aging of the population as a whole. Others however (<LINK REF="REF-Allander-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allander 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ingemar-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingemar 1993</LINK>) have demonstrated a decline in both the prevalence and incidence of shoulder pain with age, the peak prevalence occurring in the 56 - 60 year age group. As this section of the community is likely to be in paid employment, such peak prevalence has impact on the direct and indirect cost of shoulder disorders to the community.</P>
<P>Substantial disability may result from shoulder disorders. Moving the shoulder allows placement of the hand, hence compromised shoulder mobility impacts substantially on the performance of tasks essential to daily living (e.g. dressing, personal hygiene, eating and work). In addition, shoulder pain is often associated with impaired ability to sleep, so affecting mood and concentration. People with shoulder pain scored substantially less than normal values on the SF-36 (a standardised measure of general health) for physical function, social function, physical role function, emotional role function and pain (<LINK REF="REF-Gartsman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gartsman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beaton-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaton 1996</LINK>). Shoulder disorders are often recalcitrant with some studies demonstrating persisting pain and disability from 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Windt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Windt 1995</LINK>) to 18 months (<LINK REF="REF-Chard-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chard 1991</LINK>) in up to 50% of cases. </P>
<P>There are many commonly used treatments for shoulder disorders, including physiotherapy modalities, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticosteroid injections, oral glucocorticosteroids, manipulation under anaesthesia, hydrodilatation (distension arthrography), acupuncture and surgery. Whilst some interventions can be regarded as efficacious, overall there is limited evidence regarding the efficacy of these interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1998</LINK>). Furthermore, the interpretation of results of existing studies is often hampered by the fact that these disorders are labelled and defined in diverse and often conflicting ways (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>This review is one in a series of reviews aiming to establish the efficacy of common interventions for shoulder pain. This series of reviews form the update of an earlier Cochrane Review of all interventions for shoulder disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1999</LINK>). Since our previous review, many new clinical trials, studying a diverse range of interventions, have been performed. In order to update our review we have subdivided it into a series of reviews investigating the evidence for efficacy of single interventions. We have also broadened our review to include all randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials regardless of whether outcome assessment was blinded (unblinded trials were excluded from the original review).</P>
<P>Acupuncture to treat musculoskeletal pain is being increasingly accepted, by both clinicians and consumers of health care. Approximately one million consumers utilise acupuncture annually in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Paramore-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paramore 1997</LINK>), and a large percentage of these suffer musculoskeletal disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Diehl-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diehl 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Acupuncture is thought to confer an analgesic effect (Batra 1985; <LINK REF="REF-Viola-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viola 1998</LINK>). Several hypotheses for this effect have been proposed. Some authors attribute the analgesic effects to the release of b-endorphins in the lumbar spine and increased 5-Hydroxy tryptophan level in the cerebrum (<LINK REF="REF-Viola-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viola 1998</LINK>). Other explanations include the overriding of the pain stimulus by the biochemical lines of acupuncture in the transmitting process of the central nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-Viola-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viola 1998</LINK>), and the more traditional explanation of the freeing of a blockage of "Qi" (energy flow) or a stagnation of blood by acupuncture (<LINK REF="REF-Viola-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viola 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>Although acupuncture is sometimes used for the treatment of shoulder pain, few studies have investigated the efficacy of this intervention, and to our knowledge, no systematic review has been published specifically addressing the effectiveness of acupuncture for relief of pain and dysfunction of the shoulder. This review aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for shoulder pain. </P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>a) Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials regardless of publication type. Studies where participants were not randomised into intervention groups were excluded from the review. <BR/> <BR/>b) Trials in which allocation to intervention or control group was not concealed from the outcome assessor were included but recorded as such in the table of included studies.<BR/> <BR/>c) Studies in all languages were translated into English and considered for inclusion in the review. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Inclusion in this review was restricted to trials with participants meeting the following criteria:</P>
<P>a) Adults &gt;16 years of age.<BR/>b) Shoulder pain or disorder for greater than 3 weeks, irrespective of diagnostic label (unless an exclusion criteria). Studies that included various soft tissue disorders were considered if the results on shoulder pain were presented separately or if 90% or more of participants in the study had shoulder pain. <BR/>c) Studies of participants suffering a history of significant trauma or systemic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica and fracture, hemiplegic shoulders, post-operative and peri-operative shoulder pain and pain in the shoulder region as part of a complex myofacial neck/shoulder/arm pain were excluded.</P>
<P>Trials were sub-grouped into type of shoulder disorder for analysis (see methods section).</P>
<P>In our previous review, we performed a methodological review of the selection criteria used in the included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1998</LINK>). Study populations were broadly able to be categorised as either adhesive capsulitis (which included frozen shoulder and periarthritis) or rotator cuff disease (which included supraspinatus tendonitis, infraspinatus tendonitis, rotator cuff tendonitis, rotator cuff lesion, bursitis or subscapularis tendonitis) based upon the diagnostic labels and/or definitions of these labels when described. Some trials did not specify a diagnosis and some trials gave no selection criteria or definition of study population (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1998</LINK>). For this review we were broadly able to categorise the participants as adhesive capsulitis (including frozen shoulder and periarthritis), rotator cuff disease, osteoarthritis, and mixed diagnoses (including trials where a definition of study population was not specified).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>All randomised controlled comparisons of acupuncture versus placebo, no treatment, another intervention, or of varying types and dosages of acupuncture compared to each other were included and comparisons established according to intervention.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>No studies were excluded on the basis of outcome measure used. Outcomes reported in trials were pain, time to maximum pain relief, shoulder discomfort, range of motion (external and internal rotation, flexion, extension, and abduction), shoulder function, success or failure of treatment, and adverse events. </P>

<P>MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL (includes all major physiotherapy and occupational therapy journals from U.S.A., Canada, England, Australia and New Zealand), and Science Citation Index (SCISEARCH) were searched from inception to December 2003 .</P>

<BR/>In addition, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) Issue 4, 2003 was searched.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Following identification of potential trials for inclusion by the previously outlined search strategy, the methods sections of all identified trials were reviewed independently according to predetermined criteria (see selection criteria), by two reviewers. All articles were coded and details of source, intervention, population and funding recorded. Where the two reviewers disagreed it was planned that discussion would be facilitated in order to reach consensus, however, there were no disagreements.</P>
<P>Trials meeting inclusion criteria were then collated, and the methods and results sections re-sent to the same two reviewers for assessment of trial validity and data extraction.</P>
<P>ASSESSMENT OF VALIDITY<BR/>Validity of included trials was assessed by description of whether they met key criteria (including appropriate randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, number lost to follow up and intention to treat analysis). Trial quality was not scored numerically. The only quantitative scoring was given for allocation concealment, ranked as:<BR/>A: adequate<BR/>B: unclear, or<BR/>C: inadequate.</P>
<P>Whether or not trials were appropriately randomised (as described in the Cochrane Reviewer's Handbook)(<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2003</LINK>); blinded participants, care providers and outcome assessor; had complete follow up and used an intention to treat analysis was recorded on a pre-piloted data extraction sheet and later transposed into the Characteristics of Included Studies table. <BR/>Trial quality was assessed in this qualitative way as opposed to using a numerical or summary scale due to concerns regarding the validity of such scales and lack of information about whether all the criteria included in such scales impact on the overall outcome of the trial (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS<BR/>In order to assess efficacy, raw data for outcomes of interest (specifically means and standard deviations for continuous outcomes and number of events for binary outcomes) were extracted where available from the published reports. All standard errors of the mean were converted to standard deviation. Wherever data were converted or imputed, this was recorded in the notes section of the Characteristics of Included Studies table. For trials where the required data were not reported or able to be calculated, further details were requested from first authors. If no further details were provided, the trial was included in the review and fully described, but not included in the meta-analysis (i.e.. not included in the pooling of study data). An entry to that effect was made in the notes section of the Characteristics of Included Studies table.</P>
<P>When trial results were not normally distributed and so reported as median and range, the trial was not included in the meta-analysis but results presented in Additional Tables. <BR/>Meta-analysis was facilitated by RevMan software. The following choices of statistic and 95% confidence intervals were presented for all outcomes:<BR/> <BR/>CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES:<BR/>Weighted mean difference using a fixed effect model was selected when outcomes were measured on standard scales. When like outcomes were reported on non standard scales, using differing units and methods of assessment (for example disability scales), a standardised mean difference was selected. Possible clinical and methodological reasons for heterogeneity were explored, and in the presence of significant heterogeneity, trial results were not combined.</P>
<P>DICHOTOMOUS OUTCOMES:<BR/>Relative risk using a fixed effects model was selected for interpretation of dichotomous outcome measures in this review as we believe that this is the most appropriate statistic for interpretation when the event is common. Reasons for heterogeneity were evaluated and in the event of significant heterogeneity trial results were not pooled. </P>
<P>SUBGROUP ANALYSIS<BR/>Shoulder pain and disorder may be caused by varying underlying pathologies, and the diagnostic criteria for defining these disorders are not consistent nor reliably applied. Resulting from this, many trials investigate interventions in non-defined or mixed populations of participants, while others report a specific diagnosis, for example, rotator cuff disease or adhesive capsulitis. Trials included in this review were therefore divided into subgroups based on the description of the study population provided by the trial. Results were analysed both within diagnostic subgroups and across all disorders. This was planned a priori.</P>

Details of the nine included studies are given in the Table of Included studies and are described below.</P>
<P>Results from six trials were published in English (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ceccherelli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ceccherelli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dyson_x002d_Hudson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson-Hudson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kleinhenz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kleinhenz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2001</LINK>) and two were published in Chinese (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yuan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yuan 1995</LINK>). The study design of the ninth trial was published in English and results from the pilot of the trial were obtained from the author (<LINK REF="STD-Romoli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Romoli 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was methodological and clinical diversity in the included trials. Shoulder conditions included rotator cuff syndrome (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kleinhenz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kleinhenz 1999</LINK>), periarthritis (<LINK REF="STD-Yuan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yuan 1995</LINK>), adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2001</LINK>) and general or mixed shoulder pain (<LINK REF="STD-Ceccherelli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ceccherelli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dyson_x002d_Hudson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson-Hudson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romoli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Romoli 2000</LINK>). In one of these trials, the participants had shoulder pain as a result of wheelchair use (<LINK REF="STD-Dyson_x002d_Hudson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson-Hudson 2001</LINK>). One trial was in a population with periarticular disease (tendonitis or bursitis) or osteoarthritis (<LINK REF="STD-Moore-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1976</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three studies compared acupuncture to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kleinhenz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kleinhenz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1976</LINK>). Placebo methods included using placebo needles that did not penetrate the skin (<LINK REF="STD-Kleinhenz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kleinhenz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1976</LINK>) and placebo tolmetin sodium plus placebo ultrasound (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1980</LINK>) .</P>
<P>Five trials compared acupuncture to other interventions. One of these trials included both an ultrasound group and a steroid injection group as comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1980</LINK>). Other comparison interventions included nerve block (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1994</LINK>), mobilization alone (<LINK REF="STD-Romoli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Romoli 2000</LINK>), exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Sun-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2001</LINK>) and Trager (<LINK REF="STD-Dyson_x002d_Hudson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson-Hudson 2001</LINK>). Trager is a form of body work and movement re-education based on the Trager theory that puts forward the notion that the mind contributes to pain by maintaining muscles and other soft tissue in a chronically contracted and inflammatory position. Trager includes gentle movements to loosen joints and release chronic pain and a system of effortless movement sequences called mentastics exercises.</P>
<P>Two studies compared different types of acupuncture with comparisons made between deep and shallow acupuncture (<LINK REF="STD-Ceccherelli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ceccherelli 2001</LINK>) and acupuncture with sites determined by pathogenesis according to traditional Chinese medicine and the distribution of Jing-Luo (<LINK REF="STD-Yuan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yuan 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The type of acupuncture used in each trial varied only slightly and was described as traditional or classic acupuncture (i.e. according to traditional Chinese medicine) which includes (though not always specified) reaching the point where the phenomena of soreness, numbness &amp; heaviness are experienced. There was some variation in number of points used and in some cases electrical stimulus was added (<LINK REF="STD-Batra-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Batra 1985</LINK>). Moxibustion was used in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1980</LINK>). Treatments were typically of twenty to thirty minutes duration and were conducted two or three times a week for a period of three to six weeks, resulting in the course of most treatments ranging between eight and 12 sessions. Exceptions were in the trial by Moore (<LINK REF="STD-Moore-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1976</LINK>) where treatment was once a week for three weeks and in the trial by Yuan (<LINK REF="STD-Yuan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yuan 1995</LINK>) where participants received a session every second day for a total of five treatments. The treatment procedures and regimen were not always described fully in each trial, and are summarised in the 'interventions' column of the Characteristics of Included Studies table.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Included studies were of varying methodological quality. A full description of each trial against the predetermined quality assessment criteria can be found in the Characteristics of Included Studies table. Trial populations were on the whole small (median sample size = 44, range 18 to 150). The smallest trial had six drop-outs and it is not stated if an intention to treat analysis was carried out. The second smallest trial (N=24) was only the pilot phase of a larger trial that is underway and the unpublished data from the pilot study was provided by the trialist (<LINK REF="STD-Romoli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Romoli 2000</LINK>). Allocation concealment was adequate in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kleinhenz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kleinhenz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romoli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Romoli 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yuan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yuan 1995</LINK>), unclear in five (<LINK REF="STD-Ceccherelli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ceccherelli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dyson_x002d_Hudson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson-Hudson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2001</LINK>) and inadequate in one (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1980</LINK>). Seven trials blinded outcome assessor (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dyson_x002d_Hudson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson-Hudson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kleinhenz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kleinhenz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romoli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Romoli 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yuan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yuan 1995</LINK>) and two blinded participants (<LINK REF="STD-Kleinhenz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kleinhenz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1976</LINK>). There was adequate follow-up in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ceccherelli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ceccherelli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kleinhenz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kleinhenz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Eight trials presented sufficient data to be included in meta-analysis. Data from the ninth trial (<LINK REF="STD-Moore-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1976</LINK>) is included in Additional Table 1.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>ACUPUNCTURE COMPARED TO PLACEBO<BR/>Two trials assessed success rate of acupuncture in the short term (defined as a positive rating by participants in <LINK REF="STD-Kleinhenz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kleinhenz 1999</LINK> and by no need for follow-up steroid injection by assessors in <LINK REF="STD-Berry-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1980</LINK>) for rotator cuff disease. There was no significant difference between success rates in the acupuncture group compared to the placebo group (RR 1.01 (0.69 to 1.48)). Nor was there a significant difference between acupuncture and placebo in reducing pain or increasing the range of abduction in the short term (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1980</LINK>). One small trial did demonstrate a significant difference post intervention (4 weeks) favouring the acupuncture group for improved shoulder pain, range of movement and functioning measured by a composite score of these factors (The Constant Murley Score) (WMD 17.3 (7.79, 26.81) out of a total score of 100). At four months follow-up a significant difference remained between the groups, however the difference between the change in scores in the acupuncture group and the change in scores in the placebo group was unlikely to be clinically significant (WMD 3.53(0.74 to 6.32)) (i.e.. a change of 3.53 on a scale of 100 is unlikely to represent a clinically significant improvement). A third trial, whose results could not be included in the meta-analysis due to insufficient data, failed to demonstrate a significant difference between acupuncture and placebo in a measure of subjective improvement post intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Moore-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 1976</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one trial included adverse effects as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Kleinhenz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kleinhenz 1999</LINK>), finding no difference between groups with respect to the incidence of fainting, headache, dizziness, inflammatory reactions or leg weakness.</P>
<P>ACUPUNCTURE COMPARED TO STEROID INJECTION<BR/>One trial compared acupuncture to anterior glenohumeral injection of corticosteroid for rotator cuff disease, with only 12 participants in each group (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1980</LINK>). There was no significant difference from placebo following treatment with respect to pain (WMD 7.5 (-12.47 to 27.47)), range of abduction (WMD 2.9 (-26.83 to 32.62) or success rate (RR 0.83 (0.35 to 2.00)).</P>
<P>ACUPUNCTURE COMPARED TO ULTRASOUND<BR/>The same trial (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1980</LINK>) with 12 participants per group compared acupuncture to ultrasound and demonstrated no significant difference between groups following treatment with respect to pain (WMD -7.10 (-32.90 to 18.70)), range of abduction (WMD 7.9 (-21.59 to 37.39) or success rate (RR 0.83 (0.35 to 2.00)).</P>
<P>ELECTROACUPUNCTURE COMPARED TO STELLATE GANGLION BLOCK AND SUPRASCAPULAR NERVE BLOCK<BR/>A trial of 100 participants with adhesive capsulitis, published in Chinese, investigated the relative effects of electroacupuncture and regional nerve block (anaesthesia of stellate ganglion and suprascapular nerve) (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 1994</LINK>). There was a significant difference favouring nerve block over acupuncture in reducing pain at 30 hours follow-up (WMD 1.33 (1.22 to 1.44 )) (out of a total score of 4). The time to achieve maximum pain relief was significantly shorter in the nerve block group (WMD 64.96 (60.50 to 69.42 minutes)). There was a statistically significant but small difference favouring nerve block in increasing range of flexion (WMD -7.00 (-11.17 to -2.83)). No adverse effect was assessed for either intervention. This trial gives no information as to the relative effect of either intervention compared to no treatment or placebo.</P>
<P>ACUPUNCTURE PLUS MOBILISATION VERSUS ACUPUNCTURE ALONE<BR/>In a pilot study of participants with general shoulder pain (of no particular diagnosis) (<LINK REF="STD-Romoli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Romoli 2000</LINK>), eight in the acupuncture plus mobilization group and eight in the mobilization only group, results post intervention revealed no significant difference between the acupuncture plus mobilization compared to mobilization alone with respect to pain at rest (WMD -0.37(-1.85 to 1.11)), pain on movement (WMD 0.25 (-1.87 to 2.37)) (out of a total of 10), or active flexion (WMD -13.13(-39.79 to 13.53) and abduction (WMD -14.37 (-49.94 to 21.20)). No longer term follow-up data were provided by the trialist, nor is there information regarding the effect of either intervention compared to placebo or no treatment. </P>
<P>ACUPUNCTURE PLUS EXERCISE VERSUS EXERCISE ALONE<BR/>A small trial comparing acupuncture and exercise with exercise alone for adhesive capsulitis (<LINK REF="STD-Sun-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2001</LINK>) showed a significant difference favouring the acupuncture plus exercise group in a composite measure of pain, range of motion and functioning post intervention (WMD 9.20 (0.54 to 17.86)) (out of a total score of 100). The effect remained at 20 weeks follow-up (WMD 9.40 (0.52 to 18.28)).</P>
<P>ACUPUNCTURE VERSUS TRAGAR<BR/>One trial compared acupuncture and Tragar for the treatment of general shoulder pain (no particular diagnosis) due to wheel chair use (<LINK REF="STD-Dyson_x002d_Hudson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dyson-Hudson 2001</LINK>). There were no significant differences in pain scores post intervention (WMD 1.70 (-21.91 to 25.31)) or at five weeks follow-up (WMD 16.00 (-9.03 to 41.03)) (out of a total of 150) between the groups. This trial provides no information about the benefits of acupuncture or Tragar compared to placebo or no intervention.</P>
<P>DEEP VERSUS SHALLOW ACUPUNCTURE<BR/>In a trial comparing deep acupuncture and shallow acupuncture in those with general shoulder pain (no particular diagnosis) there was a significant difference favouring deep acupuncture over shallow acupuncture with respect to pain post intervention (WMD -10.31 (-15.44 to -5.18)) and at three months follow-up (-8.00 (-12.20 to -3.80). Pain was recorded using the Mc Gill Pain Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Melzack-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melzack 1975</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Ceccherelli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ceccherelli 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>JING LUO VERSUS TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE ACUPUNCTURE<BR/>There was a significantly greater recovery rate in the group where acupuncture sites were determined according to the distribution of Jing Luo compared to sites determined according to pathogenesis in the theory of traditional Chinese medicine (RR 1.50 (1.08 to 2.09)) for periarthritis (<LINK REF="STD-Yuan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yuan 1995</LINK>). This trial gives no information about the benefits of acupuncture compared to placebo or no treatment.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Based on our review, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of acupuncture for shoulder disorders. Nine trials of varying methodological quality, most of which were small, met the inclusion criteria. There were often incomplete descriptions of interventions, which varied between trials. There were a large number of different comparison groups, including different placebo interventions. </P>
<P>There were few significant findings with regard to the use of acupuncture when compared to placebo or other interventions. Due to small sample sizes it is possible that this may be explained by Type II error. Acupuncture was of benefit over placebo in improving the Constant Murley Score (a measure of shoulder function), however, by the three month follow-up, the difference between the acupuncture and placebo groups, whilst still statistically significant, was no longer likely to be clinically significant. Acupuncture used in combination with exercise was demonstrated to be more effective than exercise alone in one small trial. Deep acupuncture was shown to be more effective than shallow acupuncture and acupuncture using sites determined by Jing Luo was more effective than that using sites determined by traditional Chinese medicine, however, neither of these trials included placebo or other intervention comparison groups. In one of the larger trials, nerve block was found to be more effective than acupuncture on a range of outcome measures but no follow-up data were reported and the pain outcome measurement used may be inappropriate. Few trials reported adverse events associated with acupuncture when compared to placebo or other interventions. </P>
<P>This review has highlighted the paucity of methodologically rigorous, well described randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes assessing acupuncture for shoulder disorders. Trials lack standardised interventions, placebos and comparisons. A limited amount of pooling was possible in this review which indicates that some progress has been made with regard to the selection of standardised, valid and reliable outcome measures since our initial review in 1999. However, it is still true that the failure to apply a core set of measures to determine outcome in shoulder disorders limits the degree to which the results of different trials can be compared and/or pooled and firm conclusions regarding efficacy can be drawn.</P>
<P>Our analysis did differentiate between the nature of the populations being studied, however, there were few trials within each of these sub-groups and over all few conclusions could be made. This is nevertheless an important point to keep in mind when considering the efficacy of acupuncture as it may vary depending on the different underlying causes of shoulder pain. As there were a small number of trials and they were testing varying interventions in various populations against varying controls, it is difficult to interpret the evidence and draw conclusions about the value of acupuncture for these disorders.</P>
<P>Of particular note is that few trials measure disability associated with shoulder disorder. Disability may in fact be the most important endpoint, particularly from the patient's perspective, and we would encourage future trials to use shoulder specific disability as a primary outcome in determining effect. </P>
<P>Further standardisation in timing of outcome assessment is also required as is longer term follow-up of outcomes to determine any lasting effects. Some of the included trials did not blind the outcome assessor and therefore, given the measures of effect were based on the subjective outcomes of pain and treatment success, it is likely the results of the included trials may have overestimated effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Due to a small number of clinical and methodologically diverse trials, little can be concluded from this review. There is little evidence to either support or refute the use of acupuncture for treating shoulder pain and more trials are needed. The limited evidence available indicates some short term benefit of acupuncture compared to placebo with respect to shoulder specific disability. Little is known of the potential for adverse effects.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials serve to identify areas of clinical practice where further research is required. When sound conclusions about efficacy cannot be made after this process, there is a need for methodologically sound randomised controlled trials to justify or censure current treatment strategies. </P>
<P>One trial included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Kleinhenz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kleinhenz 1999</LINK>) developed an appropriate placebo for use in acupuncture trials which may inform future trials.</P>
<P>Further trials should consider assessing the effect of acupuncture when combined with other modalities, define study population by clear diagnostic criteria, use standardised outcome measures for disability and pain, be adequately powered, follow up participants to determine longer term outcome and give consideration to adverse effect.</P>

<P>Group 1: Acupuncture consisting of two 20-30 minute sessions for five weeks using .20 mm diametre, 40mm long needles placed 1-3cm into skin and manually stimulated to achieve Qi sensation ie. heaviness, soreness, numbness. Needles retained for 20 minutes with one additional manual stimulation.<BR/>Group 2: Trager Psychophysical Integration. This approach has no set protocol but includes table work and mentastics exercises. Table work includes gentle movements to loosen joints, ease movement and release chronic pain. Mentastics is a system of simple effortless movement sequences to reinforce and enhance the feeling of relaxation and pain free movement experienced during table work. It is based on Tragers' theory that the mind, through the nervous system, contributes to pain by maintaining the muscles in a chronically contracted and inflammed position.</P>
