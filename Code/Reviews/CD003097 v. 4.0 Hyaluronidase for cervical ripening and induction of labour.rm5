<P>Sometimes it is considered beneficial to bring labour on artificially and there are many methods currently used. One method is an injection of hyaluronidase into the cervix.

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2009-07-17 10:01:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Dilatation and effacement of the cervix are not only a result of uterine contractions, but are also dependant upon ripening processes within the cervix. The cervix is a fibrous organ composed principally of hyaluronic acid, collagen and proteoglycan. Hyaluronic acid increases markedly after the onset of labour. An increase in the level of hyaluronic acid is associated with an increase in tissue water content. Cervical ripening during labour is characterised by changes of the cervix and an increased water content. Cervical injection of hyaluronidase was postulated to increase cervical ripening. This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour induction using standardised methodology.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>A strategy was developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. This involved a two-stage method of data extraction. We assessed trial quality.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>One trial, with 168 women participating, was included in the review.</P>
<P>When compared with placebo for cervical ripening intracervical injections of hyaluronidase resulted in women receiving significantly fewer caesarean sections (18% versus 49%, relative risk (RR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.61), less need for oxytocin augmentation (10% versus 47%, RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.41), and increased cervical favourability after 24 hours (60% versus 98%, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.74). No side-effects for mother or baby were reported in this trial.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Intracervical injections of hyaluronidase for cervical ripening appear beneficial. However, this is not common practice. In addition it is an invasive procedure that women may find unacceptable in the presence of less invasive methods. </P>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Sometimes it is considered beneficial to bring on labour artificially because of safety concerns for the mother or baby. This review is one of a series of reviews of methods of labour induction using a standardised protocol. For more detailed information on the rationale for this methodological approach, please refer to the currently published 'generic' protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2000</LINK>). The generic protocol describes how a number of standardised reviews will be combined to compare various methods of preparing the cervix of the uterus and inducing labour.</P>
<P>Dilatation and effacement of the cervix are not only a result of uterine contractions, but are also dependant upon ripening processes within the cervix. The cervix is a fibrous organ composed principally of hyaluronic acid, collagen and proteoglycan. Hyaluronic acid increases as pregnancy progresses, increases markedly after the onset of labour and decreases rapidly after birth of the infant (<LINK REF="REF-Ogawa-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogawa 1998</LINK>). An increase in the level of hyaluronic acid is associated with an increase in tissue water content. Cervical ripening during labour is characterised by changes of the cervix with softening of the tissue and an increased water content (<LINK REF="REF-Kobayashi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kobayashi 1999</LINK>). Intracervical injection of hyaluronidase was postulated to promote cervical ripening.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Clinical trials comparing hyaluronidase for cervical ripening or labour induction, with placebo/no treatment or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of methods of labour induction (<I>see</I> 'Methods of the review'); the trials included some form of random allocation to either group; and they reported one or more of the prestated outcomes.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Hyaluronidase in comparison with other methods of cervical ripening or induction of labour above it in a predefined list of methods.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Clinically relevant outcomes for trials of methods of cervical ripening/labour induction have been prespecified by two authors of labour induction reviews (Justus Hofmeyr and Zarko Alfirevic). Differences were settled by discussion.</P>
<P>Five primary outcomes were chosen as being most representative of the clinically important measures of effectiveness and complications. Subgroup analyses will be limited to the primary outcomes: <BR/>(1) vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours (or period specified by trial authors);<BR/>(2) uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes;<BR/>(3) caesarean section;<BR/>(4) serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death (e.g. seizures, birth asphyxia defined by trialists, neonatal encephalopathy, disability in childhood);<BR/>(5) serious maternal morbidity or death (e.g. uterine rupture, admission to intensive care unit, septicaemia).</P>
<P>Perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality are composite outcomes. This is not an ideal solution because some components are clearly less severe than others. It is possible for one intervention to cause more deaths but less severe morbidity. However, in the context of labour induction at term this is unlikely. All these events will be rare, and a modest change in their incidence will be easier to detect if composite outcomes are presented. The incidence of individual components will be explored as secondary outcomes (see below).</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes relate to measures of effectiveness, complications and satisfaction:</P>
<P>Measures of effectiveness:<BR/>(6) cervix unfavourable/unchanged after 12 to 24 hours;<BR/>(7) oxytocin augmentation.</P>
<P>Complications:<BR/>(8) uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes;<BR/>(9) uterine rupture;<BR/>(10) epidural analgesia;<BR/>(11) instrumental vaginal delivery;<BR/>(12) meconium stained liquor;<BR/>(13) Apgar score &lt; 7 at 5 minutes;<BR/>(14) neonatal intensive care unit admission;<BR/>(15) neonatal encephalopathy;<BR/>(16) perinatal death;<BR/>(17) disability in childhood;<BR/>(18) maternal side effects (all);<BR/>(19) maternal nausea;<BR/>(20) maternal vomiting;<BR/>(21) maternal diarrhoea;<BR/>(22) other maternal side-effects;<BR/>(23) postpartum haemorrhage (as defined by the trial authors);<BR/>(24) serious maternal complications (e.g. intensive care unit admission, septicaemia but excluding uterine rupture);<BR/>(25) maternal death.</P>
<P>Measures of satisfaction:<BR/>(26) woman not satisfied;<BR/>(27) caregiver not satisfied.</P>
<P>'Uterine rupture' includes all clinically significant rupture of unscarred or scarred uteri. Trivial scar dehiscence noted incidentally at the time of surgery is excluded.</P>
<P>Additional outcomes may appear in individual primary reviews, but will not contribute to the secondary reviews.</P>
<P>While all the above outcomes were sought, only those with data appear in the analysis tables.</P>
<P>The terminology of uterine hyperstimulation is problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1987</LINK>). In the reviews we will use the term 'uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes' to include uterine tachysystole (&gt; 5 contractions per 10 minutes for at least 20 minutes) and uterine hypersystole/hypertonus (a contraction lasting at least two minutes) and 'uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes' to denote uterine hyperstimulation syndrome (tachysystole or hypersystole with fetal heart rate changes such as persistent decelerations, tachycardia or decreased short-term variability). However, due to varied reporting there is the possibility of subjective bias in interpretation of these outcomes. Also it is not always clear from trials if these outcomes are reported in a mutually exclusive manner.</P>
<P>Outcomes were included in the analysis: if reasonable measures were taken to minimise observer bias; and data were available for analysis according to original allocation.</P>

<P>For most reviews, the data extraction process was conducted centrally. This was co-ordinated from the Clinical Effectiveness Support Unit (CESU) at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, UK, in co-operation with the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group of The Cochrane Collaboration. This process allowed the data extraction process to be standardised across all the reviews. From 2001, data extraction was no longer conducted centrally.</P>
<P>The trials were initially reviewed on eligibility criteria, using a standardised form and the basic selection criteria specified above. Following this data were extracted to a standardised data extraction form which was piloted for consistency and completeness. The pilot process involved the researchers at the CESU and previous authors in the area of induction of labour. </P>
<P>Information was extracted regarding the methodological quality of trials on a number of levels. This process was completed without consideration of trial results. Assessment of selection bias examined the process involved in the generation of the random sequence and the method of allocation concealment separately. These were then judged as adequate or inadequate using the criteria described in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for the purpose of the reviews.</P>
<P>Individual outcome data are included in the analysis if they meet the prestated criteria in 'Types of outcome measures'. If appropriate, included trial data are processed as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>).</P>

</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Four studies were found, which examine the effects of hyaluronidase, two of which were in combination with other interventions. They were not considered for inclusion in this review, but will be considered in the review on 'other methods of induction', where the role of complex interventions for induction of labour is examined. One study examined the effect of hyaluronidase in combination with amniotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1967</LINK>) and another study examined the effects of hyaluronidase in combination with dexamethasone (<LINK REF="REF-Li-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1994</LINK>). One study was excluded from the review (<LINK REF="STD-Penev-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Penev 1982</LINK>) as it was not a controlled trial but utilised a one-group pre-test, post-test design.</P>
<P>The included study was conducted in Brazil. The participants were 168 women at term with normal pregnancy. They included 94 primiparae and 74 multiparae, 34 of whom had previously given birth by caesarean section. The women in the experimental group received two intracervical injections of 20.000 UI lyophylizated hyaluronidase (diluted in 5 ml distilled water), one each to the upper and lower cervix. The control group received similar placebo injections.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The included study (<LINK REF="STD-Spallicci-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Spallicci 2003</LINK>) was a double-blind randomised controlled trial. Allocation to the intervention and control groups was by random number tables and concealment of allocation was ensured through the use of coded drug boxes. None of the 168 women dropped out of the study and so there were no losses to follow up.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>One trial, with 168 women participating, was included. The following primary outcomes were not reported, vaginal delivery within 24 hours, and serious maternal or neonatal morbidity or death. Significantly fewer women gave birth by caesarean section in the experimental group when compared to the control group (18% versus 49%, relative risk (RR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.61). This finding remained significant when primiparous and multiparous women (including those with a previous caesarean section) were analysed separately. However, an interaction test showed no evidence of different effects between these sub-groups (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.53 to 4.58). Significantly less women who received hyaluronidase had an unchanged/unfavourable cervix after 24 hours (60% versus 98%, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.74), there were also significantly less instances of women requiring oxytocin augmentation in this group (10% versus 47%, RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.41). The outcome maternal satisfaction was not reported. A non-significant trend for reported maternal pain was noted in the hyaluronidase group (11% versus 21%, RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.07). There were no instances of uterine hyperstimulation with or without fetal heart rate changes, or of maternal infection.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>When compared with placebo for cervical ripening intracervical injections of hyaluronidase resulted in women receiving significantly fewer caesarean sections, less need for oxytocin augmentation, and increased cervical favourability after 24 hours. No side-effects for mother or baby were reported in this trial. However, the use of intracervical injections might be unacceptable to many women given that it is an invasive procedure, and other less invasive and effective methods are available. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The promotion of cervical ripening before the onset of uterine contractions in the process of induction of labour is highly desirable. However, intracervical injections of hyaluronidase for cervical ripening in pregnant women at term is not a widely used treatment modality. In addition, it is an invasive procedure that women may find unacceptable given that there are less invasive methods of cervical ripening to choose from. Given these factors, and despite the evidence of both a reduction in the number of women requiring oxytocin augmentation or caesarean section, this is unlikely to be a modality used in clinical practice given the presence of other effective and less invasive procedures.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Hyaluronidase is not now in common use for induction of labour. Given this, the review authors consider that further research in this area is probably unwarranted, however if research is conducted on this modality in the future an important outcome to measure would be maternal acceptability. Potential areas of research could include development and assessment of non-invasive delivery methods of hyaluronidase.</P>
