Although administering a higher dose of amino acids in parenteral nutrition via a vein provides potential benefits, possible side effects from excess protein due to immaturity of the infant's liver and kidneys, which are responsible for utilising protein and removing protein waste from the body, remain a matter of concern.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>The review included 21 studies that reported clinical outcomes in very preterm or low birth weight infants. Reporting was incomplete for all outcomes.

Not enough information is available to determine whether this had an effect on neurodevelopment. Higher amino acid intake was associated with lower rates of growth failure, increased head growth, and fewer premature eye problems (eye problems were not severe). Higher amino acid intake was also associated with increased levels of protein breakdown products (urea) and a lower incidence of high blood glucose levels.</P><P><B>Conclusions</B></P><P>Higher amino acid intake did not affect survival but reduced the incidence of growth failure up to the time of hospital discharge. Higher amino acid intake may produce other effects, including an increase in head growth and a reduction in eye problems (retinopathy of prematurity), although these effects are uncertain. Evidence suggests that high amino acid intake may not be tolerated by all infants. Further research is needed to determine the optimal amino acid intake for parenteral nutrition and nutritional balance in preterm infants.</P><P><B>Quality of evidence </B></P><P>Low-quality evidence suggests that higher AA intake in parenteral nutrition does not affect mortality.

Sick newborn and preterm infants frequently are not able to be fed enterally, necessitating parenteral fluid and nutrition. Despite advances in neonatal care, postnatal growth failure continues to be a ubiquitous problem among preterm neonates. In a 1995 to 1996 cohort of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in the National Institute of Health and Child Development Research Network, 22% of the cohort was small for gestational age (SGA) at birth; however by 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA), 97% of the cohort was below the 10th percentile in weight (<LINK REF="REF-Lemons-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemons 2001</LINK>). Although inadequate nutritional support increases risks of postnatal growth failure and neurodevelopmental impairment among preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1998</LINK>), aggressive nutritional support might place them at higher risk of protein intolerance, development of metabolic syndrome with insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease in later childhood and adulthood (<LINK REF="REF-Ehrenkranz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrenkranz 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Embleton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Embleton 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ong-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ong 2007</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-02-09 00:20:46 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Parenteral nutrition is widely used to prevent growth failure and malnutrition when nutritional support is provided to sick neonates who are unable to tolerate enteral intake owing to prematurity or the nature of their illness (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EPSGHAN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPSGHAN 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fusch-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fusch 2009</LINK>). An idealised optimal nutritional goal for neonates is one that duplicates normal in utero foetal growth rates (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1998</LINK>). Maximal weight-specific protein gain occurs before 32 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Micheli-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Micheli 1993</LINK>), and the foetus uses amino acids as a major energy source (<LINK REF="REF-Gresham-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gresham 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lemons-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemons 1976</LINK>). Postnatally, nutrition is generally introduced gradually over the first week of life because of concerns about nutrient intolerance by extreme preterm infants or very ill neonates. Lipids and glucose are frequently used at rates that exceed in utero delivery rates, but amounts of amino acid are lower than those provided at in utero delivery rates. Increasing amino acid intake during parenteral nutrition provided shortly after birth has the potential to increase protein accretion rates and growth in newborn infants. Amino acid intake may be increased during parenteral nutrition by providing increased start or initial intake of amino acids, increased rate of grading of amino acids, increased final intake of amino acids, or a combination of these strategies. Amino acid intake, particularly in the early transitional phase of a preterm infant's life, is limited by the range of fluid load and protein intake that an adapting or sick infant can deal with, as well as by the stability of the parenteral nutrition formulation (<LINK REF="REF-EPSGHAN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPSGHAN 2005</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-02-26 13:09:34 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>A concern associated with high amino acid intake in parenteral nutrition involves protein intolerance as reflected by higher ammonia and blood urea levels. These higher levels may reflect effective use of amino acids rather than protein intolerance (<LINK REF="REF-Thureen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thureen 1999</LINK>). In contrast, low initial amino acids have been associated with postnatal malnutrition and have produced measurable growth failure at hospital discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Ehrenkranz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrenkranz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ziegler-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziegler 1991</LINK>). Low early protein intake is also associated with poor long-term developmental outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1998</LINK>).</P><P>Prevention of a negative nitrogen balance is achieved in preterm infants by providing amino acids at a rate of 1 to 1.5 g/kg/d (<LINK REF="REF-Kashyap-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kashyap 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rivera-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thureen--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thureen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Lingen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">van Lingen 1992</LINK>). Achieving a body composition that more closely resembles foetal body composition may require a higher amino acid intake. In the extremely low birth weight infant, achieving intrauterine protein accretion rates may require up to 3.85 g/kg/d of protein (<LINK REF="REF-Ziegler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziegler 1994</LINK>). Evidence suggests that preterm infants may have a higher protein turnover rate relative to term infants (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 1996</LINK>). Animal studies such as <LINK REF="REF-Lemons-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemons 1976</LINK> and human studies such as <LINK REF="REF-Gresham-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gresham 1971</LINK> have shown that amino acids are a significant source of energy during intrauterine life. In addition to protein intake, energy is required for protein anabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Kashyap-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kashyap 1994</LINK>). Intake of 25 to 40 kcal of non-protein energy per gram of protein allows optimal protein accretion (<LINK REF="REF-Cauderay-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cauderay 1988</LINK>). When energy availability from a non-protein nitrogen source is limited, protein anabolism is decreased and protein is used for energy. When energy is limited and protein is used as an energy source, optimal protein synthesis cannot occur (<LINK REF="REF-Kashyap-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kashyap 1994</LINK>). On the other hand, increasing non-protein nitrogen calories without increasing protein intake is also not helpful. Preterm and term infants showed an increase in protein synthesis of a similar magnitude with parenteral nutrition, whereas increasing intravenous glucose administration did not decrease proteolysis despite a threefold increase in insulin concentration (<LINK REF="REF-Denne-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denne 1996</LINK>).</P><P>Potential benefits of higher protein intake also include greater growth of lean tissue and bone mass, thereby preventing postnatal growth failure and leading to improved glucose tolerance, synthesis of hormones and enzymes, and maintenance of oncotic pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Fomon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fomon 1993</LINK>). In an animal study, higher protein intake was shown to accelerate maturation of the renal tubules (<LINK REF="REF-Jakobsson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jakobsson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thureen--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thureen 2003</LINK>). Deficiency of protein in infants leads to growth failure causing oedema and decreased resistance to infection (<LINK REF="REF-Nayak-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nayak 1989</LINK>).</P><P>Risks of higher protein intake include increased concentrations of amino acids (especially tyrosine and phenylalanine), metabolic acidosis, hyperammonaemia, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (<LINK REF="REF-Micheli-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Micheli 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Senterre-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senterre 1983</LINK>). This risk is more pronounced with increasing prematurity. High protein intake could lead to cholestasis, and the phosphate content of amino acid solutions may increase the neonate's tendency toward hypocalcaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Andronikou-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andronikou 1983</LINK>). Renal hypertrophy and increased circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 have been reported secondary to high protein intake (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1993</LINK>). High protein intake in early life may increase risks of long-term obesity and development of diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Raiha-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raiha 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rolland-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolland 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scaglioni-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scaglioni 2000</LINK>).

Metabolic acidosis, elevated serum ammonia and hypoglycaemia were not a complication of early administration of amino acids. Elevated blood urea nitrogen is consistently associated with early administration of amino acids." Elevated blood urea nitrogen levels reported in this review are above those reported in normal foetuses from cord blood, as in <LINK REF="REF-Gresham-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gresham 1971</LINK>, and in newborn infants receiving a mean 1.8 g/kg/d parenteral nutrition, as in <LINK REF="REF-Ridout-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ridout 2005</LINK>. However, it is unclear what ammonia levels are normal in preterm infants. All six infants with an ammonia &gt; 69 &#956;mol/L - the level seen in infants after the first week - were receiving higher levels of amino acid. The biochemical safety of very high early amino acid intake in parenteral nutrition remains unclear.</P><P>The Cochrane Review "Early introduction of lipids to parenterally-fed preterm infants" reported that "no statistically significant effects of 'early introduction' of lipids on short-term nutritional or other clinical outcomes, either benefits or adverse effects, were demonstrated in the studies reviewed" (<LINK REF="REF-Simmer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmer 2006</LINK>). That review did not report biochemical tolerance. The findings of our review that early lipid intake may have potential subgroup effects including increased growth, reduced glucose tolerance, reduced retinopathy of prematurity, and increased chronic lung disease are related to the effects of higher amino acid intake in parenteral nutrition in the context of early lipid intake.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-09 02:09:34 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-02-09 02:04:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Low-quality evidence suggests that higher amino acid (AA) intake in parenteral nutrition does not affect mortality. Very low-quality evidence suggests that higher AA intake reduces the incidence of postnatal growth failure. Subgroup analysis revealed high commencement of amino acid intake (&gt; 2 to &#8804; 3 g/kg/d), increased amino acid and non-protein caloric intakes, early commencement of intake (&lt; 24 hours' age), and early lipid infusion were associated with reduced postnatal growth failure. We found insufficient evidence to determine an effect on neurodevelopment and discovered that clinical effects of higher commencement or maximal amino acid intake were not consistent. Very low-quality evidence suggests that higher AA intake reduces retinopathy of prematurity but not severe retinopathy of prematurity. Higher AA intake was associated with potentially adverse biochemical effects including azotaemia.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-02-09 02:09:34 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Adequately powered trials in very preterm infants are required to determine the effects of optimal intake and balance of amino acids in parenteral nutrition on the brain and on neurodevelopment. Further trials are required to identify effects of higher amino acid intake in parenteral nutrition on retinopathy of prematurity and periventricular leukomalacia. Limited data from this review suggest that higher amino acid intake in parenteral nutrition may be associated with a reduction in retinopathy of prematurity. Subgroup analysis suggests effects from commencing high (&gt; 2 to &#8804; 3 g/kg/d) amino acid intake; increasing both amino acid and non-protein caloric intake; providing intake for very preterm or very low birth weight infants; commencing intake at &lt; 24 hours' age; and providing an early lipid infusion. Subgroup analysis also suggests a possible reduction in periventricular leukomalacia in studies that commenced low amino acid intake (&gt; 1 to &#8804; 2 g/kg/d) and in studies that reported high maximal amino acid intake (&gt; 3 to &#8804; 4 g/kg/d).</P><P>Higher amino acid intake was associated with a reduction in hyperglycaemia (&gt; 8.3 mmol/L), although the incidence of hyperglycaemia treated with insulin was not significantly different. Subgroup analyses showed reduced hyperglycaemia in studies that commenced high amino acid intake (&gt; 2 to &#8804; 3 g/kg/d); that had high amino acid intake (&gt; 3 to &#8804; 4 g/kg/d) at maximal intake; that increased amino acids whilst providing isocaloric non-protein intake; and that delayed lipid infusion for five days or longer.</P><P>Higher amino acid intake in parenteral nutrition was associated with some evidence of biochemical intolerance, with increasing numbers of infants showing abnormal blood urea nitrogen. Subgroup analysis did not identify a threshold for amino acid intake associated with abnormal blood urea nitrogen. Further trials are required to determine the effects of optimal intake and balance of amino acids, particularly at commencement of parenteral nutrition, on biochemical tolerance, growth, the brain, and neurodevelopment. Trials should use standardised anthropometric measures to facilitate interpretation and meta-analysis of data.</P><P>Given that trials frequently reported failure to achieve target intakes of amino acids (parenteral and enteral), trials examining optimal intake of amino acid at commencement and maximal intake are required.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2015-08-18 01:01:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>None. </P></ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS><CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST MODIFIED="2018-02-09 02:13:30 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>None.</P></CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST><CONTRIBUTIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-09 02:13:28 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>All authors contributed to protocol writing.
