<P>The best way of identifying and treating women with abnormal blood glucose tests in pregnancy is not known. Raised blood glucose levels during pregnancy is known as gestational diabetes. This abnormality may be associated with bigger babies, more difficult births and could be associated with higher rates of operative delivery such as caesarean section. The review of eight studies (1418 women) suggests that offering specific treatment for gestational diabetes may be associated with better baby and mother outcomes, but has not found robust evidence on the best choice of treatment which provides the better outcomes for these women and their babies, even if identified correctly. More research is needed to assess long-term mother and baby outcomes.</P>

<P>Eight randomised controlled trials (1418 women) were included.</P>
<P>Caesarean section rate was not significantly different when comparing any specific treatment with routine antenatal care (ANC) including data from five trials with 1255 participants (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.12).

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-12 10:59:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Metabolic changes during pregnancy lower glucose tolerance. Blood glucose levels rise and more insulin is produced in response. As the pregnancy develops, insulin demands increase. For the majority of pregnant women this is a normal physiological process. However, some women develop glucose intolerance resulting in gestational diabetes affecting between 3% and 6% of all pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Gabbe-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gabbe 1977</LINK>). Women who had diabetes before becoming pregnant (pre-existing diabetes) can see their insulin requirements progressively rise throughout pregnancy.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Definition and diagnosis of gestational diabetes (GDM)</HEADING>
<P>GDM is defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. The definition applies regardless of whether insulin or only diet modification is used for treatment or whether the condition persists after pregnancy. It does not exclude the possibility that unrecognised glucose intolerance may have antedated or begun concomitantly with the pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Expert--Committee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Expert Committee 2003</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The diagnosis is generally based on an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (GTT). A GTT requires women to fast overnight before attending the hospital the following morning. Usually, two blood samples are taken. The first is taken on arrival and the woman is then given a sugary drink containing 75 g of glucose (100 g is more commonly used in the United States). The second blood sample is taken two hours later. The precise diagnostic values of the GTT are controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Weiss-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 1998</LINK>), making it difficult to provide a clear definition of gestational diabetes. Previously, two distinct diagnostic categories existed; impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and GDM. However, current World Health Organization recommendations suggest that all abnormal glucose metabolism arising in pregnancy should be defined as gestational diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Alberti-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alberti 1998</LINK>). The new National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) Guidelines use the WHO criteria (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). However, this does not distinguish between mild and more severe abnormalities of glucose tolerance. Although it has been suggested that the relationship between blood glucose levels in pregnancy and perinatal outcome is a continuous one and no single cut off can separate women into those with high risk and those with no risk at all (<LINK REF="REF-Coustan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coustan 1998</LINK>), it is helpful to classify GDM into mild and severe forms (<I>see</I> '<LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK>' section).</P>
<P>This review defines gestational diabetes according to the following values:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>fasting blood glucose greater than 7 mmol/l; or</LI>
<LI>two-hour blood glucose greater than 7.8 mmol/l following a 75 g GTT.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In the USA a 100 g glucose load is commonly used and there is some debate around the precise diagnostic values. This review accepted clearly defined values as described by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>gestational diabetes - fasting greater than 105 mg/dl; one-hour greater than 190 mg/dl; two-hour greater than 165 mg/dl; three-hour greater than 145 mg/dl.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Screening for gestational diabetes</HEADING>
<P>There are various regimens that are used to select women for formal testing with a GTT (<LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 1993</LINK>). Examples of these are a past history of gestational diabetes or IGT, the development of pregnancy complications such as polyhydramnios (increased water around the baby) or a raised random blood glucose. In addition, there are certain predisposing factors which may indicate an increased risk of gestational diabetes such as obesity and ethnicity (<LINK REF="REF-Essel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Essel 1995</LINK>). Inevitably, some women diagnosed in pregnancy will have developed true diabetes and women with gestational diabetes should have a postnatal GTT. However, the focus of this review is abnormalities of glucose tolerance associated with pregnancy.</P>
<P>In the past it was pointed out that there was little evidence to support the recommendation that all pregnant women should be screened for gestational diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Enkin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 2000</LINK>). This issue remains controversial. A systematic review of screening for gestational diabetes concluded there was insufficient evidence to justify universal screening (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2002</LINK>), and a protocol for a Cochrane review of screening for gestational diabetes has been developed (<LINK REF="REF-Tieu-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tieu 2008b</LINK>). Justification for screening rests on the relevance of gestational diabetes which remains uncertain. The key issue is whether treatment improves outcome or, more importantly, whether treatment is associated with adverse outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Complications of gestational diabetes</HEADING>
<P>Whilst it is recognised that women with pre-existing diabetes have an increased risk of both maternal and fetal complications (<LINK REF="REF-Enkin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 2000</LINK>) including caesarean section, hypoglycaemia, respiratory distress syndrome and stillbirth, there are currently limited data available on the frequency of adverse perinatal outcome resulting from gestational diabetes. The lack of evidence fuels confusion and leads clinicians to conclude that the risk of adverse perinatal outcome is equal to that of pre-existing diabetes.</P>
<P>The only commonly reported complication of gestational diabetes is macrosomia (birthweight greater than 4000 g) which may increase the risk of caesarean section, shoulder dystocia and birth trauma to the baby (<LINK REF="REF-Jarrett-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarrett 1997</LINK>). Increased birthweight is indeed associated with increased morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2002</LINK>). However, the association between abnormalities of glucose tolerance and increased birthweight remains unclear. It has been suggested that fetal growth acceleration associated with gestational diabetes can be corrected with dietary regulation and insulin (<LINK REF="REF-Soares-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares 1997</LINK>) and there may be long-term benefits to infants of normalising birthweight (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 1992</LINK>). However, some studies suggest that macrosomia is more closely related to maternal weight or maternal weight gain than blood glucose levels (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Essel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Essel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spellacy-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spellacy 1985</LINK>). Furthermore, there are inconsistencies in defining macrosomia. It is suggested that there may be a continuum of risk in relation to glucose values making dichotomous cut-off values inappropriate (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>A further consideration is the long-term consequences for the mother. Women with gestational diabetes may have an increased risk of progression to non-insulin dependent diabetes in later life, although this is influenced greatly by, again, maternal weight and also ethnicity (<LINK REF="REF-Soares-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Current management policies</HEADING>
<P>There has been much confusion surrounding the management of gestational diabetes. Many women are managed according to intensive treatment regimens, including administration of insulin, in the belief that this will prevent pregnancy complications. The rationale being to reduce blood glucose levels in the belief that this will improve maternal and infant outcomes. Interventions include dietary regulation, home blood glucose monitoring and in some cases insulin therapy. Exercise has been suggested as an alternative and less invasive intervention and is now the subject of a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Ceysens-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ceysens 2006</LINK>). Another Cochrane review assesses the impact of dietary advice on the prevention of GDM (<LINK REF="REF-Tieu-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tieu 2008a</LINK>). Increased obstetric monitoring often becomes inevitable in the form of more frequent antenatal clinic visits and ultrasound scans which intend to detect abnormalities and avoid macrosomia and stillbirth. However, they also result in an increased level of inconvenience for women compared with standard antenatal care. Furthermore, a diagnosis of gestational diabetes may cause distress in someone who previously thought herself to be healthy (<LINK REF="REF-Jarrett-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarrett 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Rationale for this review</HEADING>
<P>The key issue for both clinicians and consumers is whether identification and treatment of gestational diabetes will improve perinatal outcome, particularly in the case of mild GDM. There is almost clinical consensus to treat severe forms of GDM. However, treating the milder forms of GDM is more controversial; therefore, most of the randomised controlled trials in this area have been done to examine the effect of treatment on mild GDM (previously known as IGT). This review includes the complete range of management options for gestational diabetes from no specific treatment to intensive treatment including individualised dietary advice, close monitoring of blood glucose, insulin therapy and oral hypoglycaemic drugs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<P>Pregnant women diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) identified by a 75 g or 100 g oral glucose tolerance test (GTT). Studies without a formal GTT were only considered where a fasting blood glucose value greater than seven was used for diagnosis. Women were eligible irrespective of gestation and whether singleton or multiple pregnancy; however, women with pre-existing diabetes were not.</P>
<P>GDM was defined as fasting blood glucose of at least 7.0 mmol/L or two-hour blood glucose greater than 7.8 mmol/L. This includes IGT which is defined as two-hour value between 7.8 mmol/L and 11 mmol/L. Participants with IGT values between 7.8 to 11 mmol/L are classified as having mild GDM. IGT values greater than 11 mmol/ are classified as severe GDM.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-12 11:19:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Intensive treatment including specific dietary advice and insulin therapy for gestational diabetes was found to reduce the risk of serious perinatal morbidity in the infant using a composite measure of death, shoulder dystocia, nerve palsy and bone fracture. It is associated with less proportion of babies born weighing more than 4000 g or more than the 90th centile, However, it is associated with increases in special care baby unit admissions and in labour induction rates. Caesarean section rates were not significantly reduced when comparing intensive treatment with standard care. However, intensive treatment was associated with a reduction in the risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Caesarean section rates were significantly reduced when comparing oral hypoglycaemics to insulin as a mode of treatment for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).</P>
<P>These results are mainly based on the ACHOIS study (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2005</LINK>), being the largest trial included, which used a composite outcome of infant death, shoulder dystocia, nerve palsy and bone fracture. This composite outcome is not considered in the other six studies included in this review, which used single end points. It can be criticised on the basis that shoulder dystocia is subjective. Also, there was a lower average gestational age associated with the lower rate of macrosomia. This may have contributed to the outcomes of the ACHOIS study (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2005</LINK>). It is difficult to separate elements of the package of care to identify whether the reduced rate of the composite outcome is due to the dietary advice and treatment of raised blood glucose or the intervention which lead to a lower gestational age and reductions in birthweight which reduce the rate of shoulder dystocia.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Macrosomia was reported as an outcome in seven trials, defined as either birthweight over 4000 g or greater than the 90th centile. Babies of mothers receiving specific treatment for GDM were less likely to weigh more than 4000 g. Apart from the increased risk of operative delivery, which is separately assessed in this review, the significance of being born big remains uncertain. This can only by assessed by studies using long-term end points as primary outcomes.</P>
<P>Caesarean section rate was assessed as an outcome in six trials. The reduction is rate was not significant comparing any specific treatment to standard clinical care (risk ratio 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 1.38). However, the difference was significant when comparing oral hypoglycaemic drugs to insulin. This result is based on two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hague-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hague 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moore-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moore 2004</LINK>) with a total sample size of 90 women. The risk of pre-eclampsia was found to be reduced with specific treatment for GDM. This may well be due to better detection of pre-eclampsia associated with the closer monitoring that women with GDM receive.<BR/>
<BR/>The review found significantly higher rate of neonatal admission with intensive treatment based on the ACHOIS trial (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2005</LINK>). This may be because when it is known that a woman has gestational diabetes, her baby will be more closely observed. This may lead to an over-diagnosis of hypoglycaemia or a lower threshold for neonatal admission. The important outcome to assess is whether this is associated with an increase in long-term adverse events.</P>
<P>Overall, the results of this review support the need to offer women with a diagnosis of gestational diabetes specific treatment for GDM for better short-term outcomes. However, it is important to note that there is a lack of long-term, follow-up outcomes for both the mother and the baby. The review does not tell us how to screen or who to screen, nor does it provide enough evidence regarding the best mode of treatment for GDM.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-05-12 11:19:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>When women have a diagnosis of gestational diabetes, they should be considered for specific treatment in addition to routine antenatal care. However, the decision about whether to offer specific dietary advice or more intensive treatment including insulin or oral drugs is not yet clear. The effect of specific treatment on long-term outcomes in the mother and child is also still unclear.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-07-01 10:28:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lynn Hampson">
<P>The review highlights starkly the confusion in this area of healthcare. Consistent and universal recommendations for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes would improve the generalisability of research findings. The fact that one large trial has shown an improvement in a composite outcome for infant morbidity suggests that women should be offered intensive management. However, further large studies comparing different alternative management strategies, considering different ends of the severity spectrum, and using longer-term single outcomes would be required to make this recommendation stronger.</P>

<P>We added the outcome 'composite' (defined as one or more of the following: infant death, shoulder dystocia, bone fracture and nerve palsy) to the list of neonatal outcomes. Although this outcome was not included in the original protocol for the review, it has been added as it is the primary outcome used by the ACHOIS trial (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2005</LINK>), which includes the biggest sample among all the other studies included in this review.</P>

<P>This updated review was prepared before the release of RevMan 5 and the new Risk of bias tables. This update was therefore prepared in an earlier version of RevMan and converted to RevMan 5 during the editorial processing of the updated review. The Risk of bias tables have therefore not been completed for this updated review and it does not draw on the Group's updated methodology, as described within the editorial information about the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PREG/frame.html">Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group</A>, which were developed to reflect the new statistical options available in RevMan 5. For future updates, the new risk of bias assessments will be described for new studies (identified through updated searches) that meet the inclusion criteria.</P>
