Patients with an exacerbation are fine! The outcomes that can be more than one per patient are best removed from the review as the precision around these estimates is spurious.&lt;br&gt;Also after discussion with Paul he is not happy to have pooled totals that count the control group twice, again due to spurious precision and I have therefore changed the comparison with dose doubling so that all the outcomes are subtotal only.  This will need  a rewrite of the results for this section..... sorry!&lt;br&gt;***********************************************************************************&lt;br&gt;Paul says wedo not need to stick to the minus convention for entry of lung function, so again I have altered these and corrected the text in the review. Please double check that the data tables are the same except for the sign changes!&lt;br&gt;*******************************************************************************&lt;br&gt;One typo corrected for data entry in Comparison 2#17 Nayak second total 130 not 13.&lt;br&gt;Is it important to split the 6 and 12 week lung function data rather than put them together in separate subgroups?&lt;br&gt;Abstract: I have altered this to remove the number of exacerbations!  Patients with exacerbations are not significant compared to dose doubling.&lt;br&gt;Text: trials are excluded for having a comparison group that is not placebo but have been included if there is no placebo group at all - this seems odd to me.&lt;br&gt;Is the Trial Bata or Baba - i have changed all the links to Baba 1999!&lt;br&gt;I have changed the reference IDs so that the hyperlinks are now active.&lt;br&gt;Have a good Easter,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;***************************  *********************************  **************************************  **************************************  ************************************&lt;br&gt;30/10/2001&lt;br&gt;Technical Edit of the updated review.&lt;br&gt;The What's new section :&lt;br&gt;has been completed and is very useful.  DID THE RESULTS CHANGE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE new DATA?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT......&lt;br&gt;Trend towards reduction in exacerbations seems to me to be a balanced description of the results in the abstract.&lt;br&gt;THE POOLING OF MONTELUKAST AND ZAFIRLUKAST MAY PROVE TO BE CONTENTIOUS AGAIN IN VIEW OF THE HETEROGENEITY BETWEEN RESULTS...... i HAVE NOT ALTERED THE DEFAULT TO A RANDOM MODEL ON THE GRAPH FOR WMD FINAL DOSE OF ORAL STEROIDS AS THERE ARE ONLY 3 TRIALS.... PAUL WILL NEED TO LOOK AT THIS.&lt;br&gt;IS THE CONCLUSION A GOOD REFLECTION OF THE DATA HERE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;METAVIEW.. Labels on Graphs:&lt;br&gt;LABELS REVERSED ON GRAPHS 01~02,04,11 and tidied up on 02~13, 17-24,&lt;br&gt;iS THERE DATA MISSING FROM ONE ARM OF TAMOKI IN 01~15and 16 or is this unreported...(this was also the case in the original version so I will email FD*****)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESULTS:&lt;br&gt;Section 1.&lt;br&gt;The FEV1 results for licensed dose is combined using a random model. In my view this may lead to a type 2 error and as there are only 2 studies heterogeneity is difficult to estimate (at the least the results of fixed and random models should be given).  SMD units are not in puffs so I have altered this.  The WMD for night wakenings at high dose was an SMD so this has been changed in the text and in Metaview.  &lt;br&gt;text adjusted to match the Metaview data for the updated review at the end of 01 results: now reads - &amp;quot; There was no significant group difference in the risk of overall withdrawals [RR=0. 84; 95% CI:0.56, 1.25];  withdrawals due to poor asthma control [RR= 0.52; 95% CI: 0.20, 1.37], withdrawals due to adverse effects [RR= 0.69; 95% CI: 0.36, 1.34]; overall adverse effects [RR= 0.96; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.12]; elevated liver enzymes [RR= 1.30; 95% CI: 0.50, 3.35];  headache [RR= 1.19; 95% CI: 0.89, 1.58]; nausea [RR= 0.67; 95% CI: 0.34, 1.32] and death [RR= 0.35; 95% CI: 0.01, 8.49]. &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;Section 2.&lt;br&gt;Looks fine&lt;br&gt;Section 3.&lt;br&gt;As already noted the results for Zafirlukast and Montelukast in relation to last dose of ICS is a fixed model in Metaview and random in the text so one or other needs to be changed, OR NO POOLING IN VIEW OF HETEROGENEITY????? .****** PAUL CAN YOU MAKE A DECISION ON THIS PLEASE?******* At present the text does not match metaview.&lt;br&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 24 October 2003&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contributions; excellent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: very clear. I like the distinction between doses that are licensed and those that are not!&lt;br&gt;GREAT&lt;br&gt;References:fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: I wish all reviews were as clear as this.&lt;br&gt;THANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: fine (but the # sign needs to be removed from a couple of the outcomes). &lt;br&gt;ALL SIGNS VERIFIED AND ARE OK!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francine I know this would involve some extra work but I think it would help the reader to split the comparisons into licensed and unlicensed dosage. The outcomes can be dropped into the new comparison tree quite easily. Do you think this is worthwhile?&lt;br&gt;PERHAPS, i COULD DO THIS FOR THE NEXT REVIEW WHEN THERE ARE MORE TRIALS IN EACH CATEGORY. THIS WOULD INVOLVE A NEW COMPARISON TREE. aN ALTERNATIVE IS GETTING RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL LTRA AND JUST SEPARATING THEM IN USUAL VS HIGHER THAN USUAL DOSE; NOT A GOOD IDEA  BECAUSE IT IS AN ISSUE OF CONTENTION AT THIS POINT; AT LEAST FROM PHARMACEUTICAL CIES BUT ALSO FROM PHYSICIANS' WHO ARE INFLUENCED BY CIES.  WHEN THERE IS MORE DATA ON LTRA SHOWING NO CLASS DIFFERENCE THEN I COULD PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER AND THEN STRATIFIED ON LICENSED VS HIGHER THAN LICENSED DOSES.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;OK(cjc)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;MISSING. Could you add a one sentence summary of the result of the review with a short para in simple english for consumers? Maybe similar to the final paragraph of the what's new section?&lt;br&gt;DONE&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract - very good&lt;br&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods- fine. Do you want to say anything about class effect and dose or type of AL used here?&lt;br&gt;REWORDED. i HAD STARTED WITH 'IN ADDITION TO THE DOSE AND TYPE OF AL, 5 FACTORS... REPLACED BY 6 FACTORS...&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results -  For the tapering comparison the primary outcome is change in ICS dose - currently this is buried as outcome 12 and 13. Shouldn't this be promoted to outcomes 1 and 2?? Perhaps with 14, 15 and 25 coming next for the same reason.&lt;br&gt;YOU ARE RIGHT, BUT ALL MY REVIEWS WERE ORDERED THIS WAY (CONTINUOUS FIRST, DICHOTOMOUS OUTCOMES NEXT). i HONESTLY DON'T HAVE TIME TO RE-ORDER THEM. hOWEVER IN THE TEXT, THE MAIN OUTCOME IS DISCUSSED FIRST. i WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS HOWEVER FOR THE UPCOMING REVIEW OF AL VS LAB2 AS ADD-ON TO ICS.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;ok let's leave this for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion - fine&lt;br&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions:&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think this statement goes beyond the data presented and should be modified or removed???? I have changed it into red text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    &amp;quot;Until further evidence is available, the standard of asthma treatment should remain the use of inhaled glucocorticoids at the lowest effective dose.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;OK - DELETED &lt;br&gt;What's new - excellent&lt;br&gt;GREAT&lt;br&gt;Contentious issues:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Manufacturers will argue that their product is not the same as the others.....  Do you want to say any more about this?&lt;br&gt;OK I WILL STICK MY NECK BUT BE READY TO RECEIVE MY HEAD ON A PLATTER: HOW ABOUT THIS IN THE CONCLUSION (SEE RED )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the anti-leukotriene used (montelukast, zafirlukast, or pranlukast) influenced the response to treatment: the findings appear similar irrespective of the leukotriene receptor antagonists.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action&lt;br&gt;Back to Francine for her comments. Thanks for this very high quality review!&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;____________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;18 Nov 2003&lt;br&gt;One result is probably wrong and I have changed the text to red. See below&lt;br&gt;I am afraid I have checked this more carefully and found another SE and SD confusion. Please check the Vaquerizo paper for the outcome of nocturnal awakenings (1#26) as the CI is much narrower than reported in the paper and the wrong SD has been derived from the 95% CI in the paper. Nayak 1998 nocturnal awakenings needs a check as well please (i do not have the paper to check this one).&lt;br&gt;Also 3#8 is labelled as mean daily dose and puffs per week. Which is correct?&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;________________________________________&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; re: comments before&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; 1#26 Vaquerizo: SD corrected&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; Nayak 1998: not sure what you are referring to: Nayak is in comparison 2&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; but&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; did&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; not report nighttime awakenings&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; 3#8; Tohda confirmed units: puffs/2 weeks. I divided the number of puffs&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; by&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; 2 to&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; be puffs/week. Should I also divide the SD by 2 (can't remember)?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; as soon as you confirm your issue re: Nayak and the way to handle Tohda,&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; I'll&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; finalise and return this review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; Hi Francine,&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; Sorry the Nayak 1998 issue relates to comparison 2~6, this is diurnal&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; variation and the SD is much smaller than Ringdal. Could just check this&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; has&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; been corrected derived from the paper.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; If you have scaled the means by 2 in the Tohda paper the SD should be&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;gt; divided by 2 as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;i checked. both SD are correct and backed-up.  the reason for the marked&lt;br&gt;difference between SD is in the units of reporting (% change) for Nayak and&lt;br&gt;(absolute change in L/min) for Ringdal. I have changed the unit of the outcome&lt;br&gt;to SMD and changed the text accordingly (see red). the outcome results now is&lt;br&gt;in synch with other outcomes, i.e. non significant.&lt;br&gt;________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;30 Dec 2003 (CJC)&lt;br&gt;Thanks for making the changes to this. I have altered the NNT results so that they are derived from OR and added this to the methods. One final query. Laviollette and Simons carry the same weight for FEV1 but not PEF (AM). If this is because Laviollette PEF is a % change then this outcome should also be altered to SMD. Please check this and that you are happy with my changes! I am not going to ask for any more alterations before this goes out to Peer reveiw as well, so you can send it to Toby when you are happy with the above!&lt;br&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;_______________________&lt;br&gt;Dear Toby and Chris,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; thank you for the diligent revisions.  The weight issue for Laviolette and&lt;br&gt;Simons appears to be one of the wonders of life; no need to change to SMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Please submit the attached review to peer review and keep me informed of the&lt;br&gt;comments, if any.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happy New Year 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francine&lt;br&gt;_________________________&lt;br&gt;Sent out for peer review 5Jan2004&lt;br&gt;Comments back leading to a few grammatical improvements.&lt;br&gt;Old title: =Addition of anti-leukotriene agents to inhaled corticosteroids for chronic asthma&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2011-07-21 16:07:37 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh" REVIEW_NO="ALE2-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.1.2" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="10.0">

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review represents the second update since its initial publication in The Cochrane Library 2001, Issue 1, May 2001; the first update being in September 2001.<BR/>
<BR/>The search strategy updated in August 2003 yielded 211 additional citations; 197 citations were excluded for the following mutually exclusive reasons:<BR/>(1) Duplicate references (N = 91)<BR/>(2) Not a randomised controlled trial (N = 44), ongoing trial (N=1), or awaiting assessment (N=3)<BR/>(3) Subjects were not asthmatics (N =4)<BR/>(4) The tested intervention was not anti-leukotrienes (N =9)<BR/>(5) No consistent co-treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids (N =20)<BR/>(6) The control intervention was not inhaled corticosteroids (N = 8)<BR/>(7) Use of non permitted drugs (N=5)<BR/>(8) The tested intervention was administered for less than 4 weeks (N =5 )<BR/>(8) Outcomes not reflective of asthma control (N = 6)<BR/>(9) Acute care setting (N=1).<BR/>
<BR/>Fourteen new trials were included in the updated review;<BR/>
<BR/>-7 new trials (2 abstracts contributing little data, 4 full-text publications and 1 full disclosure of unpublished trial) comparing anti-leukotrienes versus placebo as add-on to inhaled glucocorticoids for a total of 13 trials, of which 8 trials contributed data with sufficient details to be aggregated;<BR/>
<BR/>-5 new trials (3 abstracts contributing little data and 2 full-text publications) comparing anti-leukotrienes as add-on to inhaled glucocorticoids versus double-dose of inhaled steroids for a total of 7 trials, of which 4 trials could be aggregated;<BR/>
<BR/>-2 new trials (both full-text publications) comparing anti-leukotrienes versus placebo as add-on to tapering doses of inhaled glucocorticoids for a total of 7 trials, with 6 trials contributing data that were aggregated.<BR/>
<BR/>The updated review now comprised 27 trials comparing anti-leukotrienes versus placebo as add-on to inhaled glucocorticoids.<BR/>
<BR/>The systematic review was re-structured to clearly distinguish trials that use licensed, from those that used higher than licensed, doses of anti-leukotrienes.<BR/>
<BR/>The results of the review have not changed markedly as result of the 14 additional trials. The main new feature is the addition of 2 new trials for a total of 3 trials comparing the addition of leukotriene receptor antagonists at LICENSED dose to inhaled glucocorticoids as compared to double-dose of inhaled glucocorticoids. The two options appear to provide similar benefit although the power is insufficient to assume equivalency.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-16 18:52:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<P>Inhaled steroids remain the cornerstone of asthma treatment. Anti-leukotrienes constitute a new class of drugs that can be taken by mouth and do not have the side effects associated with steroids. We looked to see how effective these drugs were when they were added to the treatment of patients who needed steroid inhalers to control their asthma.In asthmatics that are not well controlled on inhaled steroids, the addition of anti-leukotrienes brings modest improvement in asthma control but it remains unclear whether they are as effective as increasing the dose of inhaled steroids. Higher doses of anti-leukotrienes are more effective, but associated with an increased risk of side effect that occurs with these particular drugs. In asthmatics that are well controlled on inhaled steroids, the addition of anti-leukotrienes did not allow a reduction in the amount of inhaled steroid used but they seemed to have a beneficial effect on the asthma control. There are only two studies that have looked at these issues in children; this is insufficient to firmly conclude whether anti-leukotrienes are useful in children.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Anti-leukotriene (AL) agents are being considered as 'add-on' therapy to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), in chronic asthma.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine the safety and efficacy of daily AL plus ICS compared to ICS alone, and determine the corticosteroid-sparing effect of AL when added to ICS in chronic asthma. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL (until August 2003), reference lists of review articles and trials, contacted international headquarters of AL manufacturers and looked at American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society meeting abstracts (1998 to 2003).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised placebo-controlled trials of asthmatics aged two years and older with at least one month intervention.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers assessed quality and extracted data independently. Trials were grouped by asthma control at baseline (symptomatic or well-controlled) and dose of ICS in the control group (same or double).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Of 587citations, 27 (25 adult and 2 paediatric) trials met inclusion criteria. Sixteen trials were published in full-text and 16 trials reported data in a way that allowed meta-analysis. In symptomatic patients, addition of licensed doses of anti-leukotrienes to ICS resulted in a non-significant reduction in the risk of exacerbations requiring systemic steroids: Relative Risk (RR) 0.64; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.07). A modest improvement group difference in PEF was seen (Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 7.7 L/min; 95% CI 3.6 to 11.8 L/min) together with decrease in use of rescue short-acting beta2-agonist use (WMD 1 puff/week; 95%CI 0.5 to 2). With only 3 trials comparing the use of licensed doses of anti-leukotrienes with increasing the dose of inhaled glucocorticoids, no firm conclusion can be drawn about the equivalence of both treatment options. In ICS-sparing studies of patients who were well controlled at baseline, addition of anti-leukotrienes produced no overall difference in dose of inhaled glucocorticoids (WMD -21 mcg/d, 95%CI -65, 23 mcg/d), but it was associated with fewer withdrawals due to poor asthma control (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.95).<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The addition of licensed doses of anti-leukotrienes to add-on therapy to inhaled glucocorticoids brings modest improvement in lung function. Although addition of anti-leukotrienes to inhaled glucocorticoids appears comparable to increasing the dose of inhaled steroids, the power of the review is insufficient to confirm the equivalence of both treatment options. Addition of anti-leukotrienes is associated with superior asthma control after glucocorticoid tapering; although the glucocorticoid-sparing effect cannot be quantified at present, it appears modest. <BR/>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Since the mid 1980's, the understanding of the primarily inflammatory nature of asthma has tremendously changed its management (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1993</LINK>). Infiltration of bronchial airways with eosinophils and neutrophils with production of inflammatory mediators is characteristic of asthma. The most potent inflammatory mediators may be the cysteinyl leukotrienes which are produced by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of the arachidonic acid metabolism. These mediators stimulate the production of airway secretions, cause microvascular leakage and enhance eosinophilic migration in the airways; thus, leukotrienes are believed to play a major role in mediating bronchoconstriction and inflammatory changes pivotal in the pathophysiology of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Piper-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piper 1989</LINK>). Treatment of airway inflammation is now advocated by all recent consensus statements on asthma (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2002</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Australia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Australia 2002</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Boulet-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulet 2001</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-CTS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTS 1999</LINK>). Although several drugs such as ketotifen, sodium cromoglycate and sodium nedocromil have anti-inflammatory properties, inhaled glucocorticoids remain the cornerstone of asthma management because of their efficacy, tolerance, and rapid onset of action (<LINK REF="REF-CTS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTS 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spahn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spahn 1996</LINK>). The administration of inhaled glucocorticoids is generally considered safe, unless the daily dose required for control of symptoms remains large for a prolonged period. In these conditions, adverse effects such as growth stunting in children (<LINK REF="REF-Wolthers-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolthers 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipworth-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lipworth 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kamada-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamada 1995</LINK>), suppression of the adrenal axis (<LINK REF="REF-Wolthers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolthers 1998</LINK>) and bone osteopenia may be observed (<LINK REF="REF-Efthimiou-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Efthimiou 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bootsma-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bootsma 1997</LINK>). To reduce the dose of glucocorticoids required for symptom control, other drugs may be added. Long-acting beta-2-agonists, which have only mild anti-inflammatory effect, are being used for this purpose (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CTS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTS 1999</LINK>). Anti-leukotrienes form a new class of anti-inflammatory drugs which may have important glucocorticoids-sparing effects. These drugs interfere either with leukotriene production (5- lipoxygenase inhibitors) or with leukotriene receptors (leukotriene receptors antagonists). Anti-leukotrienes have the advantage of being administered orally in a single or twice daily dose and, importantly, seem to lack the adverse effects associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy. However, safety remains an important issue particularly with elevation of hepatic enzymes and Churg-Strauss syndrome reported in some patients treated with anti-leukotrienes (<LINK REF="REF-Price-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Price 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>As relatively new therapeutic agents, it is important to determine the proper place of anti-leukotrienes in the management of asthma. While the 2002 Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines classifies the role of anti-leukotrienes as still under investigation,(<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2002</LINK>) several national guidelines advocate its use as adjunct therapy to inhaled glucocorticoids in moderate to severe persistent asthma or as alternative single-agent management in mild asthma (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CTS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTS 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Australia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Australia 2002</LINK>). Randomised controlled trials have provided evidence of the efficacy of anti-leukotrienes as add-on therapy to inhaled glucocorticoids in persistent asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Laviolette-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Laviolette 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lofdahl-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lofdahl 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tamaoki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tamaoki 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Virchow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Virchow 2000</LINK>); the evidence was summarized in a Cochrane review last updated in September 2001. With the publication of new trials, an update of the systematic review of the randomised controlled trials was indicated to review the potential benefit of anti-leukotrienes as add-on therapy to inhaled glucocorticoids and to provide better insight in the influence of study characteristics on results.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-09-01 17:09:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<OL>
<LI>In patients who were symptomatic, despite use of maintenance inhaled corticosteroids, we wished to determine whether the addition of anti-leukotriene agents reduced the frequency and severity of exacerbations and improved chronic asthma control while maintaining a good safety profile. The addition of anti-leukotriene agents to inhaled corticosteroids was compared to either the use of the same or double dose of inhaled corticosteroids.</LI>
<LI>In patients who were well controlled on their baseline dose of inhaled corticosteroids, we wished to quantify the magnitude of dose reduction in inhaled glucocorticoids (glucocorticoid-sparing effect) that could be achieved with the addition of anti-leukotrienes.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Secondary objectives were to determine whether patients' characteristics, such as dose and type of anti-leukotrienes, dose of inhaled glucocorticoids required to control symptoms, age (adult versus child), severity of airway obstruction on baseline (% predicted FEV1), duration of intervention, and asthma triggers (allergens, viral infection, aspirin, or others), influenced the magnitude of effect attributable to anti-leukotrienes.</P>

The addition of licensed doses of anti-leukotrienes to 400 to 800 mcg/day of beclomethasone or equivalent resulted in a non-significant reduction in the risk of exacerbations requiring systemic steroids (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.07, <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). When higher than licensed doses were examined, the addition of pranlukast or zafirlukast to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids clearly reduced by 66% the risk of exacerbations requiring systemic steroids (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.88, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).

There was no death. The width of all these confidence interval exceeded our definition of equivalence. Insufficient data preventing pooling of trials for FEV1, diurnal variation in PEF, night waking, admission and moniliasis. The small number of trials prevented subgroup and sensitivity analyses.</P>
<P>The change from baseline in FEV1 in favour of anti-leukotrienes reached our definition of equivalence (2 trials, RR 0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.07). With regards to other outcomes, no significant group difference were observed in the chance from baseline in AM peak expiratory flow rate (3 trials, WMD 6.05, 95% CI -1.26 to 13.36), in change in diurnal variation in peak expiratory flow rate (3 trials, SMD -0.11%, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.03), in change in symptoms (3 trials, WMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.03), in use of rescue B2-agonists (3 trials, WMD 0.00 95% CI -0.37 to 0.37), and in withdrawals due to poor asthma control (3 trials, RR 0.72 95% CI 0.29 to 1.76); the width of all these confidence intervals exceeded our definition of equivalence.</P>
<P>With regards to safety, use of higher than licensed doses of leukotriene receptor antagonist was associated with a five-fold increased risk of liver enzyme elevation (3 trials, RR 4.97 95% CI 1.45 to 17), but has a marked protective effect on oral moniliasis (3 trials, RR 0.29 95% CI 0.10 to 0.81). Other safety measures show no significant group difference, namely for overall withdrawals (3 trials, RR 1.05 95% CI 0.73 to 1.50), withdrawals due to side effects (3 trials, RR 2.27 95% CI 0.95 to 5.45), overall adverse effects (3 trials, RR 0.98 95% CI 0.89 to 1.07), headache (3 trials, RR 1.14 95%CI 1.14 to 1.63), and nausea (3 trials, RR 1.77 95% CI 0.79 to 3.95).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome: maintenance dose of inhaled corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>After 6 to 24 weeks of treatment, there was no significant group difference in the % change from baseline in the inhaled corticosteroid dose required to maintain asthma control (4 trials; WMD -3%, 95% CI: -7 to 2; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).

There was no heterogeneity between the four trials contributing data to the glucocorticoids dose reduction although the trials differed not only in the dose and anti-leukotriene used, but also in the baseline dose and inhaled glucocorticoid used, dose optimisation period, weaning protocol, and intention-to-treat analysis. When the two trials not analysed by intention-to-treat were excluded, the lowest tolerated dose of glucocorticoids remained not significantly different between groups (WMD -71,95% CI -284 to 141). The rate of complete glucocorticoid weaning was similar between groups (3 trials, RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.47; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>After 12 to 20 weeks of treatment, two trials using zafirlukast (<LINK REF="STD-Bateman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 1995</LINK>), reported no significant group difference in final FEV1 (WMD 0.13 L, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.27), final PEFR (WMD 17.98.0 L/min, 95% -1.68 to 37.64), final symptom scores (WMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.05), final ß2-agonists use (WMD -0.2 puffs/day, 95% CI -0.7 to 0.3). More sensitive outcomes for insuring similar asthma control are the changes from baseline. When the lowest tolerated dose of inhaled glucocorticoids was reached, there was no significant group difference in the change from baseline in FEV1 (2 trials, WMD 0 L, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.09), in PEFR (2 trials, WMD 7.9 L/min, 95% CI: -1.61 to 17.4) and in ß2-agonists use (2 trials, WMD -0.15 puffs/week; 95% CI -0.91, 0.61). Yet, pooling of the five trials revealed a marked reduction (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.95) in the rate of withdrawals due to poor asthma control in the group treated with leukotriene receptor antagonists, suggesting better asthma control with the combination therapy. When only the trials using intention-to-treat analysis were considered, the rate of withdrawals due to poor asthma control was unaffected (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.95). A trend favouring leukotriene receptor antagonists was also observed in the number of patients with exacerbations requiring systemic steroids (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.20, 1.09).</P>
<P>Markers of inflammation such as serum eosinophils showed no group difference (WMD 0.18, 95% CI -1.13 to 1.50); nitric oxide concentration was only reported for one study, preventing pooling of data.</P>
<P>Less withdrawals due to any cause were observed in the leukotriene receptor antagonists group (6 trials, RR 0.77, 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.98), probably influenced by the marked reduction in withdrawals due to poor asthma control in the anti-leukotriene group.</P>
<P>With regard to side effects, there was no group difference in the number of withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.51) overall adverse effects (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08, random effect model), elevated liver enzymes (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.21), headache (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.08), nausea (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.19).

<P>In patients who were symptomatic on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), two treatment alternatives were addressed in these studies: adding an anti-leukotriene agent or increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids.</P>
<P>When compared to an unchanged dose of ICS, the addition of LICENSED doses of anti-leukotrienes resulted in a non-significant reduction in the risk of exacerbations requiring systemic glucocorticoids with modest group differences in peak expiratory flow (+8 L/min), ß2-agonist use (-0.3 puffs/day), and eosinophils counts (-0.07 x 10e9) in favour of anti-leukotrienes. The beneficial effect of anti-leukotrienes was clearly apparent with HIGHER THAN LICENSED doses of pranlukast or zafirlukast where a 66% reduction in exacerbations requiring rescue glucocorticoids was firmly documented. Twenty two (95% Confidence interval: 17 to 117) patients would need to receive anti-leukotrienes at unlicensed doses to prevent one patient having an exacerbation that required systemic corticosteroids during the six weeks of treatment. Group differences in the improvement from baseline in FEV1 (+100 mL), PEF (+27 L/min), symptoms (-0.5 SD) and ß2-agonist use (-0.4 SD) in favour of the combination of anti-leukotrienes and ICS are consistent with the reduction in exacerbations. When licensed and unlicensed doses of anti-leukotrienes were combined, no statistical heterogeneity was observed despite variation in the dose and anti-leukotrienes used, dose (750-2000 mcg/day) of beclomethasone, age, duration of treatment and intention-to-treat analysis. The risk of side effects from anti-leukotrienes was comparable to that of placebo. The available evidence thus suggests a modest effect of licensed doses of montelukast in symptomatic children and adults, but a clear beneficial effect of higher than licensed doses of pranlukast and zafirlukast, as add-on therapy to inhaled glucocorticoids in adults.</P>
<P>In symptomatic patients, however, most physicians would be uncomfortable with status quo; the majority would increase the dose of inhaled glucocorticoids or consider additional therapy. Only three trials compared the combination of licensed doses of leukotriene receptor antagonists with 400 to 800 mcg/day of BDP (or equivalent) to increasing the dose of inhaled steroids by 400-800 mcg/day. There was no significant group difference in the risk of experiencing a moderate exacerbations or any other outcomes, but due to the paucity of trials, equivalency could not be established. Both two options appears comparably safe.</P>
<P>When the combination of leukotriene receptor antagonists at higher than licensed doses with 400-500 mcg/day of BDP (or equivalent) was compared to doubling the dose of inhaled steroids, the improvement in FEV1 was equivalent between the two treatment options, with a modest benefit in the diurnal variation of peak flow rates in favour of anti-leukotrienes. However, no other group differences in exacerbations requiring systemic steroids, peak flow, symptoms, and use of rescue beta2-agonists were observed: again, there was insufficient power to conclude to equivalency. The use of higher doses of zafirlukast was associated with a five-fold increase in the risk of liver enzyme elevation, but was clearly protective for oral moniliasis, raising serious doubt about the safety of this strategy.</P>
<P>Also of interest is whether the addition of anti-leukotrienes will allow a meaningful reduction in the dose of inhaled glucocorticoids required to maintain control. Data from six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bateman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kanniess-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kanniess 2002</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lofdahl-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lofdahl 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shingo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shingo 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tohda-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tohda 2002</LINK>) all using licensed doses of anti-leukotrienes, tested the inhaled corticosteroid sparing properties of anti-leukotrienes.<BR/>
<BR/>In adults well controlled on various doses (300 to 3000 mcg/day) of inhaled glucocorticoids, a 6 to 24-week treatment combining daily oral anti-leukotrienes with inhaled steroids did not result in a reduction in the dose of inhaled steroids any more than placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Bateman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lofdahl-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lofdahl 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tohda-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tohda 2002</LINK>). No significant group differences were observed in the lowest tolerated dose of inhaled steroids or in the rate of patients with complete steroid withdrawal. Pooling of trials did not resulted any statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>To establish the overall or relative efficacy of anti-leukotrienes, the level of asthma control achieved after glucocorticoid tapering must be similar among groups. In fact, patients treated with anti-leukotrienes appeared to have better control than the placebo group, with a significant 37% reduction in withdrawals due to poor asthma control; yet there was no group difference in the change from baseline in FEV1 and PEFR after the minimal tolerated dose was achieved. The apparent discordant findings may be explained by the small number of trials (N=2) reporting change from baseline in FEV1 compared to the 5 trials reporting withdrawals and by the inconsistent use of intention-to-treat analyses. These observations may suggest that various factors such as trial-specific designs may influence the level of asthma control after tapering. Possible explanations include differences in the dose optimisation period prior to randomisation, tapering protocols, baseline dose of inhaled glucocorticoids, anti-leukotriene used, and intention-to-treat analysis. A longer tapering period for example, may have permitted greater reduction in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids or demonstrated better asthma control in favour of anti-leukotriene agents. Although there are insufficient data to make a firm conclusion, based on the upper confidence limit for each anti-leukotrienes, the maximal glucocorticoid-sparing effect of anti-leukotrienes would probably be less than 300 mcg/day. This is concordant with a previous systematic review demonstrating that the use of anti-leukotrienes as single agent is less effective than 400 mcg/day of beclomethasone (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2001</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Although, there are insufficient data to make firm conclusions about the magnitude of the corticosteroid-sparing effect of anti-leukotriene agents, it is important to note that during the pre-randomisation run-in period of <LINK REF="STD-Lofdahl-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lofdahl 1999</LINK>, it was possible to taper the dose of inhaled corticosteroids by 500-600 mcg, a third of the original dose. A reduction of similar magnitude was observed in the placebo group after randomisation. Similarly <LINK REF="STD-Kanniess-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kanniess 2002</LINK> reduced by 400 mcg the baseline dose of beclomethasone with no difference in asthma control. This attests to a general overdosing of enrolled patients. If the patients recruited to this study were typical of patients on moderate-high dose inhaled corticosteroids, the level of dose reduction achievable, without any additional treatment, appears to far outweigh that achieved with anti-leukotriene agents. The importance of repeated attempts at tapering the dose of inhaled corticosteroids in well-controlled patients is clear.<BR/>
<BR/>With only one paediatric trial contributing data and showing little benefit, extrapolation of data from any of the above protocols to children remains speculative.<BR/>
<BR/>There is insufficient data to determine whether patients' characteristics such as age, severity of airway obstruction on baseline, asthma triggers, and baseline dose of inhaled glucocorticoids required to achieve control have any influence of the magnitude of response. With the lack of heterogeneity between trials, there is no evidence to suggest that the anti-leukotriene used and duration of intervention affect the findings.</P>
<P>Like all systematic reviews, this meta-analysis is limited by the quantity and quality of existing data (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 1996</LINK>). Despite the abundance of literature on anti-leukotrienes, few randomised controlled trials were designed to assess the role of anti-leukotrienes as add-on therapy to inhaled glucocorticoids; 67% of trials compared anti-leukotrienes to placebo in groups of patients comprised of, or including, steroid naive patients. Most included trials (15/16) contributing data to the meta-analysis were of high methodological quality (Jadad score &gt;= 4). Data from 9 of the 11 trials with lower reported methodological quality (Jadad score &lt;= 3) were not used in this review because they were not reported in a way that permitted aggregation and thus, could not bias the conclusions (<LINK REF="STD-Baba-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Baba 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Finn 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nishimura-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nishimura 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nsouli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nsouli 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Sullivan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">O'Sullivan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tomari-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tomari 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tomita-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tomita 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wada-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wada 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yildirim-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yildirim 2001</LINK>). Sensitivity analyses excluding the remaining 2 trials with Jadad score of 0 (<LINK REF="STD-Riccioni-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Riccioni 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riccioni-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Riccioni 2002</LINK>) failed to alter the findings. A thorough systematic search resulted in the identification of methodologically strong, unpublished trials, increasing the power and scope of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thornton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornton 2000</LINK>). The value of this review is strengthened by the direct confirmation of methodology and extracted data from the authors or sponsors of 15 of 27 trials, and the voluntary disclosure of data for five unpublished trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hultquist-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hultquist 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nayak-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nayak 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ringdal-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ringdal 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bateman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laitinen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Laitinen 1995</LINK>). Because the number and size of studies pooled under each protocol was small, the robustness of the analyses could not be assessed. Furthermore, the influence on study results of different types of inhaled glucocorticoids and anti-leukotrienes, doses, age, duration of intervention, severity of airway obstruction on baseline, and asthma triggers remain speculative. No trials have documented the known adverse effects associated with prolonged used of inhaled glucocorticoids such as osteopenia, adrenal suppression, and growth suppression in children, which would permit a fairer comparison between the safety profile of treatment options. Clearly, these preliminary conclusions may be modified with accumulating data from future well-designed trials.</P>
<P>This review summarises the best evidence available until August 2003 and emphasises the ongoing shortage of relevant trials testing the role of licensed doses of anti-leukotrienes as add-on to inhaled glucocorticoids.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-09-01 17:18:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The small number and short duration of trials pooled under each protocol preclude firm conclusions. However, the data currently available suggest that:</P>
<P>(1) In patients with chronic asthma who are symptomatic on&#8805;400 mcg/day of inhaled beclomethasone, the addition of licensed doses of montelukast to inhaled glucocorticoids may improve lung function, symptoms, and use of relief beta2-agonists by a modest amount. High dose of anti-leukotrienes (2 to 4 times the licensed dose of pranlukast or zafirlukast) reduces the rate of exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroids; approximately 22 patients would have to be treated to achieve this effect. Use of higher than licensed doses of anti-leukotrienes are also associated with significant improvement in lung function, symptoms, and use of relief beta-2 agonists.<BR/>
<BR/>(2) In patients treated with 400 to 800 mcg/day of beclomethasone-equivalent of inhaled corticosteroids, use of licensed doses of leukotriene receptor antagonists are associated with improvement similar to that of dose doubling of inhaled glucocorticoids but there is insufficient power to conclude to equivalency. Use of higher than the licensed dose of zafirlukast also appears to have a similar, but not equivalent, effect to that of doubling the dose of inhaled steroids. However, this is associated with increased risk of liver enzyme elevation. With only three trials, there is still insufficient evidence to firmly recommend the use of licensed doses of anti-leukotrienes as a substitute to increasing the dose of inhaled glucocorticoids.</P>
<P>(3) In well-controlled patients, the addition of anti-leukotrienes as compared to placebo is possibly associated with superior asthma control after glucocorticoids tapering. There is insufficient evidence to firmly quantify the corticosteroids-sparing effect, which would appear to be less than 300 mcg/day of beclomethasone or equivalent.<BR/>
<BR/>To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the anti-leukotriene used (montelukast, zafirlukast, or pranlukast) influenced the response to treatment: the findings appear similar irrespective of the leukotriene receptor antagonists.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-16 19:09:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<P>Future studies should focus on children in whom few trials have been published. Two main protocols should be examined:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the addition of anti-leukotriene agents to inhaled corticosteroids versus dose-doubling of inhaled corticosteroids in symptomatic children and adults (grouped separately)</LI>
<LI>the corticosteroid-sparing effect of anti-leukotriene agents, after ensuring similar asthma control between the treatment and control groups, in well-controlled children and adults (grouped separately).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>In addition, the following issues should be considered:<BR/>The best way to assess corticosteroids-sparing effect of anti-leukotrienes as 'add-on' therapy to inhaled corticosteroids is to design trials with a prolonged run-in period prior to randomisation, during which inhaled corticosteroids are tapered to the minimum effective dose. The run-in period may need to be as long as 16 weeks as evidenced by the large reduction in maintenance dose of inhaled corticosteroids in the placebo groups both pre- and post-randomisation. Documentation of comparable asthma control after tapering must be demonstrated, preferably with exacerbations requiring systemic steroids and change from baseline in lung function, asthma symptoms, and use of rescue beta-2 agonists. The corticosteroids-sparing effect should be reported at the lowest tolerated dose in an intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>The trials should :<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>be double-blind, randomised, with complete reporting of withdrawals and drop-outs and intention-to-treat analysis</LI>
<LI>be parallel-group</LI>
<LI>involve relatively homogeneous asthmatics in terms of severity of airway obstruction on baseline as evidenced by their lung function on a given dose of inhaled glucocorticoids.</LI>
<LI>have a minimal intervention period of &gt;= 24-52 weeks for assessing the corticosteroid-sparing effect and long-term side effects of both interventions (anti-leukotrienes and inhaled corticosteroids)</LI>
<LI>provide complete reporting of continuous (N, mean change and mean standard deviation of change) and dichotomous (denominators and event rate) data.</LI>
<LI>report specifically the number of patients with exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids and those requiring hospital admissions</LI>
<LI>report specifically change from baseline (rather than final values at the end of the intervention period) in lung function, symptoms, functional status, use of rescue beta2- agonist.</LI>
<LI>systematically document reasons for withdrawals and adverse effects, including those associated with inhaled corticosteroids such as oral candidiasis, osteopenia, adrenal suppression, growth suppression, etc.</LI>
<LI>test anti-leukotriene agents (synthesis inhibitor and receptor antagonists) at LICENSED DOSES</LI>
<LI>use more uniform doses and type of inhaled corticosteroids (reported in mcg/day of CFC-beclomethasone- equivalent), whenever possible, within the same trial.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methods  </HEADING>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of studies  </HEADING>
<P>Randomised placebo controlled trials in adults and children in which anti-leukotriene agents are added to inhaled glucocorticoid were considered for inclusion. We will restrict the eligible studies to those of 4 weeks duration and longer. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of participants  </HEADING>
<P>Children aged two to 17 years and adults with recurrent or chronic asthma, symptomatic or well-controlled on daily maintenance inhaled glucocorticoids. We will include studies where participants have to have been taking their inhaled steroids for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to study entry (inclusive of any run-in period). </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of interventions  </HEADING>
<P>Combination of daily oral anti-leukotriene agents, including leukotriene synthesis inhibitors and leukotriene receptor antagonists, with inhaled glucocorticoids (treatment group) compared to inhaled glucocorticoids alone (control group). This review will consider three comparisons: </P>
<OL>
<LI>Anti-leukotrienes versus placebo in addition to a stable dose of ICS with equal doses of ICS between treatment groups: Anti-leukotrienes can be added to any dose of inhaled steroids which must be fixed. The dose of ICS in both groups must either be the same, or can be maintained from pre-study entry. Details of the type, dose and delivery of inhaled steroid will be recorded. We will record whether the ICS and dose were maintained from pre-study treatment, titrated during a run-in period, or whether a standard ICS and dose were introduced.</LI>
<LI>Anti-leukotrienes versus placebo in addition to a stable dose of ICS versus a higher dose of ICS in the control group: Anti-leukotrienes can be added to any dose of inhaled steroids which must be fixed. The dose of ICS in the control must be higher than that of the ICS in the treatment group. Details of the type, dose and delivery of inhaled steroid will be recorded. We will record whether the ICS and dose were maintained from pre-study treatment, titrated during a run-in period, or whether a standard ICS and dose were introduced.</LI>
<LI>Studies assessing anti-leukotrienes as an inhaled steroid sparing agent: Anti-leukotrienes can be added to ICS and then the dose of ICS in both groups will be permitted to vary according to a pre-specified protocol (such as symptoms, lung function, exacerbation history or a combination).</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of outcome measures  </HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes  </HEADING>
<P>Number of participants with exacerbations requiring use of systemic glucocorticoids for comparisons 1 and 2. For comparison 3, our primary endpoint will be the change from the baseline dose of inhaled glucocorticoids required to maintain control.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes  </HEADING>
<P>The following secondary outcomes were considered after various lengths of treatment:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Change in clinical or physiologic outcomes reflecting chronic asthma control (such as symptom score, night-time awakenings, days without symptoms, quality of life, rescue short-acting beta-2-agonist use, and pulmonary function tests)</LI>
<LI>Clinical or physiologic outcomes reflecting the frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations (such as hospital admissions)</LI>
<LI>Inflammatory markers (such as serum and sputum eosinophils, serum eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP), expired nitric oxide, etc)</LI>
<LI>Clinical and biochemical adverse effects (i.e. elevation of liver enzymes) as well as withdrawal rates were also examined.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection and analysis </HEADING>
<P>Two authors will independently assess the search results (FD or TL). Studies will be retrieved selected on the basis of relevance, and will be selected for inclusion by the agreement of two authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management  </HEADING>
<P>Data will be extracted independently by two reviewers (FD and TL), and disagreement will be resolved by discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies  </HEADING>
<P>We will assess the risk of bias for each study according to the Risk of Bias tool outlined in Chapter 8 of the <A HREF="http://www.cochrane-handbook.org/">Cochrane Handbook</A>. The domains we will assess for the risk of bias will be: </P>
<OL>
<LI>Allocation generation. The method used to allocate participants to treatment group (e.g. computer-generated random number sequences)</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment. The method used to conceal the sequence of treatment group assignment from study investigators and participants (e.g. assignment by date of birth, opaque sealed envelopes)</LI>
<LI>Blinding. The method by which knowledge of treatment group assignment was concealed from study investigators and participants after the study began (double-blind, single-blind). </LI>
<LI>Completeness of outcome data. The method for handling data from participants who withdrew from the study (e.g. intention to treat analysis, available case). </LI>
<LI>Selective reporting. Whether there is evidence that outcomes measured in the study are unreported (e.g. unreported harms, relevant efficacy data that are not available due for reporting and not statistical reasons). </LI>
<LI>Other sources of bias. Any other aspect of the study design which may be a source of bias. </LI>
</OL>
<P>We will collect and report information for each domain of bias and provide a judgment based on this information as high, low or unclear risk of bias. </P>
<P>We will seek confirmation of methodology for all included trials directly from the authors and/or the funding pharmaceutical companies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data  </HEADING>
<P>Confirmation of data extraction for all included trials will be sought directly from the authors and/or the funding pharmaceutical companies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>Homogeneity of effect sizes between studies being pooled will be assessed with the I square measurement. This estimates the amount of statistical variation between the studies above what would be expected with the play of chance (<A HREF="http://www.cochrane-handbook.org/">Cochrane Handbook</A>). </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis  </HEADING>
<P>Treatment effects for dichotomous outcomes were reported as pooled Risk Ratios with a fixed-effect model (RR). Equivalence was assumed if the RR estimate and its confidence interval were between 0.9 and 1.1. </P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, such as pulmonary function tests or quality of life scores, we used a Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) or Standardised Mean Difference (SMD), where appropriate, to estimate individual and pooled effect sizes. Numbers Needed to Treat (NNT) were derived from the pooled Odds Ratios using Visual Rx (an online calculator at www.nntonline.net) as the results are not affected by the way in which the events are recorded (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trials were divided into three protocols, according to the relative dose of inhaled glucocorticoids used by the control group (same, double, tapered).</P>
<P>(1) Anti-leukotrienes (AL) + inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS) versus SAME dose of ICS.</P>
<P>(2) Anti-leukotrienes (AL) + inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS) versus DOUBLE dose of ICS.</P>
<P>(3) Anti-leukotrienes (AL) + inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS) versus ICS (TAPERING protocol).</P>
<P>In all comparisons, the dose and type of anti-leukotriene agents served as the primary stratifying variable.</P>
<P>To detect possible biases, funnel plot symmetry was examined for trials contributing data to the main outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). All estimates were reported with their 95% confidence interval.</P>
<P>We will complete a Summary of Findings (SoF) table using GRADEpro software. Our assessments of the overall quality of evidence will be made according to the recommendations of the <A HREF="http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/publications/index.htm">GRADE working group </A>. We will include outcome data for the primary outcomes of OCS-treated exacerbations (comparisons 1 and 2), change from baseline in ICS dose (comparison 3), hospital admission and serious adverse events. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>If the I square measurement exceeds 25% we will consider its possible causes and assess whether this affected the results of the analysis by incorporating the variation in a random effects model. Subgroup analysis is also planned based on the following aspects of the studies: </P>
<OL>
<LI>dose and anti-leukotrienes used,</LI>
<LI>baseline dose of inhaled glucocorticoids,</LI>
<LI>age, </LI>
<LI>severity of baseline airway obstruction, </LI>
<LI>duration of intervention, </LI>
<LI>asthma triggers.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The mean baseline dose of inhaled glucocorticoids in the intervention group will be recorded in mcg/day of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-propelled beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent x 0.1; where, irrespective of delivery system used, 1 mcg of beclomethasone = 1 mcg of budesonide = 0.5 mcg of fluticasone = 2 mcg of triamcinolone = 2 mcg of flunisolide (<LINK REF="REF-USA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">USA 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Usual licensed doses of leukotriene receptor antagonists are: montelukast 10 mg daily, pranlukast 450 mg daily, and zafirlukast 20 mg twice daily. For the primary outcome, sensitivity analyses will be performed to determine the effect of publication status and risk of bias on results. We will perform the meta-analysis using RevMan 5.</P>
