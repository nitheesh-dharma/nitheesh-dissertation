<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Drug-based and non-drug-based interventions to improve the bone mineral density in patients living with HIV</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Osteoporosis is caused by bone loss, and people who have the condition are at higher risk of having a fracture. Measuring a person's bone mass density (BMD) is a way to measure his or her risk of having a fracture due to fragile bones. Decreased BMD is much more common in HIV patients than in the general population. The cause of this decrease is not certain, but it may be because of the HIV infection itself or because of the antiretroviral medications that patients with HIV take. Although patients with HIV often get fractures because of their sometimes more fragile bones, it has been shown that this bone loss is often not effectively treated in this population. This review examines the randomised controlled trials investigating treatments for bone loss in patients with HIV infection.</P>
<P>Three trials examined the use of the drug alendronate to improve BMD in patients with HIV. These three studies were quite different from each other in terms of the populations studied and the interventions used, but even similar studies did not always have heterogeneity. A fourth study examined the use of testosterone in male patients with HIV and AIDS wasting syndrome. The four studies in this review were limited by the fact they were all very small and lasted a short amount of time, and thus they were unable to detect prevention of fractures or changes in number of patients with osteoporosis. There were also further compromises in study design. However, the limited available data show that there may be safe and perhaps effective treatments in the form of alendronate for patients with HIV who have decreased bone mineral density and, in those with AIDS wasting syndrome, testosterone. </P>
<P>Larger studies further examining the issue of decreased BMD are currently underway.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) occurs more commonly in patients with HIV than in the general population, making this group more susceptible to fragility fractures. However, bone loss is under-treated in patients with HIV.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of interventions aimed at increasing bone mineral density in HIV-infected adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Meeting Abstracts, AIDSTRIALS, ACTIS, Current Controlled Trials, National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry, and CenterWatch (search date July 2006).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials comparing any pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapy with placebo, no treatment, or an alternative therapy, with the goal of increasing bone mineral density in adult (age 18 years or over) patients with HIV.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality, and extracted data. Where data were incomplete or unclear, conflicts were resolved with discussion and/or trial authors were contacted for further details.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three completed randomised-controlled studies examined the role of alendronate in patients with HIV and osteopenia or osteoporosis. When all three studies were combined, much heterogeneity was seen (p&lt;0.0001), most likely due to different populations and interventions. A sensitivity analysis showed that in two studies without heterogeneity (p=0.11), alendronate, calcium and vitamin D improved lumbar BMD after one year when compared with calcium and vitamin D (weighted mean difference +2.65 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80, 4.51 percent). However the alendronate group did not have less fragility fractures, relative risk (RR) 1.28 (95% CI 0.20, 8.21), or osteoporosis, RR 0.50 (95% CI 0.24, 1.01). Adverse events were not significantly different between groups, RR 1.28 (95% 0.20, 8.21). One randomised-controlled study done in patients with AIDS wasting found that after three months, testosterone enanthane improved lumbar BMD compared to placebo by +3.70 (95% CI 0.48, 6.92) percent, but progressive resistance training did not improve lumbar BMD (+0.40 95% CI -2.81, 3.61 percent). No group in this study had any adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The very limited data reviewed showed that bisphosphonate therapy andin those with AIDS wasting syndrome, testosteronemay be safe and possibly effective methods to improve bone mineral density in HIV patients. The available studies are small, of short duration, and not powered to detect changes in WHO categories and fracture rates.</P>
<P>Larger studies using bisphosphonates are currently underway. The role of colecalciferol, androgen replacement in women, and growth hormone are also under investigation.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Osteoporosis is a state of low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to bone fragility and increased risk of fracture (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1993</LINK>). It is defined by the presence of a fragility fracture or a t-score of -2.5 or less, meaning a bone mass density (BMD) 2.5 standard deviations below that of a healthy young population (<LINK REF="REF-Kanis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 1994</LINK>). Individuals with a bone mineral density between 1.0 and 2.49 are defined as having osteopenia (<LINK REF="REF-Kanis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 1994</LINK>). BMD is the most readily quantifiable predictor of fracture risk in patients who do not have a history of fragility fracture when viewed in context with the patient's age (<LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2005</LINK>). Increased age, prior fragility fracture, parental history of hip fractures, smoking, use of systemic corticosteroids, excess alcohol intake, and rheumatoid arthritis are other major risk factors for future fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Kanis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Decreased bone mineral density also occurs more commonly in HIV patients than in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Bruera-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruera 2003</LINK>). In some studies, the use of antiretroviral therapy, in particular those with protease inhibitors, is associated with osteopenia or osteoporosis in as many as 50% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Tebas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tebas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 2003</LINK>). Other studies have shown that HIV-infected patients have increased rates of osteopenia and osteoporosis regardless of treatment, suggesting that HIV infection may directly decrease BMD (<LINK REF="REF-Amiel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amiel 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Landonio-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landonio 2004</LINK>). Lipodystrophy, a common side effect of antiretroviral therapy, has also been occasionally associated with reduced BMD (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2004</LINK>). Finally, overlapping risk factors such as female gender, increased age, low body mass index, steroid use, and smoking can contribute to reduced bone mineral density in these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Mondy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mondy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fragility fractures due to decreased BMD have been previously described, although prospective longitudinal studies are needed (<LINK REF="REF-McComsey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McComsey 2004</LINK>). Bone loss in HIV patients may also be poorly treated. In one study, only 35% of 55 patients who had suffered a fragility fracture recalled having any therapy to treat their underlying bone disease (<LINK REF="REF-McComsey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McComsey 2004</LINK>). Calcium supplementation was the most commonly reported therapy, and only 10% received antiresorptive therapy. This systematic review aims to review the current evidence on treating bone loss in patients with HIV infection.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>See: Cochrane HIV/AIDS Group methods used in reviews.</P>
<P>Two reviewers searched the following databases, filtering for randomised controlled trials:<BR/>·MEDLINE<BR/>·EMBASE<BR/>·LILIACS<BR/>·<I>The Cochrane Library</I> (CENTRAL)<BR/>·Meeting Abstracts (http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/meetingabstracts.html)</P>
<P>The following keywords were used:<BR/>Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, HIV seropositivity, HIV, human immunodeficiency virus, HIV infection, osteopenia, osteoporosis, bone mineral density, exercise, diet, nutrition, alfacalcidol, calcitriol, vitamin K, alendronate/therapeutic use, metabolic/drug therapy, osteoporosis/drug therapy, vitamin D/therapeutic use, calcium/therapeutic use, diphosphonates/therapeutic use, bone diseases/drug therapy, calcitonin, etidronic acid, zoledronic acid, sparing, switch, switching, replacement, fluoride, hormone replacement therapy, testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, selective estrogen receptor modifiers, parathyroid hormone, raloxifene, risedronate, etidronate, caffeine, salt, protein, fatty acids, dietary fibre</P>
<P>The following databases were searched for ongoing randomised controlled trials:<BR/>·AIDSTRIALS (http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/clinical_trials/);<BR/>·ACTIS (AIDS Clinical Trials Information Service at http://www.actis.org/);<BR/>·Current Controlled Trials (http://www.controlled-trials.com/);<BR/>·The National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry (http://clinicaltrials.gov/);<BR/>·CenterWatch (http://www.centerwatch.com/).</P>
<P>The citations of included trials and major reviews were handsearched for additional studies.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers reviewed the titles and potentially relevant abstracts retrieved by our search strategy. They obtained full articles of the relevant trials that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Relevant articles were inspected independently by two reviewers and disagreements were solved by discussion. Both reviewers assessed the methodological quality of each trial in terms of allocation concealment, blinding, and inclusion of all randomised participants. Allocation concealment was classified as adequate (Grade A), unclear (Grade B), inadequate (Grade C), or not used (Grade D). Blinding was described as open (all parties are aware of treatment), single (either the participant or the care provider is aware of the treatment given), or double (neither the participant nor care provider know which treatment is given). Inclusion of all randomised participants was rated as Grade A (intention-to-treat analysis was possible and there were few losses to follow-up), Grade B (exclusions after randomisation were less than 10%), and Grade C (exclusions were greater than 10% or were widely different between groups).</P>
<P>Both reviewers independently extracted the data using a data-extraction form. For each of the studies, we extracted publication status, year, trial sponsor, duration of study follow-up, study setting, number of randomised patients in each group, age, number of female patients, HIV risk factors, baseline osteoporosis risk factors, baseline t-scores, presence of antiretroviral therapy, and HIV disease severity as measured by CD4-positive lymphocyte count. We crosschecked data and solved discrepancies by discussion. If needed, study authors were contacted for clarification.</P>
<P>Data was analysed using Review Manager 4.2.8. The weighted mean difference method using inverse variance with 95% confidence intervals was used for continuous outcomes. The Mantel-Haenszel method odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were used for dichotomous outcomes. Heterogeneity among trials was assessed using chi-square and I-square statistics. Where heterogeneity was detected, heterogeneity was explored through stratifying by the above patient characteristics, using a random-effects model, and/or excluding outlying trials. After all eligible studies were included in the primary analysis, sensitivity analyses were planned <I>a priori</I>, if needed, for each of the methodological quality factors. Funnel plots were planned <I>a priori</I>, if needed, to estimate the treatment effect against the precision of trialsin order to estimate asymmetry because of selection bias or methodological flaws. Subgroup analyses were planned <I>a priori</I>, if sufficient number of studies and data existed, to be conducted for subsets of studies (setting, control group intervention), and subgroups of patients (gender, ethnicity, AIDS status).</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Four published randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fairfield-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fairfield 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guaraldi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Guaraldi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mondy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mondy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Negredo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Negredo 2005</LINK>) that examined interventions aimed at improving bone loss in patients with HIV were identified. Two of these studies examined the use of alendronate, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation compared with calcium and vitamin D supplementation alone (<LINK REF="STD-Guaraldi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Guaraldi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mondy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mondy 2005</LINK>). One of these studies examined the use of alendronate compared with no study drug, with both groups receiving dietary counselling to ensure adequate daily calcium intake (<LINK REF="STD-Negredo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Negredo 2005</LINK>). The last study used a 2 x 2 factorial design to examine the role of testosterone versus placebo and exercise versus no exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Fairfield-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fairfield 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Negredo (<LINK REF="STD-Negredo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Negredo 2005</LINK>) enrolled 26 HIV-infected patients who were on stable highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and fulfilled the World Health Organization criteria of osteoporosis (t-score of -2.5 or less) in a pilot study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive alendronate 70mg once a week plus dietary counselling at each study visit to ensure dietary calcium intake of 1200g/day, or dietary counselling alone. Patients were followed every 24 weeks for 96 weeks. A DEXA scan was performed at each study visit for the lumbar spine and hip. Twelve patients were allocated to receive alendronate and 14 were controls. One patient in the alendronate group was withdrawn. At baseline, the two groups were similar, except that the alendronate group was older and had lower dietary calcium intake. All patients were on HAART, but the study did not describe whether the same proportion of patients treated with protease inhibitors was in each group. The outcomes measured were proportion of patients fulfilling criteria for osteoporosis and improvement in BMD after 48 and 96 weeks.</P>
<P>Mondy (<LINK REF="STD-Mondy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mondy 2005</LINK>) enrolled 31 HIV-infected patients on stable HAART who had a lumbar spine BMD t-score of less than -1 in a single-centre pilot study. Patients were randomised to receive alendronate 70mg weekly or no alendronate for 48 weeks; calcium supplements (1000mg) and vitamin D supplements (400IU) were given to both groups. A DEXA scan was performed at baseline and at 24-week intervals. Fifteen patients were randomised to receive 70mg of alendronate weekly with calcium and vitamin D, while 16 patients received only calcium and vitamin D. Age, gender, race, CD4 count, cigarette/alcohol use, weight, baseline body mass index, baseline BMD at the hip and lumbar spine, proportion with osteoporosis, and serum bone formation markers were not significantly different at baseline. Eighty-seven percent of the total participants were male and the mean age was 44 ± 8.4. All patients were on HAART, with either one protease inhibitor or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, but the study did not describe if the same proportion of protease inhibitors treated patients were in each group. The primary endpoint was change in the BMD in the lumbar spine region. The study was powered to detect a 3% within-arm difference in lumbar spine BMD at 48 weeks. Whole-body BMD, adipose and lean tissue regional distributions, and bone metabolism markers were also obtained.</P>
<P>Guaraldi (<LINK REF="STD-Guaraldi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Guaraldi 2004</LINK>) enrolled 41 HIV-infected patients on stable HAART who had a lumbar spine and hip t-score of less than -1 in a multi-centre study. Patients were randomised to receive alendronate 70mg weekly or no alendronate for 52 weeks; calcium 1000 mg and vitamin D 500 IU were provided to both groups. Patients were followed at 16, 32, and 52 weeks. A DEXA scan was performed at each visit for the lumbar spine and femoral neck. Eighteen participants were in the alendronate plus calcium and vitamin D group and 23 participants were in the calcium and vitamin D group. At baseline, the mean lumbar and femoral neck BMD, age, gender, body mass index, bone resorption markers, HIV viral load, and CD4 count were not significantly different between groups. Seventy-one percent of the total participants were male. The mean age was 44.5 ± 3.6 (mean ± standard deviation) in the alendronate group and 42.5 ± 3.5 in the control group. All patients were on HAART, and had similar lengths of exposure to different classes of antiretroviral therapies, although it was unclear if the two groups had a similar proportion of patients treated with protease inhibitors during the time of the study. The outcomes measured were BMD at the lumbar spine and femoral neck, vertebral and nonvertebral fractures, and serum biochemical markers for bone resorption.</P>
<P>Fairfield (<LINK REF="STD-Fairfield-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fairfield 2001</LINK>) enrolled 54 eugonadal (serum free testosterone &gt;42 pmol/L) HIV-infected men with AIDS wasting syndrome (weight &lt;90% of ideal body weight or weight loss &gt;10% baseline weight) between 27 and 51 years of age in a single-centre 2x2 factorial study for 12 weeks. Patients were stratified for weight, above or below 90% ideal body weight, and randomized to receive testosterone enanthate (200mg/week intramuscularly) or placebo, and simultaneously to receive progressive resistance training three times per week with a licensed physical therapist or no training. A DEXA scan of the lumbar spine and proximal femur was performed at baseline and at 12 weeks. Four patients elected not to participate in the study before the baseline evaluation and seven did not complete the study. Twenty-four men were randomized to testosterone and 26 men were randomized to exercise. The groups did not differ at baseline with respect to age, weight, body mass index, total body fat content, total body lean content, CD4 count, viral load, total testosterone, free testosterone, estrone, estradiol, or lumbar spine BMD. In this study, protease-inhibitor use was not associated with significant differences in BMD or t-scores. Seventy-six percent of patients were receiving antiretroviral therapy and 72% were receiving HAART, but it was unclear if the groups had a similar proportion of patients treated with antiretroviral therapy during the time of the study. The average age was 38.1 ±3.5. At baseline, the average t-scores for total hip were -0.65 ± 0.8 and for lumbar spine were 0.62 ±1.2. The main outcome was change in lumbar spine BMD after three months of treatment. Fasting weight and serum total and free testosterone levels, serum estradiol and estrone levels, and bone metabolism markers were also measured.<BR/>

Alendronate, calcium, and vitamin D had a significant weighted mean difference in lumbar BMD of +2.65 (95% CI 0.80, 4.51) percent after one year, but did not improve femoral neck BMD (+0.32, 95% CI -2.70, 3.34 percent). Mondy (<LINK REF="STD-Mondy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mondy 2005</LINK>) also found no significant difference in total hip bone mineral density (+0.45 95% CI -0.20, 1.10 percent), and trochanter bone mineral density (-0.27 95% CI -0.82, 0.28 percent) after one year.

</U>We found one randomised controlled study (<LINK REF="STD-Fairfield-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fairfield 2001</LINK>) that examined the role of testosterone in male patients with HIV and AIDS wasting syndrome (comparison Table 2).

Compared to placebo, testosterone enanthane intramuscular injection (200mg/week) improved lumbar bone mineral density by +3.70 (95% CI 0.48, 6.92) percent after three months. Neither group had any adverse events. There were no completed studies found that examined the effect of female hormone replacement therapy, raloxifene, parathyroid hormone, or calcitonin.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The very limited data reviewed showed that bisphosphonate therapy may be a safe and possibly effective method to improve bone mineral density in HIV patients with bone loss. The three published studies examining alendronate were small, lasted only one to two years, and were not powered to detect small differences in bone mineral density. The power and length of treatment were also insufficient to determine improvements in WHO category status change and fracture rates. All three were open-label studies, and two did not use intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Mondy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mondy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Negredo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Negredo 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Considerable heterogeneity occurred among the three alendronate studies (p&lt;0.0001), most likely due to different populations (t-score less than 2.5 in one study, and t-score less than 1.0 in two studies) and different interventions (alendronate with calcium intake counselling versus calcium intake counselling alone in one study, and alendronate with calcium and vitamin D supplementation versus calcium and vitamin D supplementation alone in two studies). Imputed data and methodological quality differences may also be contributing factors. In the two studies examining the effect of alendronate, calcium, and vitamin D compared to calcium and vitamin D alone, heterogeneity was not present and an improvement in lumbar BMD was demonstrated after one year.</P>
<P>The use of testosterone in male patients with HIV and AIDS wasting syndrome, but not all living with osteoporosis or osteopenia, was examined in one study and significantly improved bone mineral density after only three months (<LINK REF="STD-Fairfield-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fairfield 2001</LINK>). In the same study, exercise did not improve bone mineral density but a power analysis was not performed. Intention-to-treat analysis was also not done. Improvements in WHO category status change and fracture rates were not reported and there was likely insufficient power and length of treatment to detect these measurements for either testosterone or exercise. Although no adverse events were reported, adverse effects due to long-term use of testosterone are not known for this setting.</P>
<P>No randomised controlled trials were found examining the role of changes in HIV therapy on bone loss. Given that certain antiretroviral therapies may increase risk of decreased bone mineral density, the four trials included in this review did not provide data showing whether the antiretroviral therapies were similar between groups. It is unclear if differences in antiretroviral therapies between groups were a confounding factor in the bone mineral density changes.</P>
<P>Larger studies using bisphosphonates are currently underway (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McComsey-2006" TYPE="STUDY">McComsey 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rozenberg-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rozenberg 2006</LINK>). Trials are also underway to examine the role of androgen replacement in women and growth hormone in men and women (<LINK REF="STD-Grinspoon-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Grinspoon 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grinspoon-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Grinspoon 2006b</LINK>). One trial is examining the role of colecalciferol (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Ven-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van der Ven 2006</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Limited data show that there may be safe and perhaps effective treatments in the form of alendronate for patients with HIV who have decreased bone mineral density and, in those with AIDS wasting syndrome, testosterone. These data are limited because of their small size, relatively short study duration, and some compromises in study design.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Long-term efficacy and safety data regarding the use of bisphosphates and testosterone in larger studies will verify the results of these pilot studies. Other interventions to treat and prevent bone loss in patients with HIV need further investigation.</P>
