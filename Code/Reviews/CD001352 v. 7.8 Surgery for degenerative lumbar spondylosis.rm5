<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Degeneration of the lumbar spine is described as lumbar spondylosis or degenerative disc disease and may lead to spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal), vertebral instability and/or malalignment, which may be associated with back pain and/or leg symptoms. This review considers the available evidence on the procedures of spinal decompression (widening the spinal canal or laminectomy), nerve root decompression (of one or more individual nerves) and fusion of adjacent vertebrae. There is moderate evidence that instrumentation can increase the fusion rate, but any improvement in clinical outcomes is probably marginal. The effectiveness of intra-discal electrotherapy (IDET) remains unproven. Only preliminary results are available on disc replacement and it is not possible to draw any conclusions on this subject.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Surgical investigations and interventions account for large health care utilisation and costs, but the scientific evidence for most procedures is still limited.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>Degenerative conditions affecting the lumbar spine are variously described as lumbar spondylosis or degenerative disc disease (which we regarded as one entity) and may be associated with back pain and associated leg symptoms, instability, spinal stenosis and/or degenerative spondylolisthesis. The objective of this review was to assess current scientific evidence on the effectiveness of surgical interventions for degenerative lumbar spondylosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PubMed, Spine and ISSLS abstracts, with citation tracking from the retrieved articles. We also corresponded with experts. All data found up to 31 March 2005 are included. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised (RCTs) or quasi-randomised trials of surgical treatment of lumbar spondylosis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data from published papers. Additional information was sought from the authors if necessary.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty-one published RCTs of all forms of surgical treatment for degenerative lumbar spondylosis were identified. The trials varied in quality: only the more recent trials used appropriate methods of randomization, blinding and independent assessment of outcome. Most of the earlier published results were of technical surgical outcomes with some crude ratings of clinical outcome. More of the recent trials also reported patient-centered outcomes of pain or disability, but there is still very little information on occupational outcomes. There was a particular lack of long term outcomes beyond two to three years. Seven heterogeneous trials on spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis and nerve compression permitted limited conclusions. Two new trials on the effectiveness of fusion showed conflicting results. One showed that fusion gave better clinical outcomes than conventional physiotherapy, while the other showed that fusion was no better than a modern exercise and rehabilitation programme. Eight trials showed that instrumented fusion produced a higher fusion rate (though that needs to be qualified by the difficulty of assessing fusion in the presence of metal-work), but any improvement in clinical outcomes is probably marginal, while there is other evidence that it may be associated with higher complication rates. Three trials with conflicting results did not permit any conclusions about the relative effectiveness of anterior, posterior or circumferential fusion. Preliminary results of two small trials of intra-discal electrotherapy showed conflicting results. Preliminary data from three trials of disc arthroplasty did not permit any firm conclusions.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Limited evidence is now available to support some aspects of surgical practice. Surgeons should be encouraged to perform further RCTs in this field. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-05 13:28:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>This review includes all forms of surgical treatment of degenerative conditions affecting the lumbar spine. These are variously described as lumbar spondylosis or degenerative disc disease (which we regard as one entity); whether or not they are regarded as the effects of ageing, secondary to trauma or 'wear and tear', or degenerative disease; and whether they involve the inter-vertebral discs, the vertebrae and/or the associated joints. This includes the associated pathologies or clinical syndromes of instability, spinal stenosis and/or degenerative spondylolisthesis. We have termed the collective conditions 'degenerative lumbar spondylosis'. </P>
<P>Symptoms associated with degenerative lumbar spondylosis vary in severity and have a relatively low correlation with the severity of anatomical or radiographic changes. Only a small proportion of patients come to surgery. Surgical treatment may take the form of either a) fusion with the goal of relieving low back pain (with or without referred leg symptoms, but with the dominant presenting complaint of back pain), and/or b) decompression of nerve root(s) or cauda equina with the goal of relieving neurogenic claudication. Generally, fusion may be considered if there is severe disc degeneration, mal-alignment, or evidence of spinal instability. Decisions about surgery are usually based not only on the nature of the localized pathology and associated symptoms and disability, but also on other factors such as the patient's occupation, athletic or recreational activity, and socio-economic situation. The choice of procedure may be influenced by the surgeon's beliefs about the role of surgery in spinal disorders, and the surgical instrumentation and skills available. In the future, it is also likely to be necessary to consider ways of incorporating patient preferences.</P>
<P>Spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal) was first described as a rare developmental condition, but there is now increasing recognition that stenosis secondary to degenerative lumbar spondylosis may be a cause of low back and leg symptoms, particularly in older patients. Indeed, spinal stenosis is probably now the most common and fastest growing reason for spinal surgery in adults over 65 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Ciol-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciol 1996</LINK>). This fact suggests that surgery is beneficial, but good data relating to the diagnostic criteria and natural history of the condition, the indications for surgery and choice of surgical procedures, and the clinical or patient characteristics associated with a favourable outcome are lacking. Two meta-analyses provide some information. One suggests that, on average, 64% of patients will obtain a satisfactory outcome from surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1992a</LINK>). The other suggests that decompression without a fusion will give a 69% satisfactory outcome, whereas with fusion (solid in 86%), this figure would increase to 90% (<LINK REF="REF-Mardjetko-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mardjetko 1994</LINK>). However, these two meta-analyses were based either entirely (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1992a</LINK>), or mainly (<LINK REF="REF-Mardjetko-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mardjetko 1994</LINK>) on largely retrospective case series.</P>
<P>After more than ninety years, there is continued dispute as to whether lumbar fusion is an appropriate and effective method of treating back pain in patients with degenerative lumbar spondylosis. There is heated debate and lack of clear evidence on the nature and role of 'instability', and the clinical indications for surgery are not well defined (<LINK REF="REF-Szpalski-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szpalski 1997</LINK>). There is also wide variation in the surgical techniques used, technical success and rate of fusion. Reported satisfactory clinical outcomes range from 16% to 95% (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1992a</LINK>). </P>
<P>There is continued interest in, and controversy about, instrumented fusion. Posterior pedicle instrumentation was first used in Europe in the early 1960s (<LINK REF="REF-Roy_x002d_Camille-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roy-Camille 1986</LINK>). In recent years, there has been an explosion of surgical and commercial interests in a wide variety of methods of instrumented fusion in both Europe and the US. The above noted meta-analysis of published case series of degenerative spondylolisthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Mardjetko-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mardjetko 1994</LINK>) suggested that fusion with pedicle screws produced a higher fusion rate (93% versus 86%) than fusion without instrumentation (which was not statistically significant), but that it did not produce any difference in clinical outcomes (86% versus 90% satisfactory outcomes). There is less available scientific information about other methods of fusion, whether anterior or posterior. In recent years there has been rapidly growing clinical, commercial and public interest in other innovative technologies, such as, intradiscal electrotherapy (IDET) and disc arthroplasty.</P>
<P>In view of these various continued uncertainties, a systematic review of all RCTs of surgical treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylosis remains appropriate. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To test the following null hypotheses: <BR/>(i) Any form of surgical treatment for low back pain and/or associated leg symptoms secondary to degenerative lumbar spondylosis is no more effective than natural history, placebo, conservative treatment, or a rehabilitation program. <BR/>(ii) Decompression of spinal stenosis secondary to degenerative lumbar spondylosis is no more effective than any of these alternatives. <BR/>(iii) There is no difference in outcome between different forms of surgical treatment for spinal stenosis. <BR/>(iv) Fusion for low back pain secondary to degenerative lumbar spondylosis is no more effective than any of these alternatives. <BR/>(v) There is no difference in outcome between different forms of surgical treatment for low back pain</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Eligible trials were entered into RevMan 4.2 and sorted on the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. For each included trial, assessment of methodological quality and data extraction were carried out as detailed below. </P>
<P>1. Both authors (JNAG, GW) selected the trials to be included in the review. Disagreement was resolved by discussion, followed, if necessary, by further discussion with an independent colleague. </P>
<P>2. The methodological quality was assessed and internal validity scored by both authors, assessing risk of pre-allocation disclosure of assignment, intention to treat analysis and blinding of outcome assessors (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). The quality of concealment allocation was rated in three grades: A: Clearly yes - some form of centralized randomisation scheme or assignment system; B: Unclear - assignment envelopes, a "list" or "table", evidence of possible randomisation failure such as markedly unequal control and trial groups, or trials stated to be random but with no description; C: Clearly no - alternation, case numbers, dates of birth, or any other such approach, allocation procedures that were transparent before assignment. Withdrawal, blinding of patients and observers, and intention-to-treat analyses were assessed according to standard Cochrane methodology and tabulated in the results tables (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). The nature, accuracy, precision, observer variation and timing of the outcome measures were also tabulated. Initially, any outcomes specified were noted. The data were then collated and outcome measures collected for later meta-analysis. In fact, only four categorical outcomes were consistently reported: the patient's and surgeon's ratings of success, the attainment of spinal fusion and the performance of a second surgical procedure. To pool the results, ratings of excellent and good were classified as 'success', while fair and poor were classified as 'failure'. The pooled data are given in the analysis tables. </P>
<P>3. For each study, Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% confidence limits (95% CI) were calculated. Results from clinically comparable trials were pooled using random-effects models for dichotomous outcomes. It should be noted that in several instances the test for homogeneity was significant, which casts doubt on the statistical validity of the pooling. Nevertheless, there is considerable clinical justification for pooling the trials in this way. In view of the clinical interest, these results are presented as the best available information at present, with the qualification that there may be considerable statistical weaknesses to some of the results. The evidence was rated strong, medium or limited according to the Cochrane Back Review Group levels of evidence (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Descriptions of randomisation were poor in the earlier trials, but there now appears to be more awareness of the importance of the method of randomisation. In 16 studies there was a clear attempt at concealment of group allocation. In seven trials the method of allocation was not described. Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Herkowitz-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Herkowitz 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Postacchini-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Postacchini 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grob-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Grob 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schofferman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schofferman 2001</LINK>) were considered to be quasi-randomised as the patients were allocated by alternate assignment, according to their date of admission to hospital or by odd and even file numbers. Six trials were clearly 'open' to potential selection bias (<LINK REF="STD-Bridwell-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bridwell 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Postacchini-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Postacchini 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zdeblick-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Zdeblick 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grob-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Grob 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schofferman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schofferman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kitchel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kitchel 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Eighteen of the 31 trials had the recommended follow-up for surgical studies of at least two years. Most had a follow-up rate of at least 90%. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-France-1999" TYPE="STUDY">France 1999</LINK>) gave different patient outcomes after best and worst case analyses. Blinding is difficult in surgical studies, but three of the recent trials were double blind and several used an independent assessor. Most of the recent trials also provided patient-oriented, clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Deyo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyo 1998</LINK>). The majority of the trials gave technical surgical outcomes such as fusion, spondylolisthesis progression or the need for re-operation. Clinical outcomes were mainly crude ratings on a three to four-point scale: five trials gave a surgeon's rating and nine gave a patient's rating. Eleven gave direct information on back pain (see Characteristics of Included Trials table) and nine on functional outcome measured on a validated assessment scale. These defects of trial design introduced considerable potential for bias and many of the conclusions of this review are about surgical outcomes rather than patient-centred clinical outcomes. There is still a lack of long-term follow-up beyond two years, which is particularly important in procedures that aim to alter the long-term natural history or clinical progress of a degenerative condition. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-06-05 13:10:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data from thirty-one RCTs of all forms of surgical treatment for degenerative lumbar spondylosis are included in this updated review. In the first edition of this review nine of the 16 trials identified were found on MEDLINE, four from personal bibliographies and four from abstracts of meeting proceedings. The new trials were mainly collected by the authors from personal literature review or after notification by colleagues of the Cochrane Back Review Group. Three trials originally included have now been deleted from the review (see Characteristics of Excluded Trials table) as originally, they were abstracts of work in progress and no data have been published over the intervening years (<LINK REF="STD-Emery-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rogozinski-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rogozinski 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zdeblick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zdeblick 1996</LINK>). Six further trials are included as ongoing studies. The majority of the trials compared two or more surgical techniques. From a surgical perspective, the trials now fall into three broad sections: 1) surgical treatment (decompression with or without fusion) for spinal stenosis and / or nerve root compression 2) surgical treatment (fusion, intra-discal electrotherapy or disc arthroplasty) for back pain 3) comparison of different techniques of spinal fusion.</P>
<P>In the first section, one trial compared surgical treatment with conservative therapy and one compared different techniques of decompression for spinal stenosis. Three trials compared decompression alone with decompression and some form of fusion. One trial compared outcomes following use of an interspinous spacer with those after a non-operative regime, including epidural injection. A further two trials of surgery for isthmic spondylolisthesis were included. The second section included two trials of fusion to relieve discogenic back pain compared with different forms of conservative treatment, and preliminary results from three small trials of intra-discal electrotherapy (IDET) and two trials of disc arthroplasty. In the third section, 15 trials considered the role of instrumentation in fusion and four trials that of electrical stimulation (direct current and pulsed electromagnetic stimulation) in postero-lateral fusion. Five trials included sub-groups of participants and are included in more than one section.</P>
<P>Analysis of the included trials is complicated by the inclusion of participants with varied pathology and a lack of consistency in treatment methods. Only five of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Moller-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amundsen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Amundsen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fritzell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fritzell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brox-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brox 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brox-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brox 2004</LINK>) had a conservative treatment arm. It was not possible to analyze participants according to duration of their symptoms, type of previous conservative treatment, or indications for surgery, as few of the trials provided these data in usable form. Although many trials provided limited information on selected complications, these were not comparable between trials. Three trials provided comparative information on operating time and blood loss, and three trials provided information on progression of spondylolisthesis. No other adverse effects could be reviewed. A cost analysis was performed in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fritzell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fritzell 2001</LINK>), although the methodological criticisms by Goosens (<LINK REF="REF-Goosens-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goosens 1998</LINK>) should be noted.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Techniques for the decompression of spinal and nerve root stenosis.</HEADING>
<P>The effectiveness of surgical decompression for spinal stenosis has been considered in one new trial (<LINK REF="STD-Amundsen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Amundsen 2000</LINK>). In this trial, 19 patients with severe symptoms were selected for surgical treatment and 50 patients with moderate symptoms for conservative therapy. A further 31 patients were randomised between the two treatments. The overall results were broadly in line with those from meta-analyses of retrospective case series by Turner (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1992b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1992b</LINK>) and Ciol (<LINK REF="REF-Ciol-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciol 1996</LINK>). The results of conservative therapy were better than expected but the authors suggested that, if surgery was deemed necessary, it might be 'good' for up to four-fifths of severely affected individuals. However, the small, randomised portion of the study showed no statistically significant effect. At ten years, five people of the 11 randomised to decompression had no, or minimal, pain compared with the four of 14 who were initially treated conservatively (six were lost to follow-up).</P>
<P>Postacchini (<LINK REF="STD-Postacchini-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Postacchini 1993</LINK>) considered techniques of decompression for spinal stenosis by comparing laminectomy with multiple laminotomy. This study had several confounding factors. Nine of the 35 patients scheduled for laminotomy actually had a laminectomy for technical reasons and several patients in each group also had an inter-transverse arthrodesis for degenerative spondylolisthesis. This trial did not demonstrate any difference in clinical outcomes or spondylolisthesis progression between the two treatment methods.</P>
<P>Three trials considered whether some form of postero-lateral fusion, with or without instrumentation, was a useful adjunct to decompression alone (<LINK REF="STD-Herkowitz-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Herkowitz 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bridwell-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bridwell 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grob-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Grob 1995</LINK>). They provided data on a total of 139 participants with 99% follow-up at two to three years. Pooling of the three trials showed no statistically significant difference in outcomes between decompression plus fusion or decompression alone (random OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.13,1.48), as rated by the surgeon, 18 to 24 months after the procedure, although the precision is too small for definitive conclusions to be drawn. One of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Grob-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Grob 1995</LINK>) considered fusion with and without instrumentation in patients with degenerative spinal stenosis with no evidence of instability. In the fusion arm of the trial, patients were allocated to either decompression plus arthrodesis of only the most stenotic segment, or decompression of the whole area. The authors concluded that, in the absence of instability, arthrodesis was not necessary, provided that the posterior elements were preserved during the decompression to maintain spinal stability. The other two trials considered the role of adjunct fusion in spinal stenosis associated with single or two-level degenerative spondylolisthesis. Herkowitz (<LINK REF="STD-Herkowitz-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Herkowitz 1991</LINK>) studied non-instrumented fusion alone, and showed that fusion produced significantly less self-reported back and leg pain and significantly better surgeon's ratings of outcome. Bridwell (<LINK REF="STD-Bridwell-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bridwell 1993</LINK>) studied both instrumented and non-instrumented fusion. Those with an instrumented fusion had a significantly higher fusion rate, less spondylolisthesis progression and more improvement in walking ability. Post hoc analysis showed that achieving a solid fusion was associated with subjective improvement. However, there were methodological limitations to this trial: in particular, the control group was too small and there were insufficient data for an intention-to-treat analysis to demonstrate any significant effect of performing fusion per se versus decompression alone.</P>
<P>Currently, there are no published RCTs of surgical decompression to relieve isolated nerve root stenosis, but there is one trial examining the effect of an interspinous spacer device (<LINK REF="STD-Zucherman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zucherman 2004</LINK>) in elderly patients with one or two level central stenosis. Limited results at one year suggest better outcome estimated on the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire and less pain following device use. Trials of intra-foraminal steroid injection are not included in this surgical review.</P>
<P>There are two trials of surgical treatment for isthmic spondylolisthesis. It may be debated whether this condition falls within our definition of degenerative lumbar spondylosis, but for completeness these trials have been included in this review. Moller (<LINK REF="STD-Moller-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2000</LINK>) studied 111 adults with low back pain alone (one third) or with sciatica (two thirds) associated with isthmic spondylolisthesis. The primary aim of the trial was to compare the outcome of posterolateral fusion with conservative treatment in the form of an intensive exercise program. At two years, patients treated surgically had less pain and disability, and better self- and observer-rated outcomes. There was no significant difference in occupational outcomes. However, no separate data were presented for back pain, and it is not clear how much of these successful outcomes was related to relief of sciatica from foraminal stenosis, which is the generally accepted indication for surgery in this condition. Carragee (<LINK REF="STD-Carragee-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Carragee 1997</LINK>) compared the results of fusion alone, or fusion plus laminectomy and decompression for isthmic L5/S1 spondylolisthesis. Again, these patients had both back and leg pain, although without serious neurology. This trial was confounded by the fact that non-smokers had fusion by bone grafting alone, while smokers had their fusion supplemented by instrumentation. However, in neither group did the addition of decompression to the arthrodesis appear to improve clinical outcome.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Surgery for back pain without neurological compromise</HEADING>
<P>At the time of the original Cochrane review of degenerative lumbar spondylosis (1999) there were no published RCTs on the effectiveness of fusion for chronic back pain, compared with natural history, conservative treatment or placebo. There are now two new trials. The Swedish trial of lumbar fusion versus physiotherapy treatment for chronic low back pain (<LINK REF="STD-Fritzell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fritzell 2001</LINK>) included 294 individuals presenting at 19 spinal centres over a six-year period. Strict inclusion criteria limited trial entry to those who had low back pain more pronounced than leg pain, lasting longer than two years, and no evidence of nerve root compression. Each patient had to have completed a course of conservative treatment that had failed to produce relief. Nineteen per cent had previous surgery. Individuals were randomised into four treatment groups. Seventy-two patients had conservative treatment and 222 had one of three different fusion techniques. There was a 98% follow-up at two years. Twenty-five subjects did not complete treatment according to random allocation, but these 'group changers' were included in the original 'intention-to-treat' analysis. At two years, independent assessors rated 46% of the surgical group as 'excellent' or 'good', compared with 18% of the conservative group (P &lt; 0.0001). More surgical patients rated their results as 'better' or 'much better' (63% versus 29%, P &lt; 0.0001). The surgical patients had significantly greater improvement in pain (visual analogue scale) and disability (Oswestry scale). The "net back to work rate" was significantly in favour of surgical treatment (36% versus 13%, P value 0.002). There were no significant differences in any of these outcomes between the three surgical groups. The Swedish trial also provided one of the few cost-effective analyses of spinal surgical treatment. The cost differences between the surgical and conservative groups were significant, mainly because more individuals went back to work in the surgical group (<LINK REF="STD-Fritzell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fritzell 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The major question about the Swedish trial was the nature of the conservative treatment used as the control intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Mooney-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mooney 1990</LINK>). The investigators tried to ensure that each patient understood that "no treatment method, as far as was known, was superior to any other". Nevertheless, the control group essentially received more of the same 'usual non-surgical treatment' that had already failed, and the failure of which was one of the indications leading to consideration of surgery. In view of the likely negative patient expectations, it is hardly surprising that the results in the control group appear to have been poorer than most epidemiological studies of natural history. Strictly speaking, this trial provided the first substantive evidence that fusion is more effective than continued, standard 1990s, 'usual care'.</P>
<P>The Norwegian trial (<LINK REF="STD-Brox-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brox 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brox-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brox 2004</LINK>) compared posterolateral fusion with transpedicular screws and post-operative physiotherapy versus a modern 'rehabilitation' type of programme, consisting of an educational intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Indahl-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Indahl 1995</LINK>) and a three-week course of intensive exercise sessions, based on cognitive-behavioural principles. Sixty-four patients with low back pain lasting longer than one year plus disc degeneration at L4/5, L5/S1 or both (<LINK REF="STD-Brox-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brox 2003</LINK>), and a further 60 patients with chronic low back pain more than one year after previous discectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Brox-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brox 2004</LINK>) were randomised and reported on separately. There was a 97% follow-up at one year and intention-to-treat analysis. In both series, there were no significant differences in any of the main outcomes of independent observer rating, patient rating, pain, disability or return to work. Radiating leg pain improved significantly more after surgery, whereas fear avoidance beliefs and forward flexion improved significantly more after conservative management. At one-year follow-up, the conservative groups had significantly better muscle strength and endurance (<LINK REF="REF-Keller-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keller 2004</LINK>). Despite the relatively small size of these trials (though the number randomised to conservative treatment is comparable to the Swedish trial, 57 compared to 72), the consistent results in both first time and previously failed surgical patients and lack of any trends make a Type II error unlikely. In contrast to the Swedish trial, these results suggest that fusion and a modern rehabilitation approach can produce comparable outcomes.</P>
<P>There are now results from three small RCTs of intra-discal electrotherapy (IDET), each using different protocols. The first (<LINK REF="STD-Barendse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barendse 2001</LINK>) randomised 28 patients to either IDET or placebo. At eight weeks, one patient was judged a success in those stimulated (n = 13) and two in the controls (n = 15). No more detailed or longer-term results have been published. The second (<LINK REF="STD-Pauza-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pauza 2004</LINK>) reported on a highly selected group of 64 patients (from a potential cohort of 4253) randomised to IDET or placebo. Results (from 56) suggested that IDET resulted in a significantly greater improvement in pain and disability. The final study (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2003</LINK>) randomised 57 patients with a 2:1 ratio to IDET or placebo and had 96% follow-up. No patient in either arm met pre-defined criteria for clinically significant improvement in the Low Back Outcome Score or SF-36, or for a successful outcome. These trials are all small so it is not possible to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of IDET. Nevertheless, the extremely poor results of Barendse and Freeman cast serious doubt on the highly selective, positive results reported by Pauza. It is interesting to note that IDET was also found to be ineffective in both arms of a randomised trial published by Ercelen et al (<LINK REF="STD-Ercelen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ercelen 2003</LINK>). This trial was excluded from the review as it compared two durations of thermocoagulation rather than the intervention versus any form of control therapy.</P>
<P>Three makes of artificial disc - the SB Charite, ProDisc and Maverick - are currently undergoing FDA-approved multi-centre RCTs for degenerative lumbar disc disease. <LINK REF="STD-McAfee-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McAfee 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zigler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zigler 2003</LINK> respectively summarised earlier European experience of these two devices, which did not include any RCTs. McAfee (<LINK REF="STD-McAfee-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McAfee 2003</LINK>) reported on the pilot feasibility study of the US RCT comparing the SB Charite (n = 41) and BAK anterior interbody fusion (n = 19) for single level degenerative disc disease at L4/5 or L5/S1. There was no significant difference in Oswestry Disability scores between the artificial disc and fusion groups at two years. During the period of review of this manuscript, further data from an additional 244 participants (total 304: 205 Charite, 99 BAK) have been published by Geisler et al. 2004 (see sub-reference <LINK REF="STD-McAfee-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McAfee 2003</LINK>). Oswestry disability scores, VAS scores and device failure rates are provided in the analysis tables. No significant differences were observed. <LINK REF="STD-Zigler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zigler 2003</LINK> (n = 39) and <LINK REF="STD-Delamarter-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Delamarter 2003</LINK> (n = 53) each reported six-month results from single centres taking part in the US RCT of ProDisc versus circumferential 360 degree fusion for one- or two-level degenerative lumbar disc disease between L3/S1. <LINK REF="STD-Zigler-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zigler 2003</LINK> compared 28 patients who received ProDisc and 11 who had fusion. Operative time, blood loss and length of hospital stay were lower with disc replacement. Disc replacement patients had a trend to better Oswestry Disability scores, but at six months there were no significant differences in pain, disability or patient satisfaction. In view of the small numbers, it is not possible to graphically present the results, make multiple statistical comparisons or draw any firm conclusions. <LINK REF="STD-Delamarter-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Delamarter 2003</LINK> compared 35 patients who received the ProDisc and 18 who had fusion. Disc replacement patients had significantly faster improvement in VAS pain and Oswestry Disability scores at six weeks and three months, but by six months there was no significant difference between disc replacement and fusion. Patients with disc replacement at L4/5 preserved significantly better motion.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3) Techniques of fusion</HEADING>
<P>Fifteen trials addressed various questions about the role of instrumentation in fusion. Four of these were sub-groups from trials already described in sections 1) and 2) (<LINK REF="STD-Bridwell-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bridwell 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grob-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Grob 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fritzell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fritzell 2001</LINK>). This was a very heterogeneous group of studies, in terms of surgical pathology, the technique(s) of instrumentation and the questions addressed. Four trials included patients with back pain associated with mixed pathologies - degenerative disc disease, degenerative spondylolisthesis, isthmic spondylolisthesis, or failed back surgery - and did not present separate results for each condition (<LINK REF="STD-Zdeblick-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Zdeblick 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-France-1999" TYPE="STUDY">France 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2002</LINK>). The Swedish study (<LINK REF="STD-Fritzell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fritzell 2001</LINK>) focused on people with chronic low back pain due to degenerative disc disease, and excluded stenosis or spondylolisthesis, but 19% of the participants had back pain following previous surgery for disc herniation. Two trials had participants with degenerative spondylolisthesis and stenosis (<LINK REF="STD-Bridwell-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bridwell 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fischgrund-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fischgrund 1997</LINK>) and three had participants with isthmic spondylolisthesis (<LINK REF="STD-McGuire--1993" TYPE="STUDY">McGuire 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carragee-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Carragee 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moller-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2000</LINK>). Only the recent Norwegian study (<LINK REF="STD-Brox-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brox 2003</LINK>) reported separately on participants with chronic low back pain due to degenerative disc disease. There were differences in surgical approach and instrumentation systems in most studies, and only three trials used the same pedicle screw system. There was also lack of uniformity in the outcome measures, with the most common being technical surgical outcomes - fusion rates, progression of spondylolisthesis and re-operation rates. The results from the trials are summarized in the 'analysis tables'. Note that the test for homogeneity was significant in all the meta-analyses. Nevertheless, there is strong clinical rationale for pooling this group of trials and, in view of the clinical importance of the issue, the results are presented as the best information available at present, with the qualification that there may be some statistical weakness to their interpretation.</P>
<P>Eight trials directly addressed the question of whether instrumentation improves the outcome of postero-lateral fusion, with an average 95% patient follow-up at 16 months to 4.5 years (mean 28 months). These trials provide moderate evidence that instrumentation improves the fusion rate (random OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21,0.91: favours instrumented). Taken altogether, these trials provide conflicting evidence that instrumentation produces a statistically and clinically significant improvement in clinical outcomes (random OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28,0.84: favours instrumented). However that is heavily dependent on the suspiciously good results of Bridwell (<LINK REF="STD-Bridwell-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bridwell 1993</LINK>) and Zdeblick (<LINK REF="STD-Zdeblick-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zdeblick 1996</LINK>). If only the methodologically stronger trials since 1997 are considered, then any advantage appears to be marginal and non-significant (74% versus 68%).</P>
<P>Four trials compared various combinations of anterior, posterior or combined fusion. Schofferman (<LINK REF="STD-Schofferman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schofferman 2001</LINK>) found no difference in clinical outcomes between anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) plus pedicle screws plus instrumented posterolateral fusion (360°) versus ALIF plus pedicle screws without graft (270°). Health care costs increased with the complexity of surgery. Kitchel (<LINK REF="STD-Kitchel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kitchel 2002</LINK>) found no difference in outcomes with the addition of a posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) in degenerative spondylolisthesis (Grade I/II) to a posterolateral instrumented fusion for patients over 60 years of age, but significantly longer surgery time, higher blood loss and complication rate in this group. Christensen (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2002</LINK>) found that circumferential fusion using ALIF carbon fiber cages produced a higher fusion rate (90% versus 80%) and lower re-operation rate (7% versus 22%) than posterolateral fusion with Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation. Circumferential fusion produced marginally less back and leg pain (though of borderline significance on multiple comparisons). Finally, Sasso (<LINK REF="STD-Sasso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sasso 2004</LINK>) compared fusion rate using a cylindrical threaded titanium cage inserted anteriorly with that obtained after using a femoral ring allograft. Although fusion rate was greater with the cage, disability and neurologic outcome scores were not significantly different. These conflicting results do not permit any conclusions about the relative effectiveness of anterior, posterior or circumferential fusion.</P>
<P>Four trials assessed whether electrical stimulation could enhance fusion, though they all used different methods. Mooney and Linovitz (<LINK REF="STD-Mooney-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mooney 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linovitz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Linovitz 2002</LINK>) used pulsed electromagnetic stimulation for four hours/day and 30 minutes/day respectively. Goodwin (<LINK REF="STD-Goodwin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goodwin 1999</LINK>) used capacitively coupled field stimulation 15 to 16 hours/day and Jenis (<LINK REF="STD-Jenis-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jenis 2000</LINK>) tested both pulsed electromagnetic stimulation and implanted direct current. The anatomical technique of fusion varied. Jenis tested instrumented and Linowitz non-instrumented fusion, while Mooney and Goodwin tested both instrumented and non-instrumented fusion. Three trials in non-instrumented fusion showed a significant effect on the fusion rate [random OR 0.38 95% CI 0.22, 0.64: favoured stimulation]. Two out of three trials in instrumented fusion showed positive results though the third trial had negative results [random OR 0.59 95% CI 0.15, 2.30: not significant]. Although these results suggest that electrical stimulation does have a modest effect on enhancing fusion, it is not possible to assess the relative value of different methods of electrical stimulation. Jenis, Mooney and Goodwin assessed clinical outcomes, but overall there was no significant effect.</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>There is now an increasing scientific database of 31 RCTs on surgical treatments for degenerative lumbar spondylosis. Four RCTs were presented in a single day at the 2003 meeting of the International Society for Study of the Lumbar Spine (ISSLS). Most of the recent trials are of higher quality than those previously reported. However, most still compare different surgical techniques, and few address the more fundamental question of whether these techniques provide effective relief of presenting symptoms. Many trials still report relatively short-term, technical, surgical outcomes rather than patient-centred outcomes of pain, disability and capacity for work. The limited evidence on the long-term effects of either surgical decompression or fusion remains a matter of concern, given the magnitude of the clinical problem and the numbers and costs of surgical procedures being performed. </P>
<P>The trials on spinal stenosis and decompression permit limited conclusions. There is no clear evidence about the most effective technique of decompression for spinal stenosis or the extent of that decompression. There is limited evidence that adjunct fusion to supplement decompression for degenerative spondylolisthesis produces less progressive slip and better clinical outcomes than decompression alone. There is also limited evidence that fusion alone may be as effective as fusion combined with decompression for grade I or II isthmic spondylolisthesis with no significant neurology. </P>
<P>There are now two trials on the effectiveness of fusion compared with conservative treatment. The first (Swedish) trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fritzell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fritzell 2001</LINK>) appeared to provide strong evidence in favour of fusion, but the more recent (Norwegian) trial (<LINK REF="STD-Brox-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brox 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brox-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brox 2004</LINK>) refutes this. The difference may lie in the treatment given to the control group. Fusion is more effective than continued, failed, standard 1990s, 'usual care'; it does not appear to be any more effective than a modern rehabilitation programme. Clearly, there are still open questions about the scientific evidence on the clinical effectiveness of fusion. Further evidence is required, which hopefully will be provided by the multi-centred RCTs of fusion that are presently underway in the US and the UK. </P>
<P>There are now 15 trials of instrumented fusion, but they are clinically and statistically very heterogeneous, and any attempt to combine and interpret the results must be cautious and tentative. These trials dealt with diverse pathological conditions, with different criteria for surgery, and the results were not always presented separately for each sub-group. Most of the trials used different instrumentation systems. Many of these trials were of low methodological quality with inadequate randomisation, lack of blinding and potential for bias. The published results were mainly surgical outcomes, such as fusion and surgeon's ratings, rather than patient-centred outcomes. Some of the trials were published in abstract form only. Bearing these limitations in mind, instrumentation of a posterolateral fusion appears to lead to a higher fusion rate, though there are problems assessing fusion in the presence of metalwork, which few of these trials considered (<LINK REF="REF-Blumenthal-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumenthal 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kant-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kant 1995</LINK>). Despite enhancing fusion, it appears that any improvement in clinical outcomes is marginal. It is not possible to draw any conclusions from this review about the relative morbidity or complications, except that instrumentation is obviously associated with unique complications. Neither is it possible to draw any conclusions about the possible role of instrumented fusion for any particular pathological condition, or about the relative benefits of any particular instrumentation system. </P>
<P>Bono et al (<LINK REF="REF-Bono-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bono 2004</LINK>) recently completed a comprehensive review of a much wider range of randomised and non-randomised, prospective and retrospective studies of lumbar fusion, which provides a useful check on this more rigorous but more limited Cochrane review. They also concluded that:<BR/>1. The surgical literature on lumbar fusion over the past 20 years is 'incomplete, unreliable, haphazard'. They made useful suggestions on how this should be improved in future studies.<BR/>2. The use of instrumentation appears to increase the overall fusion rate, but only slightly.<BR/>3. The use of instrumentation does not improve overall clinical outcomes (though there is currently insufficient evidence to judge particular sub-groups of patients).<BR/>The recent paper (<LINK REF="STD-Zucherman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zucherman 2004</LINK>) examining the use of an interspinous spacer device for lumbar spinal stenosis provides promising results and further studies are clearly warranted.</P>
<P>There are still only preliminary results available on disc replacement, preventing the drawing of any firm conclusions. It is likely to be another 18 months before the full two-year outcomes from all the centres of the US RCTs are published.</P>
<P>Only four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Thomsen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Thomsen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fritzell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fritzell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brox-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brox 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brox-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brox 2004</LINK>) considered occupational status, and it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of any of these surgical treatments on capacity for work. There is no good evidence on cost-effectiveness. There are other data on various aspects of surgical technique that we have not included in this review (e.g. computer assistance on the placement of pedicle screws (<LINK REF="STD-Laine-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Laine 2000</LINK>)). There is also immense scientific interest in the role of recombinant bone morphogenic protein (<LINK REF="STD-Transfeldt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Transfeldt 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandhu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandhu 2003</LINK>) and gene therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cha-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cha 2003</LINK>), but we feel that these topics should be the subject of a separate Cochrane Review.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is now some evidence on various issues of surgical techniques of decompression and fusion for individuals with lumbar spondylosis. There is still insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of surgery on clinical outcomes to draw any firm conclusions. Further studies are needed. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for more scientific evidence on the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of surgical decompression and/or fusion for specific pathological and clinical syndromes associated with degenerative lumbar spondylosis. This will require high quality RCTs, preferably comparing these surgical treatments with natural history, placebo or conservative treatment. Surgeons should seek expert methodological advice when planning trials. </P>
<P>This Cochrane review should be maintained and updated, as further RCTs become available. The authors of this review will be pleased to receive information about any other RCTs of surgical treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylosis. </P>
