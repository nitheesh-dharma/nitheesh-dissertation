For example, research in Scotland has shown that 50% of tooth decay occurs in 11% of 5-year-old children and only 6% of 14-year-old children. In light of this uneven distribution, it is often suggested that these small percentages of children may be offered targeted-caries preventive measures to great potential effect, in a cost effective manner.

At least two review authors independently performed all the key steps in the review such as screening of abstracts, application of inclusion criteria, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment.

This study was assessed to be at high risk of bias. The study recruited children from seven schools in an area of deprivation that had low levels of fluoride in the water. The mean age at the beginning of the study was 8.8 years and at the termination was 10.9 years. DMFT in permanent teeth or dmft in primary teeth was greater than one at the start of the study and greater than one million colony-forming units of <I>Streptococcus mutans</I> per millilitre of saliva.</P><P>Although 132 children were still included in the trial at the two-year completion point, examination and statistical analysis was performed on only the 63 children (31 in intervention group, 32 in control group) who had retained the beads (retention rate was 47.7% at 2 years). Among these 63 children, caries increment was reported to be statistically significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (DMFT: mean difference -0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.23 to -0.21; DMFS: mean difference -1.52, 95% CI -2.68 to -0.36 (very low-quality evidence)). Although this difference was clinically significant, it only holds true for those children who maintain the fluoride beads; over 50% of children did not retain the beads.</P><P>Harms were not reported within the trial report. Evidence for other outcomes sought in this review (progression to of caries lesion, dental pain, healthcare utilisation data) were also not reported.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-01-25 10:51:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch"><P>There is insufficient evidence to determine the caries-inhibiting effect of slow-release fluoride glass beads. The body of evidence available is of very low quality and there is a potential overestimation of benefit to the average child. The applicability of the findings to the wider population is unclear; the study had included children from a deprived area that had low levels of fluoride in drinking water, and were considered at high risk of caries. In addition, the evidence was only obtained from children who still had the bead attached at 2 years (48% of all available children); children who had lost their slow-release fluoride devices earlier might not have benefited as much from the devices.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-02-28 15:07:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-01-25 11:34:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-11-24 15:48:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Dental decay is not distributed evenly among the population. For example, in epidemiological surveys in Scotland, 50% of the disease can be accounted for by including only 11% of 5-year-old children and only 6% of 14-year-old children (<LINK REF="REF-DHSRU-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">DHSRU 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pitts-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitts 1999</LINK>). In light of this uneven distribution, it is often advocated that these small percentages of children may be offered targeted caries preventive measures to great potential effect, in a cost-effective manner. However, some dentists have cautioned that such targeted interventions may fail to effect real change if they require the targeted individuals to adopt different social norms from their peers (<LINK REF="REF-Batchelor-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Batchelor 2002</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-01-25 11:31:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch"><P>Fluoride is valuable not only in the prevention of caries but also in reversal and remineralisation of lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Biesbrock-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biesbrock 1998</LINK>). However, this would appear to be a slow process requiring the presence of fluoride in the mouth for extended periods of time (<LINK REF="REF-Rolla-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolla 1990</LINK>), and the low concentrations found after brushing with fluoride-containing dentifrice may not be sufficient to reduce the dissolution of tooth mineral significantly (<LINK REF="REF-ten-Cate-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ten Cate 1999</LINK>).</P><P>There are a number of methods of delivering supplemental fluoride, including tablets, mouthrinses, fluoridated salt, toothpastes, gels, and varnishes. Several of these have been the subject of Cochrane Reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2010</LINK>). A number of devices have been used to provide a slow-released, more sustained presence of fluoride within the buccal cavity showing that it is possible to sustain elevated levels of fluoride within saliva and plaque (<LINK REF="REF-Mirth-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mirth 1982</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-01-25 11:32:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch"><P>The desired properties of fluoride-releasing devices include being safe to administer, providing low and continuous intraoral fluoride concentration of at least 1 year, being quick and easy to administer, being robust and being clinically effective (<LINK REF="REF-Toumba-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toumba 2001</LINK>). In terms of the desired properties of fluoride-releasing devices, only glass ionomer cements meet the criterion of long-term fluoride release of at least 1 year. Two types of intraoral fluoride slow-release device are currently in use, the co-polymer membrane (<LINK REF="REF-Cowsar-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cowsar 1976</LINK>), and slow-dissolving fluoride glass beads (<LINK REF="REF-Toumba-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toumba 1993</LINK>). The glass beads, which are 4 mm in diameter, are attached to the buccal aspect of molar teeth using an acid-etch composite. The percentage of incorporated fluoride can be adjusted to vary the amount released and the beads have been shown to lead to raised salivary fluoride levels for up to 2 years (<LINK REF="REF-Toumba-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toumba 1993</LINK>).</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-01-25 11:34:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch"><P>Concerns that accidental swallowing of fluoride-containing devices might lead to gastric irritation or adverse effects following raised plasma fluoride concentrations were addressed in a study reported in 1994 (<LINK REF="REF-Curzon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curzon 2004</LINK>). Glass beads constituted with 13.3% fluoride were deliberately swallowed by five adult volunteers and their venous blood was subsequently drawn and analysed at intervals. Plasma fluoride concentration did not rise from baseline during 2 hours of monitoring in contrast to fluoride tablets, which gave a detectable increase peaking after 20 to 30 minutes. Based on this finding, the authors concluded that fluoride released from slow-dissolving glass did not present a health risk.</P><P>The purpose of this review was to determine, if possible, the clinical effectiveness of slow-release fluoride devices for halting, or slowing, the progression of enamel, dentine, and carious root lesions on different tooth surfaces of primary (deciduous) and permanent teeth. It is anticipated that if such slow-fluoride releasing devices did prove to be clinically effective they would primarily be offered to children regarded as being at high risk of developing dental caries.</P><P>This is the second update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2006 and previously updated in 2014 (<LINK REF="REF-Bonner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonner 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bonner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonner 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chong 2014</LINK>).</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-11-24 15:48:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different types of slow-release fluoride devices on preventing, arresting, or reversing the progression of carious lesions on all surface types of primary (deciduous) and permanent teeth.</P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2018-02-01 15:02:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-01-25 11:40:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2014-11-24 15:48:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) irrespective of publication status, language, or blinding.

When no specification was provided with regard to the methods of examination adopted, diagnostic thresholds used, groups of teeth and types of tooth eruption recorded, and approaches for reversals adopted, the primary choices described above were assumed.</P></CRIT_OUTCOMES_SECONDARY></CRIT_OUTCOMES></SELECTION_CRITERIA><SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2018-02-01 15:02:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ELECTRONIC_SEARCHES MODIFIED="2018-02-01 15:02:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Cochrane Oral Health&#8217;s Information Specialist conducted systematic searches in the following databases for randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials.

The generalisability of these findings to routine dental practice was questioned by the difficulties of retention of the devices by the study population (children at high risk of caries, living in an area with low levels of fluoride in tap water). Clearly, once the beads have been dislodged they are no longer useful. In addition, the beneficial effects seen might prescribe careful selection of the target recipients to be cost-effective.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-01-25 15:08:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Luisa M Fernandez Mauleffinch"><UL><LI>Evidence: the study identified for this review did not provide reliable evidence to answer the main question of the review. Some limited evidence was found but weaknesses in this were evident. To remedy these weaknesses, much larger, well-conducted trials (randomised controlled trials, and where possible, double-blinded) should be carried out. These trials should, perhaps, draw comparisons between available alternatives such as gels or varnishes and should provide analysis of results on the basis of intention-to-treat and consider costs and benefits. One of the authors of the included study has previously concluded that the use of slow fluoride-releasing glass beads is a cost-effective technique (<LINK REF="REF-Toumba-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toumba 1997</LINK>). The included study focused on children from a low socio-economic area (<LINK REF="STD-Toumba-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Toumba 2005</LINK>). It may also be of benefit to establish how much fluoride should be released from the devices for optimum effect. Different materials and methods used for bonding may influence the efficacy of fluoride release as well as the strength of the bonding.</LI><LI>Population: participants from different risk categories.</LI><LI>Intervention: slow-release fluoride devices, of different materials or methods for bonding.</LI><LI>Comparison: placebo or other slow-release fluoride devices of a different material or methods of bonding, or amount of fluoride released.</LI><LI>Outcomes:</LI><UL><LI>primary outcomes:</LI><OL><LI>number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth or surfaces or both (DMFT/DMFS in permanent teeth - dmft/dmfs in primary teeth);</LI><LI>progression of caries lesion through enamel or into dentine;</LI></OL><LI>secondary outcomes:</LI><OL><LI>dental pain;</LI><LI>harms of slow-release fluoride devices, including adverse effects of swallowing dislodged devices;</LI><LI>participant satisfaction;</LI><LI>retention of devices (number of devices staying intact);</LI><LI>other healthcare utilisation data (e.g. time taken to fit, number of visits to the dentist for attention to or re-fitting of slow-release fluoride devices and cost effectiveness of the slow-release fluoride devices).</LI></OL></UL><LI>Time: the intervention and follow-up should be conducted for a minimum of 1 year, and preferable for a longer duration.</LI></UL></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-01-24 16:01:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We wish to acknowledge the help of Anne Littlewood, Information Specialist, in the design of the search strategy and of Luisa Fernandez Mauleffinch, Managing Editor, and the rest of the Cochrane Oral Health editorial team.
