<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-08 14:02:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Type 1 diabetes results from a defect in insulin secretion, leading to elevated levels of plasma sugar or glucose and disturbances in carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Complications may effect the eyes, kidneys, nerves and the cardiovascular system. Type 1 diabetes may occur at any age and it is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and adolescence. Type 1 diabetes impacts heavily on the lifestyle of the individual as well as their families. Since there is no cure or prevention for type 1 diabetes, life-long insulin replacement and monitoring of blood glucose levels are required. It is vital that effective insulin therapy regimes are available for optimal management and to minimise blood glucose fluctuation (known as too low or too high blood sugar levels - hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia).</P>
<P>Insulin therapy may be in the form of 'conventional' therapy of multiple (typically four) injections per day or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion involves attachment (via catheter on the outside of the body) to an insulin pump that is programmed to deliver insulin to match the individual's needs, and doses are activated by the individual to cover meals and correct blood glucose fluctuation. Here we explore whether continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is better than three or more insulin injections per day for good management of type 1 diabetes.</P>
<P>Twenty three studies randomised 976 participants with type 1 diabetes to either continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or multiple injections. Seven of the 23 studies were performed in participants under 18 years of age and the remainder were performed in adults. Study duration ranged from six days to four years. The body of evidence suggests that continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion may be better than multiple injections for glycaemic control in people with type 1 diabetes; continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion appears to provide no benefit for reducing non-severe hypoglycaemic events. Future studies need to consider the short and long term adverse effects, mortality, morbidity and costs of these interventions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-10 13:45:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-11-08 14:18:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Type 1 diabetes results from a defect in insulin secretion. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group on the Cochrane Library (see 'About the Cochrane Collaboration', 'Collaborative Review Groups-CRGs'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main Glossary on <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<P>The onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus may occur at any age and it is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and adolescence. In adults with type 1 diabetes, vascular complications are a major cause of mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Couper-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Couper 2002</LINK>). Based on young onset patients, the incidence of this disease worldwide varies from 0.1 to 37.4 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Karvonen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karvonen 2000</LINK>). The EURODIAB Study Group predicts that between 2005 and 2020, new cases of type 1 diabetes in European children younger than five years will double and that the prevalence of cases in those younger than 15 years will increase by 70% (<LINK REF="REF-Dabelea-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dabelea 2009</LINK>). Type 1 diabetes impacts heavily on the lifestyle of the individual as well as their families. Life-long insulin replacement and monitoring of blood glucose levels are required and patients are prone to acute and late complications of diabetes (for example cardiovascular disease) that are influenced by diabetes control. Moreover, the economic burden is high for the individual, the family, the health care sector and society as a whole, where significant health care costs arise not only at diagnosis but also for subsequent admissions to hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Sutton-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutton 1990</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-11-10 13:45:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Since there are no interventions shown to delay or prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-DPT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DPT 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ENDIT-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ENDIT 2003</LINK>), it is vital that effective treatment regimes are available for optimal management of this disease. Glycaemic control is maintained by replacement of insulin. Insulin is administered subcutaneously from where insulin is absorbed into the bloodstream. Here, complexes are formed enabling binding to the insulin receptor for activation of glucose uptake into the muscle. There are various regimes for insulin administration. Ideally, an individual's insulin replacement regimen should provide appropriate basal insulin requirements across 24 hours, provide sufficient levels to cover food intake, have adequate provision for correction when needed, minimise blood glucose fluctuation and therefore risk of hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia and achieve short-term and long-term targets (<LINK REF="REF-APEG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">APEG 2004</LINK>). Insulin therapy may be executed in the form of 'conventional' insulin therapy of multiple injections (like 2 to 4 injections per day) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). The multiple injection form of therapy may consist of administering rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate-acting or long-acting types of insulin (<LINK REF="REF-APEG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">APEG 2004</LINK>), which differ in relation both to their speed of onset and duration of glucose-lowering action. For example, rapid-acting insulins typically begin to lower glucose within 5 to 10 minutes of injection, and last for 4 to 6 hours, while short-acting insulins take at least 20 minutes to begin to act, and can last for up to eight hours. In contrast, CSII typically administers a rapid-acting insulin (analogue) via an insulin pump programmed to deliver basal rates to match the individual's needs and bolus doses are activated by the individual to cover meals and correct hyperglycaemia. Insulin pumps are worn by the individual externally and insulin is delivered from the pump via insertion of a catheter into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall (<LINK REF="REF-Pickup-1980a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickup 1980a</LINK>). In this review, we define multiple insulin injections as three or more per day (MI).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-10-30 12:43:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>While CSII and MI are both successful methods of insulin therapy, it has been suggested that CSII may be a superior alternative since it allows to more closely mimic normal physiology and eliminate the need for repeat injections. CSII may provide a more efficient mode of insulin delivery to the bloodstream, minimise the risk of hypoglycaemic events and may be more beneficial to those who find it difficult to adhere to a regimen of multiple injections. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>Potential adverse events that may arise include pump malfunction, catheter-site infection, irritation, diabetic ketoacidosis or discomfort (<LINK REF="REF-Guinn-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guinn 1988</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-10-30 12:18:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Three systematic reviews comparing MI with CSII have been published (<LINK REF="REF-HTA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">HTA 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pickup-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickup 2002</LINK>). The review by Pickup et al provides an overview of the studies located, however there are some limitations. Firstly, on-going study and abstract searches have not been documented, therefore it is possible that relevant studies may have been overlooked. Secondly, important aspects such as the search strategy and methods of study randomisation have not been documented. The Health Technology Assessment (HTA) report and the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines are methodologically rigorous, however the most up-to-date search strategies were conducted in 2007 and therefore do not include recent randomised controlled trials. Given the limitations of these previous systematic reviews, it is important that we have considered these factors and used specific methodology and criteria outlined by the Cochrane Collaboration in our aim to present a comprehensive systematic review to assess the effects of CSII compared to MI. Where possible and feasible, we have performed meta-analyses.</P>

<P>Results of clinically and statistically homogenous studies were pooled to provide estimates of the efficacy of the interventions. Clinical homogeneity was satisfied when participants, interventions, outcome measures and timing of outcome measurement were considered to be similar. For studies that were clinically heterogeneous or presented insufficient information for pooling, a descriptive analysis was performed. Statistical homogeneity was assessed using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic where I<SUP>2</SUP> values under 50% indicated acceptable homogeneity (low heterogeneity) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>Twenty-three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) meeting the inclusion criteria of this review were identified. Details of these studies are shown in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table. Eleven of the 23 included studies were of parallel design, the other 12 had a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Bak-1987-and-Husted-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bak 1987 and Husted 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruttomesso-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bruttomesso 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chiasson-1984-and-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Chiasson 1984 and 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanaire_x002d_Broutin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hanaire-Broutin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hirsch-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hirsch 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Home-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Home 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoogma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hoogma 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saurbrey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Saurbrey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmitz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmitz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weintrob-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Weintrob 2004</LINK>). Six of the cross-over studies were analysed using adequate statistical methodology to account for within-person variation. Six cross-over studies were not adequately analysed, and ignored within-person variation, so we reanalysed the data from these studies as described above in '<LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK>'. The results from these analyses can be found in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>Seventy-eight percent (18) of the studies had an initial run-in phase lasting from two days to six months in order to achieve stable metabolic conditions. Of the 12 studies with a cross-over design, six reported a wash-out period before switching to the other treatment.</P>
<P>The single centre design was the dominating setting (70%) but multiple centre studies were also common (30%). Studies were published from 1982 to 2008. Sixty-one per cent (14 studies) could be clearly identified as partly or entirely industry sponsored and in two studies, funding was not specified. Diagnostic criteria for entry into the study was specified in eight of the studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions of included studies</HEADING>
<P>All included studies compared continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and multiple insulin injections (MI) (three or more insulin injections per day). The duration of the intervention ranged from six days to four years. It is important to note that the study with an intervention period of six days (<LINK REF="STD-Meschi-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Meschi 1982</LINK>) should not be considered a real life setting and so was explored in sensitivity analysis but the effect estimate was largely unaltered. Most studies tried to achieve a comparable insulin dose regimen throughout the investigation period, and treating physicians, together with the participants, tried to achieve optimisation of therapy, usually by means of flexible insulin dosage in order to achieve metabolic targets of heterogeneously defined adequate blood glucose control.</P>

In all four studies the CSII groups had higher scores, representing better treatment satisfaction, than the MI group. Of the two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Doyle-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Doyle 2004</LINK>) that used the validated diabetes quality of life for youth scale (DQOLY), one study in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2003</LINK>) reported a higher score, representing better quality of life, in the CSII group than the MI group. The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Doyle-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Doyle 2004</LINK>), including participants less than 18 years of age, did not report scores but noted that a difference between the groups was not found. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hoogma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hoogma 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsui-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tsui 2001</LINK>) used the validated diabetes quality of life scale (DQoL) and found that the MI group scored lower, representing better quality of life, than the CSII group. Use of the SF-12 questionnaire (<LINK REF="STD-Hoogma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hoogma 2005</LINK>), SF36 general health perceptions scale (<LINK REF="STD-DeVries-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeVries 2002</LINK>) and the paediatric quality of life inventory (PedsQL) (<LINK REF="STD-Nuboer-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nuboer 2008</LINK>) (all validated) revealed that CSII was favoured over MI for perception of better mental health, perception of better general health and better quality of life, respectively. It is difficult to determine which treatment is better when independent questionnaires (<LINK REF="STD-Bak-1987-and-Husted-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bak 1987 and Husted 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chiasson-1984-and-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Chiasson 1984 and 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanaire_x002d_Broutin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hanaire-Broutin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Home-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Home 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoogma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hoogma 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saurbrey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Saurbrey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schmitz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Schmitz 1989</LINK>) were used to measure satisfaction, acceptability, preferred treatment and reaction to treatment.

Hoogma et al (<LINK REF="STD-Hoogma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hoogma 2005</LINK>) reported 21 injection and infusion site injuries reactions in the CSII group and Weintrob et al (<LINK REF="STD-Weintrob-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Weintrob 2004</LINK>) reported 12 minor infusion site infections, 16 blockages and 42 dislodgments. All but one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hoogma-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hoogma 2005</LINK>) either did not report serious adverse events or reported that there were no serious adverse events. Hoogma et al reported 33 serious adverse events in the CSII group and 58 in the MI group. Three studies reported drop-outs as a results of adverse events. One of these (<LINK REF="STD-DeVries-2002" TYPE="STUDY">DeVries 2002</LINK>) reported one femur fracture but did not report which group the participant was in. A second study (<LINK REF="STD-Doyle-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Doyle 2004</LINK>) reported one case of dehydration and ketosis in the MI group and the third study (<LINK REF="STD-Home-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Home 1982</LINK>) reported one undescribed event.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-11-10 13:46:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-11-10 13:46:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Twenty-three studies randomised 976 participants with type 1 diabetes to either continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple insulin injections (MI) (three or more insulin injections per day). Study duration ranged from six days to four years. Upon meta-analysis of 20 studies that reported glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (overall unclear risk of bias), there was a statistically significant difference in favour of CSII, the mean difference was -0.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.4 to -0.1, P = 0.001). Without altering the direction of effect, heterogeneity was reduced from an I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic of 50% to 34% upon removal of <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 1982</LINK>, a study with high risk of bias. Subgroup analyses for age did not significantly alter the effect estimate, however subgroup analyses for study duration showed that medium term studies (12 studies, one to six months) had a higher effect estimate (-0.3% (95% CI -0.5 to -0.1)) and long term studies (seven studies, more than six months) had a lower non-significant effect estimate (-0.2% (95% CI -0.4 to 0.1)).</P>
<P>Thirteen studies were meta-analysed for daily mean blood glucose (overall unclear risk of bias). Due to considerable heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic of 94%) a reliable pooled effect estimate could not be established. Subgroup analysis for age demonstrated that the effect estimate and heterogeneity were lower and non-significant among the two studies with participants under 18 years of age (-4 mg/dl (95% CI -14 to 7), I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic of 0%). Subgroup analysis for study duration showed that combination of the two long term studies resulted in a higher effect estimate (-21 mg/dl (95% CI -29 to -13), I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic of 0%).</P>
<P>Eleven studies reported fasting blood glucose (overall high risk of bias). Due to considerable heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic of 71%) a reliable pooled effect estimate could not be established. Subgroup analysis for age demonstrated that the effect estimate and heterogeneity were lower among the three studies with participants under 18 years of age (-8 mg/dl (95% CI -24 to 9), I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic of 0%).</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of the five studies that reported post-prandial blood glucose (overall high risk of bias) demonstrated a non-significant difference between the interventions with an effect estimate of -4 mg/dl (95% CI -11 to 2, I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic of 37%) in favour of CSII compared with MI. Subgroup analyses for age and study duration did not substantially alter the effect estimates or heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Non-severe hypoglycaemia, often defined in the studies as a blood glucose level lower than 70 mg/dl, was reported in 17 studies (overall unclear risk of bias) using different scales. It was not appropriate to conduct a meta-analysis, however the data suggested that there is no relevant benefit of one intervention over the other for reducing non-severe hypoglycaemic events. Severe hypoglycaemia, often defined in the studies as requiring assistance from another person for recovery or resulting in coma or seizure, was reported in 15 studies (overall unclear risk of bias) using different scales. Despite it not being appropriate to conduct a meta-analysis, the data suggest that CSII may be better than MI for reducing the incidence of severe hypoglycaemic events.</P>
<P>Quality of life was reported in 15 studies (overall unclear risk of bias) using different scales. It was not appropriate to conduct a meta-analysis, however many of the studies used validated questionnaires and found that CSII was preferred over MI for treatment satisfaction, quality of life and perception of better general and mental health. Often, participants randomised to CSII preferred to continue with CSII at study completion rather than return to MI.</P>
<P>There was a statistically significant decrease in daily insulin requirement measured in units (U) by nine studies (overall high risk of bias). The mean difference was -7 U (95% CI -11 to -3, P = 0.0003, I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic of 32%). There was an insufficient number of studies for subgroup analyses for age and study duration. When measured in units per kilogram (U/kg), the daily insulin requirement mean difference found among 12 studies (overall unclear risk of bias) could not be reliably pooled due to considerable heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic of 94%).</P>
<P>No significant difference was found for weight (-0.4 kg (95% CI -2 to 1.3), I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic of 0%) among eight studies (overall unclear risk of bias). Subgroup analysis for age did not significantly alter the effect estimate, however subgroup analysis for study duration showed that long term studies (seven studies) had a higher non-significant effect estimate -1.6 kg (95% CI -7.7 to 4.5, I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic of 27%).</P>
<P>Information about adverse events other than non-severe and severe hypoglycaemic events was not well reported. Most common other adverse events included ketoacidosis, dehydration and injection or infusion site complications. There were high numbers of injection or infusion site complications, suggesting that training on the use and care of these interventions is vital.</P>
<P>None of the studies reported on mortality, morbidity or costs.</P>
<P>Exploration of small study bias revealed that the effect estimates for HbA1c, daily mean blood glucose, daily insulin requirement (U/kg) and weight were higher than the effect estimates for these outcomes when all studies were included, suggesting that small study bias may be present for these outcomes.</P>
<P>Funnel plot asymmetry was found in all meta-analyses. It should be noted that there are a number of explanations for the asymmetry of a funnel plot, including true heterogeneity of effect with respect to study size, poor methodological design of small studies and publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-11-10 13:38:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>There were many gaps in the information provided by the study investigators about quality and data. Nineteen study investigators were contacted for clarification of study design, data or both, and 53% (10 study investigators) replied to our questionnaire.</P>
<P>Six cross-over studies were not adequately analysed, and did not report correlations between baseline and end-of-study data, therefore ignoring within-person variation. We reanalysed the data from these studies assuming different correlation coefficients (0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) and have discussed the '<LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>' based on the most conservative approach, assuming a correlation coefficient of 0.3. The data from these studies were also reanalysed assuming the largest standard deviation of the differences derived from the cross-over studies with adequate statistical methodology. The results from the analyses assuming different correlation coefficients and the largest standard deviation of the differences (found in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>) do not vary substantially from that presented in '<LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>' for direction of effect and heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Participants in the included studies were both adults and children with type 1 diabetes, suggesting that the results would be relevant to a broad spectrum of age groups in similar contexts. None of the studies were conducted in developing countries.</P>
<P>The mean reduction in HbA1c associated with CSII was relatively small at 0.3 percentage points, and likely to be of only borderline clinical relevance. However, the reduction frequency of severe hypoglycaemic events was of greater clinical relevance, with 8 out of 15 studies providing data on severe hypoglycaemia reporting a reduction of at least 50% in the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia. Thus, CSII is likely to be a clinically useful alternative for those individuals in whom there is concern about severe hypoglycaemia.</P>

<P>Using the approach described in '<LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK>', the body of evidence was classified as high, unclear or low risk of bias for each outcome. Risk of bias was unclear for most of the evidence, but for studies reporting the outcomes daily insulin requirement (U), fasting blood glucose and post-prandial blood glucose, the body of evidence was at high risk of bias.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-09-03 09:13:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review consists of published data only. In future, updates will attempt to identify non-published studies.</P>
<P>The selection criteria specified that MI required three or more injections per day, therefore many studies were excluded because their definition of MI was two or more injections per day. We are uncertain whether these studies would have altered the effect estimates seen in this review.</P>
<P>Many different scales and units were used to report measures of non-severe and severe hypoglycaemia and quality of life. There were insufficient studies to conduct meta-analyses for each of the scales and units, and as a result, our interpretation of the overall effects of the interventions on these outcomes is subjective and open to bias.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-11-02 16:06:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>A systematic review by Pickup et al (<LINK REF="REF-Pickup-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pickup 2002</LINK>), a health-technology assessment (HTA) report (<LINK REF="REF-HTA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">HTA 2004</LINK>) and a NICE report (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>) were in agreement with the findings of this review.</P>
<P>The systematic review by Pickup et al found that glycosylated haemoglobin A1c and mean blood glucose concentration were lower in people receiving CSII compared with those receiving MI. Blood glucose concentrations were less variable during CSII and the insulin dose required to maintain glycaemic control was reduced with CSII.</P>
<P>The HTA report found that the quality of included studies was generally poor. When compared with at least three injections per day (MI), CSII resulted in a modest but important improvement in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c and a short term reduction in insulin dose in adults with type 1 diabetes. Overall hypoglycaemic events did not differ between CSII and MI. The authors of the HTA review were unable to identify any economic evaluations comparing these two interventions, however it is estimated that the additional cost associated with using CSII over MI varies from 1091 (1208 EURO, 11/2009 exchange rate) to 1680 (1860 EURO, 11/2009 exchange rate), per annum (including the cost of the pump and consumables).</P>
<P>The NICE report focused on recommendations for when to use CSII. The report included non-randomised and randomised studies and found improvement in HbA1c and reduction in insulin dose. No difference was found for hypoglycaemic events and weight between the two interventions but patient preference slightly favoured CSII.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-11-10 13:43:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Both continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and multiple insulin injections (MI)CSII are currently used in practice. There may be benefit in using CSII over MI for improving glycaemic control and improving health-related quality of life in people with type 1 diabetes. Non-severe hypoglycaemic events do not appear to be influenced differently by either intervention.</P>
<P>It is important to note that there is insufficient evidence regarding adverse events, diabetes late complications, mortality and cost - all essential considerations in deciding which treatment to administer in practice. Until evidence is available for these outcomes we are unable to make a recommendation about whether either intervention is superior over the other in the management of glycaemic control in people with type 1 diabetes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-02 16:07:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Long term, large scale and methodologically rigorous studies are required to determine the effect of CSII and MI on outcomes such as hypoglycaemia, mortality, diabetes late complications and other adverse effects, using validated scales. Cost effectiveness data are also required to determine superiority between the two interventions.</P>

<I>It is important to note that at the design phase, the study investigators anticipated the possibility that they would have to analyse the study as a parallel RCT (rather than a cross-over) because of the demanding nature of the protocol and an expected high drop out rate. However, at the point of cross-over, there had been no drop outs so the study investigators continued with a cross-over design and stopped inclusion at 79 participants (48 participants per arm were calcluated to be required to have an 80% chance of detecting a 0.75% difference in HbA1c with an assumed SD of 1.3%). Finally, the study investigators decided that due to the drop out rate after cross-over, they would analyse the data as a parallel study using only pre cross-over data.</I>

<P>MI (ROUTE, TOTAL DOSE/DAY, FREQUENCY):An algorithm was given to adjust insulin doses. 80% of the previously given before meal human insulin dose was delivered as insulin aspart before meals and participants were advised to add the preprandial dose increment to their night time NPH insulin dose, leaving the total daily insulin dose unchanged. When the interval between two day time injections was greater than five hours, additional NPH doses were added: 40% of the previously given premeal human insulin was delivered as NHP insulin and 60% as insulin aspart for each interval exceeding five hours.

<P>CSII (ROUTE, TOTAL DOSE/DAY, FREQUENCY): The Medtronic MiniMed 508 or Paradigm 511 was used to deliver insulin aspart. The initital base dose was ~50% of the total daily insulin dose. Initial carbohydrate-to-insulin ratios and correction doses were based on their prerandomisation insulin doses or on age and pubertal stage. Participants were advised to use the prescribed carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio for all meals and snacks that were &#8805;15 g carbohydrates. Participants were contacted daily in the first two weeks for dosage adjustments. Blood glucose targets were 70 to120 mg/dl before meals and 90 to 150 mg/dl at bed time. Participants were instructed to treat two consecutive high blood glucose levels as potential catheter occulsions, and were advised to change the site and take a correction dose of aspart by injection.</P>
<P>MI (ROUTE, TOTAL DOSE/DAY, FREQUENCY): The initial dose of glargine was calculated as 80% of their total daily insulin dose of NPH or lentre according to usual practice guidelines with glargine. Initial carbohydrate-to-insulin ratios and correction doses were based on their pre-randomisation insulin doses or on age and pubertal stage.

<P>CSII (ROUTE, TOTAL DOSE/DAY, FREQUENCY): Autosyringe AS6C pump was used in 12 participants and the Nordisk infuser was used in 3 participants during the first two years. After the second year the following pumps were used: Nordisk Infuser, Autosyringe AS6C, Eugly, Graseby MS26, Nipro. Subcutaneous abdominal site of infusion. Approximately half of the daily insulin dose was given continuously and rest as boluses 15 minutes pre meals. Basal and meal doses were adjusted individually in each participant, according to glycaemic targets. Thirteen participants used four pre meal boluses per day, one used three and one used six. The Nordisk infuser, Graseby and Eugly pumps delivered regular porcine insulin at a concentration of 100 U/ml, the other pumps delivered 40 U/ml. In the auto syringe AS6C pumps, daily insulin dose was diluted to 2.8 ml by the corresponding insulin buffer. Fourteen participants received Velosulin and one participant received Actrapid.</P>
<P>MI (ROUTE, TOTAL DOSE/DAY, FREQUENCY): Regular porcine insulin was injected 15 to 30 minutes pre meal and NPH insulin was given at bed time. Fourteen participants were injected five times per day and one participant was injected four times per day. Doses were adjusted according to glycaemic targets. Patients were allowed to inject via butterfly needle for the first two years. After the second year Novopen was used for injection of regular insulin.</P>

<P>CSII (ROUTE, TOTAL DOSE/DAY, FREQUENCY): The 507C Medtronic MiniMed Pump was used to deliver Humalog adjusted according to glycaemic targets. Participants calculated before meal boluses by means of carbohydrate counting and individualised carbohydrate/insulin ratios. In participants with no history of severe hypoglycaemia, the before meal target blood glucose range was 3.9 to 8.3 mmol/L. In participants with reduced hypoglycaemic awareness, the before meal target blood glucose range was 4.4 to 8.9 mmol/L. If hypoglycaemia was recurrent, a higher range was used.</P>
<P>MI (ROUTE, TOTAL DOSE/DAY, FREQUENCY): Three injections of short acting insulin at meal times plus NPH at bed time. The dose was adjusted according to glycaemic targets. If before meal blood glucose was below 6.5 mmol/L, the dose was decreased by 10%, if blood glucose levels were consistently below 4.5 mmol/L for more than three days, the dose was decreased by 20%. Therapy was discontinued if two hours after meal blood glucose was consistently below 7.5 mmol/L.

<P>SETTING: Out-patient</P>
<P>CSII (ROUTE, TOTAL DOSE/DAY, FREQUENCY): Participants used their pre study insulin and doses were adjusted according to glycemic targets and amount of carbohydrates per meal according to 1U of insulin per 10 to 20 grams of carbohydrates. The target range for glycemia was 80 to 150 mg/dL (4.4 to 8.3 mmol/L) before meals and at midnight and 120 to 180 (6.7 to 10.2 hours) after meals. Regular insulin was delivered 20 to 30 minutes before meals and lispro was delivered immediately before meals and snacks. Participants were asked to change the infusion site every three days and under the following conditions: when blood glucose &gt; 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L) with positive urine ketones or when blood glucose was &gt; 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L) and failed to respond to a corrective insulin dose, and at any sign of insertion site infection.</P>
<P>MI (ROUTE, TOTAL DOSE/DAY, FREQUENCY): Participants used their pre study insulin and doses were adjusted according to glycaemic targets and amount of carbohydrates per meal. Participants were instructed to use a fixed caloric amount of carbohydrates for each meal and then adjust insulin according to postprandial glucose values. Insulin consisted of combined neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) and regular insulin before breakfast, regular insulin before lunch and supper and NHP at bed time.</P>

<P>It is important to note that at the design phase, the study investigators anticipated the possibility that they would have to analyse the study as a parallel RCT (rather than a cross-over) because of the demanding nature of the protocol and an expected high drop out rate. However, at the point of cross over, there had been no drop outs so the study investigators continued with a cross-over design and stopped inclusion at 79 participants (48 participants per arm were calculated to be required to have an 80% chance of detecting a 0.75% difference in HbA1c with an assumed SD of 1.3%). Finally, the study investigators decided that due to the drop out rate after cross over, they would analyse the data as a parallel study using only pre cross over data.</P>

The higher independence of fixed meal times was found to be a major advantage of both interventions in 85% of participants. Ninety five percent of participants felt the pen injector was easy to handle and only 30% reported the high frequency of injections in MI to be a disadvantage. Seventy five percent were discomforted by the CSII butterfly needle, 56% were discomforted by the infuser at home and 36% were discomforted by infuser at work.

<P>All subjects found CSII easier to administer and adjust than MI. A decrease in hypoglycaemic events and an improved feeling of well-being was suggested to contribute to this acceptance. Some of the female participants found it difficult to accommodate for the CSII pump when dressing and conducting water sports, where removal was required.</P>

<P> A multiple choice and open ended questionnaire about patients attitudes about the two interventions was administered. Results were discussed afterwards "to clarify possible misunderstandings". All nineteen participants felt more freedom and that metabolic control improved during both. Seven out of nineteen participants found CSII easier while eighteen out of nineteen found MI using the novopen easier or much easier and thirteen found that the novopen was less painful than conventional injections. Three participants felt that the number of injections inherent in MI using novopen was a problem while ten complained of the inconvenience of a bulky CSII device. Overall, twelve preferred MI with novopen, six preferred CSII and one participant was unsure.</P>

<P>All participants reported improved well being during both CSII and MI. The majority of participants (80%) wanted to continue with MI while nobody wanted to go back to pre-study conventional treatment. The higher independence of fixed meal times was found to be a major advantage of both interventions in 85% of participants. Ninety five percent of participants felt the pen injector was easy to handle and only 30% reported the high frequency of injections in MI to be a disadvantage. Seventy five percent were discomforted by the CSII butterfly needle, 56% were discomforted by the infuser at home and 36% were discomforted by infuser at work. Freedom from injections was an essential advantage by 44%.</P>

<P>Eight of ten participants preferred CSII and four of these wished to continue with it rather than go back to their pre-study twice-daily injection therapy. The CSII pump was regarded as too large and uncomfortable. No patient wished to continue with MI, regarding the midday injection as inconvenient.</P>

<P>The lifestyle and manageability questionnaire showed that those on CSII perceived more flexibility with regard to eating habits (p&lt;0.001), improvement in lifestyle flexibility and sleep patterns (p&lt;0.001) than those on MI.</P>
<P>When asked if they would recommend their current treatment: At the start of the study, 92% would have recommended MI. After the first phase of the study, 89% of those on MI recommended MI, whereas 98% of those on CSII recommended CSII (p&lt;0.01). At end of the study, those who switched back to MI after receiving CSII reported a reduction in recommendation of MI (63%). 100% of first time users of CSII recommended it.</P>

<P>All subjects found CSII easier to administer and adjust than MI. A decrease in hypoglycaemic events and an improved feeling of well-being was suggested to contribute to this acceptance. Some of the female participants found it difficult to accommodate for the CSII pump when dressing and conducting water sports, where removal was required.</P>

<P>A multiple choice and open ended questionnaire about patients attitudes about the two interventions was administered. Results were discussed afterwards "to clarify possible misunderstandings". All nineteen participants felt more freedom and that metabolic control improved during both. Seven out of nineteen participants found CSII easier while eighteen out of nineteen found MI using the novopen easier or much easier and thirteen found that the novopen was less painful than conventional injections. Three participants felt that the number of injections inherent in MI using novopen was a problem while ten complained of the inconvenience of a bulky CSII device. Overall, twelve preferred MI with novopen, six preferred CSII and one participant was unsure.</P>
