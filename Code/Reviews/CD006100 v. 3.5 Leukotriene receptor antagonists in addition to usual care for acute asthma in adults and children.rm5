The only comments that were suitable for inclusion were a note in the included studies section explaining that the doses of LTRA employed in the studies were the same as currently used. The second was a reference that needed adding - I couldn't find this and have asked the reviewer to provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was doing my pre-copyediting check and have found several points that needed attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The background required headings which I have done. the text is really to sparse to allow all four headings to be sensibly applied, but I think it's OK like it is now. I added in the references to the guidelines and deleted a couple of repetitious sentences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The objectives in the abstract must match those in the review exactly - I have made this so!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Measures of treatment effect - should the highlighted part read mean and SD?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Added in a comment (highlighted) about the usual LTRA dose in practice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC RoB assessment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please have a look at my comments in the RoB tables. This is all rather subjective I am afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;===========================================================================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liz 2/12/2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search methods lists extra searches of MEDLINE/EMBASE/CENTRAL/LILACS. Have deleted this, unless Kirsty and Richard did this? In which case, we need the full searches they used! I only supplied them with search of Register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRISMA diagram: numbers didn't add up so have amended it a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC 29.11.11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Emma,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have left you risk of Bias and a couple of discussion sections. Do you have citations to add for GINA and NAEPP? Also comment on withdrawals. Otherwise I have tidied this up and am happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Notes 28/11/2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven't checked the results in the abstract yet as I agreed to do with Kirsty Done by CJC but at present no results on IV therapy are presented in the abstract, whilst all the figures are for IV!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objectives in the abstract should match those in the main text, and they don't at the moment. I was not sure about copying the objectives form the main text because they seem to exclude people who are not &amp;quot;currently receiving inhaled bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids.&amp;quot; however, the exclusion criteria relate to anti-leuks on top of standard care - and I assume you mean standard care in the ED rather than ongoing inhalers. Done CJC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk of bias needs updating...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made a prisma diagram - please confirm you are happy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;it is not possible to find out which trial included smokers from the characteristics of included studies &amp;quot;Although smokers were included in several studies this was limited to less than ten pack years.&amp;quot; might this be helpful?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;this sentence reads strangely &amp;quot;We opted to include available data from trials under a composite outcome of requirement for further care, which includes hospitalisation, but also encompasses requirement for further therapies within the ED since study drugs failed to manage the acute episode sufficiently. &amp;quot; I think it would be better to discuss this more carefully in the measures of treatment effect - I wonder also whether it would be sensible to do a sensitivity analysis my removing the studies that only contributed admissions - might not leave you with much info.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospital admissions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think that 'consistent reduction' is too strong. Suggest saying that the change was not statistically significant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the Cates plot in fig three is wrong- Chris - please check the new info I added!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;requirement for additional care&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would it be helpful for the reader to discuss how many events were hospital admissions? Morris has less in additional care than admissions? Why? CJC to check this and take this out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think the highlighted sentence is incorrect, but not sure how to fix it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change in FEV1 - was this above the MID? I think it needs to be 150 mL or greater. this is mentioned in the discussion - should a limit be specified? This is mentioned in the discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Withdrawal - how was withdrawal measured? The withdrawal rate was high in Camargo 2003 (13%) and much lower in Camargo 2010 (1%). Do you have any comments on this? Is it worth doing ROB for incomplete outcome data and discussing withdrawals in this context?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not really acceptable to exclude trials published as abstract only. I'd be more comfortable if they were in classification pending. Then readers would be able to search for the full trial report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discuss the lack of sensitivity analysis as too few studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;suggest adding dose of study meds to table one&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;need to expand on this sentence &amp;quot;Early use, initiated by parents of wheezing infants has been shown to have some impact in reducing healthcare utilisation&amp;quot; especially as Robertson is an excluded study&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I activated the headings, but not sure how helpful that really was... but should really have something under the other headings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;how to best find out whether drugs are not licensed in the US? I checked the FDA, and montelukast and zafirlukast were only available as oral preps but this doesn't feel quite right as I did this on a search. is there another way?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;implications for research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;if the drugs are not licensed, how can you refer to standard doses?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;why is that additional research needed if the basic question has not already been answered? Perhaps to would be helpful to try LTRA at higher doses?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC July 2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Todi data on admissions added. No data on need for additional care (please check)! Medians given for MPIS and FEV1 showing no significant differences, but cannot be used in meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camargo 2010 admission and treatment failure data entered from Table 3 (does treatment failure match need for additional treatment in other studies)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris 2010 data added on admissions, treatment failure and change in FEV1 (assumed equal SD in both groups to match CI and P value). Pooling of adults and children turned off as change in FEV1 (litres) would be expected to be smaller in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have updated the description of studies to remove duplicate references to the earlier Carmargo2003b and Silverman2004b studies and the studies that have been removed on mild asthma. Details of the new studies have been added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New results section added on IV Montelukast trials and numbers corrected for oral results. Please check both!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have removed the high dose and low dose distinction for oral treatment as I do not think it adds anything now. Is this ok?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a look at the revised results section. Would you like to amend the abstract and discussion in the light of the new findings of the review? Not much support for oral LRTA but IV in adults looks promising to me? Children not really enough data yet to know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Characteristics of the new studies also need to be updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Editing Full review May 25th 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for this review. It is coming on well but will need more thought in some areas before we can send it out for peer review. Please see my comments below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Where does the Camargo FEV1 in litres come from? The paper reports change in % predicted FEV1? why not use the % figures and then this could be combined with Nelson. We do not usually report a pooled result from a single study in the abstract, as it is not a pooled result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Is it sensible to combine studies on oral and IV treatment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Matsunga is post emergency room treatment (as well as no steroids).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.When doing subgroup analyses #1.3 and #1.4, you can use the full numbers for the placebo arms in Silverman and Camargo (rather than the halved numbers which are needed when both active treatment arms are in the same analysis). This will stop you comparing the high dose with the low dose arms, but this would be better done by directly entering the hi and lo dose data as treatment and controls. Would you like to do this? It is not valid to comment in the discussion on the possible benefits of higher dose Rx without carrying out this analysis, in my view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. It would be good to find and replace will be with were as there are some places where the future tense from the protocol is still present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. As the studies were in acute asthma I guess there were not too many drop outs but at present this is missing as a domain of risk of bias?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. I am concerned about the clinically heterogeneity of the treatments. I am not sure that Matsunga should be pooled with the other studies as this trial was on Rx AFTER the acute phase had been treated. I think you should sub-group by type, dose and delivery of the LRTA and then pool those that you think are sufficiently similar (you will need to justify this for IV and oral use - does IV have a faster onset of action for example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. The minimally important clinically increase in FEV1 needs to be considered. I think this is usually 150mls and at present the whole reported confidence interval is less than this so you will have to justify the clinical relevance of this difference even if it is statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. Liz has pointed out that there are no excluded studies listed? Why not? &amp;#160;Search strategy: The section about the Register searches is fine. Have changed the search date to June 2009. The authors say they have searched additional databases - did they actually do this? If so, then the search strategy they used for each database needs to be listed in the appendices. If they didn't then that section can just be deleted. The Airways Group (i.e. Liz &amp;amp; Susan!) only provided searches of the Airways Register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;______________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Edit May 9&lt;br&gt;This looks fine now. Minor change made in red to make clear that this review is about studies that randomise acute asthma to LRTA or placebo. I do not think that you will find anything randomising to just standard care, and I would not regard the results as very reliable if you did find anything.&lt;br&gt;This can go forward for peer review and submission.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Richard Chavasse wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirsty, Toby,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for not getting round to this sooner - too much work etc etc...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirsty sent me a copy of the RTF document in March with comments from the editors which were not included in the document sent by Toby more recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My feelings would be:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go with the changes suggested except:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not add sentence in 'Types of participants' regarding previous reversibility. This would get too complicated and not always paediatric friendly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies should be placebo controlled in this instance - we are not comparing LTRA with steroid or other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would leave in severity sub group analysis as we may find evidence only for use in Moderate asthma not severe / life threatening and would need to be clear for future recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy to look at dose and type of LTRA. I suspect the type will be limited to 2 or 3, dose more variable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes aside I would be happy to proceed -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies again for tardiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC March 1 2006&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Title: Leucotriene Receptor Antagonists (LTRA) is the usual terminology. I have changed the title to reflect this to &amp;quot;Leucotriene Receptor Antagonists in addition...&amp;quot; Is this OK?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewers Contributions: Fine KG changed to KW (was this a former surname?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background: Could you add some information about the speed of onset of oral or IV LRTA treatment. Presumably it acts fast enough to potentially alter hospital admission rates?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: The problem is in the details of usual care. &amp;quot;To determine if the addition of an anti-leukotriene produces a beneficial effect in children and adults with acute asthma who are already receiving inhaled bronchodilators and/or corticosteroids.&amp;quot; Already receiving could relate to their previous treatment or the treatment of acute asthma so this needs to be made clearer please. Are the corticosteroids inhaled or systemic? Already implies a gap between the treatment with bronchodilators and LRTA, do you mean this?&lt;br&gt;I have deleted the benefits of interest from this section as it is duplicated in the outcome measures below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants: You need to define the grounds for diagnosis of acute asthma (especially in the children under 5, how will you tell that they are not suffering viral wheeze?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interventions: LRTA compared to what ? I would strongly encourage including trials with a placebo comparison arm. This is not currently specified. Leave the subgroups to the methods section and if you are happy to include any LRTA by any route then just state such. I am puzzled by the suggestion that you will just include the lower dose if two arms are used with different doses (eg Silverman). I would not recommend this if your review is about all doses, types and administration routes then it is unjustified to exclude higher dose arm data. Also the sentence on usual care needs fine tuning. Current best care would be with inhaled beta-2 agonists titrated to patient response at short intervals. I have no idea what is meant by the final sentence about other co-interventions being monitored (by whom and in what way). You could say that other interventions are allowed but should be the same in the the LRTA and placebo arms? I think co-interventions will need to be part of your sub-group analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: &amp;quot;The number needed to treat (NNT) will be derived to help clarify the degree of benefit for a range of baseline rates and will be calculated from the pooled risk difference (RD). &amp;quot; This is one of my research interests and I would not do this as you are not expecting all the studies to have the same baseline admission rate and the pooled risk difference will be swayed the baseline rate in the largest study. I would commend using the pooled OR and applying it to a specified baseline admission rate (see www.nntonline.net and help file for Visual Rx). This is the standard group approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that you will find severity of exacerbation very difficult to use as a sub-group as I suspect it will vary considerably within studies, and you will not be using individual patient data for the review. I would suggest co-interventions as a more appropriate sub-group as LRTA may work in a different way when added to different usual care regimens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have moved ITT down to sensitivity analysis (as it is a part of quality) and type of LRTA up to predefined subgroups. Adding an extra set of clinical subgroups does not seem necessary to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: Meaning of usual care (or optimum care). If bronchodilators are only given hourly (eg Silverman) then I would not regard this as optimal care in 2006! This will need care when you come to write up the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action : This is a good topic for a review. Toby could you send this back to the authors to consider the above before we get the protocol peer reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;OK'd by Brian 220206&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;07/02/2006&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the ammendments to the protocol:-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having discussed the suggestions with Richard, we agree with most of the ammendments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However,we do not wish to change the subgroup analysis. We would prefer to keep the age sub-groups. Although papers and numbers may be small at present, we feel it is important to the paediatric population and useful for guideline development. It may become more important within later revisions as further papers become available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, we would like to keep to the BTS groups for severity, these incorporate PEF in addition to RR/HR/sats etc. These are the parameters we use in practice in both paediatrics and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope that these are ok. Look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirsty&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2012-04-02 11:00:50 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="LKT-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.1.4" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="3.5">

<TITLE MODIFIED="2012-03-12 10:26:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">Does adding antileukotriene agents to usual care when people are suffering an asthma attack in the emergency department help?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-04-02 10:58:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Current recommended treatment in the emergency department for people experiencing an asthma attack is beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, systemic corticosteroids and oxygen. Unfortunately, some people do not get better with these standard treatments and so there is interest in developing additional treatments which will help people experiencing an asthma attack. One such treatment is antileukotrienes, which are available in tablet form to be taken orally; this drug is also made in injection form, however the intravenous form is not marketed and therefore not available.</P>
<P>This review considers the effect of antileukotriene agents, (normally used as add-on preventer therapy in chronic asthma), when used during acute asthma treated in emergency settings. We identified eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on 1470 adults and 470 children addressing this question, and in most of these studies participants were also given courses of corticosteroids at the time of treatment. We did not find a significant difference in the likelihood of being admitted to hospital between people treated with oral antileukotrienes and placebo or usual care. There was no significant difference in participants requiring additional care (including hospital admission or other treatment options) at the end of the studies between treatment and control groups. There was an improvement in lung function in people taking antileukotrienes compared to those on placebo. More research in this area is required, and the low number of studies recruiting children does not enable us to provide evidence on what effects this class of drugs has in children.</P>
<P>There were two trials that randomised 772 adults and 276 children to receive intravenous antileukotrienes and there was no statistically significant difference in hospital admissions, however there was an improvement in lung function in adults on antileukotrienes.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-03-12 10:26:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Acute asthma presentation in the emergency setting frequently leads to hospital admission. Currently available treatment options include corticosteroid therapy, beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and oxygen. Antileukotriene agents are beneficial in chronic asthma as additional therapy to inhaled steroids. Their value when used orally or intravenously in the acute setting requires evaluation.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-03-12 10:26:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>To determine if the addition of a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) produces a beneficial effect in children and adults with acute asthma who are currently receiving inhaled bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-03-12 10:34:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group's Specialised Register of trials with predefined terms. Searches are current to February 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-03-12 10:26:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We included randomised trials comparing antileukotrienes and standard acute asthma care versus placebo and standard care in people with acute asthma of any age. We considered any dose and method of delivery of the leukotriene agent.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-03-12 10:26:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion in the review and extracted data. We then checked data and resolved disagreements by discussion. We contacted study authors where necessary to provide additional information and data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-04-02 10:58:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Eight trials, generating 10 treatment-control comparisons, that recruited 1470 adults and 470 children met the entry criteria. These studies were of mixed quality, and there was heterogeneity in the severity of asthma exacerbation.</P>
<P>For oral treatment, there was no significant difference in hospital admission between LTRAs and control in three trials on 194 children (risk ratio (RR) 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 3.52). Using a broader composite outcome which measured requirement for additional care there was no significant difference between treatments (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.28). Results demonstrated some indication of improvement in lung function with a significant difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1)</SUB> favouring LTRAs in two trials on 641 adults (mean difference (MD) 0.08; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.14). There were insufficient data to assess this outcome in children. The most common adverse event described was headache; however, there was no significant difference between LTRAs and control (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.22 to 2.99). Due to insufficient numbers, we were unable to conduct a subgroup analysis based on age.</P>
<P>The combined results of two trials of intravenous treatment in 772 adults and one trial in 276 children demonstrated a reduction in the risk of hospital admission which was not quite statistically significant (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.01). There was a statistically significant small difference in FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>in the adult studies (MD 0.12; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.17), but not in the single trial in children (MD 0.01; 95% CI -0.06 to 0.08).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-03-12 10:26:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Presently, the available evidence does not support routine use of oral LTRAs in acute asthma. Further studies are required to assess whether intravenous treatment can reduce the risk of hospital admission, and what the most appropriate dose regimen is. Additional research is also needed into safety and efficacy of additional doses for those on maintenance therapy, and larger paediatric trials are required to allow subgroup analysis. Prolonged studies would be required to establish other health economic outcomes in admitted patients.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-03-12 10:26:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Acute asthma consistently ranks among the most frequent causes of visits to the emergency department, and hospital admission in both children and adults.</P>
<P>Many patients with acute asthma exacerbations do not respond fully to standard therapy of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, systemic corticosteroids and oxygen. Therefore alternative therapeutic avenues need to be explored. The roles of adjunctive therapies such as systemic aminophylline (<LINK REF="REF-Parameswaran-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parameswaran 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitra-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitra 2005</LINK>), systemic beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Travers-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Travers 2001</LINK>) and inhaled magnesium sulfate (<LINK REF="REF-Blitz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blitz 2005</LINK>) remain unclear; however, systemic magnesium (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2000</LINK>) and inhaled anticholinergic (<LINK REF="REF-Stoodley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoodley 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Plotnick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plotnick 2000</LINK>) agents have been shown to be effective. The long-term, anti-inflammatory effects of leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) in chronic asthma are well established, and have been found to have a good safety profile (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2004</LINK>). Antileukotriene agents reach peak serum concentrations within three hours; the onset of action is fast and sustained (<LINK REF="REF-Dockhorn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dockhorn 2000</LINK>). In acute asthma, the leukotriene pathways are activated, as evidenced by increased plasma and urinary leukotrienes (<LINK REF="REF-Sampson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 1995</LINK>). More recently, antileukotriene agents have been shown in animal models of acute asthma to have anti-inflammatory effects through suppression of T-helper cytokines (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-03-27 17:47:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Since the initial publication of the British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (<LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN</LINK>) asthma guidelines, several studies have been published evaluating the efficacy of LTRAs in acute asthma. The most recent revisions of both the <LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN</LINK>) asthma guidelines, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program expert panel report (<LINK REF="REF-NAEPP-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP 2007</LINK>) and the Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2008</LINK>) conclude insufficient evidence to make a recommendation about the use of LTRAs. However, to date there has been no published systematic review of the evidence.</P>
<P>LTRAs can be administered in acute asthma by the oral or the intravenous route, but intravenous administration is not currently licensed.</P>

<P>For dichotomous variables, we expressed both individual and pooled statistics as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we reported individual data as mean differences (MDs) and pooled the data using the MD where the scales reported were identical or where the conversion factor was known (e.g. FEV<SUB>1</SUB>). We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) where different metrics were used to measure outcome and there was no known conversion factor (e.g. symptoms). We reported MDs and SMDs with 95% CIs.</P>

<P>The trials recruited 1470 adults and adolescents above the age of 12 years and 470 children between the age of 2 and 12 years (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Four trials were conducted in children (<LINK REF="STD-Harmanci-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Harmanci 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Todi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Todi 2010</LINK>). No study included children less than two years. All the participants in the studies had been recruited from emergency treatment settings. Participants had a history of asthma for more than one year in the trials carried out in adults, however the trials in children had different inclusion criteria. One trial carried out in children aged between two and five years required only six months asthma history (<LINK REF="STD-Harmanci-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Harmanci 2006</LINK>), a second trial in children 6 to 14 years allowed children with at least one previous episode of asthma-like symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Morris-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2010</LINK>) and a third trial included children aged 5 to 15 years seeking treatment for acute moderate to severe asthma in paediatric services of a tertiary hospital in north India (<LINK REF="STD-Todi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Todi 2010</LINK>). Patients were excluded where there were other possible clinical explanations for dyspnoea including pneumonia, congestive cardiac failure, cystic fibrosis and chronic lung disease of prematurity.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Oral montelukast or zafirlukast in addition to usual care</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Hospitalisation (primary outcome)</HEADING>
<P>There was no significant difference between oral leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) and control in the risk of admission to hospital in three studies including 194 children comparing oral montelukast to control in addition to usual care for acute asthma (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.21 to 3.52; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Requirement for additional care</HEADING>
<P>A broader composite outcome which measured the requirement of other forms of additional care at the end of the study protocol was also not significantly different between treatments (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.28; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). One study on 641 adults given zafirlukast and one study on 50 children given oral montelukast provided data for this analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Lung function</HEADING>
<P>There was a significant difference in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> favouring LTRAs in the combined results of a single study on 641 adults on different doses of zafirlukast (MD 0.08; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.14; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Silverman-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 2004a</LINK> 20 mg of zafirlukast was administered orally and in <LINK REF="STD-Silverman-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 2004b</LINK> the dose was 160 mg.</P>
<P>Change in predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> did not show a significant effect of LTRAs in a single study of montelukast in 26 children (MD -3.10; 95% CI -12.70 to 6.50; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pulmonary index scores</HEADING>
<P>Lung function tests are less reliable in young children, especially during acute exacerbation. Therefore one study (<LINK REF="STD-Harmanci-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Harmanci 2006</LINK>) used the pulmonary index score based on clinical observation (on 50 children); there was a statistically significant change in pulmonary index score favouring children on LTRAs compared with placebo in this study (MD -1.2; 95% CI -1.37 to -1.03; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Respiratory rate</HEADING>
<P>The same study (<LINK REF="STD-Harmanci-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Harmanci 2006</LINK>), reported a small but statistically significant difference in respiratory rate (MD -4.60; 95% CI -6.84 to -2.36; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist usage</HEADING>
<P>A single study in 45 adults (<LINK REF="STD-Cylly-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cylly 2003</LINK>), showed a small but statistically significant reduction in the number of rescue beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist administrations with additional oral montelukast (MD -0.80; 95% CI -1.47 to -0.13; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Symptom scores</HEADING>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse effects and withdrawals</HEADING>
<P>The most commonly described adverse event with LTRAs is headache; however, there was no significant difference between LTRAs and control (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.22 to 2.99, N = 641 adults in a single study; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>) with respect to the occurrence of headache.

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Relapse</HEADING>
<P>Only one study on 546 adults and one study on 22 children reported relapse data at the end of the follow-up period; these studies did not demonstrate a significant difference between LTRAs and controls (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.07; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Hospitalisation (primary outcome)</HEADING>
<P>Three studies on 772 adults and one study on 276 children reported hospital admission using intravenous montelukast. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of hospital admissions in adults (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.06) or children (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.23). The pooled result from all age-groups approached statistical significance (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.01; see <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Requirement for additional care</HEADING>
<P>Three studies on 772 adults contributed data to this outcome. There was no statistically significant difference in the requirement for additional treatment in these trials (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.13; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (litres)</HEADING>
<P>There was a significant benefit in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> in the three studies with results from 764 adults (MD 0.12; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.17), but not in the study in 276 children (MD 0.01; 95% CI -0.06 to 0.08), see <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>. We did not combine the results from the adult and children studies as children have lower expected FEV<SUB>1</SUB> than adults, and a formal test for differences between adults and children was not performed.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Withdrawal from study</HEADING>
<P>The risk of withdrawal was significantly lower for intravenous montelukast in the adult studies (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.97), but the study in children had much wider CIs (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.31 to 4.12; <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). There was no significant difference between the results from adults and children (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 0.97, degrees of freedom (df) = 1 (P = 0.32), I² = 0%).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-04-02 10:58:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>This systematic review examined all of the available evidence for the effectiveness of adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) to standard treatment for the management of acute asthma in adults and children in the emergency department. Overall, we included 10 unique studies involving 1940 participants in this review. The studies differed in drug preparation and dose, route of administration, symptom severity as well as outcome measurements. The pooled results of oral treatment (currently the only licensed route of administration in the UK), failed to demonstrate a statistically significant or clinically important reduction in need for hospital admission in children. There was a statistically but not clinically significant difference in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> in the adult studies. There was some indication of an improvement in symptoms and reduction in additional treatment. The studies do not provide any information on impact on length of hospital stay.</P>
<P>The effect of initial disease severity may also be an important factor in determining benefit. The study populations in this review display a wide variation in presenting severity. Early use, initiated by parents of wheezing infants has been shown to have some impact in reducing healthcare utilisation (<LINK REF="STD-Robertson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 2007</LINK>). Whilst there appeared to be no significant effect on hospitalisation in the more severe group of patients, other health economic outcomes, including length of stay, clinical dependency scores and morbidity related to additional treatments (intravenous bronchodilators) may also be relevant given the apparent effect on pulmonary function and symptom scores. This effect would need to be addressed in longer studies with adequate power to look at these specific outcomes.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-03-12 10:26:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The more recent studies have included children and adults on maintenance LTRAs. With our increasing use of regular LTRAs in patients requiring preventative therapy for asthma, specific studies will be required to look at whether additional or higher doses in the acute setting are beneficial and safe in this group. Patients who seem to benefit from LTRAs for the management of their persistent symptoms may be the patients who would be most likely to respond to LTRAs in the acute setting.</P>
<P>It would not be advisable to apply the results of trials on intravenous administration of LTRAs in acute asthma to clinical practice, where this route of administration is not currently licensed.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-03-12 10:26:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The studies overall, were of good methodological quality. Most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-03-12 10:26:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We attempted to minimise bias by undertaking comprehensive literature searches and handsearching references from review articles. Furthermore we screened abstracts and full-text documents, and extracted and entered data in duplicate.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-03-12 10:26:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Two studies explored a dose-response relationship; comparing standard and higher than standard dose, there was no clear dose-related response. One large study demonstrated a possible reduction in symptom scores with a high dose strategy of 160 mg zafirlukast compared to 20 mg zafirlukast (<LINK REF="STD-Silverman-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Silverman 2004a</LINK>). The second smaller study (<LINK REF="STD-Camargo-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Camargo 2003a</LINK>) did not show a difference in change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> between doses of 7 mg and 14 mg, and in the group's subsequent paper, the lower dose intravenous regime of 7 mg was used (<LINK REF="STD-Camargo-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Camargo 2010</LINK>). It is therefore possible that higher than licensed doses, if safe, may provide better outcomes as suggested in other studies (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2004</LINK>) and further research on this question seems warranted.</P>

<P>This systematic review has highlighted the need for additional high quality studies to address several unanswered questions.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Are higher than standard doses of oral LTRAs, and intravenous use of LTRAs safe in adults and children in the acute setting?</LI>
<LI>Do additional doses of LTRAs in patients with acute asthma who are already receiving long-term LTRA therapy (i.e. those with a documented response to this treatment modality) offer additional benefits?</LI>
<LI>Do LTRAs used in the acute setting have an impact on health economic and clinical outcomes, including length of hospital stay, dependency scores and morbidity?</LI>
<LI>Do LTRAs started early in an exacerbation of asthma at home or in primary care, alongside beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, reduce healthcare utilisation in adults and children?</LI>
<LI>Is there a difference in response to LTRAs in children with different phenotypes of acute wheeze (multi-trigger wheeze, episodic viral associated wheeze)?</LI>
