<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Cuts (lacerations) often need to be closed to ensure proper healing, and prevent infection or unattractive scarring. Wounds may be closed with stitches (sutures), staples, tapes or glue (tissue adhesive). The review found that glue is an excellent substitute for stitches, staples or tapes to close simple cuts. Glue causes less pain, is quicker and needs no follow up for removal. A slightly higher number of cuts may break open (dehisce) after being glued, compared to cuts closed with stitches, staples or tapes. Though there are a few different types of glue available, no one glue seems to be superior.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Tissue adhesives have been used for many years to close simple lacerations as an alternative to standard wound closure (sutures, staples, adhesive strips). Potential advantages over standard wound closure include ease of use, decrease in pain, time to apply and not requiring a follow-up visit for removal. Whilst studies have compared tissue adhesives with standard wound closure to determine the cosmetic outcome and other secondary outcomes no systematic review was previously available, so that no generalizable, definitive answers about the effectiveness of tissue adhesives existed.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To summarize the best available evidence for the effects of tissue adhesives on the healing of traumatic lacerations in children and adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Trials Register (October 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2007), MEDLINE (1950 to October Week 1 2007), EMBASE (1980 to 2007 Week 41), CINAHL (1982 to October Week 2 2007), Web of Science - Science Citation Index (1975 to April 29, 2007), seven clinical trial registries, and reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing tissue adhesives with standard wound closure or one tissue adhesive compared with another tissue adhesive for acute, linear, low tension, traumatic lacerations in an emergency or primary care setting.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Information on adverse effects was collected from the trials. Outcomes of cosmesis (subgroups of age, wound location and need for deep sutures), pain, procedure time, ease of use, and complications were analysed separately for two comparisons: 1) tissue adhesive compared with standard wound closure; and 2) tissue adhesive compared with another tissue adhesive.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirteen studies were included in this review. Eleven studies compared a tissue adhesive with standard wound closure. No significant difference was found for cosmesis at any time point examined, using either Cosmetic Visual Analogue Scale (CVAS) or Wound Evaluation Score (WES). Pain scores (Parent VAS weighted mean difference (WMD) -13.4 mm; 95% CI -20.0 to -6.9) and procedure time (WMD -4.7 minutes; 95% CI -7.2 to -2.1) significantly favoured tissue adhesives. Only one study reported on ease of use, favouring standard wound closure. Small but statistically significant risk differences were found for dehiscence (favouring standard wound care, Number Needed to Harm (NNH) 40; 95% CI 20 to 1168) and erythema (favouring tissue adhesive, NNH 10; 95% CI 5 to 239). Other complications were not significantly different between treatment groups.</P>
<P>Two studies compared tissue adhesives. One study compared two different tissue adhesives, butylcyanoacrylate with octylcyanoacrylate, for pediatric facial lacerations and found no significant difference for cosmesis, pain, procedure time, or complications. Another study compared two different formulations (viscosities) of octylcyanoacrylate to assess the incidence of product migration as a proxy for complications of application; the high-viscosity product migrated on significantly fewer participants.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Tissue adhesives are an acceptable alternative to standard wound closure for repairing simple traumatic lacerations. They offer the benefit of decreased procedure time and less pain, when compared to standard wound closure. A small but statistically significant increased rate of dehiscence with tissue adhesives is observed.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-05 13:02:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Traumatic wounds, including lacerations, are one of the most common reasons for people presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) (<LINK REF="REF-Sibert-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibert 1981</LINK>). The management of these lacerations involves cleaning the wound and then re-approximating the wound edges until natural healing occurs. Without proper closure, the patient is at increased risk of infection and excessive scar formation, which results in a poor cosmetic outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Hollander-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollander 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>Traditionally, approximation of these lacerations has been accomplished using sutures, which either dissolve after a number of days, or require another visit for removal. Insertion of sutures requires a local anaesthetic agent to reduce the pain associated with the procedure. Infiltration of the wound with a local anaesthetic can be quite painful. Small children with lacerations pose further challenges, as they may require sedation to reduce pain, emotional distress and movement during the procedure. This adds time and complexity to the patient's ED visit (<LINK REF="STD-Osmond-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Osmond 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osmond-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osmond 2000</LINK>). Other standard wound closure (SWC) options include staples and adhesive strips. </P>
<P>For many years, tissue adhesive compounds (glue) made from cyanoacrylates have been available to close simple lacerations. These compounds are supplied as liquid monomers that quickly form a strong bond over the approximated wound. This keeps the edges together until healing has occurred. Practitioners experienced in suturing find them quick and easy to use following a brief orientation to the product and its limitations. They are relatively painless for the patient and provide an excellent cosmetic outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Osmond-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Osmond 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osmond-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osmond 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sells-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sells 1999</LINK>). No follow-up appointment for suture removal is required and one study has shown them to be a cost-effective alternative to sutures (<LINK REF="REF-Osmond-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osmond 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>There is an increasing amount of literature supporting the use of tissue adhesives for various minor lacerations (<LINK REF="REF-Applebaum-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Applebaum 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barnett-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barnett 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruns-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bruns 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elmasalme-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elmasalme 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goktas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Goktas 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Holger 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattick-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Mattick 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mizrahi-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mizrahi 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morton-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morton 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osmond-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Osmond 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perron-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perron 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saxena-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Saxena 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zempsky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zempsky 2001</LINK>). Initially, the evidence was in the form of successful case series that lacked controls or blinded outcome assessments. A number of randomised controlled trials have since been reported which advocate tissue adhesives in their respective study populations. However, the evidence has not been summarised and interpreted in a systematic and rigorous review.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing tissue adhesives with standard wound closure (i.e., sutures, staples, adhesive strips) or one tissue adhesive compared with another tissue adhesive.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We considered studies that recruited people of any age in an ED, outpatient clinic, walk-in clinic or other primary care setting. The wounds had to be acute, linear lacerations, less than 12 hours old, resulting from blunt or sharp trauma, excluding stellate lacerations, puncture wounds, and mammalian bites. Wounds of any length, width and depth were included, provided that the edges could be approximated with minimal tension after deep sutures were placed, if required. Also excluded were studies of wounds which were infected, heavily contaminated or devitalized, those crossing joints or mucocutaneous junctions, those in hair-bearing areas, and those in people with keloid formation or chronic illness which could impair healing (e.g., peripheral vascular disease, diabetes). </P>
<P>We did not consider any trials that evaluated tissue adhesives in the operating room for closure of surgical incisions (see <LINK REF="REF-Coulthard-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulthard 2004</LINK> for data on surgical incisions), or trials dealing with other types of wounds (e.g., ulcers, skin grafts, dental repair).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We considered studies in which participants were randomised to closure of their laceration by one of two or more methods, one of which was a tissue adhesive. The comparison arms were either another form of skin closure (i.e., sutures, staples, adhesive strips) or a second tissue adhesive.</P>

Next, concealment of allocation was assessed as adequate, inadequate or unclear using the methodology described by <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion.</P>

<P>Medians were substituted for means where means were not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Bruns-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bruns 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattick-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Mattick 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osmond-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Osmond 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 1997</LINK>). Where there were two observers rating cosmetic wound appearances (CVAS), their summary measures were pooled (<LINK REF="STD-Bruns-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bruns 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Holger 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zempsky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zempsky 2001</LINK>). Where standard deviations or any variations thereof (e.g., standard error, variance) were not reported, P values from t-tests were inverted to obtain standard deviations (<LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1998a</LINK>). If not stated, p-values were assumed to be two-sided. Upper bound p-values were also inverted giving a conservative estimate in some cases (<LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1998a</LINK>). Non-parametric confidence intervals (CI) were used to obtain standard deviations where not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Bruns-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bruns 1998</LINK>). Therein a robustness to the 'normality' assumption was assumed. In cases where only p-values from non-parametric tests were reported, an average of the standard deviations from other trials with that particular outcome was substituted (<LINK REF="STD-Mattick-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Mattick 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two comparisons were established a priori for separate analyses: (1) tissue adhesive compared with standard wound closure (SWC); and (2) tissue adhesive compared with tissue adhesive. Continuous data (i.e., CVAS, pain scores, time to complete, ease of the procedure) were converted to a mean difference and an overall weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was calculated. The Wound Evaluation Score (WES) was reported as a dichotomous outcome in each study (i.e., optimal or suboptimal cosmesis), and thus we expressed it as a relative risk (RR) and a pooled relative risk with 95% CI. Complications (i.e., dehiscence, infection, erythema, delayed closure, discharge, tissue adhesive migration) were presented as risk differences (RD); since some studies had zero events in both treatment groups a relative risk could not be calculated. The number needed to harm (NNH) was also calculated for further clarification where the results were significant. The baseline SWC risks were combined using the same weights used in the corresponding meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Almost all pain VAS and time to complete the procedure data were skewed with a right tail (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>), however, almost all treatment groups were sufficiently large to meet the requirements of the central limit theorem. Thus, the distribution of the means, not the singular data points, were approximately normal and we could use the WMD to summarize this data.</P>
<P>Results for tissue adhesives compared with standard wound closure were calculated using random effects models (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>), since two tissue adhesives were used (e.g., butylcyanoacrylate (Histoacryl TM), octylcyanoacrylate (Dermabond TM)) and treatments varied for standard wound closures (e.g., suturing, staples, adhesive strips). Statistical heterogeneity was quantified using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic indicates the per cent variability due to between study variability as opposed to within study variability. An I<SUP>2</SUP> greater than 50% may be considered large. Possible sources of heterogeneity were explored by subgroup and sensitivity analyses using the primary outcomes at the most popular time point (i.e., CVAS at one to three months and WES at one to three months). Subgroup analyses examined the effect of different age groups (pediatric, less than 18 years versus adult, greater than or equal to 18 years), wound location (face versus body), type of tissue adhesive, and methodological quality criteria (components of the Jadad score, funding source) using a subgroup chi squared test (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>). Subgroups of extent of laceration (lacerations requiring deep sutures versus not) and allocation concealment could not be analysed due to insufficient data. Sensitivity analyses assessed for the choice of statistical model (i.e., fixed-effect versus random-effects model).</P>
<P>Results for the tissue adhesive compared with another tissue adhesive comparisons were calculated using fixed-effect models, since there was only one study included for each unique pair of tissue adhesives compared.</P>

<P>Using the various search strategies, we identified more than 850 unique articles. From these, 45 were selected as potentially relevant, including one abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Symeonoglou-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Symeonoglou 1998</LINK>) only identified through the Cochrane Wounds Group trials register, and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Stuart-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stuart 1999</LINK>) only identified through the clinical trials registers. No additional articles were identified by citation searches, or through correspondence with authors and tissue adhesive manufacturers.</P>
<P>Two authors (KF and KR) assessed the abstracts, and full text when available, of the 45 potential articles for relevance using a standard inclusion/exclusion form. Unanimous agreement was attained on all relevance decisions. Fifteen unique studies were selected, represented by 25 of the 45 articles. Six of the unique studies were represented by more than one identified publication, due to the presence of abstracts, separate reporting of early and late cosmetic outcomes, or analysis of the results sub grouped by other variables. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Zempsky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zempsky 2001</LINK>) was initially represented by the interim results published in abstract format only; the completed results have now been published and these data have been updated.</P>
<P>Three studies, despite meeting inclusion for relevance, have been subsequently excluded. The first study (<LINK REF="STD-Singer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2002</LINK>), a multi-centre trial that included both traumatic lacerations and operative wounds, reported combined results for both populations. Four of the 10 sites within the multi-centre trial dealt with lacerations. Two of these sites have independently reported their results and are included in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Bruns-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bruns 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 1998</LINK>). Multiple attempts to obtain the unpublished data from the remaining two sites have been unsuccessful. The second excluded study (<LINK REF="STD-Symeonoglou-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Symeonoglou 1998</LINK>) was an abstract of a RCT evaluating sutures and two tissue adhesives for closure of facial lacerations. No results were presented in the abstract, no subsequent publication of results has been found, and multiple attempts to contact the authors have been unsuccessful. The last study (<LINK REF="STD-Stuart-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Stuart 1999</LINK>) was identified through a clinical trials register. Attempts to contact the investigator for the status of the study have been unsuccessful and no published results have been found.</P>

Eleven studies compared a tissue adhesive with standard wound closure, five with butylcyanoacrylate (Histoacryl TM)(<LINK REF="STD-Barnett-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barnett 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goktas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Goktas 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 1997</LINK>) and six with octylcyanoacrylate (Dermabond TM) (<LINK REF="STD-Bruns-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bruns 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Holger 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattick-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Mattick 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zempsky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zempsky 2001</LINK>). The standard wound closure method was sutures in seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barnett-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barnett 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goktas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Goktas 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Holger 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 1997</LINK>), adhesive strips in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Zempsky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zempsky 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattick-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Mattick 2002a</LINK>), and a mixture of closure methods in the remaining two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bruns-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bruns 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 1998</LINK>), though the majority of participants received sutures. In one of the studies comparing tissue adhesive with sutures (<LINK REF="STD-Holger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Holger 2004</LINK>), the tissue adhesive was actually compared with two types of suture (i.e., absorbable and non-absorbable) in a three-arm trial; additional data from the author allowed us to combine these two standard wound closure arms.</P>
<P>Seven of the 11 studies were limited to children (<LINK REF="STD-Barnett-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barnett 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruns-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bruns 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Holger 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattick-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Mattick 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zempsky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zempsky 2001</LINK>), two were limited to adults (<LINK REF="STD-Goktas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Goktas 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1998a</LINK>), and the remaining two studies included all ages (<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 1998</LINK>). Three of the pediatric studies (<LINK REF="STD-Holger-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Holger 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zempsky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zempsky 2001</LINK>) and one of the studies without age restriction (<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1979</LINK>) were limited to facial lacerations. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barnett-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barnett 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattick-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Mattick 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1979</LINK>) excluded deep suture lacerations. The remaining studies did not stratify their results by extent of laceration.</P>
<P>Two studies compared two tissue adhesives. The first study (<LINK REF="STD-Osmond-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Osmond 1999a</LINK>) compared butylcyanoacrylate and octylcyanoacrylate for the closure of pediatric facial lacerations not requiring deep sutures. The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>) compared high-viscosity octylcyanoacrylate and low-viscosity (standard) octylcyanoacrylate for the closure of any laceration amenable to tissue adhesive closure in children and adults.</P>
<P>Two studies allowed participants with more than one laceration to be enrolled; each laceration was assessed independently. The first study (<LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1998a</LINK>) randomised each laceration independently, while the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Bruns-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bruns 1998</LINK>) randomised the participant and all lacerations were assigned to that treatment arm. This non-independence occurred in only two participants, each with two lacerations, and would not affect the results significantly. All other studies randomised and assessed one laceration per participant.</P>
<P>All studies were published in English, except <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1979</LINK> (Danish). All studies were conducted in an ED setting.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Cosmesis was the primary outcome reported by all selected studies except one (<LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>). Most researchers used the Cosmetic Visual Analogue Scale, the Wound Evaluation Score, or a combination of these two measures of cosmesis. The timing for cosmesis assessments varied somewhat between studies, but three distinct time periods became evident allowing grouping: (1) suture/staple removal and complication follow up at 5 to 14 days; (2) early healing at 1 to 3 months; and (3) late healing at 9 to 12 months. Early cosmesis scores (7 to 14 days) have been shown to poorly correlate with late scores (6 to 9 months) (<LINK REF="REF-Hollander-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollander 1995b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Cosmetic Visual Analogue Scale (CVAS) is a 100 mm line, with zero being "worst scar imaginable" and 100 being the "best scar imaginable". A blinded assessor, usually a plastic surgeon, rates the appearance of each laceration, either in person or from a standardized photograph, by placing a mark along the line. The CVAS was developed to assess laceration repairs in clinical trials. It has been shown to be a reliable and valid outcome measure of long-term cosmesis with excellent intra- and inter-rater agreement. A measure of 12 to 15 mm has been shown to be the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) between optimal and sub-optimal scars using the WES scoring method (<LINK REF="REF-Quinn-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1998a</LINK>). A modified version of the CVAS was used in one study with the participant rating their satisfaction with their scar (<LINK REF="STD-Singer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 1998</LINK>). Since cosmesis ultimately deals with the patient's perception of how well the laceration has healed, these results were combined with other CVAS values.</P>
<P>The Wound Evaluation Score (WES) assesses six clinical variables of each scar: absence of step-off, contour irregularities, wound margin separation greater than two millimetres, edge inversion, excessive distortion, and overall cosmetic appearance. Each variable is given a score of zero or one, with a total score of six considered "optimal" (<LINK REF="REF-Hollander-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollander 1995a</LINK>). Results are reported as dichotomous data, the number of optimal scars in each group. Though determining this score requires that the evaluator be able to assess the scar in person, it offers the advantage of providing specific feedback of the imperfections that have resulted in a suboptimal scar. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Barnett-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barnett 1998</LINK>) used a non-validated five-point scale (i.e. 1 = poor, 5 = excellent) to assess cosmesis. Following communication with the author, we converted those participants with "excellent" scores to "optimal" to combine with other WES assessments. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1993</LINK>) used both CVAS and a non-validated three-point categorical scale (i.e., unacceptable, acceptable, excellent) to assess cosmesis. We could not determine a justifiable way to combine the three-point scale with WES, so these data were excluded. Finally, <LINK REF="STD-Schultz-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 1979</LINK> used a non-validated rating of "acceptable" versus "unacceptable"; "acceptable" was translated to "optimal" to be combined with other categorical WES assessments.</P>
<P>The primary outcome in the remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Singer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2003</LINK>) was the incidence of migration of the tissue adhesive greater than 1 cm from the wound edges. This outcome was chosen as a proxy for complications during application (i.e., for wounds adjacent to the eyes where excessive migration could cause the eyelids to become stuck together).</P>
<P>We assessed secondary outcomes of pain associated with the procedure and ease of the procedure using visual analogue scales. The time to complete the procedure, when included in the results, was reported as a mean number of minutes for each study group.</P>
<P>The remaining secondary outcomes considered were complications: incidents of infection, dehiscence, induration or erythema, discharge, and the need for delayed closure.</P>

<P>No studies were double-blind due to the nature of the interventions (impossible to insert "placebo" sutures or staples), thus Jadad scores ranged from one to three.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cosmetic scores</HEADING>
<P>There were nine studies with 889 lacerations that compared tissue adhesives with standard wound closure using the CVAS outcome measure. Overall, there were no significant differences between tissue adhesives and standard wound closure for CVAS at any of the time points examined. Only one study measured CVAS between 5 to 14 days; the WMD showed no difference (0.0 mm; 95% CI -4.8 to 4.8; 52 lacerations (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>)). At 1 to 3 months, the pooled WMD was 1.6 mm (95% CI -3.2 to 6.4; seven studies with 549 lacerations (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was large and indicated 57% heterogeneity due to between-study heterogeneity. The CVAS pooled WMD at 9 to 12 months was 1.5 mm (95% CI -3.1 to 6.1; four studies with 237 lacerations; (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>)). Between-study heterogeneity was negligible (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>
<P>Four studies (with 364 lacerations) used the WES; there were no significant differences between treatment groups at any of the time points examined. At 5 to 14 days, the pooled RR for an optimal wound was 0.97 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.09; two studies with 195 lacerations (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>)). The pooled RR for an optimal wound at 1 to 3 months was 0.99 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.11; four studies with 364 lacerations; (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>)). The pooled RR for an optimal wound at 9 to 12 months was 1.08 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.30; two studies with 140 lacerations; (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>)). Between-study heterogeneity was absent at all these time points.</P>
<P>All subgroup analyses (i.e., age, location, need for deep sutures, tissue adhesive, Jadad score and its components, funding) except two gave insignificant findings (Analysis 01.07 through 01.30). For the subgroup by age using CVAS at 5 to 14 days, the one trial of adults found a statistically significant superiority of BCA over SWC (WMD 7.74, 95% CI 2.71 to 12.77; (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>)). For the subgroup by tissue adhesive using CVAS at 1 to 3 months, BCA was found to be superior to SWC (WMD 7.50, 95% CI 1.75 to 13.25; three studies with 182 lacerations; (<LINK REF="CMP-001.26" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.26</LINK>)).</P>
<P>The funnel plot for CVAS at one to three months did not indicate publication bias. The weighted regression bias coefficient was insignificant (P = 0.83). WES at one to three months had too few studies (N = 4) to assess publication bias.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Pain</HEADING>
<P>Six studies measured pain scores (VAS) with 570 lacerations. All VAS results were significant and favoured the tissue adhesive interventions. The pain outcome with the most studies, the parent-reported VAS, had a pooled WMD of -13.4 mm (95% CI -20.0 to -6.9; five studies with 434 lacerations; (<LINK REF="CMP-001.31" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.31</LINK>)). Between-study heterogeneity was minimal (I<SUP>2</SUP>=15%). The remaining pain outcomes contained data from only one study each. The patient-reported VAS WMD was -10.8 mm (95% CI -17.1 to -4.5). The physician-reported VAS WMD was -12.6 mm (95% CI -20.1 to -5.1). The nurse-reported VAS WMD was -14.9 (95% CI -22.5 to -7.3).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Time to complete the procedure</HEADING>
<P>Time to complete the procedure also favoured the tissue adhesive interventions (pooled WMD -4.7 min, 95% CI -7.2 to -2.1; six studies with 584 lacerations)(<LINK REF="CMP-001.32" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.32</LINK>). Although between-study heterogeneity was large (I<SUP>2</SUP>=84%), the six studies were consistent in that they all showed that tissue adhesives were much less time consuming. The large heterogeneity seems to be due to the inconsistent SDs of the various studies; the heterogeneity disappeared completely (I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%) if we considered a standardized mean difference, while the result was still statistically significant.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Ease of procedure</HEADING>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Mattick-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Mattick 2002a</LINK>) reported ease of the procedure for the physician. These data were quite skewed; they reported a p-value of 0.07 from a Mann-Whitney test and showed greater ease for the SWC procedure (medians five versus nine mm)(<LINK REF="CMP-001.33" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.33</LINK>).</P>

<P>Nine studies recorded complications on 834 lacerations. All complications were insignificant using the random-effects (RE) model, except for the incidence of dehiscence and erythema. Fewer cases of dehiscence occurred using standard wound care (Risk Difference (RD) 2.4%, 95% CI 0.1 to 4.9)(<LINK REF="CMP-001.34" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.34</LINK>), while fewer incidences of erythema occurred when using tissue adhesives (RD -10%, 95% CI -19 to -0.4). The baseline risk of dehiscence with tissue adhesives was 3.7% and 40 (95% CI 20 to 1168) patients would need to be treated with SWC to prevent one case of dehiscence when using tissue adhesives. The baseline risk of erythema with SWC was 18.3% and 10 (95% CI 5 to 239) patients would need to be treated with tissue adhesives to prevent one incident of erythema when using SWC. Risk differences for infection, delayed closure and discharge were not significant. The baseline SWC risks were 1.1, 0, and 8.2% respectively.<BR/>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review has shown that tissue adhesives are an acceptable alternative to standard wound closure (SWC) for repairing simple traumatic lacerations. </P>
<P>No significant difference was found in the short or long-term cosmetic outcome between lacerations closed with tissue adhesives and SWC. Indeed, the range of plausible values (the 95% CI) are all smaller than the range of minimum clinically important differences (12 to 15 mm) suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Goodman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodman 1994</LINK>). No further studies simply comparing a tissue adhesive to SWCs for cosmetic outcome are necessary. No subgroup differences were found when participants were grouped for age or for location. No comparisons could be made within the included studies for the extent of lacerations. </P>
<P>While cosmesis is an important outcome for both patients and providers, other outcome measures must be considered before declaring tissue adhesives an appropriate alternative to sutures and other SWC methods. The application of tissue adhesives is significantly faster (average 4.7 minutes less) and less painful than SWC. In clinical practice, this is particularly important to consider when treating young children. Suturing wounds in this age group can be emotionally traumatic for the child (unless sedation is used) as well as the parent. Though sedation is safe and uncomplicated for the majority of patients, this adds time and increases cost and complexity. </P>
<P>No individual study has been able to show a significant difference in complication rates between tissue adhesives and SWC. This is due to insufficient power to detect rare outcomes, such as infection and dehiscence. However, when pooling the results of the nine studies comparing tissue adhesives to SWC, significant random-effects differences were found for erythema (favouring tissue adhesive) and dehiscence (favouring SWC). No differences were found for infection, delayed closure or discharge. This may still be due to insufficient pooled numbers of participants, calling for further clinical trials that are designed to assess complication rates rather than cosmesis, and thus are sufficiently powered to detect these rare events. </P>
<P>A small, but significant increased risk of dehiscence was found with tissue adhesives. The estimate of this risk difference is 2.4% (95% CI 0.1 to 4.9; Number Needed to Harm (NNH) 40, 95% CI 20 to 1168). The clinical significance of this result is difficult to interpret without further research to identify whether wound characteristics, patient characteristics, practitioner skill level/training, or different tissue adhesives influence this result. Also, it is not known whether dehisced wounds, including those that require secondary closure, have a different cosmetic outcome than those without dehiscence. Until these questions are answered, this complication should be discussed with the patient (and parent) as a potential, although infrequent, complication that would require a repeat visit for a second closure. Research to identify patients' tolerance for this potential second visit may also influence how practitioners approach this issue. </P>
<P>Erythema was found more often in participants treated with standard wound closure. The random-effects estimate of this risk difference is -10% (95% CI -19 to -0.4; NNH 10, 95% CI 5 to 239). It is difficult to determine the clinical significance of this finding without further data to correlate this early complication with long-term cosmesis. </P>
<P>While there are theoretical differences between the two tissue adhesive products currently available (butylcyanoacrylate (BCA), octylcyanoacrylate (OCA)), only one study with available data was identified that compared them directly. No significant difference was found between the two tissue adhesives for the outcomes of cosmesis, procedure time, pain, infection, or dehiscence. One other study was identified, but no data were available to include it in the review at this time. In an indirect (between study) comparison using a chi squared test (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>), we found a significant difference that favoured BCA (WMD 7.5 versus -2.1 mm, p= 0.003) on CVAS at one to three months. Direct evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Oxman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1992</LINK>), obtained through further tissue adhesive versus tissue adhesive trials, is required to make a definitive conclusion. </P>
<P>The lack of other studies comparing the two products may be due to a number of possible factors. In the United States, only octylcyanoacrylate (Dermabond TM) is available under FDA sanction. Without FDA approval of the research protocol, other tissue adhesives cannot be studied. In other countries where both products are available, there is a significant per-patient cost savings of Histoacryl TM, when used as a multi-dose vial, over Dermabond TM (<LINK REF="REF-Quinn-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinn 1998b</LINK>). This cost difference may deter researchers from further comparisons between the products, when each has shown to be an equally acceptable alternative to standard wound care. </P>
<P>The final study compared a newer formulation of octylcyanoacrylate (high-viscosity) with the standard formulation to assess the incidence of migration away from the wound. The authors chose this outcome as a proxy for complications during use, where the patient's eye may become inadvertently stuck shut by adhesive migrating from a nearby wound. While this complication does rarely occur and may be theoretically prevented using a higher-viscosity tissue adhesive, migration can easily be prevented with appropriate patient selection, preparation and positioning (<LINK REF="REF-Farion-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farion 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two outcomes showed significant heterogeneity in the results of the included studies. The first, tissue adhesive versus SWC using CVAS at one to three months, is the outcome with the largest number of included studies. Each study relied on its own raters (plastic surgeons) to make cosmetic assessments using CVAS, which does not include a reference point of "adequate" or any other qualifier. Thus, each rater is able to set their own reference point, leading to heterogeneity in the results among studies. The other outcome, time to complete the procedure, may be explained by the various SWC methods used in the comparison arms. For example, two trials used adhesive strips, which take very little time to apply compared to trials in which sutures were used. As well, few studies clearly reported how the time was measured (start and end points), making it impossible to know if the various studies were assessing the same time period. </P>
<P>Two economic analyses of tissue adhesives have been published. The first analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Osmond-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osmond 1995</LINK>) compared the personnel time, supply costs and parental costs between non-absorbable percutaneous sutures, absorbable percutaneous sutures and multi-use Histoacryl TM in a Canadian ED setting, using 1993 costs. The ED overhead costs and costs associated with complications were not included, as they were thought to be equal across all three groups, with the assumption that cosmesis was equivalent. Absorbable sutures were found to be 2.4 times more costly than tissue adhesives, while non-absorbable sutures were 6.8 times more costly, due to the need for a repeat visit. The other analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Zempsky-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zempsky 2005</LINK>) compared three closure methods (adhesive strips, sutures and tissue adhesives) for simple wounds closed without complication, with subsequent dehiscence, or with subsequent infection. The authors used the literature to estimate the costs of the products used (primary closure +/- secondary closure if dehiscence occurred) and the physician's time (minutes to repair the wound multiplied by mean physician's labour rate/minute). This US-based analysis only considered octylcyanoacrylate (Dermabond TM) and did not account for costs associated with removal of non-absorbable sutures. In the end, they concluded that adhesive strips had the lowest cost per laceration overall, the lowest cost per laceration with subsequent dehiscence, and the lowest cost per laceration with subsequent infection. Tissue adhesives were found to be the most expensive alternative in all three scenarios. </P>
<P>An updated cost analysis is needed to compare tissue adhesives, considering these scenarios as well as the cost of procedural sedation, which is being utilized more often for lacerations repaired with sutures. </P>
<P>The evidence is limited by the overall low methodological quality of the included studies, as assessed by the Jadad score. Due to the types of treatments being compared, it was impossible to blind the participant or the physician, though blinded individuals did the later cosmetic assessments. Most studies failed to adequately describe the randomisation process and half did not fully report the management of dropouts or withdrawals. Similarly, only two studies adequately described their allocation concealment practices. The primary outcome of most studies is also a potential limitation, given the subjective nature of cosmesis scoring. Three studies assessed cosmesis with non-validated scoring systems. </P>
<P>Several factors may have affected our results. Our use of imputed values and combining parametric and non-parametric statistics may have lead to less precise results. Subgroup analyses were a necessary part of our review; unfortunately, these are indirect comparisons and are also underpowered due to lack of data. Finally, further data are required to determine whether variables such as the training level of the treating physician influence the results.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P> Tissue adhesives are an acceptable alternative to standard wound closure for repairing simple traumatic lacerations. <BR/> Tissue adhesives offer the benefit of rapid application and less pain. This has greatest implication for children with lacerations. <BR/> A small but significant increased rate of dehiscence with tissue adhesives must be considered when choosing the closure method (Number Needed to Harm 40).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P> Research is needed to determine the characteristics (patient, wound, product, operator) that result in an increased rate of dehiscence with tissue adhesives and whether dehiscence results in poor cosmetic outcome. This will require a very large RCT powered to detect these possible differences leading to rare events. <BR/> Additional research is needed to compare different tissue adhesives and the relative costs of tissue adhesives versus other forms of wound closure. <BR/> Further studies are needed to evaluate the use of tissue adhesives for more complex lacerations, or use in locations which have been excluded in prior research (over joints, scalp).</P>
