<P>Epilepsy is a disorder where recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges in the brain. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are commonly used to prevent these seizures but have long-term side effects. When in remission (seizure free), it may be best to stop using the drugs but the right time to withdraw them is still unclear.</P>
<P>We searched electronic databases in June 2014, adding to the research done in a previous version of this review. The same five trials were included in our analysis, comprising 924 epileptic children (all below 16 years old) who were randomly assigned to either early removal of AEDs (before completing two years without seizures); or late withdrawal of AEDs (after completing two years without seizures). Considering all evidence, we found that stopping AED intake before completing two years without seizures increases the risk of seizure relapse by around 34%. This percentage is increased if the child has partial seizures (if the electrical burst only involves a part of the brain, resulting mainly in localized symptoms); or an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) record (unusual patterns of electrical activity in the brain). Other factors that might be related to a higher relapse rate are: age below two years or above 10 years when epilepsy started; history of status epilepticus (convulsions longer than 30 minutes); an IQ lower than 70; and high frequency of seizures before and during treatment. Overall, the included trials provided a moderate quality of evidence.</P>
<P>The review of trials found that there is evidence to support waiting at least two years or more seizure free before discontinuing AEDs in children, especially if they had partial seizures or abnormal EEG.</P>
<P>There is not enough evidence to show the best time to withdraw antiepileptic drugs in adults with epilepsy who are free of seizures.</P>
<P>There is not enough evidence that demonstrates the optimal time to remove antiepileptic drugs in people (children or adults) with generalised seizures (if the electrical discharges affect the whole brain, causing global symptoms).</P>
<P>More research is needed, particularly involving adults and those with generalised seizure types.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-12-22 14:04:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder which affects millions of people around the world. Antiepileptic drugs (AED) are the main interventions used to prevent seizures and control epilepsy. Although effective in most cases, AEDs are related to long-term adverse effects, such as cognitive and behavioural alterations. Thus when epilepsy is in remission, it may be in the individual&#8217;s best interest to discontinue medication. However, the optimal timing of AED discontinuation is still unknown.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (June 2014); CENTRAL (Issue 5, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, May 2014); MEDLINE (1946 to June 2014); CINAHL (23 June 2014); Scopus (1823 to June 2014); ClinicalTrials.gov (23 June 2014); and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (23 June 2014).

<P>Randomised controlled trials that evaluate withdrawal of AEDs after varying periods of seizure remission in adults and children with epilepsy.

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-12-19 17:13:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each trial. Summary RRs and 95% CIs for dichotomous data were calculated using a fixed-effect model. A test of statistical heterogeneity was conducted for each pooled risk ratio calculation. Each included study underwent a 'Risk of bias' assessment, based on the Cochrane Handbook recommendations, and we examined the overall quality of information through the GRADE system, presented in two 'Summary of Findings' tables.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-20 19:55:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five trials were included in this review, representing 924 randomised children with epilepsy, all under 16 years of age at randomisation, with a median follow-up of 5.6 years. No eligible trial evaluated adults or assessed mortality or status epilepticus as outcomes. The pooled risk ratio for seizure relapse after AED withdrawal was 1.34 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.59, P = 0.0007). Conforming to this estimate, the number needed to harm, that is expose an individual to a higher risk of seizure relapse because of early withdrawal of AED, is 8 (95% CI 5 to 20). Early discontinuation was associated with greater relapse rates in people with partial seizures with a pooled risk ratio of 1.51 (95% CI 0.97 to 2.35, P = 0.07). Absence type epilepsy showed a lower risk of relapse. Variables associated with higher risk of seizure relapse were abnormal EEG findings (pooled RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.83, P = 0.003), especially epileptiform activity (RR 2.58, 95% CI 2.03 to 3.28, P &lt; 0.0001); epilepsy onset before 2 years or after 10 years of age; history of status epilepticus; intellectual disability (IQ &lt; 70); and high seizure frequency before and during treatment. Gender and family history did not show any significant influence over seizure relapse. Overall, the included trials were classified as low or unclear risk of bias where methodological information was not reported and could not be provided by original study authors.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-12-22 14:00:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence to support waiting for at least two seizure-free years before discontinuing AEDs in children, particularly if individuals have an abnormal EEG or partial seizures, or both. There is insufficient evidence to establish when to withdraw AEDs in children with generalised seizures. There is no evidence to guide the timing of withdrawal of AEDs in seizure-free adults. Further high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed, particularly recruiting adults and recruiting those with generalised seizure types, to identify the optimal timing of AED withdrawal and risk factors predictive of relapse.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-01-27 12:29:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-12-22 14:02:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Affecting about 50 million people worldwide or 6 to 10 per 1000 individuals (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>), epilepsy is a chronic neurological disease characterised by recurrent, synchronous and exaggerated abnormal neuronal discharges, called seizures, which can be of focal or generalised onset. The disease definition also encompasses the neurological, cognitive and psychosocial sequelae of epilepsy, according to guidelines of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE), as shown in <LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2014</LINK>. To confirm the diagnosis, two or more unprovoked seizures must occur 24 hours apart; or one seizure occurs with very high risk of recurrence (e.g. after stroke); or the individual must have a diagnosis of epilepsy syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2014</LINK>). Treatment should be initiated after diagnosis only, because merely one third of people with a single provoked seizure have further ones (<LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1998</LINK>), and individuals with single provoked seizures will most likely recover without any medical intervention.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-01-27 12:29:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antiepileptic drugs (AED) are the main interventions used to prevent seizures and control epilepsy. Although effective in 50% to 70% of cases when used as a single or a combination therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Kwan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Britton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 2002</LINK>), AEDs are related to long-term adverse effects, such as cognitive and behavioural alterations (<LINK REF="REF-Eddy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddy 2011</LINK>); and withdrawal of AEDs might be advantageous for individuals with long-term remission of seizures if the benefits of withdrawal surpass the harm caused by AED use. Furthermore some AEDs, particularly those most recently licensed, are expensive and might be a continuous financial burden to individual participants as well as public health systems around the world if taken needlessly (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). Therefore when epilepsy is in remission, discontinuation of antiepileptic medication may be favorable to quality of life. However, removal of the drug in an inappropriate manner can lead to relapse of seizures, even in individuals with prolonged seizure freedom, therefore the relative risks and benefits of drug withdrawal should be carefully considered (<LINK REF="REF-Lossius-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lossius 2008</LINK>). Unfortunately, there are still no conclusive studies that determine when this discontinuation can safely occur. In 1994, the American Academy of Neurology published a guideline for suspending AEDs in seizure-free participants, recommending discontinuation if the individual meets all of the following criteria: free from seizures following two to five years of treatment, has a single type of epilepsy, a normal neurological examination and a normalized EEG (<LINK REF="REF-AAN-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAN 1996</LINK>). Similarly, randomised prospective studies in the UK, demonstrated enhanced favorable results from waiting for two or more seizure-free years before initiating withdrawal (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MRC-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 1993</LINK>). Still, the time limit of two years was chosen arbitrarily, since most studies regarding AED withdrawal have confounding variables (specific types of epilepsy, age of study participants, normal or abnormal EEG etc.), representing a sample which is not representative of the general population, and can be contradictory.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-01-27 11:54:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Comparing participants who withdrew with the ones still in treatment, an increased risk of seizure relapse in the initial six months was reported; however, if no seizure occurred in this initial six-month period then after a year the seizure risk for the two groups was almost equal (<LINK REF="REF-Lossius-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lossius 2008</LINK>). Moreover, other studies show that this risk drops significantly at 3 months after withdrawal and even more as time progresses, drawing attention to driving restrictions specifically in this period (<LINK REF="REF-Bonnett-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonnett 2011</LINK>). This pattern of risk differences is confirmed by the <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-MRC-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 1993</LINK> studies.</P>
<P>Also, there are numerous advantages to be gained from the interruption of AED. Not having to take pills regularly and a perception of health can improve one&#8217;s self-esteem, particularly with regard to a disease such as epilepsy which is known to cause social stigma (<LINK REF="REF-Siqueira-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siqueira 2011</LINK>). Also, some cognitive and behavioural long-term effects inherent to AED treatment might only be demonstrated after years of pharmacotherapy and withdrawal may be greatly beneficial to motor coordination, rapid cognition, concentration and memory (<LINK REF="REF-Lossius-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lossius 2008</LINK>). Furthermore, some AEDs can interfere defectively with coexisting medical conditions and drugs, such as oral contraceptives, antibiotics, antipsychotics, immunosuppressants, antineoplastics and other antiepileptic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Johannessen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johannessen 2010</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-12-22 14:03:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In an attempt to define the optimal time of AED discontinuation, this review intended to analyse and synthesise randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which participants, children or adults, had been allocated to groups undergoing early or late withdrawal of AEDs. For the purpose of this review, early withdrawal of AED is determined as suspension of medication after less than two continuous seizure-free years while in treatment, whereas late withdrawal is considered as two or more seizure-free years before discontinuation.</P>
<P>This systematic review&#8217;s purpose was firstly to summarize evidence from RCTs that compare early and late withdrawal of AEDs regarding risk relapse, status epilepticus occurrence, and mortality. Secondly, we assessed variables such as age at seizure onset, seizure types, EEG findings at different time points, intelligence quotient, and neurological examination. Finally, we attempted to narratively define a subpopulation of adults with epilepsy who may safely have AEDs withdrawn after remission of less than two years.</P>
<P>This review is an update of the previously published review in the<I> Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I> (Issue 3, 2001) titled 'Early versus late antiepileptic drug withdrawal for people with epilepsy in remission'.</P>

Included studies compared an early versus late antiepileptic drug discontinuation, following two distinctly different periods of remission of seizures. Exact definitions of 'early' or 'late' withdrawal varied amongst the individual studies: for the purpose of this review, we defined early withdrawal of AED as the suspension of medication after less than two continuous seizure-free years while in treatment, whereas late withdrawal is considered as two or more seizure-free years before discontinuation. This definition was chosen because two years is the time limit already used in clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-AAN-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAN 1996</LINK>).</P>

<P>We employed a fixed-effect model meta-analysis to find the pooled risk ratio for each outcome, using the Mantel-Haenszel statistical method, since no significant heterogeneity was found. As seizure relapse, mortality and status epilepticus are dichotomous outcomes, we expressed the results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We expected to carry out comparisons between the aforementioned outcomes and variables presented in the included trials as possible prognostic factors. For trials reporting time-to-event (survival-type) data, we were unable to extract the required information, as either graphs were not published or insufficient evidence was reported. As study authors did not respond to requests to provide these data for analysis, then where we could not extract data we have reported results narratively.</P>

<P>Overall, we included five trials in this analysis, representing 924 randomised children with epilepsy, all under 16 years of age at randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Braathen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Braathen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gebremariam-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gebremariam 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Todt-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Todt 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verrotti-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Verrotti 2000</LINK>). One trial was actually published as three different papers, which focus on various aspects of the same trial (<LINK REF="REF-Andersson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Braathen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Braathen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Braathen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braathen 1997</LINK>). In this case, we only considered the first two studies as one database; no additional data were presented in <LINK REF="REF-Braathen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braathen 1997</LINK>. Data regarding EEG recordings were extracted from the <LINK REF="REF-Andersson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersson 1997</LINK> article, and the rest were extracted from both papers (<LINK REF="REF-Andersson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Braathen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Braathen 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Participants were only included after at least two unprovoked seizures or having previously been diagnosed as epileptic. Also, <LINK REF="STD-Braathen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Braathen 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Todt-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Todt 1984</LINK> included children with one episode of status epilepticus or one seizure of more than 30 minutes. However, <LINK REF="STD-Todt-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Todt 1984</LINK> analysed these separately and their information was not included in our review together with the other participants. Children with febrile seizures, major neurological illness, neonatal seizures, infantile spasms and other specific types of epilepsy were excluded in every trial. In <LINK REF="STD-Verrotti-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Verrotti 2000</LINK>, only children with non-rolandic partial epilepsy were studied. All five trials classified the participants' seizure type according to definitions of the International League Against Epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four trials randomised individuals after a diagnosis of seizures or epilepsy had been made, treatment with AEDs had been initiated and a seizure-free period had elapsed prior to discontinuation of drug (<LINK REF="STD-Gebremariam-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gebremariam 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Todt-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Todt 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verrotti-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Verrotti 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Braathen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Braathen 1996</LINK>, however, randomised individuals after a diagnosis but prior to treatment with AEDs.

<P>In all trials, withdrawal was tested in early and late schemes. Even though definition of both groups was different in all of them, they could all be divided into before and after two seizure-free years, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Braathen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Braathen 1996</LINK>, in which withdrawal was defined as 'early' or 'late' taking into consideration time of treatment with antiepileptic drugs, and not specifically seizure-free years; and <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK>, where early withdrawal was considered as before six seizure-free months and late after 1 year. Although this criterion varies slightly from ours, this trial was included after a sensitivity analysis and because the early-withdrawal group had less than 2 years without seizures. Tapering of AEDs was conducted gradually over a period ranging from one month to up to one year.</P>

<P>In all trials, seizure activities were reported by the participants&#8217; parents and by regular follow-up visits made by the trialists. For our review, we used the data extracted from the last reported time point, since all of them had followed up with the participants for up to around 5 to 6 years on average. We tried to extract information regarding mortality and status epilepticus as outcomes, but none of the studies showed valid results and only one death was mentioned, in <LINK REF="STD-Braathen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Braathen 1996</LINK>.</P>
<P>With regard to variables which impact seizure relapse only two factors could be studied: seizure type; and EEG.

We contacted trialists for the additional data but none have been received at this time.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Seizure <I>relapse</I>
</HEADING>
<P>Comparison between early (fewer than two seizure-free years) and late (more than two seizure-free years) withdrawal regarding seizure relapse were available in all included studies, representing 924 randomised epileptic children. The pooled risk ratio for this outcome was 1.34 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.59, P = 0.0007) and four of the trials showed similar effects, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Gebremariam-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gebremariam 1999</LINK>, which demonstrated a risk ratio of 0.82 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.54) when discontinuing AEDs at 18 seizure-free months. The Chi² test for seizure relapse showed no evidence of significant statistical heterogeneity between the trials (Chi² = 7.73, df = 4, P = 0.10, I² = 48%). The pooled risk difference was 0.12 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.19) at end of follow-up. On the basis of the overall risk ratio, the number needed to harm is 8 (95% CI 5 to 20). In other words, for every eight individuals that are withdrawn later off AEDs, one seizure relapse is prevented compared to early withdrawal. See <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>Given the difference in definition of early and late withdrawal in <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK> compared to the other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK> considered 'early' as less than one seizure-free year and 'late' as equal to, or more than, one seizure-free years), we performed sensitivity analysis excluding the participants in <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK> from meta-analysis to investigate any potential influence of the different definition. The pooled RR for 763 children in the remaining four studies was 1.45 (95% CI 1.18 to 1.78, P = 0.0005), showing a similar pooled result and no change to the conclusions of the analysis. Therefore, following this sensitivity analysis, we conclude that our results are robust to the variation of early and late withdrawal definition in <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK>.</P>

<P>Only two trials reported the number of children with partial epilepsy in each group and how many of those had a seizure relapse. From <LINK REF="STD-Braathen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Braathen 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Verrotti-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Verrotti 2000</LINK>, 180 children with partial seizures were randomised in early and late withdrawal groups. There was no statistical heterogeneity between these studies (Chi² = 1.07, df = 1, P = 0.30, I² = 7%), and both showed similar effect. The pooled risk ratio was 1.51 (95% CI 0.97 to 2.35, P = 0.07), favouring late discontinuation of AEDs in children with partial epilepsies.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Braathen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Braathen 1996</LINK> found that benign partial epilepsy with rolandic spikes had the lowest relapse rate in both early and late withdrawal groups, followed by simple partial epilepsies. In comparison with both these types, complex partial seizure epilepsy showed a risk ratio of 4.70 (95% CI 1.34 to 21.65).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK> reported a risk ratio of 1.39 for partial epilepsies, regardless of time of withdrawal, but did not publish the number of participants nor send us the values when contacted.

Both showed a similar effect favouring a normal EEG before discontinuing antiepileptic treatment and the overall risk ratio when EEG was abnormal was 1.44 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.83, P = 0.003).

<LINK REF="STD-Gebremariam-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gebremariam 1999</LINK> measured EEG before treatment with AED, and before and after AED discontinuation, reporting only risk ratios, of which abnormal EEG during tapering is the most specific (RR 6.21 95% CI 5.62 to 68.50).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-27 11:54:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found that all trials, except <LINK REF="STD-Gebremariam-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gebremariam 1999</LINK>, supported waiting more than two years to withdraw AEDs in seizure-free children, with an overall pooled risk ratio of 1.34 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.59). This preference in stalling discontinuation is accentuated in partial-seizure epilepsies, where the pooled risk ratio increases to 1.51 (95% CI 0.97 to 2.35, p=0.07). However, <LINK REF="STD-Braathen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Braathen 1996</LINK> suggested that when partial seizures are simple or benign with rolandic spikes, the risk of relapse is much lower than the complex kind. Overall, partial epilepsies have a higher seizure recurrence than generalised types, regardless of discontinuation scheme. Differences between early and late withdrawal were not clear when analysing generalised epilepsies, but tended towards a lower risk in late suspension of AEDs. Absence seizures probably have lower risk of relapse overall, but also follow the pattern of higher recurrence in early withdrawal.</P>
<P>Abnormal EEG findings, especially paroxysmal activity, indicate a higher seizure recurrence, but this may also be linked to the type of epilepsy and thus classification of seizures is the main prognostic factor, instead of simply EEG findings. Interestingly, children with normal EEG were more influenced by the seizure-free period before AED discontinuation, having a higher risk ratio in early discontinuation than infants with abnormal EEG registrations.</P>
<P>Children of less than 2 or above 10 years of age at epilepsy onset have a higher risk of seizure relapse after discontinuation. Again, however, this might be associated with certain types of epilepsies that are more common in specific age groups. Other variables which may be related with seizure relapse risk are intellectual disability (IQ &lt; 70), a history of status epilepticus, and a higher seizure frequency before or during treatment. Gender and family history of epilepsy were not shown to be associated with recurrence of seizures.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-07-29 21:30:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Isabella Strozzi">
<P>Our primary outcome was difference in seizure relapse rates between early and late withdrawal of AEDs in people with epilepsy in remission, and the included studies have appropriately provided data for a conclusion regarding seizure relapse rates following early or late withdrawal of AEDs in children. However, aside investigation of the influence of EEG results and seizure types on the seizure recurrence outcome, our secondary outcomes were not addressed and we were left with no answers regarding risk of mortality or status epilepticus occurrence after withdrawal. Also, no eligible trial included adults, consequently there are currently no data to support earlier withdrawal of AEDs in adults or in elderly people.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-01-21 09:09:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included five trials (described in seven articles), which assembled a total of 924 children that could be compared regarding to seizure-free period before AED withdrawal (early versus late). All studies were randomised but not blinded:in these studies, blinding was probably unfeasible or even unethical, since withdrawal of medication is difficult to simulate, especially in a relatively long follow-up period and regarding a condition as serious as epilepsy. Regarding EEG analysis, 618 children were studied from two of the included trials, but <LINK REF="STD-Braathen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Braathen 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Todt-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Todt 1984</LINK> included in their EEG report a different number of children than the ones used to calculate a risk ratio for early versus late withdrawal, causing a certain confusion.</P>
<P>As shown in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, comparison between types of epilepsy was considered as indirect because one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Verrotti-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Verrotti 2000</LINK>) did not include children with generalised seizures and therefore could not compare results adequately with partial seizure epilepsy participants. This comparison, as well as the one between early and late withdrawal, was considered as imprecise because the confidence interval from one of the studies causes an appreciable risk ratio reduction (above 25%).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Braathen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Braathen 1996</LINK>, differently from the other trials, did not divide groups into different seizure-free periods, but in different treatment schedules (one or three years) with the last six months being seizure-free. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK>) randomised participants to either six seizure-free months or one seizure-free year, both groups withdrawing AEDs in less than two seizure-free years. However, we elected to include both trials because they did randomise individuals to early and late AED discontinuation. See '<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>'.</P>

<P>The main factor that could serve as a source of bias is the manner in which the authors of the included studies chose to report their results: only in risk ratio form instead of absolute numbers or survival curves that we could use to perform a meta-analysis, leaving us with less information than we would ideally have had.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-27 12:29:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Previous trials and meta-analyses, not randomised between early and late withdrawal of AEDs, have suggested that at least two years of seizure freedom are needed before attempting withdrawal of AEDs (<LINK REF="REF-AAN-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAN 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shinnar-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinnar 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Su-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2013</LINK>). Also, other studies have concluded that the long-term relapse rate after withdrawal is not much different from participants who continued their treatment, and the contrast is much accentuated in the first years of comparison (<LINK REF="REF-Aktekin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aktekin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK>). The purpose of this review was to quantify the relapse risk associated with an even earlier AED discontinuation (less than two years). All of the included trials pertained only to children, however, revealing a complete absence of trials which have studied earlier withdrawal of AEDs in adults.</P>
<P>Children who were seizure-free for more than two years before discontinuation had a 34.3% relapse rate, comparable to incidences found in previous studies (<LINK REF="REF-Callaghan-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callaghan 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gherpelli-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gherpelli 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shinnar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Shinnar 1994</LINK>), and this rate was reported also in <LINK REF="REF-Sillanp_x00e4__x00e4_-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sillanpää 2006</LINK>, which had a follow-up period of 37 years. <LINK REF="REF-Li-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2014</LINK>, who included adults, showed a lower relapse rate; however they explain that their population had a smaller proportion of partial seizures and most participants were seizure free for more than three years.</P>
<P>Partial epilepsies were found in our review to have a higher risk of relapse after withdrawal, even more so when this is too early. Overall, other studies confirm that partial seizure epilepsy is a risk factor for seizure relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Bouma-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouma 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Callaghan-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callaghan 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dooley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dooley 1996</LINK>), pointing out that complex partial seizures have a worse prognosis than benign rolandic and simple partial seizures (<LINK REF="STD-Dooley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dooley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramos_x002d_Lizana-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramos-Lizana 2010</LINK>), just as we inferred. However, <LINK REF="REF-Gherpelli-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gherpelli 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ramos_x002d_Lizana-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramos-Lizana 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1991" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Shinnar-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinnar 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Sillanp_x00e4__x00e4_-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sillanpää 2006</LINK> concluded that generalised tonic-clonic seizures were a greater risk factor. Remote symptomatic or organic epilepsy had higher recurrence risk in the studies by <LINK REF="REF-Berg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Matricardi-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matricardi 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ramos_x002d_Lizana-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramos-Lizana 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sillanp_x00e4__x00e4_-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sillanpää 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Shinnar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Shinnar 1994</LINK>.</P>
<P>Our included studies showed that abnormal EEG findings before withdrawal (and during treatment) damaged the prognosis, especially if paroxysmal activity was registered. One included study found also a higher risk if EEG during tapering was irregular. Most of the literature seen corroborated these affirmations, stating that EEG is a good prognostic tool prior to discontinuation in neonates, children or adults (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gherpelli-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gherpelli 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellstr_x00f6_m_x002d_Westas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hellström-Westas 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matricardi-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matricardi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Overweg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overweg 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shinnar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Shinnar 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tennison-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tennison 1994</LINK>), specifying that 'slowing' (<LINK REF="REF-Shinnar-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinnar 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shinnar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Shinnar 1994</LINK>) or 'spikes' (<LINK REF="REF-Tennison-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tennison 1994</LINK>) are risk factors. <LINK REF="REF-Su-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2013</LINK>, however, found that abnormal EEG during and after tapering AEDs was more specific than before withdrawal attempt. It is interesting to point out that EEG findings are also used for epilepsy type classification, and the type of epilepsy may be true predictor of prognosis following AED withdrawal.</P>
<P>From the five trials we included, we inferred that both below 2 year old and over 10 year old children had a higher risk for seizure recurrence. This matches with the conclusions of <LINK REF="REF-Berg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dooley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dooley 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Shinnar-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Shinnar 1994</LINK>, but, while <LINK REF="REF-Bouma-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouma 1987</LINK> contradicted such relation, <LINK REF="REF-Gherpelli-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gherpelli 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Li-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2014</LINK> found no significant association between age at onset and relapse. We can also speculate that age at onset is associated with epilepsy types that have different kinds of prognosis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-12-22 14:01:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence that discontinuing medications prior to at least two seizure-free years is associated with a higher recurrence risk than waiting for two or more seizure-free years in children, particularly if individuals have an abnormal EEG and partial seizures. However, the optimal time of withdrawal is not clear because two years was chosen arbitrarily. There is insufficient evidence to establish when to withdraw AEDs in children with generalised seizures. Decisions to continue or discontinue medications prior to two years in individual children need to be based on the child's underlying epilepsy syndrome. There is no evidence to guide the timing of withdrawal of AEDs in (less than two years) seizure-free adults.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-12-22 13:59:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further randomised controlled trials are needed to identify individuals who can be safely withdrawn from AEDs earlier than two seizure-free years. Future trials should include adults, older adults and all clinically relevant outcomes such as mortality, status epilepticus as well as seizure endpoints at various seizure-free intervals. New studies should address variables which have been shown to be related to seizure relapse such as epilepsy types, type of AED, age at seizure onset and seizure frequency. Future research should aim to identify what specific characteristics make possible a safe early withdrawal of AEDs in individuals of all ages.</P>

<P>The review title was changed from 'When can antiepileptic drugs be withdrawn in patients with epilepsy?' in the protocol to 'Early versus late antiepileptic drug withdrawal for people with epilepsy in remission' in order to better fit the content of the paper, emphasizing the seizure-free period in question.</P>
<P>Participants from the included studies were changed from 'seizure free for at least two years' to 'seizure free for a described period of time', so the review could compare participants seizure free for less or more than 2 years.</P>
<P>Studies were in fact analysed through a 'fixed-effect model' instead of a 'random-effects model' as described in the protocol, because the studies were consistent enough to be considered as homogeneous. Also, results were reported as risk ratio, instead of risk difference, for a better understanding.<BR/>
