<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-01-17 14:16:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To help prevent the malaria parasite from developing resistance to antimalarial medicines, the WHO recommends the use of combination therapy, where malaria infections are treated with more than one drug simultaneously. As azithromycin is an antibiotic that also has an effect on the malaria parasite, we assessed its efficacy and tolerability as an antimalarial when used alone or as part of combination therapy with other antimalarials. Our review of studies conducted over the past 14 years suggests that azithromycin is a relatively weak antimalarial whose efficacy depends on the drug dose and the partner drug in the combination therapy. The data suggest that, among adults, the higher doses needed to achieve an acceptable level of treatment success with malaria may be less well tolerated. Unless the ongoing product and dose optimisation process results in a universally efficacious product or identifies a specific niche application that is complementary to the current scala of more efficacious antimalarial combinations, azithromycin's future as an antimalarial does not look promising.</P>

<P>Fifteen trials met the inclusion criteria (2284 participants, 69% males, 16% children). They were conducted in disparate malaria endemic areas, with the earlier studies conducted in Thailand (five) and India (two), and the more recent studies (eight) spread across three continents (South America, Africa, Asia). The 15 studies involved 41 treatment arms, 12 different drugs, and 28 different treatment regimens. Two studies examined <I>P. vivax.</I>

<P>Three-day azithromycin (AZ) monotherapy did not perform well for <I>P. vivax</I> or <I>P. falciparum </I>(Thailand: <I>P. vivax</I> failure rate 0.5 g daily, 56%, 95% CI 31 to 78.

A 1 g azithromycin and 0.6 g chloroquine combination daily for three days for uncomplicated <I>P. falciparum</I> infections was associated with increased treatment failure in India and Indonesia compared with the combination of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and chloroquine (pooled RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.25 to 5.67), and compared with the combination atovaquone-proguanil in a multicentre trial in Columbia and Surinam (RR 24.72, 95% CI 6.16 to 99.20). No increased risk of treatment failure was seen in two studies in Africa with mefloquine as the comparator drug (pooled RR 2.02, 95% CI 0.51 to 7.96, P = 0.3); the pooled RR for PCR-corrected data for the combination versus mefloquine was 1.01, 95% CI 0.18 to 5.84 (P = 1.0).

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-17 14:22:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The World Health Organization (WHO) treatment guidelines for uncomplicated malaria recommend combination therapy to reduce the development of drug resistance and to improve therapeutic efficacy. Over the past decade highly efficacious artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have been implemented across the world (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_RBM-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/RBM 2006</LINK>). Despite this substantial progress, there is a clear need for further antimalarial combinations, involving both candidates for the next generation of first-line antimalarials and those that address specific niches in malaria control, such as options that are safe for use during early pregnancy or that can be used for syndromic approaches that target multiple diseases.</P>
<P>Three antibiotic groups have been shown to have antimalarial activity in studies using experimental malaria models: tetracyclines, lincosamides, and macrolides (<LINK REF="REF-Pradines-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pradines 2001</LINK>). Antibiotics have also been used in clinical practice to enhance the effect of available antimalarials. For example, tetracycline and doxycycline (tetracyclines) and clindamycin (a lincosamide) are recommended in combination with quinine as a second-line treatment option for uncomplicated malaria following a treatment failure (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_RBM-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/RBM 2006</LINK>). However, because they can disturb bone and teeth development, the tetracyclines are contraindicated among pregnant women and children, frequently the most vulnerable groups for malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Nosten-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nosten 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Azithromycin is a potential alternative treatment option. This relatively new macrolide antibiotic has a longer half-life (approximately 60 hours) and better pharmacokinetic properties (adult treatment dose for bacterial infections 500 mg orally once daily for three to seven days) compared to the macrolide erythromycin, which is widely available in developing countries (standard adult treatment dose for bacterial infections is 250 to 500 mg orally every six hours or 0.5 to 1 g every 12 hours for seven days or more). Azithromycin can treat a broad spectrum of bacterial infections; it has an attractive safety profile and could be an option for use in pregnancy, where the currently available arsenal of effective and safe antimalarials is limited (<LINK REF="REF-Nosten-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nosten 2006</LINK>). Several trials have used azithromycin to treat sexually-transmitted diseases and genital infections during pregnancy with no reports of adverse neonatal outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Adair-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adair 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gray-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogasawara-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogasawara 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies of the efficacy of azithromycin in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in experimental and animal models have shown that azithromycin is a relatively weak antimalarial with a slow parasite clearance rate. The treatment dose, duration of therapy, and antimalarial partner drug are reported to be important determinants of efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Biswas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biswas 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gingras-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gingras 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gingras-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gingras 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neerja-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neerja 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noedl-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noedl 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohrt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohrt 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Puri-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puri 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yeo-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeo 1995</LINK>;). Results from experimental clinical studies using azithromycin (in combination or alone) for treating symptomatic malaria in Asia were inconsistent in methodology, dose used, and outcome measures (<LINK REF="STD-Dunne-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Dunne 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunne-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Dunne 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krudsood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Krudsood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krudsood-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Krudsood 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Na_x002d_Bangchang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Na-Bangchang 1996</LINK>). In this review, we aim to summarize the available data from randomized controlled trials to assess the usefulness of azithromycin for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria and to identify its potential niche among the available antimalarial drugs.</P>

<B>
<BR/>Trial selection<BR/>
</B>The first author screened the results of the search strategy for potentially relevant trials and retrieved the full articles of these trials. Each trial was scrutinized for multiple publications from the same study. Using an eligibility criteria form based on the inclusion criteria, two authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion in the review. Discrepancies between assessments were resolved through discussion or referred to an editor of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group when needed. We excluded studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria for the efficacy assessment and stated the reason for exclusion; however, we included these studies for adverse events.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction<BR/>
</B>We piloted the data extraction form before using it for independent data extraction. We attempted to contact the corresponding author if the available data was unclear, missing, or reported in a format that was different to the format that we required.</P>
<P>We extracted the number of participants analysed and the number randomized for each treatment arm and for each outcome. We calculated the percentage loss to follow-up and reported this information in the characteristics table. For continuous outcomes, we extracted the arithmetic means and standard deviations for each treatment group, together with the numbers of participants in each group. If medians were extracted, we also extracted ranges. For dichotomous outcome measures (eg treatment failure, presence of gametocytes, adverse events), we recorded the number of participants experiencing the event and the number analysed in each group. We entered the data in <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-5.0" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 5.0</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>Methodological quality assessment</B>
<BR/>We used 'The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias' (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We followed the guidance to assess whether adequate steps had been taken to reduce the risk of bias across six domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding (of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors); incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002</LINK>). We have categorized these judgments as 'yes' (low risk of bias), 'no' (high risk of bias), or 'unclear'. Where our judgement was unclear, we attempted to contact the trial authors for clarification.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Data analysis<BR/>
</B>We analysed the data using <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-5.0" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 5.0</LINK> and presented all results with 95% CI. If no participants were lost to follow-up, we used an intention-to-treat analysis. For trials with loss to follow-up, we undertook an available case analysis, in which trial participants were analysed by the arm they were randomised into and participants for whom the outcome was not collected were excluded.</P>
<P>We compared dichotomous data using relative risks. Where data were presented using medians and ranges, we presented the data in tables only. We aimed to conduct sensitivity analyses based on allocation concealment and loss to follow-up. We did not intend to combine trials of different comparator drugs.</P>
<P>We assessed heterogeneity by inspecting the forest plots and assessing the heterogeneity statistics (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test &lt; 0.1, I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic &gt; 50%). If we detected heterogeneity and considered it clinically meaningful to combine the trials, we used a random-effects model. We intended to explore the following potential sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses: participants (children versus adults, as defined by the included trials); trial setting (high versus low malaria transmission ); drug dose (total dose and division of doses over days); and presence of drug resistance to comparator drug. However, the small number of studies per comparison did not allow these analyses. They also precluded meaningful use of funnel plots and sensitivity analyses.</P>

<P>We identified 19 potential studies for inclusion. Two studies were excluded because their results were not yet available: one was still ongoing at the time of the search (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-677833" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 677833</LINK>), and one study was completed but the analysis was not yet finished (NIAID 379821). Two other studies were excluded from the efficacy analysis because they were not randomized (<LINK REF="STD-Krudsood-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Krudsood 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-282919" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 282919</LINK>); however, these studies were included in the evaluation of adverse events. In the remaining 15 studies, 2284 participants were enrolled and 2083 (91.2%) were available for the analysis of the primary endpoint. Participants were children and adults: the lowest age for inclusion was six months (<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 2009</LINK>). However, most studies included adolescents and adults only (13 out of the 15 studies); we estimate that 374 of the enrolled participants (16.4%) were children &lt; 60 months and/or with a weight &lt; 35 kg. Sixty-nine percent of participants were male and two studies included men only (<LINK REF="STD-Na_x002d_Bangchang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Na-Bangchang 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pukrittayakamee-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pukrittayakamee 2001</LINK>); all studies excluded pregnant women. The earliest study started in 1995 and the most recent study finished in 2009. The majority of studies were funded by Pfizer alone (nine) or in combination with others (two). Six trial synopses were retrieved from the web from studies sponsored by Pfizer; the role of the funding agency was not stated in these reports.</P>
<P>Two studies examined <I>P. vivax </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Dunne-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Dunne 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pukrittayakamee-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pukrittayakamee 2001</LINK>), whereas <I>P. falciparum</I> was the species of primary interest in all other studies. The early studies were conducted in Thailand (five) and India (two), whereas the more recent studies (eight) were conducted across three continents (South America, Africa, Asia). Thailand is known for its multi-resistant <I>P. falciparum</I>, with described resistance to chloroquine, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, mefloquine and quinine; malaria transmission is generally low, unstable, and seasonal. There is no malaria transmission in Bangkok, the site of three studies. Malaria transmission within the area investigated in the early Indian study was reported as "stable throughout the year" (<LINK REF="STD-Dunne-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Dunne 2005b</LINK>). One of the Pfizer studies was conducted in an area of intense malaria transmission in Kenya (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-82563" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 82563</LINK>), but the type of malaria transmission in the areas of the other Pfizer studies was not reported. Malaria transmission was high in the study area in Tanzania (<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 2009</LINK>), but moderate-to-low in the study area in Bangladesh (<LINK REF="STD-Thriemer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Thriemer 2010</LINK>). All studies followed participants up to day 28, with seven of them reporting PCR-adjusted failure rates and seven studies continuing follow-up until day 42. However, only three studies reported day 42 results (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-84227" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 84227</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sykes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Thriemer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Thriemer 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was a wide variety in the drug combinations, doses of azithromycin and comparator drugs, and regimens used, with 41 treatment arms of the 15 studies involving 12 different antimalarials, and 28 different treatment regimens (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> or Table 2). The most common azithromycin combination was 1 g azithromycin with 0.6 g chloroquine daily for three days (1 g azithromycin/chloroquine), used in six arms. The characteristics of the included studies are given in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>All studies except one (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-367653" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 367653</LINK>) reported excluding subjects with a recent history of intake of an antimalarial, although the period of intake could vary between the last 48 hours to 42 days prior to enrolment. In Tanzania, only subjects with a history of intake of an effective antimalarial were excluded, because local drug resistance to commonly used antimalarials such as sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, amodiaquine and chloroquine was reported to be &gt; 70% (<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 2009</LINK>). Two studies used drug screening tests to confirm the absence of antimalarial metabolites (<LINK REF="STD-Na_x002d_Bangchang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Na-Bangchang 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pukrittayakamee-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pukrittayakamee 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>The available information did not allow an appropriate evaluation of the quality of the data. The six trial synopses from Pfizer that were publicly available contained limited information on the methods, and did not specify randomization and allocation concealment. Baseline characteristics were broadly comparable between arms except for the baseline parasite density in the combination arm of a study in India, which was lower than the other arms (Table 4, <LINK REF="STD-Dunne-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Dunne 2005b</LINK>). Four trials conducted by Pfizer included an arm with 0.5 g azithromycin and 600 mg chloroquine for three days; when one of these trials in India showed low efficacy in a second interim analysis, this arm was stopped in this and all other trials where this arm was used (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-74841" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 74841</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-82576" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 82576</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-84227" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 84227</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-84240" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 84240</LINK>). Results were presented for the 59 participants in the arm for the trial in India (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-74841" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 74841</LINK>), but not for this arm in any of the other trials in which nine, 14, and seven participants were enrolled, respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-82576" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 82576</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-84227" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 84227</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-84240" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 84240</LINK>). Two studies were reportedly terminated because of a slow rate of recruitment (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-84240" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 84240</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-82563" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 82563</LINK>) and two arms in one trial were terminated prematurely because of a lack of efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Dunne-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Dunne 2005b</LINK>); results of the enrolled participants in these studies were included in our analyses (except for the 0.5 g azithromycin/600 mg chloroquine arm in Pfizer 84240). The comparator drugs for the studies by Pfizer in Africa, Indonesia, and South America were not the first-line drug in the respective countries.</P>
<P>A summary of the 'Risk of bias' assessments is presented in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. Of the 15 trials included in the assessment of efficacy, the sequence generation and allocation concealment was adequate and judged to be at low risk of bias in three studies, and unknown in the remaining trials. Only five studies were judged to be at low risk of bias due to adequate blinding. Blinding of laboratory staff was conducted in five open label studies, reducing the bias for the efficacy outcome; however, adverse event reporting will remain at risk of bias in these studies.Two trials were considered to be at high risk of bias due to a moderate loss of participants (&gt; 15%), and/or unequal distribution of loss of participants between treatment arms. We considered almost all trials at risk of selective reporting for one or more of the following reasons: the outcome assessment seemed subjective; there was no baseline data provided by treatment arm; adverse events were not reported by treatment arm; prespecified outcomes were not reported; treatment arms were included that were not randomized; only men were included; interim analyses and subsequent halting of treatment arms; and halting of complete studies before the sample size had been reached. Only one study reported that the sponsor had no role in data analysis and writing of the report (<LINK REF="STD-Thriemer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Thriemer 2010</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2011-03-14 14:36:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Details of how we derived estimates of total failure from the data in each trial report can be found in Table 2. Six treatment arms used the same treatment combination and dose for azithromycin (1 g of azithromycin for three days in combination with 0.6 g of chloroquine for three days); however, only three comparison regimens were the same. An overview of the RR for comparing an azithromycin-containing regimen with an alternative regimen can be seen in Table 3 (<I>P. falciparum</I> and <I>P. vivax</I>) and <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> (<I>P. falciparum</I>). A risk ratio (RR) greater than one indicates that the azithromycin regimen is more likely to result in treatment failure compared to the alternative regimen; a RR less than one indicates the opposite. The attained efficacy and 95% confidence interval for each arm, stratified by dose, is presented in <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>, with PCR-adjusted results used for <I>P. falciparum</I> where available. To allow comparison and for completeness, we also show the information from the excluded trials. A meta-analysis could be conducted for the comparisons between azithromycin/chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine/chloroquine, azithromycin/chloroquine and mefloquine, azithromycin/chloroquine and chloroquine, and azithromycin/artesunate and artemether/lumefantrine. For the comparison between azithromycin/chloroquine and chloroquine, the chloroquine doses used differed (0.3 g on day three versus 0.6 g on day three), and the sample sizes of the second study were very small (<LINK REF="STD-Dunne-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Dunne 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-82563" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 82563</LINK>); for this reason, the results of the first study and not the meta-analysis have been presented where necessary (<LINK REF="STD-Dunne-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Dunne 2005b</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">P. vivax</HEADING>
<P>There was no difference in total treatment failure rates for a three-day course of azithromycin monotherapy (azithromycin 0.5 g per day) compared with seven-day monotherapy courses of tetracycline, doxycycline or clindamycin in Thailand (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). In India, a three-day course of azithromycin (1 g per day) was significantly less efficacious than the standard first-line chloroquine course. In the latter study, all participants were treated with primaquine from day 7 until day 20, which may partly explain the overall higher efficacy at day 28. Compared to the other antibiotics, the time to <I>P. vivax </I>parasite clearance was longer with azithromycin monotherapy (Table 5).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">P. falciparum</HEADING>
<P>The main meta-analyses used a fixed-effect model (except for the comparison between azithromycin/chloroquine and chloroquine) and data for participants who could be evaluated at follow-up. Because of the limited number of comparisons that could be made, no exploration of the effect of trial methodology on the estimate of treatment effect was conducted.</P>
<P>
<B>Total failure by day 28</B>
</P>
<P>Azithromycin combination therapy at a dose of 0.5 g per day in combination with chloroquine at 0.6 g per day for three days resulted in a high level of day 28 treatment failures in a study in India (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-74841" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 74841</LINK>) compared with a sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine/chloroquine combination (RR 6.10, 95% CI 2.21 to 16.87), and a combination of chloroquine and 1 g of azithromycin per day (RR 2.96, 95% CI 1.00 to 8.75). This led to the premature termination of the 0.5 g azithromycin/chloroquine arm in all Pfizer sponsored trials (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-82576" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 82576</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-84227" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 84227</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-84240" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 84240</LINK>) at that time. The results of the 0.5 g azithromycin/chloroquine arm from the other studies before termination were not available.</P>
<P>The combination of an azithromycin dose of &#8804;0.5 g per day for three days in combination with artesunate or artemether did not perform well. Krudsood et al (<LINK REF="STD-Krudsood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Krudsood 2000</LINK>) report an increased risk of day 28 treatment failures when the combination of 0.5 g azithromycin and artesunate for three days is compared with mefloquine/artesunate (RR 24.00, 95% CI 3.36 to 171.27), but not when compared with three days of artesunate monotherapy (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.14). Na-Bangchang et al report an increased risk of treatment failure when comparing the combination of azithromycin at 0.5 g for three days and artemether at 300 mg at start with doxycycline for five days and artemether in a higher dose (300 mg at start and 100 mg after 12 hours) (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.76) (<LINK REF="STD-Na_x002d_Bangchang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Na-Bangchang 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cure rates using an azithromycin dose of 0.5 mg ranged from 15% (95% CI 5% to 35%, in combination with artemether; <LINK REF="STD-Na_x002d_Bangchang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Na-Bangchang 1996</LINK>) to 66% (95% CI 53% to 78%, in combination with chloroquine; <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-74841" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 74841</LINK>). A higher cure rate of 86% (95% CI 42% to 99%, in combination with chloroquine) was reported among seven adult participants in Africa (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-82576" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 82576</LINK>).</P>
<P>When using azithromycin doses of 1 g per day or higher, no difference was seen in treatment failures when comparing azithromycin/quinine combinations (different dose regimens for three or five days) with a doxycycline/quinine combination for seven days (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2006</LINK>) or azithromycin/artesunate combinations for three days (different dose regimens) (<LINK REF="STD-Noedl-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Noedl 2006</LINK>) in Thailand, but sample sizes were small (&lt; 30 participants).</P>
<P>Azithromycin doses of &gt; 1 g per day for three days (1.5 g per day in Bangladesh, and 20 mg/kg/day among children in Tanzania) in combination with artesunate were associated with increased treatment failure compared to artemether-lumefantrine (pooled RR 3.08, 95% CI 2.09 to 4.55; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Thriemer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Thriemer 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dunne et al in India showed reduced treatment failure for the combination of 1 g azithromycin daily for three days and chloroquine (the standard dose of 0.6 g on day 1 and 2, and 0.3 g on day 3) versus chloroquine alone (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.18) or azithromycin alone (1 g daily for three days: RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.20) (<LINK REF="STD-Dunne-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Dunne 2005b</LINK>). A 1 g azithromycin/chloroquine combination (1 g azithromycin and 0.6 g chloroquine daily for three days) was associated with increased treatment failure in India and Indonesia compared with the combination sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine/chloroquine (pooled RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.25 to 5.67; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-74841" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 74841</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-84240" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 84240</LINK>) and compared with the combination atovaquone-proguanil in a multi-site trial in Columbia and Surinam (RR 48.43, 95% CI<B> </B>6.80 to 344.84) (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-84227" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 84227</LINK>). No increased risk on treatment failure was seen in two multi-country studies in Africa with mefloquine (750 mg at start, followed by 500 mg after six to 10 hours) as comparator drug (pooled RR 2.02, 95% CI 0.51 to 7.98, P = 0.3; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-82576" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 82576</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-367653" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 367653</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of the seven studies that followed participants until day 42, three studies reported their day 42 results. For one study, this was not for the evaluable study population (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-84240" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 84240</LINK>); the results of the other two studies are presented in <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>. The pooled RR for the combination of azithromycin and artesunate versus artemether-lumefantrine on day 42 was 1.90 (95% CI 1.44 to 2.49, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>PCR-adjusted failure rates by day 28</B>
</P>
<P>PCR-adjusted (partially) failure rates were available for eight studies. For the two studies in Africa comparing the 1 g azithromycin/chloroquine combination with mefloquine monotherapy, there was sufficient information to repeat the meta-analysis with PCR-adjusted data. The pooled RR was 1.01 (95% CI 0.18 to 5.87), suggesting there was no difference in treatment failure among the two treatment regimens (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-82576" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 82576</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-367653" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 367653</LINK>). However, the fact that the RR decreased from 2.02 to 1.01 may indicate there were more new infections in the azithromycin/chloroquine group and that post-treatment prophylaxis is shorter with azithromycin/chloroquine than with mefloquine. For the two studies comparing azithromycin/artesunate with artemether-lumefantrine, the PCR-adjusted pooled RR on day 28 was 3.63 (95% CI 2.02 to 6.52, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>); on day 42 it was 2.47 (95% CI 1.53 to 3.99, <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> shows the treatment efficacy and 95% CI for each drug regimen in order of increasing azithromycin dose, using PCR-adjusted data where available. Depending on location and combination drug, there is a tendency for improved efficacy with increasing azithromycin dose. Overall, the highest efficacy level was observed in studies in Africa with a 1.0 g azithromycin/chloroquine combination among adults. However, the only study in African children &lt; five years so far, which used an equivalent or higher azithromycin dose in combination with artesunate, showed insufficient efficacy.</P>
<P>
<B>Fever and parasite clearance</B>
</P>
<P>Six and eight studies reported data on fever and parasite clearance, respectively, although 12 and 13 studies, respectively, mentioned that this information would be collected. The available data was insufficient for meta-analysis and is presented in Table 4 and Table 5. Drug combinations with artesunate tended to have shorter fever and parasite clearance times compared with other combinations. Asexual parasite clearance was reported to be significantly shorter for atovaquone-proguanil compared with the 1 g azithromycin/chloroquine combination but the underlying data was not provided (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-84227" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 84227</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Gametocytes</B>
</P>
<P>Six studies reported gametocyte outcomes; information from one study could not be interpreted (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-84240" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 84240</LINK>). In India, azithromycin monotherapy for <I>P. vivax</I> resulted in more frequent gametocytaemia at day 7 (17 out of 95) compared with chloroquine (0 out of 99, P<I> </I>&lt; 0.001, <LINK REF="STD-Dunne-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Dunne 2005a</LINK>). In Thailand, Noedl et al did not see a difference in the mean gametocyte clearance time among the regimens used (azithromycin/artesunate combinations and azithromycin/quinine combinations, four arms) (<LINK REF="STD-Noedl-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Noedl 2006</LINK>). Gametocyte clearance was similar between a 1 g azithromycin/chloroquine combination and mefloquine monotherapy until day 28 in a study in Africa. On and beyond day 28, mefloquine showed a slightly higher gametocyte clearance rate than 1 g azithromycin/chloroquine (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-82576" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 82576</LINK>); unfortunately, the underlying data was not provided. No significant difference was seen in gametocyte clearance between 1 g azithromycin/chloroquine and atovaquone-proguanil in South America, although lower gametocytaemia clearance was reported with atovaquone-proguanil from week 3 onwards (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-84227" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 84227</LINK>). In the study among children and adults in Bangladesh, no difference in median gametocyte clearance was found between the azithromycin-artesunate and artemether-lumefantrine regimens (46.1 hours versus 97.2 hours, among 128 and 65 participants respectively; no interquartile range available) (<LINK REF="STD-Thriemer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Thriemer 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Morbidity other than clinical malaria (eg diarrhoea, respiratory tract infections) up to 28 days</B>
</P>
<P>There was not enough systematic information in the trials to assess this secondary outcome. One trial reported a higher occurrence of upper respiratory tract infections among participants in the control group using artemether-lumefantrine compared to the azithromycin-artesunate arm (9.5% among 65 participants versus 2.3% among 128 participants respectively, P = 0.06, <LINK REF="STD-Thriemer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Thriemer 2010</LINK>). Diarrhoea is discussed under specific adverse events.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events (All studies)</HEADING>
<P>Details of the safety reporting methods used and the inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. Entry criteria were rigorous for some studies, limiting the amount of adverse effects that can be expected. Ten studies excluded subjects with an allergy to study drugs, ten studies excluded persons with abnormal laboratory tests, and seven studies excluded persons with severe vomiting. As reported before, pregnant women were excluded in all studies. Three studies did not provide any baseline information. For the other studies, the presented baseline information was comparable between arms, except for the open label arm of 1 g azithromycin/chloroquine in the early study in India (<LINK REF="STD-Dunne-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Dunne 2005b</LINK>), where a lower baseline parasite density was reported. Four studies did not report the procedures used to monitor adverse events. In four studies, the denominator of the study population for the evaluation of adverse events was not reported. Six studies used placebos.</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse events overall</B>
</P>
<P>The number of persons with any adverse events are presented in Table 6, and reported in terms of 'treatment related' (TR) and 'any cause' (AC) adverse events where this information was provided. TR adverse events are events which in the opinion of the investigators (of the trial) are likely, probably, or possibly related to the intervention the participant received. A participant can have more than one adverse event, and the last columns indicate the total number of adverse events which were reported by arm; the denominator here is the number of subjects, with the average number of adverse events per person in brackets.</P>
<P>No clear difference in frequency of adverse events was detected in studies involving <I>P. vivax </I>(Table 6)<I>; </I>in one study the frequency of adverse events tended to be lower in the azithromycin arm (<LINK REF="STD-Dunne-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Dunne 2005a</LINK>), whereas in the other study they tended to be higher (<LINK REF="STD-Pukrittayakamee-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pukrittayakamee 2001</LINK>)<I>. </I>
</P>
<P>The open label arm of the 1 g azithromycin/chloroquine combination in the early study in India reported less adverse events compared to the (blinded) chloroquine (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.70) or azithromycin (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.82) monotherapy arms (<LINK REF="STD-Dunne-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Dunne 2005b</LINK>). The azithromycin/artesunate combinations had less TR adverse events compared to the azithromycin/quinine combinations in Thailand (<LINK REF="STD-Noedl-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Noedl 2006</LINK>); the azithromycin/artemether combination had less AC adverse events compared to doxycycline/artemether in the same country (<LINK REF="STD-Na_x002d_Bangchang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Na-Bangchang 1996</LINK>). No difference was seen in adverse events when the 1 g azithromycin/ chloroquine combination was compared with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine/chloroquine; however, the information on adverse events in studies using sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine/chloroquine was very limited (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-74841" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 74841</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-84240" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 84240</LINK>). More adverse events were reported in the 1 g azithromycin/chloroquine combination arm compared with mefloquine (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.50; <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-82576" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 82576</LINK>) or atovaquone-proguanil (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.83; <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-84227" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 84227</LINK>) in placebo-controlled studies. This was not seen in the open-label study comparing 1 g azithromycin/chloroquine to mefloquine (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.37; <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-367653" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 367653</LINK>). The pooled RR for TR adverse events when comparing the 1 g azithromycin/chloroquine combination with mefloquine was 1.20, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.36 (Analysis 2.1, <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-82576" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 82576</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-367653" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 367653</LINK>). No difference in adverse events was detected in the studies comparing azithromycin/artesunate versus artemether-lumefantrine.</P>

<B>Serious adverse events and discontinuations</B>
</P>
<P>Serious adverse events and discontinuations are presented in Table 7, with a distinction between TR adverse events and AC adverse events, where this information was provided. We also included any other adverse events reported for laboratory tests or physical examination. Types of serious adverse events are presented in the last column. There were no deaths, and no significant differences between regimens for serious adverse events and discontinuations. Some laboratory abnormalities were reported, but these all seemed transient.</P>
<P>
<B>Specific adverse events</B>
</P>
<P>Where this information was available, we summarized findings for specific adverse events in Table 8. Because different doses of azithromycin were used over the different trials, we assessed the occurrence of a dose-response relationship for azithromycin. We were able to explore this for nausea (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>), vomiting (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>), diarrhoea (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>), and pruritis (<LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>). A higher prevalence of nausea (33.0% or 33/100) was reported among participants using 2 g azithromycin/chloroquine (open label study in Columbia/India) compared to participants using 1 g azithromycin/chloroquine (9.6% or 11/114 in placebo controlled trial, RR 3.1, 95% CI 1.7 to 5.8, and 11.5% or 13/113 in open label trial, RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 4.7, comparing 2 g versus 1 g azithromycin dose). No consistent difference was detected for the other adverse events examined. Although <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK> suggested there might be an association between azithromycin dose and nausea, this did not seem to translate into vomiting (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). No dose-response relationship was apparent for diarrhoea (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>), and pruritis was mainly reported in studies in Africa and South America (<LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-01-17 14:23:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review covers azithromycin efficacy and safety data for uncomplicated malaria among participants from controlled trials across malaria endemic regions in Africa, South America, and Asia conducted over a 14-year period. Overall, the reviewed studies show the evidence is scattered, variable in quality, and with a considerable risk of bias; additionally, there are substantial gaps in knowledge.</P>
<P>For <I>P. vivax</I> there is simply insufficient data, with only two studies available. From the evidence provided, azithromycin is inadequate as a monotherapy for <I>P. vivax </I>using a dose of 0.5 to1 g per day for three days, and, like other antimalarial antibiotics, has no apparent effect on the <I>P. vivax</I> hypnozoites.</P>
<P>For uncomplicated <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria, the evidence covered a wide variety of dose regimens, partner drugs, and comparators, although the varied reporting quality and low adherence to the widely recommended CONSORT guidelines for the reporting of clinical trials complicated assessment of the evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Hopewell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopewell 2008</LINK>). The available data suggest that azithromycin has weak dose-dependent antimalarial activity and is not efficacious as a monotherapy. The current evidence does not support firm conclusions about the use of azithromycin as part of combination therapy for treating uncomplicated <I>P. falciparum. </I>The wide variety of involved treatment arms limited meta-analyses, but individual trial results showed that the efficacy of a combination of 1 g azithromycin/chloroquine for three days was significantly lower when compared with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine/chloroquine in Asian adults or atovaquone-proguanil in South American adults, and equivalent when compared to mefloquine in African adults. Compared with artemether-lumefantrine, one of the WHO recommended ACTs (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_RBM-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/RBM 2006</LINK>), a higher dose of azithromycin (1.1 to 1.5 g/day for three days) in combination with artesunate was inadequate among African children and inferior among adults in Bangladesh. Only studies of the azithromycin/chloroquine combination among adults in Africa (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-367653" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 367653</LINK>) and one study in India/Colombia had an efficacy level &gt; 95% and a lower 95% CI limit of 90% or above, which is the recommended cure rate for a new antimalarial medicine to be considered for policy (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_RBM-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/RBM 2006</LINK>). For the azithromycin/chloroquine combination, 2 g azithromycin per day for three days may be needed to reach universal cure rates in excess of 90%, but this may not be as well tolerated as 1 g/day.</P>
<P>There were no differences in serious adverse events among the regimens used. There was no difference in adverse events overall when comparing azithromycin/chloroquine with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine/chloroquine (Asia), but there were significantly more adverse events when comparing azithromycin/chloroquine with mefloquine (Africa) or atovaquone/proguanil (South America). Higher doses of azithromycin may result in nausea, but not necessarily vomiting (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). However, a note of caution should be mentioned, because different studies have different systems and rigor regarding the detection of adverse events and so comparing adverse events between studies is not as reliable as comparing adverse events between different arms of the same study.</P>
<P>Besides the standard challenges to meta-analysis in Cochrane reviews related to variations in definitions, endpoints and study design between reviewed studies, two issues deserve specific mention. Over the past few years the assessment of efficacy of antimalarials with longer half-lives has moved towards the use of day 42 PCR-adjusted findings as the primary endpoint of interest (<LINK REF="REF-Stepniewska-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stepniewska 2004</LINK>). PCR-adjustment is particularly important in areas of high malaria transmission, where on the one hand a high rate of re-infection may mask successful clearance of the original infection, while on the other a higher background immunity of older children or adult participants may complement the drug treatment and may mask a low-grade level of drug resistance (<LINK REF="REF-White-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2002</LINK>). Of the 13 randomized trials for <I>P. falciparum</I>, three were conducted in an area without malaria transmission (Bangkok, Thailand), while (partial) PCR adjustment for day 28 was available for eight trials, including trials in Africa that were presumably conducted in areas of higher transmission. Although seven studies reportedly followed patients until day 42, those outcomes were not presented in the publications for five of these studies.The half life of azithromycin (approximately 60 hours or 2.5 days) suggests that treatment failures are likely to occur by day 28, but the day 28 PCR-adjusted rates may underestimate the true failure rates. The RR for the azithromycin-combination compared with a comparator drug may also depend on the pharmacokinetic qualities of the comparator drug, eg if this is a short-acting or a long-acting drug, or a drug with a post-treatment prophylactic effect.</P>
<P>This review is also defined by the fact that almost half of the reviewed trial information originated from publicly-available trial synopses prepared by the manufacturer Pfizer. The company has made a commendable effort to provide public access to their unpublished research findings on azithromycin, allowing us to include the majority of relevant azithromycin treatment trials in this review. Although these synopses are limited in the amount of detail and did not go through the standard peer review process, they make up a substantial proportion of the available 'azithromycin for malaria' literature. The reported methodology sections in the manuscripts and trial synopses frequently lacked the required level of detail to assess the quality of the trials. Pfizer and authors of non-Pfizer-related articles were contacted for additions, clarification and verification of the quality, methods and data where needed, which was partially obtained.</P>
<P>One study, conducted between 1998 and 2001, needs specific mention from a methodological perspective. The promising results of this study for the 1 g/day azithromycin dose in combination with chloroquine (<LINK REF="STD-Dunne-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Dunne 2005b</LINK>) likely guided Pfizer&#8217;s subsequent efforts to assess the antimalarial properties of azithromycin, but we had serious quality concerns: the azithromycin/chloroquine combination arm was not blind and was not conducted concurrently with the other arms. This suggests that randomization may not have occurred for this last arm, and technically this arm could be excluded from this review. Results may indeed have been somewhat biased, as the enrolment parasitaemia of the last arm was lower compared to the other arms and enrolment parasite density is a well-known determinant of treatment outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Stepniewska-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stepniewska 2004</LINK>). In addition, the outcome assessment appeared subjective ("Any participant who, in the opinion of the investigator, had not sufficiently improved received additional antimalarial therapy"). This may have contributed to the higher efficacy level observed in the initial study in India compared to the later study in the same country.</P>
<P>The variation in assessed azithromycin doses and treatment arms for the azithromycin-chloroquine combinations that followed the initial Indian study in part depicts the product development and dose-optimisation process Pfizer undertook to adapt a widely used antimicrobial for an antimalarial application. Unfortunately, although there are guidelines for assessing drug efficacy, there are no clear guidelines for the development and field assessment of optimal antimalarial doses and dose regimens for programmatic conditions, taking into account efficacy and safety as well as costs, user-friendliness, and long-term prospects, particularly the potential for drug resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2008</LINK>). It is increasingly being recognized that new antimalarial candidates may not achieve their full potential in terms of impact and useful life-span because of a lack of attention to dose-optimization, and a tendency to select, register and market doses at the lower end of the therapeutic range, which before long fuel the development of resistance.</P>
<P>The assessed azithromycin doses, observed dose-dependency, and regional variation in efficacy illustrate this issue (Figure 2). Sub-optimal results were obtained among adults in India, Colombia, Surinam, and Indonesia when a 1 g azithromycin/chloroquine combination was used; however, this same dose and combination performed well in Africa, where a higher level of pre-existing antimalarial immunity in adult study participants may have contributed to high clearance rates. A relatively high dose of 1.2 g azithromycin per day in combination with artesunate was insufficient for African children, confirming the likely role of pre-existing immunity in the observed difference in parasite clearance. The level of background chloroquine resistance in the study area will also have contributed to the difference in the azithromycin/chloroquine combination; in areas with a high level of chloroquine resistance, the combination is effectively reduced to an azithromycin monotherapy. In addition, the effect of dose may depend on a patient's weight, with higher treatment failure rates reported in heavier subjects in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-74841" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 74841</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-82576" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 82576</LINK>). A recent single arm study using a high dose of azithromycin (2 g/day for three days) in combination with chloroquine did show a higher efficacy in a multi-site study in adults in India and Columbia (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-282919" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 282919</LINK>), suggesting that a 2 g azithromycin dose may be needed to achieve universal high efficacy. This higher azithromycin dose seemed less well tolerated, however, and was associated with an increased risk of nausea, but not vomiting or diarrhoea (Figures 3 to 5). The reported incidence of nausea and vomiting with 2 g azithromycin/chloroquine  (30% and 18%, respectively) was higher than in a study using a single 2 g dose of azithromycin for community-based pneumonia or acute sinusitis among adults (4% and 1%, respectively) (<LINK REF="REF-Pfizer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfizer 2008</LINK>). Apart from differences in monitoring, it is possible that the duration of therapy and the malarial illness may have contributed to the higher occurrence of these adverse events.</P>
<P>A cumulative dose of 3 to 6 g of azithromycin is relatively high compared with other applications of azithromycin. Lower doses are used for bacterial infections (eg 500 mg per day for three days) and single treatments of azithromycin with 1 to 2 g have been used successfully for treating otitis media among children (a dose of 30 mg/kg once up to a maximum of 2 g), community-acquired pneumonia among adults (one single dose of 2 g), acute bacterial sinusitis among adults (one single dose of 2 g), and sexually-transmitted diseases (one single dose of 1 g) (<LINK REF="REF-Pfizer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfizer 2008</LINK>). In bacteria, macrolides such as azithromycin and erythromycin bind to the 50S ribosomal subunit and inhibit protein synthesis, causing premature detachment of incomplete peptide chains and subsequent cell death (<LINK REF="REF-Retsema-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Retsema 2001</LINK>). In bacterial infections, azithromycin works effectively because it concentrates in tissues and white blood cells; neutrophils can become vehicles for drug delivery at a site of infection and a higher dose can enhance drug efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Blumer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Retsema-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Retsema 2001</LINK>). For malaria, higher and longer treatment doses are needed because of a different mechanism of action: azithromycin affects the 'house keeping' function of the apicoplast in the progeny, causing 'delayed death' (<LINK REF="REF-Dahl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahl 2008</LINK>). The apicoplast is an organelle in the plasmodium; its function is currently unclear , but it is thought to have an origin in prokaryotes. Although malaria parasites directly exposed to azithromycin do not seem to be functionally affected, and can go on to invade an erythrocyte and develop into a schizont, these schizonts are unable to form functional merozoites and will subsequently die (<LINK REF="REF-Dahl-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dahl 2008</LINK>). A higher efficacy of azithromycin can be expected when at least two asexual cycles (approximately 96 hours) have occurred (<LINK REF="REF-Biswas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biswas 2001</LINK>), which might translate into a four-day course of azithromycin. Given the relatively slow and weak antimalarial action of azithromycin, the use of this drug for case-management would need to rely heavily on combination with a fast-acting efficacious antimalarial such as a member of the artemisinin group (<LINK REF="REF-Noedl-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noedl 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In vitro studies have produced conflicting results for interactions of azithromycin combinations: Edgie-Mark et al (2009) reported indifference between azithromycin and chloroquine, whereas others indicated that there may be an additive or synergistic effect of the combination (<LINK REF="REF-Edgie_x002d_Mark-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edgie-Mark 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nakornchai-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakornchai 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noedl-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noedl 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohrt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohrt 2002</LINK> ). But the level of azithromycin-chloroquine interaction may depend on the background resistance level of the <I>P. falciparum</I> strain to chloroquine (<LINK REF="REF-Ohrt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohrt 2002</LINK>). For the azithromycin-artesunate combination, antagonism has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Nakornchai-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakornchai 2006</LINK>), whereas an additive to synergistic interaction was reported for azithromycin-dihydroartemisinin by Noedl et al (2007) and an additive with a trend for antagonism was reported by Ohrt et al (2002) (<LINK REF="REF-Noedl-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noedl 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohrt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohrt 2002</LINK>). An additive effect has been reported for azithromycin-mefloquine (<LINK REF="REF-Nakornchai-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakornchai 2006</LINK>), and an additive to synergistic effect for azithromycin-quinine, azithromycin-pyroniradine, azithromycin-tafenoquine, and azithromycin-primaquine (<LINK REF="REF-Nakornchai-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakornchai 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noedl-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noedl 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohrt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohrt 2002</LINK>). Thus far, azithromycin has mainly been combined with chloroquine. A few studies in Thailand assessed other azithromycin combinations for <I>P. falciparum</I>, but, except for the study by Krudsood and colleagues, these had relatively small sample sizes (30 participants or less per arm) (<LINK REF="STD-Krudsood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Krudsood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Na_x002d_Bangchang-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Na-Bangchang 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noedl-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Noedl 2006</LINK> ). The studies where azithromycin was combined with artesunate did not show promising results compared with artemether-lumefantrine.</P>
<P>Given the weak antimalarial properties and low prospects as a competitor drug for the current range of ACTs, the remaining interest in an azithromycin combination seems mainly based on its appealing safety profile. This would allow two potential niche applications among pregnant women and children: intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) and use as a potential syndromic treatment, eg for malaria and respiratory tract infections in children and malaria and sexually-transmitted diseases in pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-Chico-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chico 2008</LINK>). Findings in this review were mainly based on adult males and care should be taken when extrapolating efficacy and tolerability findings from adults to a paediatric or pregnant population, whose different pharmacokinetic profiles may require different doses. However, the two studies which included children and compared an azithromycin/artesunate combination with an azithromycin dose of &gt; 1 g per day with artemether-lumefantrine showed that the azithromycin/artesunate combination was three times more likely to result in failure (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Two more paediatric studies are in analysis or ongoing in African countries (<LINK REF="STD-Pfizer-677833" TYPE="STUDY">Pfizer 677833</LINK>: Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Zambia, a comparison of fixed-dose azithromycin/chloroquine versus artemether-lumefantrine; NIAID 379821: Malawi, comparison of azithromycin/chloroquine versus chloroquine alone, chloroquine and artesunate, and chloroquine and malarone), assessing azithromycin doses ranging from 20 to 30 mg/kg/day for three days. This is equivalent to 1.2 to 1.8 g in a person of 60 kg. Findings from these studies will be included in a future update of this review.</P>
<P>A small study in Malawi evaluated the usefulness of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine in combination with 1 g azithromycin per day for two days for treating uncomplicated malaria in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Kalilani-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalilani 2007</LINK>). This combination resulted in fewer recrudescent episodes when compared to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine monotherapy, but the authors reported one abortion that was possibly related to treatment, four days after exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Kalilani-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalilani 2007</LINK>). Azithromycin monotherapy has been evaluated for malaria prophylaxis among healthy, non-pregnant, semi-immune adults in doses ranging from 250 mg daily to 1000 mg weekly. The reported prophylactic efficacy ranged from 98% to99% for <I>P. vivax</I> in two studies with a total of 327 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Heppner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heppner 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1999</LINK>), and 64% to 83% for <I>P. falciparum</I> in three studies with a total of 444 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heppner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heppner 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1999</LINK>). For <I>P. vivax</I>, the results were better than the treatment results of azithromycin monotherapy for clinical malaria. When considering the drug for IPT in pregnancy, azithromycin is not optimal given the need for a longer duration of treatment. This may cause substantial challenges for adherence, driving resistance. In addition, the combination of azithromycin with chloroquine is not ideal for IPT, given the efforts by countries to remove chloroquine from the national shelves in favour of ACTs (<LINK REF="REF-Sipilanyambe-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sipilanyambe 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>), and the problems with adherence and adverse events such as pruritis, which are well-described in the African region (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2004</LINK>). As resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine is increasing and the effective lifespan of IPT with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine may be coming to an end (<LINK REF="REF-Ter-Kuile-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ter Kuile 2007</LINK>), plans are underway to test a 1 g azithromycin/chloroquine combination as a fixed-dose option for IPTp (IPT for pregnant women) in Africa (Dr. Chandra, personal communication, <LINK REF="REF-Chico-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chico 2008</LINK>). Given the above dose-dependent data in non-pregnant adults, and the challenges to successful implementation, this may not be a potential niche product just yet.</P>

<P>The available evidence suggests that azithromycin has relatively weak antimalarial activity.</P>
<P>Given the availability of highly efficacious and cheaper first and second line antimalarials, there does not seem to be a place for wide-scale programmatic use of the assessed azithromycin-chloroquine combinations and the azithromycin-artesunate combination for case-management of uncomplicated <I>P. falciparum</I> malaria (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_RBM-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/RBM 2006</LINK>); there is insufficient data available on the use of azithromycin with other partner drugs.</P>
<P>The available evidence is very limited. The main reasons for this are the small number of studies using the same treatment combination, azithromycin dose and comparison group; uncertainty over trial methodological quality; the sub-optimal results reported so far, mainly with chloroquine; and the availability of superior alternatives in the form of ACTs. In addition, the current cost of azithromycin would be a barrier as well: a treatment course of 1 g azithromycin/0.6 g chloroquine for three days was estimated at $7 (<LINK REF="REF-Chico-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chico 2008</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-01-17 10:10:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While the current evidence is insufficient for policy makers, the fact that azithromycin has a different mechanism of action to other antimalarials, together with its safety profile, may offer treatment options for pregnant women and children; for example, there may be opportunities to use it for a syndromic approach that could be explored further.</P>
<P>We also understand that Pfizer is working on optimizing the drug formulation in order to overcome some of the described challenges. Unless those efforts are fruitful, however, the current move towards a &#8216;low&#8217; 1 g dose azithromycin/chloroquine fixed-dose product focusing on IPTp may be somewhat impetuous. Furthermore, the need for a treatment course lasting several days (and the potential for pruritis when combined with chloroquine) poses a considerable challenge for wide-scale use as IPTp.</P>
<P>Given the limited data, and the potential further improvements in drug formulation, it remains important to explore further the use of azithromycin in combination with fast-acting drugs with different mechanisms of action for case management, or in combination with other medium/long-acting drugs for IPT, or at higher daily doses. For case management, exploration of a twice daily versus once daily regimen may be worthwhile to assess if such a regimen would reduce nausea when used in combination with other antimalarials.</P>
<P>In conclusion, azithromycin is a weak antimalarial with some appealing characteristics. Unless it overcomes some of the highlighted challenges and finds a specific niche that is complementary to the current scala of more efficacious antimalarial combinations, its future as an antimalarial does not look promising.</P>

<P>Although we initially intended to assess the possibility of subgroup analysis by species of malaria, it proved irrelevant to compare studies for <I>P. vivax</I> directly with studies for <I>P. falciparum</I> given the different efficacy of the drugs used for these species. We decided instead to keep all data stratified by malaria species. The trials excluded for meta-analyses were included in the assessment of adverse events and drug efficacy, because they provided valuable information for these outcomes. We believe that excluding these trials would deprive the reader of a complete overview of the topic. This review was conducted over several years and because of the adoption of new methods by the Cochrane group for assessing risk of bias, we changed our assessment accordingly using the revised guidelines in 2008.</P>

<P>A block randomization table of 10 QAZ to 2 QD subjects was generated. To improve power of the study, enrolment to a well-tolerated QAZ arm was increased with 10 (year 1). In the subsequent year's malaria season (year 2), an additional regimen with a higher daily azithromycin regimen was assessed without comparator. Thirty women were enrolled in year 1 in an azithromycin regimen, but there were 10 in the QD arm, whereas there should have been six.
