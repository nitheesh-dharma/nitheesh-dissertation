<P>Acquired severe aplastic anemia is rare. Stem cells from the bone marrow usually replace naturally dying blood cells in the peripheral blood. Severe aplastic anemia is probably caused by an irregular, attacking immune response against these blood producing stem cells within the body. If supplies are not maintained, functional blood cells are lacking and infections, bleeding, and exhaustion will occur. Patients may experience paleness, weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Disease progression is associated with severe infections, which are a major cause of death.</P>
<P>The transplantation of stem cells from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor without prior therapy (first-line therapy) is a treatment option for newly diagnosed patients with severe aplastic anemia. An HLA-matched sibling donor, a brother or a sister, serves as a donor of stem cells that carry identical (matched) genetic characteristics to the HLA genes. The harvested cells are transfused intravenously and produce new blood cells. Problems may arise when the cells do not settle down sufficiently to produce blood cells (graft failure) or if the donor immune cells recognize body cells of the recipient as foreign and attack them (graft-versus-host disease). Both problems may lead to early death.</P>
<P>The application of the drugs ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin as immunosuppressive therapy without prior therapy (i.e. as first-line therapy) is an alternative to transplantation and can be used for patients where no HLA-matched sibling donor is found. Immunosuppressive therapy means the drugs suppress reactions of the immune system. The aim is to reduce abnormal immune reactions. Problems may arise when patients do not respond well or show no response at all.</P>
<P>We identified three studies meeting our quality criteria for inclusion in the review. All had methodological limitations meaning that we could not draw firm conclusions. With respect to the primary outcomes, they showed ambiguous results for overall mortality when comparing treatment arms: one study favored transplantation and two studies favored treatment with ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin. Treatment-related mortality, that is death caused by complications of the treatment, was considerable for patients in the transplantation arm. Treatment failure, that is no response to treatment, was substantial for patients in the ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin arm. Graft failure was reported for 3% to 16% and graft-versus-host-disease for 26% to 51% of the transplanted patients. Because the data are scarce and biased it is not possible to determine which treatment is better - transplantation for HLA-matched sibling donors or ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin for patients that do not have such a sibling.</P>
<P>Several reasons make it highly probable that there will not be any good evidence comparing these interventions in the future. One reason is that randomized controlled trials are unlikely to be conducted due to ethical constraints and strong patient and clinician preferences. Studies with 'Mendelian randomization' could provide some good evidence in theory, however, in practice they are difficult to conduct properly and have been disappointing. 'Mendelian randomization' means the view that nature itself has already 'randomized' the paternal and maternal part of a gene given that donor and recipient are siblings. Another reason is that the outcome of transplantation has improved considerably. This is true for matched donor transplantation including both related and unrelated donors. It means that ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin may not be a first treatment choice if a matched sibling or even a matched unrelated donor is available.</P>

<P>Acquired severe aplastic anemia is a rare and potentially fatal disease, which is characterized by hypocellular bone marrow and pancytopenia. The major signs and symptoms are severe infections, bleeding, and exhaustion. First-line allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor (MSD) is a treatment for newly diagnosed patients with severe aplastic anemia. First-line treatment with ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin (as first-line immunosuppressive therapy) is an alternative to MSD-HSCT and is indicated for patients where no MSD is found.</P>

<P>To evaluate the effectiveness and adverse events of first-line allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of HLA-matched sibling donors compared to first-line immunosuppressive therapy including ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin in patients with acquired severe aplastic anemia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-07-10 12:35:05 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the electronic databases MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and <I>The Cochrane Library</I> CENTRAL (Wiley) for published articles from 1946 to 22 April 2013. Further searches included trial registries, reference lists of recent reviews, and author contacts.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-07-01 10:10:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The following prospective study designs were eligible for inclusion: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials if the allocation of patients to treatment groups was consistent with 'Mendelian randomization'. We included participants with newly diagnosed severe aplastic anemia who received MSD-HSCT or immunosuppressive therapy without prior HSCT or immunosuppressive therapy, and with a minimum of five participants per treatment group. We did not apply limits on publication year or languages.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-07-01 10:10:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors abstracted the data on study and patient characteristics and assessed the risk of bias independently. We resolved differences by discussion or by appeal to a third review author. The primary outcome was overall mortality. Secondary outcomes were treatment-related mortality, graft failure, no response to first-line immunosuppressive therapy, graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), relapse after initial successful treatment, secondary clonal and malignant disease, health-related quality of life, and performance score.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-10 12:35:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified three trials that met the inclusion criteria. None of these trials was a RCT. 302 participants are included in this review. The three included studies were prospectively conducted and had features consistent with the principle of 'Mendelian randomization' as defined in the present review. All studies had a high risk of bias due to the study design. All studies were conducted more than 10 years ago and may not be applicable to the standard of care of today. Primary and secondary outcome data showed no statistically significant difference between treatment groups. We present results for first-line allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of an HLA-matched sibling donor, which we denote as the MSD-HSCT group, versus first-line treatment with ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin, which we denote as the immunosuppressive therapy group in the following section.</P>
<P>The pooled hazard ratio for overall mortality for the MSD-HSCT group versus the immunosuppressive therapy group was 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.43 to 2.12, P = 0.90, low quality evidence). Therefore, overall mortality was not statistically significantly different between the groups. Treatment-related mortality ranged from 20% to 42% for the MSD-HSCT group and was not reported for the immunosuppressive therapy group (very low quality evidence). The authors reported graft failure from 3% to 16% for the MSD-HSCT group and GVHD from 26% to 51% (both endpoints not applicable for the immunosuppressive therapy group, very low quality evidence). The authors did not report any data on response and relapse for the MSD-HSCT group. For the immunosuppressive therapy group, the studies reported no response from 15% (not time point stated) to 64% (three months) and relapse in one of eight responders after immunosuppressive therapy at 5.5 years (very low quality evidence). The authors reported secondary clonal disease or malignancies for the MSD-HSCT group versus the immunosuppressive therapy group in 1 of 34 versus 0 of 22 patients in one study and in 0 of 28 versus 4 of 86 patients in the other study (low quality evidence). None of the included studies addressed health-related quality of life. The percentage of the evaluated patients with a Karnofsky performance status score in the range of 71% to 100% was 92% in the MSD-HSCT group and 46% in the immunosuppressive therapy group.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-01 10:11:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are insufficient and biased data that do not allow any conclusions to be made about the comparative effectiveness of first-line allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of an HLA-matched sibling donor and first-line treatment with ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin (as first-line immunosuppressive therapy). We are unable to make firm recommendations regarding the choice of intervention for treatment of acquired severe aplastic anemia.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Acquired severe aplastic anemia is a rare (<LINK REF="REF-GARD-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">GARD 2012</LINK>) and potentially fatal disease which is characterized by hypocellular bone marrow and pancytopenia; it mainly affects young adults. The incidence rate of aplastic anemia is estimated at 0.7 to 4.1 per million people per year (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufman 2006</LINK>). The age-standardized incidence rate (West Germany in 1987) is estimated at 2 per million children younger than 15 years of age per year (<LINK REF="REF-GCCR-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">GCCR 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pathophysiology</HEADING>
<P>The underlying pathophysiology is thought to be an aberrant immune response involving the T-cell mediated destruction of hematopoietic stem cells. In most cases, the cause is unknown, although various triggers such as drugs, radiation, toxins, and viruses have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Brodsky-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodsky 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Killick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Killick 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Young-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Signs and symptoms</HEADING>
<P>The major signs and symptoms are severe infections, bleeding, and exhaustion. Infections are caused by the diminished number of granulocytes and lymphocytes to prevent bacteria and viruses. The risk of spontaneous, longer-lasting and major bleeding increases the lower the level of platelets. Physical and mental exhaustion goes along with the reduced ability of the red blood cells to transport oxygen as the major energy source. Patients may experience paleness, weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Disease progression is associated with severe infections, which are a major cause of death.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnostic criteria</HEADING>
<P>Diagnosis is established by full blood count and bone marrow biopsy and aspirate, all of which also serve to exclude other possible causes of aplasia, and/or peripheral pancytopenia (<LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2009</LINK>). A blood cell count of less than 0.5 G/L polymorphonuclear neutrophils is crucial for the diagnosis of severe aplastic anemia. A very low polymorphonuclear neutrophils count of less than 0.2 G/L may be called very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA), a subdivision of severe aplastic anemia. The diagnostic criteria used today derive from reports from the 1970s (<LINK REF="REF-Camitta-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camitta 1975</LINK>). Severe aplastic anemia should be clearly differentiated from other diseases with similar appearing blood cell counts, such as Fanconi anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, myelodysplastic syndromes, and secondary bone marrow failure by malignant bone marrow infiltration, for example leukemia (<LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2009</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Description of the procedure</HEADING>
<P>The impaired hematopoiesis, including the patients' dysfunctional immune cells, is destroyed by myeloablative chemotherapy. New healthy hematopoietic stem cells then need to be transferred. Usually, they are collected from an HLA-identical sibling donor. The harvested cells are transfused intravenously, flow through the body via the blood circulation system and end up in the bone marrow to nestle, grow, and produce a complete hematopoietic system including granulocytes, red blood cells, and platelets. Problems may arise when the cells do not settle down sufficiently to produce blood cells, which is called graft failure. The donor immune cells recognize epithelial cells of the recipient as foreign, which may lead to graft-versus-host disease. This may lead to serious organ toxicities. Therefore, the patient is exposed to immunosuppressive treatment to minimize a graft-versus-host reaction. The type of drugs, the standard dose, and the recommended duration of the conditioning regimen is listed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Indication</HEADING>
<P>According to the 2009 <I>Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aplastic anaemia</I> of the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (<LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2009</LINK>), first-line allogeneic HSCT from the bone marrow of an HLA-matched sibling donor (MSD) is regarded as the initial treatment of choice for newly diagnosed patients with severe aplastic anemia younger than 40 years. The harvesting of hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow is recommended rather than from mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (<LINK REF="REF-Schrezenmeier-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schrezenmeier 2007</LINK>). Radiation-based conditioning regimens are not recommended because of an increased risk of inducing secondary cancer and other unwanted effects, such as infertility or impairment of growth and development of children (<LINK REF="REF-Schrezenmeier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schrezenmeier 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Treatment failure and severe adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Graft failure may lead to early death. The conditioning regimen leads to hematological and non-hematological organ toxicities. Severe adverse events (SAE) such as acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), grade II to IV, and extensive chronic GVHD endanger the function of certain organs.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparator: first-line treatment with ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin (as first-line immunosuppressive therapy)</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Description of the procedure</HEADING>
<P>First-line treatment with ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin (as first-line immunosuppressive therapy) means the suppression of reactions of the immune system by the specific drugs: ciclosporin alone, antithymocyte globulin alone, antilymphocyte globulin alone, or ciclosporin combined with either antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin. First-line means that patients have not received immunosuppressive therapy or any hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before except replacement of blood cells. Other substances that affect the immune reaction, such as corticosteroids, are not included. The aim is to reduce the abnormal immune reaction of the patient against their own hematopoiesis. When successful, the hematopoiesis of the patient can recover to the extent that they can lead a normal life. Immunosuppressive therapy may have a curative potential but probably a lower frequency than MSD-HSCT. The long immune suppression may be associated with adverse events. The type of drugs, the standard dose, and the recommended duration of treatment is listed in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Indication</HEADING>
<P>Immunosuppressive therapy is indicated for <I>younger</I> patients where no MSD is found, which can be expected for 70% of patients with severe aplastic anemia (<LINK REF="REF-Brodsky-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brodsky 2005</LINK>). Some of these patients respond to immunosuppressive therapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Treatment failure and adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Some patients do not respond well or show no response at all. A major risk of immunosuppressive therapy is the development of clonal diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Guinan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guinan 2009</LINK>). Frequent transfusions increase the risk of adverse events such as iron overload and early death.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-07-01 10:12:31 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The treatment of severe aplastic anemia mainly includes immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte/antilymphocyte globulin and/or cyclosporine, or MSD-HSCT. Clinical treatment algorithms have been suggested to assist decisions that satisfy individual conditions, personal preferences, and prognostic factors. Current recommendations are mainly based onthe results of analyses of secondary data such as bone marrow registries. MSD-HSCT is seen as the treatment of choice for <I>younger</I> patients with an HLA-matched sibling donor. This type of donor may only be available for about one-third of eligible patients. The upper age limit for transplantation is controversial because lack of co-morbidities may be associated with a favorable outcome in <I>older</I> patients. MSD-HSCT can cure severe aplastic anemia, however, it is associated with graft failure, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and organ toxicities. These severe adverse events can lead to treatment-related mortality.</P>
<P>Immunosuppressive therapy is regarded as an alternative treatment for patients without a suitable donor, for patients who do not favor MSD-HSCT, for those who have an increased risk due to impaired general health, comorbidities, or other health conditions incompatible with the stem cell transplantation procedure, and for <I>older</I> patients. Patients may not respond to immunosuppressive therapy at all, which can lead to early mortality. Extended immunosuppressive therapy may be associated with the development of clonal diseases later in life. Pre-treatment with immunosuppressive therapy and transfusion of blood products may have an unfavorable effect on the outcome of MSD-HSCT. First-line MSD-HSCT could prevent these additional risks. If a diagnosis of severe aplastic anemia is established at an early patient age, then it is crucial to know which treatment promises more benefit and less harm in the long run. Evidence based on randomized controlled trials is not available. Non-randomized controlled studies can differ substantially in their quality and have additional risks of bias. Thus, there is a need to search and appraise the evidence in a rigorous way to inform practice.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Rationale for including non-randomized clinical trials consistent with the principle of 'Mendelian randomization'</HEADING>
<P>There are ethical concerns around randomization of patients with severe aplastic anemia to transplantation versus non-transplantation. In general, MSD-HSCT is a life-threatening treatment that can lead to early severe adverse events including death. Acquired severe aplastic anemia is a rare disease and, according to the results of a previous literature search, currently there are no published RCTs available. However, there are considerable numbers of studies with comparative data available.</P>

<LINK REF="REF-Gray-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Wheatley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wheatley 2004</LINK> described the potential of 'Mendelian randomization' to minimize bias when comparing MSD-HSCT with an alternative therapy. The base concept has been ascribed to <LINK REF="REF-Katan-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katan 1986</LINK>. 'Mendelian randomization' by definition accepts only siblings as transplant donors and these sibling donors are required to have 'identical' or matched features of specific transplant-relevant HLA sites when compared with the transplant recipient. Therefore, patients with an HLA-matched sibling will be allocated to the MSD-HSCT group. On the other hand, patients with siblings that are not HLA compatible will be allocated to the immunosuppressive therapy group. The term 'Mendelian randomization' refers to the fact that the genetic distribution of paternal and maternal alleles follows a random process and is determined before birth. This concept takes advantage of an instrumental variable for allocating the patients to treatment groups and, at the same time, this variable is neither associated with the treatment nor associated with the outcome.</P>
<P>If this is true, then this allocation by HLA features of siblings can reduce bias. Bias is introduced when a perceived high risk or a certain age group affects the decision of the person who allocates patients to the treatment groups. We suppose that studies with a prospective design and application of the principles of 'Mendelian randomization' have a higher quality than other non-randomized studies. For this reason we included these studies after careful evaluation. Limitations of 'Mendelian randomization' are addressed in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>.</P>

<P>We included participants with newly diagnosed acquired severe aplastic anemia without prior HSCT or immunosuppressive therapy. This included idiosyncratic causes, such as idiopathic etiology, hepatitis, drugs and chemicals, and predictable causes, such as radiation or chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Killick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Killick 2000</LINK>). We have adopted the diagnostic criteria and classification of severity for severe aplastic anemia according to the guidelines of the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (<LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2009</LINK>). Severe aplastic anemia is characterized by a count of less than 0.5 G/L polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA), a subdivision of severe aplastic anemia, is characterized by a polymorphonuclear neutrophils count of less than 0.2 G/L. We did not set any age limits for participants.</P>

<P>Two review authors (FP, UG) independently abstracted data on study characteristics, patients and interventions, duration of follow-up, outcomes, and deviations from protocol. In addition, two review authors (FP, UG) independently assessed the risk of bias. We resolved differences between review authors by discussion or by appeal to a third review author (CB). All three included studies were full-text publications.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-07-01 10:13:57 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (FP, UG) independently assessed the risk of bias in the included studies using six criteria. We have used four criteria from The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011a</LINK>):</P>
<OL>
<LI>blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias);</LI>
<LI>incomplete outcome data such as missing data (attrition bias);</LI>
<LI>selective reporting such as not reporting pre-specified outcomes (reporting bias); and</LI>
<LI>other sources of bias such as bias related to the specific study design and competing interest.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We extended the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias with two additional criteria that are specific to the inclusion criteria for the present review and critical for confidence in results:</P>
<OL>
<LI>comparable baseline characteristics; and</LI>
<LI>concurrent control.</LI>
</OL>
<P>As all studies were supposed to apply 'Mendelian randomization', we removed the criteria random sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), and blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) because these criteria are determined by the study design. The process of allocation of alleles is a random process of nature and is therefore concealed (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2010</LINK>). Blinding of participants and personnel does not seem possible with respect to MSD-HSCT and immunosuppressive therapy. We would not have applied the removal of these items in the case of RCTs.</P>
<P>We applied The Cochrane Collaboration's criteria for judging risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011b</LINK>). In general, a 'low risk' of bias judgement indicates that the bias is unlikely to seriously alter the results, for example, participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment. A 'high risk' of bias judgement indicates that the bias seriously weakens confidence in the results, for example, participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments. An 'unclear' risk of bias judgement indicates that the bias raises some doubt about the results, for example, the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-07-08 11:14:44 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Michaela Rancea">
<P>The primary effect measure was the hazard ratio (HR) for time-to-event data.

We planned to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. In case of rare events, we planned to use the Peto odds ratio instead.

In the update report published in 2005, covering the study period from 1993 to 2001, overall survival, secondary clonal disease or malignancies, and also relapse were not reported separately for the two distinct treatment groups. Rather, the results were presented for two subgroups according to disease severity. The authors dichotomized the patients into a group that consisted of patients with severe aplastic anemia but not with very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA) and in another group that consisted of patients with VSAA only. The combined results of both subgroups were not reported. Subsequently, we cannot compare the subgroup results with the results of other studies that generally report the results of all severe aplastic anemia patients per treatment group.

<P>We identified three prospective, non-randomized controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bayever-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bayever 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-F_x00fc_hrer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Führer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gratwohl-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gratwohl 1981</LINK>) including 302 participants; 121 received matched sibling donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (MSD-HSCT) and 181 received immunosuppressive therapy. Based on these trials we found insufficient evidence to clarify whether first-line allogeneic MSD-HSCT leads to better overall survival than first-line immunosuppressive therapy.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bayever-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bayever 1984</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gratwohl-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gratwohl 1981</LINK> reported considerable treatment-related mortality: from 20% to 42% in the MSD-HSCT with no event reported for the immunosuppressive therapy group. Both studies were conducted roughly 30 years ago and are certainly not applicable to the standard of care of today. The graft failure rate was variable and caused the death of 16% of transplanted patients in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Gratwohl-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gratwohl 1981</LINK>; graft failure was a problem in 3% in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bayever-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bayever 1984</LINK>. No response to immunosuppressive therapy was observed in more than half of patients in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bayever-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bayever 1984</LINK> and was also still considerable in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Gratwohl-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gratwohl 1981</LINK>. Graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) affected a quarter to a half of patients, without distinction between acute and chronic GVHD. Relapse was reported only in one study, affecting up to one in eight patients. Secondary clonal disease or malignancies were detected in the immunosuppressive therapy group in the study by <LINK REF="STD-F_x00fc_hrer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Führer 1998</LINK> and in the MSD-HSCT group by <LINK REF="STD-Bayever-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bayever 1984</LINK>. This result is certainly not representative but shows that malignancies may occur after and could possibly be caused by both treatments.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-07-01 10:15:45 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patients were treated in the time period from 1976 to 1982 (<LINK REF="STD-Bayever-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bayever 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gratwohl-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gratwohl 1981</LINK>) and from 1993 to 2001 (<LINK REF="STD-F_x00fc_hrer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Führer 1998</LINK>). The applicability of these data to current clinical practice is considerably restricted as medical knowledge and terms of health care, especially in HSCT, have progressed and changed significantly over that time period.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-07-01 10:15:51 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The low number of studies included in the present review limits the inferences we can make from the extracted data. One of the two included studies does not report data for all participants but rather restricts the presentation to subgroups according to severity of severe aplastic anemia. In general, studies handle very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA) data as part of severe aplastic anemia data, in agreement with the classification of severe aplastic anemia. Absence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) may be associated with ethical problems in HSCT, especially regarding children (<LINK REF="REF-Chybicka-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chybicka 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the strengths of this review is the broadness of the search strategy such that study retrieval bias is very unlikely. Nevertheless, there remains a slight possibility that an unknown number of studies were not registered and not published. Duplicate publication bias is very unlikely because we searched for follow-up papers of a single study, to ensure that we included the updated version, and we excluded secondary analyses of registers or databases, which may use data that have been published previously by individual contributing study centers. We identified outcome reporting bias with respect to treatment-related mortality.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-07-10 12:42:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The low number of studies included in the present review is caused by our approach in excluding studies with obvious excess risk of bias in addition to a non-randomized design such as retrospective evaluations and registry analyses. Another main reason for excluding studies was the unbalanced distribution of patients' characteristics across treatment groups. Control for confounders was not addressed in any of the potentially relevant studies.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Gray-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Wheatley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wheatley 2004</LINK> addressed the problem of bias in studies comparing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with another treatment using a non-randomized study design. They suggested 'Mendelian randomization' as a principle to avoid bias. Use of 'Mendelian randomization' is no guarantee, however, that bias is minimized. This may be because tissue typing data may not be accurate. Patients may have only one sibling either in the donor or in the no donor group. Large families have a greater chance of finding a donor. Therefore, designing a non-randomized controlled trial by applying 'Mendelian randomization' requires careful thought to effectively reduce bias and control for potential confounders. There is a time lag in patients with siblings because tissue typing and readiness for assignment to treatment group may possibly take several months (<LINK REF="REF-Wheatley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wheatley 2004</LINK>). On the other hand, patients with no siblings can be assigned immediately and are at earlier risk for adverse events. <LINK REF="REF-Nitsch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nitsch 2006</LINK> describes the limits to causal inference based on 'Mendelian randomization'.</P>

However, this finding was not confirmed in a comprehensive evidence-based guideline by <LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2009</LINK>: "Allogeneic BMT from a human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor is the initial treatment of choice for newly diagnosed patients if they have severe or very severe aplastic anaemia, are &lt;40 years old and have an HLA-compatible sibling donor." <LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2009</LINK> estimated that this type of transplantation provides a 75% to 90% chance of long-term cure. <LINK REF="REF-Guinan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guinan 2009</LINK> reported in a review of studies with younger patients that overall survival ranges between 75% and 95% at three to five years. In a recent review, <LINK REF="REF-Eapen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eapen 2012</LINK> sets a cut-off at the age of 20 years and describes overall survival of about 80% in younger and 50% to 70% in older patients. The (now unusual) low overall survival of 47% at two years, remaining stable at 47% up to five years, in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Gratwohl-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gratwohl 1981</LINK> is probably associated with the age of the study (starting in 1976): it is certainly not applicable to current expectations regarding overall survival.</P>
<P>It is assumed that the risks of transplant-related mortality increase with age. <LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2010</LINK> reported the increased risk with age in 1307 patients with severe aplastic anemia after MSD-HSCT. Therefore, age plays a major role in clinical decisions about assigning patients to treatment. <LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2009</LINK> proposed an algorithm for the treatment of severe aplastic anemia that directs patients younger than 40 years of age to the MSD-HSCT group and patients older than 40 years of age to the immunosuppressive therapy group for first-line treatment. The upper age limit for recommending transplantation is a matter of debate because younger patients could have increased risk if co-morbidities are present and older patients could have a favorable prognosis if in a state of physical well-being and if transplanted as early as possible after diagnosis. <LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2010</LINK> also reported that mortality risks were associated with a poor performance score and a long interval between diagnosis and transplantation of more than three months. <LINK REF="REF-Sangiolo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sangiolo 2010</LINK> reported on 23 consecutive patients ranging in age from 40 to 68 years and showed an overall survival of 65% after a median follow-up of 9.1 years. The authors concluded that their data favors extending MSD-HSCT to patients older than 40 years of age who are without significant co-morbidities. The Third Consensus Conference on the treatment of aplastic anemia agreed on 21 February 2010 that bone marrow should be used as the source of stem cells and that the upper age limit should be 50 years (<LINK REF="REF-Kojima-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kojima 2011</LINK>). In a recent publication (ahead of print) <LINK REF="REF-Bacigalupo-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacigalupo 2012</LINK> reported a survival advantage for bone marrow as compared to peripheral blood as a stem cell source in all age groups.</P>
<P>Concerning immunosuppressive therapy, overall survival was 45% in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bayever-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bayever 1984</LINK> and ranged from 81% to 93% in the study by <LINK REF="STD-F_x00fc_hrer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Führer 1998</LINK>. <LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2009</LINK> reported five-year survival from 75% to 85% and <LINK REF="REF-Guinan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guinan 2009</LINK> reported 10-year survival from 80% to 83%, as summarized in other studies. <LINK REF="REF-Deyell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyell 2011</LINK> estimated five-year overall survival of 96% in 45 children with a median age of 7.3 years and therefore gives reason to believe that children can have a very good prognosis if treated with immunosuppressive therapy. The Third Consensus Conference on the treatment of aplastic anemia agreed in 2010 that the combination of antithymocyte globulin and ciclosporin remains the gold standard for immunosuppressive therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Kojima-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kojima 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Bacigalupo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacigalupo 2008</LINK> reported that the outcome has improved since 1996 for HSCT but not for immunosuppressive therapy. <LINK REF="REF-Peinemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peinemann 2011</LINK> identified three studies that reported a statistically significant improvement of overall survival in the HSCT group but not in the immunosuppressive therapy group (<LINK REF="REF-Bacigalupo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacigalupo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Locasciulli-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Locasciulli 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Locasciulli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Locasciulli 2007</LINK>) and one study that found an improvement in both treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Pitcher-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pitcher 1999</LINK>). Several factors may have contributed to recent improvements in HSCT, such as detailed HLA-matching, less irradiation-based conditioning, less acute GVHD with a prophylaxis combination of methotrexate plus ciclosporin instead of methotrexate alone (<LINK REF="REF-Bacigalupo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacigalupo 2000</LINK>), refinement of the type and dosage of conditioning drugs, and general advancement of medical and nursing clinical science.</P>
<P>It is assumed that frequent prior transfusion of blood products and prior immunosuppressive therapy is associated with a worse outcome after HSCT. Therefore, first-line HSCT is recommended in eligible patients with selected characteristics. The data in the included studies were too scarce to allow any reference to this important topic. Immunosuppressive therapy is an alternative treatment option for patients who are not eligible for sibling donor HSCT and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is the recommended source of stem cells (<LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2009</LINK>). This recommendation was derived from the results of registry analyses that showed worse survival in patients that received peripheral blood stem cells (<LINK REF="REF-Schrezenmeier-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schrezenmeier 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Peinemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peinemann 2011</LINK> conducted a systematic review without applying restrictions such as excluding studies with a retrospective design and included as many comparative studies as possible so as not to miss any valuable outcome information. Data from patients with varying characteristics, such as young and advanced age, may have compromised the applicability of the results. They found high risk of bias among 26 identified non-randomized comparative studies. Of these, 19 studies were included in a meta-analysis of overall mortality but considerable heterogeneity did not justify a pooled estimate. Rather the forest plot was meant only to visualize the effect and the corresponding broad confidence intervals.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Treatment-related mortality was high in the MSD-HSCT group at 20% to 42% of transplanted patients. Graft failure and GVHD are adverse events that are unique complications of allogeneic transplantation. Thus, treatment-related mortality events are easy to define and to detect after transplantation. For the immunosuppressive therapy group, treatment-related mortality was not observed. Treatment-related mortality events are very difficult to determine. An infection, for example, can be caused by the disease or can be caused by the treatment. It is almost impossible to clarify this situation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bayever-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bayever 1984</LINK> reported graft failure in 3% of patients and <LINK REF="STD-Gratwohl-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gratwohl 1981</LINK> in 16% of patients, which lies at either end of the range of 4% to 14% summarized by <LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2009</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Bayever-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bayever 1984</LINK> reported that 64% of patients did not respond to immunosuppressive therapy at three months and that 12.5% of responders relapsed at five years. While the 'no response' rate of 64% appears rather high, the 'no response' rate of 15% reported by <LINK REF="STD-Gratwohl-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gratwohl 1981</LINK> is probably rather low compared with others. <LINK REF="STD-F_x00fc_hrer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Führer 1998</LINK> reported a higher proportion of responders (69% and 44%) compared to <LINK REF="STD-Bayever-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bayever 1984</LINK> and response and relapse was significantly favorable in the VSAA only subgroup. <LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2009</LINK> described the combination of antithymocyte globulin and ciclosporin as being associated with response rates of between 60% and 80%. <LINK REF="REF-Guinan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guinan 2009</LINK> described a response rate from 27% to 79% in pediatric studies at six months and a relapse rate among responders between 16% to 33% at 10 years. According to <LINK REF="REF-Deyell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyell 2011</LINK>, the five-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 12.9% in 45 children with a median age of 7.3 years; according to <LINK REF="REF-Kamio-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamio 2011</LINK> a response was observed in 59.8% (264 of 441) children and the 10-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 11.9% at 10 years. The recent findings about response and relapse match well with the very early findings. This leads to the assumption that the serious problems of not responding to immunosuppressive therapy or relapsing after an initial successful response may not have improved sufficiently over the last three decades. However, a reporting bias for these late events cannot be ruled out. <LINK REF="STD-Bayever-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bayever 1984</LINK> reported acute GVHD (grade II to IV) in 29% of patients, which may appear high compared to the range of 12% to 30% (but grade III to IV) summarized by <LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2009</LINK>. The 21% risk of extensive chronic GVHD reported by <LINK REF="STD-Bayever-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bayever 1984</LINK> matches the range from 30% to 40% summarized by <LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2009</LINK> (any chronic GVHD). The condition regimen and graft manipulation has substantially changed over time, so that comparisons over three decades appear biased. <LINK REF="STD-Gratwohl-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gratwohl 1981</LINK> reported 26% GVHD but did not distinguish between acute and chronic GVHD, which makes it difficult to compare the reported rates.</P>
<P>The risk for later secondary clonal disease and malignancies, including hemolytic paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and myelodysplastic syndrome, was 3% in the HSCT group reported by <LINK REF="STD-Bayever-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bayever 1984</LINK> and 5% in the immunosuppressive therapy group reported by <LINK REF="STD-F_x00fc_hrer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Führer 1998</LINK>. According to <LINK REF="REF-Deyell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyell 2011</LINK>, the five-year cumulative incidence of clonal evolution was 3.2% in 45 children with a median age of 7.3 years. We believe that this risk is probably highly underestimated because of an insufficient length of follow-up. Indeed, <LINK REF="REF-Frickhofen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frickhofen 2003</LINK> found much higher proportions among 30 responders (14 complete, 16 partial). Five patients developed hemolytic paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, four myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia, and four solid tumors after a median follow-up of 11.3 years. The actual probability at 11 years was 25% for clonal or malignant disease, 10% for hemolytic paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, 8% for myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia, and 11% for solid tumors. It should be mentioned that 30/17 patients of a total of 47 patients were treated with/without ciclosporin. <LINK REF="REF-Guinan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guinan 2009</LINK> stressed that recurrence of severe aplastic anemia and clonal evolution are hurdles to overcome in improving overall survival. <LINK REF="REF-Frickhofen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frickhofen 2003</LINK> showed in a RCT that ciclosporin is an essential part of immunosuppressive therapy along with antithymocyte globulin. Recently, <LINK REF="REF-Scheinberg-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheinberg 2011</LINK> showed in a RCT that horse is superior to rabbit antithymocyte globulin, as indicated by hematologic response and survival. However, horse antithymocyte globulin is currently not available on the pharmaceutical market (<LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bayever-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bayever 1984</LINK> reported a good Karnofsky performance status of 92% in the HSCT group versus 46% in the immunosuppressive therapy group. This result may point to a better performance after HSCT than after immunosuppressive therapy for patients that have survived. We did not find any other study, review, or guideline addressing Karnofsky performance status.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Recent publications and potential treatment outlook</HEADING>
<P>While updating the literature search, we identified recent publications that are loosely associated with the topic of the present Cochrane review. <LINK REF="REF-Burroughs-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burroughs 2012</LINK> observed three groups of HLA-matched related HSCTs with respect to conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis. In group 1 the regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide and methotrexate, in group 2 cyclophosphamide was given alone, and in group 3 cyclophosphamide and methotrexate was extended with antithymocyte globulin and ciclosporin. With a median follow-up of 25 years, the five-year survival was 66%, 95%, and 100% for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001). The authors concluded: "Advances in preparative and GVHD prophylaxis regimens, and supportive care during the past 40 years have led to improved outcomes for children with SAA. These results confirm the use of allogeneic marrow transplantation for children with SAA who have HLA-matched related donors". <LINK REF="REF-Battiwalla-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Battiwalla 2012</LINK> found that secondary graft failure at two years after HLA-matched sibling bone marrow transplantation for severe aplastic anemia was lower in patients who carried HLA DR15+ compared to HLA DR15- but did not find a significant impact on survival. <LINK REF="REF-Kim-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2012</LINK> found that overall survival did not differ significantly between the younger patient group (&lt; 40 years old) and the older patient group (&gt;= 40 years old) in patients with severe aplastic anemia who received transplants from HLA-matched related donors. The authors reported that patients between the ages of 41 and 50 years should undergo allogeneic HSCT as early as possible to optimize survival. <LINK REF="REF-Buchbinder-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchbinder 2013</LINK> described autologous cord blood HSCT as an effective and safe alternative if no related donor is available. <LINK REF="REF-Risitano-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Risitano 2013</LINK> recommended that alemtuzumab-based immunosuppression may be a treatment option as a second-line therapy for severe aplastic anemia patients who are not indicated for allogeneic HSCT and who did not respond to initial immunosuppressive therapy. <LINK REF="REF-Scheinberg-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheinberg 2012a</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Scheinberg-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheinberg 2012b</LINK> provided an overview and update of various treatment options for severe aplastic anemia including immunosuppressive therapy and transplantation.</P>

<P>The included data are too scarce and too biased to allow any conclusion on the comparative effectiveness of first-line allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of HLA-matched sibling donors and first-line ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin. We are unable to make firm recommendations regarding choice of intervention. The rates of adverse events, such as treatment-related mortality, graft failure, no response to first-line ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin, and graft-versus-host disease, are unusually high, which may be explained by the age of the studies (starting in 1976). The results are not applicable to current modern standard care.</P>
<P>Patients should be made aware of the early treatment-related mortality and the burden of acute graft-versus-host disease after first-line allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of HLA-matched sibling donors. Patients treated with first-line ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin should also be made aware that the disease may recur after initial successful treatment, and that life-threatening late clonal and malignant disease after first-line ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin may occur in a higher percentage compared to first-line allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of HLA-matched sibling donors. Unrelated matched donor transplantation after first-line ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin in patients without a first-line allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of HLA-matched sibling donors was not the scope of the present review.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-07-01 10:16:40 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized controlled trials that compare first-line allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of HLA-matched sibling donors with first-line ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin are unlikely to be conducted due to ethical constraints and strong patient and clinician preferences for one or the other intervention based on patient characteristics and disease status. In theory, prospective studies that use 'Mendelian randomization' offer a useful alternative to randomized controlled trials to reduce the risk of bias. In practice, it appears unlikely that a well-designed comparative study based on 'Mendelian randomization' will be accomplished in the future. Some experts in this field have admitted that expectations have been disappointed. One reason might be the rarity of severe aplastic anemia, although collaboration across cancer centers could facilitate the recruitment of sufficient numbers of participants. Another reason is that the outcome of transplantation has improved considerably. This is true not only for matched related donor transplantation but especially for matched unrelated donors. It means that ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin may not be a first treatment choice if a matched sibling or a matched related or even a matched unrelated donor is available.</P>

<P>We changed the objective to evaluation of transplants from HLA-matched (identical) siblings only and not from HLA-matched related family members. We wanted to create a homogeneous group of patients with an identical close relationship. We also wanted to react to common practice which recommends first-line allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation preferably to HLA-matched (identical) siblings.</P>
<P>We included studies with a prospective design only and we did not include retrospective studies to reduce the risk of bias introduced by retrospective designs.</P>
<P>We amended the outcomes. We deleted "treatment-free survival" as a primary outcome measure because it is not an established outcome in transplantation science. We deleted "transfusion requirements" as a secondary outcome measure because it is a risk factor before treatment. We changed "complete and partial response" to "no response to first-line ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin" and subsumed it into the outcome "treatment failure" together with "graft failure" in transplanted patients.</P>
<P>We confined the immunosuppressive treatment to first-line ciclosporin and/or antithymocyte or antilymphocyte globulin.</P>

A combination of cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin was found as effective as irradiation in preventing rejection with better long-term outcome. In regards to conditioning regimens, radiation-based regimens should be avoided because of the higher associated likelihood of inducing secondary cancer, the deleterious effects on fertility, and the potential detrimental effects on growth and development, a policy that would be particularly important for pediatric patients."</P>

Of 35 patients receiving MSD-HSCT, 2 were not able to develop GVHD because 1 patient died of sepsis 1 day after transplant and 1 patient experienced a graft rejection. Of 33 patients, 17 patients developed GVHD according to the results section of the article, without specifying the acute or chronic type. In the discussion section, the authors report moderate to severe GVHD in 10 patients. This could be the number of patients with acute GVHD. However, it is not clearly described how many patients had acute versus chronic GVHD.</P>
