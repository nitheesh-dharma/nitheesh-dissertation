<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Comparisons of methods used in adults to put bone fragments of a fractured wrist back into place</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Wrist fractures (breaks) are common injuries in adults, especially in people with osteoporosis (bone loss). Bone fragments may need to be put back into place to restore anatomy and reduce the risk of further soft-tissue damage. The process of doing this is called reduction and usually the patient is given anaesthesia beforehand. In closed reduction, often termed manipulation, the displaced fragments are repositioned using various manoeuvres while keeping the overlying skin intact. Traction to pull the fragments apart is provided either manually involving two people or with a mechanical device such as 'finger-traps' attached to two or more fingers and a counterweight suspended over the upper arm. The reduced fracture is then stabilised, typically by plaster cast immobilisation, to help it to heal.</P>
<P>Three randomised controlled trials involving a total of 404, mainly female and older, people with displaced fractures of the distal radius are included in this review. None of the trials assessed functional outcome, and only one trial reported on complications. Each trial compared different methods of reduction. One trial, in which all participants had intravenous regional anaesthesia, found no significant differences in anatomical outcomes between mechanical reduction using finger trap traction and manual reduction. The second trial compared two methods of manual reduction. These were a novel method of manual reduction where participants actively provided counter-traction without being given anaesthesia versus traditional manual reduction under intravenous regional anaesthesia. The participants of the novel method group suffered more but not intolerable pain during the reduction procedure, which was shorter in duration. No differences in anatomical outcome were detected. The third trial compared mechanical reduction involving a special device without anaesthesia versus manual reduction under haematoma block (local anaesthesia). Less pain during the reduction procedure was recorded for the mechanical traction group. Both methods yielded similar anatomical results. Fewer participants of the mechanical traction group had signs of neurological impairment, mainly finger numbness, at five weeks but this difference was not statistically significant by one year.</P>
<P>The review concluded that there was not enough evidence to decide whether there was any difference between the various methods tested.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Fracture of the distal radius is a common clinical problem. Displaced fractures are usually reduced using closed reduction methods, which are non-surgical and generally comprise traction and manipulation. The resulting position is then stabilised, typically by plaster cast immobilisation.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine the evidence for the relative effectiveness of different methods of closed reduction for displaced fractures of the distal radius in adults. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (June 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2007, Issue 2), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the National Research Register (UK), conference proceedings and reference lists of articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials comparing different methods of closed reduction. We also included trials where the use or not of anaesthesia was tested concurrently with different methods of reduction.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Both authors independently selected trials and assessed methodological quality. Data were extracted independently by one author and checked by the other. No pooling was possible.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three trials involving a total of 404, mainly female and older, people with displaced fractures of the distal radius were included. These failed to assess functional outcome, and only one trial reported on complications. </P>
<P>One trial found no statistically significant differences between mechanical reduction using finger trap traction and manual reduction in anatomical outcomes. All participants of this trial were given intravenous regional anaesthesia.</P>
<P>One trial compared a novel method of manual reduction where the non-anaesthetised patient actively provided counter-traction versus traditional manual reduction under intravenous regional anaesthesia. While participants of the novel method group suffered more, yet not intolerable, pain during the reduction procedure, the latter was shorter in duration. No differences in anatomical outcome were detected.</P>
<P>The third study compared mechanical reduction involving a special device without anaesthesia versus manual reduction under haematoma block (local anaesthesia). Less pain during the reduction procedure was recorded for the mechanical traction group. Both methods yielded similar radiological results. Fewer participants of the mechanical traction group had signs of neurological impairment, mainly finger numbness, at five weeks but this difference was not statistically significant by one year.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There was insufficient evidence from comparisons tested within randomised controlled trials to establish the relative effectiveness of different methods of closed reduction used in the treatment of displaced fractures of the distal radius in adults.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-16 10:23:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Fracture of the distal radius is one of the most common fractures in many predominantly white and older populations (<LINK REF="REF-Sahlin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahlin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 1998</LINK>). It has been estimated that a 50 year old white woman in USA or Northern Europe has a 15% lifetime risk of a distal radius fracture; whereas a white man of the same age has a lifetime risk of a little over 2% (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1985</LINK>). A more recent prospective survey, conducted in six centres in the UK, of Colles' fracture in patients aged 35 years and above, reported the overall annual incidence of this fracture to be 9/10,000 in men and 37/10,000 in women (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Neill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Neill 2001</LINK>). Distal radial fractures are usually treated on an outpatient basis, with around 20% of patients (mainly older people) requiring hospital admission (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Neill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Neill 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most fractures of the distal radius in older people result from low-energy trauma, such as a fall from standing height or less. In younger adults, these injuries are usually sustained through high-energy trauma such as a traffic accident. The pattern of incidence reflects bone loss from osteoporosis in older people as well as an increased number of falls by older women (<LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>These fractures are generally closed and usually involve displacement of fracture fragments. They may be either extra-articular (leaving the articular or joint surface of the distal radius intact) or intra-articular (where the articular surface is disrupted). Numerous classifications have been devised to define and group different fracture patterns (<LINK REF="REF-Chitnavis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chitnavis 1999</LINK>). Simple classifications based on clinical appearance, and often named after those who described them, remain in common use. In particular, "Colles' fracture" is still the terminology used for a fracture in which there is an obvious and typical clinical deformity - of dorsal displacement, dorsal angulation, dorsal comminution (small fragments of bone), and radial shortening.</P>
<P>The majority of distal radial fractures are treated conservatively (non-operatively). This usually involves reduction under anaesthesia of the fracture if displaced, and forearm immobilisation in a plaster cast or brace for around six weeks. Questions over the use and timing of fracture reduction and of conservative methods used to stabilise the reduced fracture are covered in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003a</LINK>). A Cochrane review evaluating the main methods of anaesthesia, and associated physical techniques, used during reduction and surgical treatment is also available (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2002</LINK>). Another Cochrane review examines surgical treatment, which usually involves reduction followed by either external or internal fixation, and a similar period of immobilisation (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003b</LINK>). </P>
<P>Reduction is defined as "the restoration of a displaced part of the body to its normal position by manipulation or operation" (<LINK REF="REF-Dictionary-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dictionary 1994</LINK>). Here we focus on conservative methods - closed reduction - used to restore the anatomy of the distal radius through the repositioning of displaced bone fragments. These procedures are distinct from methods, such as plaster cast immobilisation or external fixation, used to stabilise the reduced fracture: such methods are reviewed elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003b</LINK>). However, methods, such as maintaining traction, of retaining the reduced position before the implementation of interventions aimed at fracture stabilisation are included in this review. </P>
<P>In closed reduction, often termed manipulation, the displaced fragment(s) are repositioned using various manoeuvres while the arm is under traction. The classic method of closed reduction for Colles' fractures, described by Charnley (<LINK REF="REF-Charnley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charnley 1999</LINK>), requires two people pulling in opposite directions to produce and maintain longitudinal traction. This is termed manual reduction. Mechanical methods of reduction usually include the use of 'finger-traps', introduced by Caldwell (<LINK REF="REF-Caldwell-1931" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caldwell 1931</LINK>). In finger-trap traction the injured arm is suspended using finger traps attached to two or more fingers, and a counterweight suspended over the upper arm (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 1999</LINK>). This dispenses with the need for assistants.</P>
<P>Movement of bone fragments resulting in loss, which may be total, of the reduced position is commonplace after closed reduction. This usually occurs within the first 10 to 14 days after initial reduction but can continue until the fracture heals at around six to eight weeks. Thus, while the evaluation of treatment interventions in this review will include the initial anatomical restoration achieved by the methods under comparison, the emphasis will be on final outcome in terms of residual deformity, functional and clinical outcome, and presence of complications. Some complications are associated with the injury itself. As well as concomitant injuries to soft tissues, fracture displacement can further compromise blood vessels, tendons and nerves, with median nerve dysfunction being the most common complication (<LINK REF="REF-Belsole-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belsole 1993</LINK>). The presence of these complications, especially median nerve compression, is often an indication for reduction.</P>
<P>Anatomical measurement to assess initial displacement, restoration of anatomy, loss of reduced position and final radiological deformity, is key to this review. Generally, the criteria used to determine whether displacement is sufficient to warrant reduction are based on anatomical parameters measured from X-ray films. However, a study of X-ray film measurements for healed distal radius fractures has revealed quite large margins of error ("tolerance limits") for both inter-observer and intra-observer readings (<LINK REF="REF-Kreder-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreder 1996</LINK>). The implications of these findings are considered in our discussion of the findings of this review. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>This review aims to identify and assess the evidence from randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of the relative effectiveness of methods used for closed reduction of distal radial fractures in adults. Where possible, we intended to make a distinction between subsequent conservative and surgical management of the fracture, and between the treatment of initial as compared with redisplaced or secondarily-displaced fractures.</P>

<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-07-16 10:23:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We considered any randomised or quasi-randomised (use of a method of allocating participants to a treatment that is not strictly random; e.g. by date of birth, hospital record number, alternation) controlled clinical trials of reduction methods used for treating distal radial fractures.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Skeletally mature adults with a displaced and closed fracture of the distal radius considered suitable for reduction.</P>
<P>The characteristics of the participants included in the trials were noted, with an emphasis on type of fracture, concomitant soft-tissue injury, age, gender and functional demands.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>All randomised controlled trials comparing different conservative methods of reduction for displaced distal radial fractures. We originally planned to include only trials that solely compared different methods of reduction for fractures of the distal radius. Thus we intended to exclude trials where co-interventions (such as the method of anaesthesia) or subsequent interventions (such as the method of immobilisation) up to the time of last follow up differed between the intervention groups. However, we subsequently made an exception of trials where the use or not of anaesthesia was tested concurrently with different methods of reduction. Where reported, clinician experience and speciality were noted.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-05-01 11:13:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>(1) Failed or inadequate reduction. This is based on at least one of the following: i) explicit reports of inadequacy or failure, ii) the need for remanipulation or change of planned treatment (e.g. recourse to surgery) or iii) secondary or re-displacement in excess of pre-specified threshold values. The non-resolution of injury related complications, specifically median nerve compression, was also considered in this outcome category.</P>
<P>(2) Anatomical outcome. This is based on individual radiological parameters such as radial length or shortening and shift, dorsal angulation, radial inclination or angle, ulnar variance, as well as composite measures including malunion and total radiological deformity. Definitions of four of the most commonly reported radiological parameters are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Other radiological parameters, such as those associated with the displacement of articular fragments, would also have been considered (<LINK REF="REF-Kreder-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreder 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>(3) Clinical outcome. This includes residual soft tissue swelling; early and late complications associated with distal radial fractures or their treatment, including reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) and osteoarthrosis; cosmetic appearance; and patient satisfaction with treatment.</P>
<P>(4) Functional outcome and impairment. Patient-rated functional assessment instruments such as Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (DASH) and the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) (<LINK REF="REF-MacDermid-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDermid 2000</LINK>). Other measures include return to previous occupation, including work, and activities of daily living; grip strength; pain; and range of movement (wrist, forearm and shoulder mobility).<B> </B>Range of movement for the wrist is described in terms of six parameters: flexion (ability to bend the wrist downwards) and extension (or upwards); radial deviation (ability to bend the wrist sideways on the thumb side) and ulnar deviation (on the little finger side); and pronation (ability to turn the forearm so that the palm faces downwards) and supination (palm faces upwards).</P>
<P>(5) Resource use. Hospital admission, use of assistants, anaesthetist involvement and other costs.</P>

No pooling was done in this review. Should this be possible in the future, results of comparable groups of trials will be pooled using the fixed-effect model and 95% confidence limits. Heterogeneity between comparable trials will be tested using a standard chi-squared test and considered statistically significant at P &lt; 0.1.

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>No new studies were identified from the extension of the search from June 2005 to June 2007.</P>
<P>Three out of four eligible studies were included. Strictly, only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK>) met the original criteria of the review in that it solely compared two different methods of closed reduction. In the other three eligible trials, the new method of closed reduction was used without anaesthesia whereas the control group received anaesthesia during a standard method of closed reduction. As the provision of anaesthesia is a co-intervention it would have resulted in the exclusion of these trials. However, we consider the underlying question is valid and extended the scope of the review accordingly. Various reasons, including a lack of discrete outcome data, prompted us to exclude one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kongsholm-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Kongsholm 1981</LINK>) that was only available as a conference abstract (<I>see</I> 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK> took place in one centre in the UK, whereas the other two trials were based in Sweden. The three studies involved a total of 404 participants with fractures of the distal radius. Participants were mainly female; the proportion ranged from 77% (<LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK>) to 91% (<LINK REF="STD-Kongsholm-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kongsholm 1987</LINK>). The mean ages of the trial populations were in the early to mid sixties. Both the youngest (15 years) and the oldest (94 years) participants appeared in <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK>.</P>
<P>Fracture type was generally broadly defined as acute Colles' fracture. Only <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK> gave radiological criteria for fracture displacement meriting reduction. In all three trials, fractures were categorised according to Frykman's fracture classification scheme and both extra-articular and intra-articular fractures were included.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK> compared mechanical traction using finger traps with manual reduction in 250 people with 253 fractures. All participants were given intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1992</LINK> compared two methods of manual reduction in 38 people. In a novel method of reduction, participants, who lay on their stomachs, actively provided counter-traction; no anaesthesia was provided for this group.

<P>Based on information provided in their trial reports, all three trials had methodological flaws. The results of the quality assessment for the individual trials are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> for details of the quality assessment scheme). Information specific to the first three items of the quality assessment is given in the methods sections of the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. A summary of the results for individual items of quality assessment is given below.</P>
<P>Concealment of treatment allocation at randomisation (item 1) was not confirmed in any of the trials. Some details of the method of randomisation were only provided in <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK>, where sealed envelopes were used.</P>
<P>Intention-to-treat analysis (item 2) was considered very likely in <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kongsholm-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kongsholm 1987</LINK>; no participants were lost to follow up in either trial. <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK> did not score for this item due to the unexplained loss of 27 participants from the trial between reporting it at a conference and at journal publication.</P>
<P>Aside from blinded assessment of radiographs in <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK>, there was no report of blinding of assessors (item 3), participants (item 5) or care providers (item 6).</P>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Kongsholm-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kongsholm 1987</LINK> provided sufficient information to indicate comparability between the treatment groups in key baseline characteristics such as gender, age, fracture type and displacement, and time since injury (item 4).</P>
<P>Comparability of care programmes (item 7), comprising interventions other than the trial interventions, was considered likely in <LINK REF="STD-Kongsholm-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kongsholm 1987</LINK>. (In this trial and <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1992</LINK>, the different provision of anaesthesia to the two intervention groups is treated as a co-intervention rather than a confounder.) The criteria for judging comparability depended, to some extent, on the outcomes reported. For instance, both <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1992</LINK> failed to provide confirmation of pre-specified criteria for changes in management (surgical treatment; re-reduction).</P>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK> provided sufficient details of trial inclusion and exclusion criteria to define the study population (item 8). This included giving the threshold radiological criteria for determining the need for reduction.</P>
<P>Good descriptions of the trial interventions were provided (item 9). This included details on the use of assistants and of the participation of the patient in the reduction process.</P>
<P>The definition (item 10) of outcome measurement was clear enough to give a good idea of what was recorded in <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kongsholm-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kongsholm 1987</LINK>. However, no trial was rated as having good quality outcome measurement (item 11). This is despite there being some indication of an active and systematic approach. </P>
<P>The length of overall follow up (item 12) was too short in <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK> (5 weeks) and <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1992</LINK> (10 days).

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Given the differences in the comparisons evaluated by the three included trials, each trial is reviewed separately. The outcomes reported by each trial are listed in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. Where available and appropriate, data for these outcomes are presented graphically.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Mechanical reduction using finger trap traction versus manual reduction (Comparison 01)</B>
<BR/>In the full report of <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK>, results were available for 223 participants with 225 fractures. This differs from the 250 participants with 253 fractures reported at a conference (<LINK REF="REF-Earnshaw-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Earnshaw 1999</LINK>). In addition, there were some discrepancies between text and graphs, as well as percentages that sometimes did not add up. Earnshaw et al did not provide any indication of the criteria for resorting to surgical treatment or indicate how many of the 56 fractures operated on by five weeks were in each group, or whether re-reduction was ever undertaken. In the absence of clarification from the lead trialist, we have noted the general consistency in the results of the two trial reports and used the data from the full report. Interpretation of <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK> is also hampered by some ambiguity in the description of outcome; in the following we have taken the results for acceptable anatomical position at five weeks to apply to those participants who had an acceptable position throughout: from reduction up to five weeks.</P>
<P>Earnshaw <I>et al</I> defined an acceptable radiological position as one with less than 10 degrees of dorsal angulation and less than five millimetres of radial shortening. These were the same criteria used to exclude 'undisplaced' fractures from their trial. Based on these criteria, 15 fractures in each group had an unacceptable position after reduction (<I>see </I>Analysis 01.01: relative risk (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.96). There was no indication on whether a further reduction or surgery was offered or provided for the 30 fractures that would still be considered displaced according to the trial inclusion criteria. Dorsal angulation, radial shortening and radial angulation were reported not to differ (reported P &gt; 0.05) between the two groups either at presentation or following reduction; visual inspection of the graphs in the 2002 trial report supports this claim. There was also no difference between the two groups in the difficulty of the reduction as rated by the performing surgeon using a visual analogue scale (<I>see</I> Analysis 01.02). By five weeks, under 30% of the trial population had fractures that had been reduced to and had remained in an acceptable anatomical position; the numbers of fractures with an acceptable position were similar in the two groups (<I>see </I>Analysis 01.03: 30/112 versus 36/113; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.26). It is not clear from <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK>, how many of the other 70% of fractures, approximately a third of which were treated surgically, had an acceptable anatomical position at five weeks.</P>
<P>No other outcomes were reported in <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK>. <BR/>

<BR/>Manual reduction with counter-traction provided by patient versus manual reduction under anaesthesia with counter-traction provided by an assistant (Comparison 02)</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1992</LINK> compared a new method of manual reduction without anaesthesia with a more usual method using intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA) in 38 people. Means and standard deviations for dorsal angulation and radial shortening were calculated from the individual patient data presented in the trial report. These showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups in the radiological outcome achieved through reduction (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.01). No improvement was evident for one participant of the new reduction method group (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.02). Without anaesthesia, the new method was more painful than the usual method where IVRA was employed (mean values on a 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain) scale: 5.2 versus 3.4; reported P &lt; 0.05). However, though more people undergoing the new reduction process endured increased pain during reduction (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.03) and significantly more participants of this group endured increased or unchanged pain during reduction (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.04: 18/19 versus 11/19; RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.44), no participant interrupted the reduction process because of intolerable pain. It is noteworthy that after IVRA, 11 participants considered their pain was either unchanged or worse; there was no significant difference between the mean pain scores for this group before reduction and after anaesthesia (3.8 versus 3.1). By 10 days, similar numbers of fractures had redisplaced in the two groups (<I>see</I> Analysis 02.05: 4/19 versus 6/19; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.99).</P>

<B>Mechanical reduction using finger traps and a dynamic device versus manual reduction under anaesthesia (Comparison 03)</B> <BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Kongsholm-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kongsholm 1987</LINK> compared mechanical reduction involving a special device versus manual reduction with haematoma block in 116 people. Patients using the dynamic device were asked to rotate (pronate and supinate) their forearm; those in the manual traction group were passive recipients of care. There was no important difference between the two groups in post-reduction radiological outcome (<I>see</I> Analysis 03.01); as Kongsholm <I>et al </I>point out, the statistically significant difference in volar angle (mean difference -1.7º, 95% CI -3.17º to -0.23º) would not generally be considered clinically significant. Statistically significantly fewer mechanical traction group patients experienced severe pain during the reduction procedure (<I>see</I> Analysis 03.02: 5/62 versus 19/54; RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.57). No participant sustained an acute nerve injury. At five weeks significantly fewer participants of the mechanical traction group had signs and symptoms of, mostly mild, neurological impairment (<I>see</I> Analysis 03.03: 2/62 versus 11/54; RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.68). The fractures of three patients with neurological impairment in the manual reduction group had undergone re-reduction, but the overall data for re-reduction in <LINK REF="STD-Kongsholm-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kongsholm 1987</LINK> were not available. The difference in neurological impairment was no longer statistically significant by one year (<I>see</I> Analysis 03.03: RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.37).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Closed reduction is the key preliminary procedure of the definitive treatment for most displaced fractures of the distal radius. However, it cannot be divorced from the subsequent procedures aimed at stabilisation of the reduced position. This dependency has important implications in terms of conducting and interpreting comparisons of different methods of closed reduction. While differences, or absence of differences, in immediate outcomes (mainly, radiological measurements, resolution of injury-related or appearance of new complications, and pain) may be valid, the interpretation of longer-term outcome is problematic. Ensuring comparability of post-reduction care programmes, including the method of stabilisation, should go some way to address the issue of confounding. (The latter is where factors other than the interventions under investigation influence outcome.) Yet, even if care programme comparability is achieved, questions remain over the long-term impact of any differences in effectiveness of two methods of reduction. Such differences could be dwarfed by the effects of inadequate fracture stabilisation (resulting in the loss of the reduced position) and of complications associated with wrist immobilisation. The issue of anaesthesia adds to the complexity: the method chosen may also influence the success of the reduction and long term outcome. Again, the method of anaesthesia should be the same for both intervention groups, though an exception has been made for this review where the use or not of anaesthesia has been defined as a co-intervention.</P>
<P>The inherent difficulties in performing these comparisons and interpreting their results are further compounded by questions regarding the accuracy of radiological measurements. An associated issue concerns the relationship of radiological deformity with long term functional and clinical outcome. As explained in Kreder et al (<LINK REF="REF-Kreder-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreder 1996</LINK>), there are many potential sources of errors in radiological measurement. For instance, variation in limb positioning has been demonstrated to affect the assessment of ulnar variance (the relative positioning of the distal ends of the ulnar and radius) (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yeh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeh 2001</LINK>) as well as radial and dorsal angulation (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1992</LINK>). In their study of X-ray film measurements for healed distal radius fractures, which revealed quite large margins of error ("tolerance limits") for both inter-observer and intra-observer readings, Kreder et al suggested their findings represented "a conservative estimate of the variation that might be expected in clinical practice" (<LINK REF="REF-Kreder-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreder 1996</LINK>). This has implications for the application of threshold criteria of fracture displacement for performing reduction, for measuring the success of the reduction procedure, for measuring any subsequent loss in position and radiological deformity after fracture healing. Additionally, there are implications for determining the clinical and functional significance of residual anatomical displacement and interpreting differences found in comparisons of treatment interventions for these fractures. The goal of reduction is restoration of anatomy and we anticipate that any reduction method that has become established will achieve this to a sufficient extent for commonly recorded parameters, such as dorsal angulation and radial shortening, so that any difference between methods in these outcomes will not be sufficiently large to exceed the variation in measurement resulting from other causes.</P>
<P>Despite the above considerations, we consider the question asked in this review - which is the best method of closed reduction for fractures of the distal radius? - is still relevant for the reasons given below.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Closed reduction is indisputably a key procedure in the treatment of these fractures.</LI>
<LI>Many methods of closed reduction exist and there is variation in practice. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK> considered that manipulation under manual traction was common practice in the UK, whereas mechanical traction using finger traps was common in the USA.</LI>
<LI>The method of reduction may avoid or affect the need for anaesthesia; it may also influence the method of anaesthesia chosen. (Two of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kongsholm-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kongsholm 1987</LINK>) specifically tested the use of anaesthesia.) As pointed out in <LINK REF="REF-Lidstrom-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lidstrom 1959</LINK>, reduction was done without anaesthesia in the past. Nowadays, anaesthesia is usually provided with the aim of not only alleviating pain during the procedure but also enabling better muscle relaxation to facilitate reduction. </LI>
<LI>The method of reduction may affect the choice of method for fracture stabilisation. For instance, it may restrict the options for arm positioning: <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK> reported that it was difficult to achieve ulnar deviation and flexion while moulding of the plaster during finger-trap traction. There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine whether this limitation is clinically important (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003a</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Different methods have different resource impacts, notably with respect to health worker involvement. Traditional methods of manual reduction require two people to provide manual traction, whereas an extra person is not required for mechanical traction. However, the application and use of mechanical devices take up resources too. In one of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1992</LINK>), the patient rather than another clinician took on the role of providing counter-traction. </LI>
<LI>Finally, despite the difficulties in measurement and performing trials, different methods may still yield better results and be less risky, in terms of complications.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Turning now to the evidence available from randomised trials. We identified just one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK>), with 250 participants, comparing two methods of closed reduction only. This found no statistically significant differences between mechanical reduction using finger trap traction and manual reduction in anatomical outcomes or in the surgeon's perception of the ease of reduction (<I>see</I> 'Results'). However, these findings need to be set into the context of the problems associated with radiological measurement, the lack of functional outcomes (promised in a future investigation) or any account of complications, the short-term follow up (just five weeks), and an absence of clarification of various aspects of methodology (including criteria for subsequent surgery) and trial results (for intention-to-treat analysis). In essence then, this trial provides little evidence for examining the relative effectiveness of these two commonly used methods of reduction. As pointed out in a commentary on the article, one finding of the trial was the high rate of fracture redisplacement associated with both methods when in combination with plaster cast immobilisation (<LINK REF="REF-Seiler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seiler 2002</LINK>); but, again, the ultimate functional consequences of this were not revealed.</P>
<P>The paucity of randomised evidence evaluating methods of closed reduction may reflect that some consider "closed reduction in any form is a poor method of treatment if the goal is improvement of fracture alignment" (<LINK REF="REF-Amadio-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amadio 2002</LINK>). However, for the reasons given above, we are convinced that the question of what method is best is relevant and should be addressed through randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>The two other smaller trials (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kongsholm-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kongsholm 1987</LINK>) included in this review tested whether a new method of closed reduction could also avoid the use and risks of anaesthesia. As well as expanding our review inclusion criteria to accommodate anaesthesia as a co-intervention, pain experienced during reduction is a crucial outcome in these trials.</P>
<P>The active role played by the patient in the new manual method of reduction of <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1992</LINK> should have prevented intolerable pain, but nonetheless significantly more participants of this group experienced unchanged or worse pain compared with those given manual reduction under IVRA. More surprising is the high proportion of participants of the latter group whose pain was not diminished by IVRA. Subsequent pain was not recorded. <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1992</LINK> considered the absence of significant differences between the two groups in the immediate radiological outcome or in redisplacement by 10 days showed the new method to be a valid alternative to the traditional method of manual reduction under anaesthesia. An added attraction was the relatively quick procedure that avoided the delays associated with IVRA and reduced the number of staff needed. However, the conclusion of equivalence of the two approaches is insecure due to the small number of patients in the trial, the reservations associated with radiological measurement, the short follow up, and the lack of functional outcomes or mention of complications.</P>
<P>Patients using the dynamic mechanical traction device without anaesthesia in <LINK REF="STD-Kongsholm-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kongsholm 1987</LINK> also played an active role in reducing their fracture. Statistically significantly fewer participants in this group suffered severe pain compared with those given manual reduction under local anaesthesia (haematoma block). <LINK REF="STD-Kongsholm-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kongsholm 1987</LINK> acknowledged that the number (35%) with severe pain despite haematoma block was high relative to several case series; limited evidence from our review of anaesthesia methods supports this view (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2002</LINK>). No important differences in immediate radiological outcome were found but, as with the other two included trials, this should be seen in the context of an absence of functional outcome data. In a separate paper, <LINK REF="STD-Kongsholm-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kongsholm 1987</LINK> reported that neither method resulted in acute nerve injury, but found that significantly fewer patients in the mechanical traction group had signs of neurological impairment, mainly finger numbness, by five weeks. The authors suggested that this was more likely to result from the haematoma block than a difference in the reduction methods. Our review of the evidence from randomised trials of different methods of anaesthesia did not identify this as a specific problem associated with haematoma block; however, data on complications were also sparse (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2002</LINK>). Though there is some indication, including a claim, of care programme comparability in <LINK REF="STD-Kongsholm-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kongsholm 1987</LINK>, some differences in care, such as in the application of the plaster casts, are still plausible and may have influenced this result. Lastly, by one year the differences in neurological impairment were no longer statistically significant and were still not reported in the context of overall function.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There was insufficient evidence from comparisons tested within randomised controlled trials to establish the relative effectiveness of different methods of closed reduction used in the treatment of displaced fractures of the distal radius in adults.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Research on closed reduction methods needs to be set in the context of the overall management of these fractures. There are many unresolved issues such as:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>When is reduction required and what is the best method of anaesthesia, if such is necessary?</LI>
<LI>When, to what extent, by what means and for how long is immobilisation required? </LI>
<LI>When is surgery indicated and what method should be used?</LI>
</UL>
<P>Patient characteristics and preferences, fracture type, and local expertise and resources influence treatment choices and must be considered. We suggest an integrated programme of research, which includes consideration of closed reduction methods, for the management of these fractures is the way forward. Such a programme should include the identification of gaps in the available evidence for major decision points of clinical management and prioritisation of topics for research. We have made some advance towards this in a project comprising a formal and structured consultation process involving key players, including a patient representative. These provided feedback on a comprehensive document summarising the evidence, primarily from Cochrane reviews, available for key decision points along typical care pathways for these fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2003c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2003c</LINK>). All research should conform to best practice in design, conduct, analysis and reporting: an awareness of various methodological issues examined in this and our other reviews should help to avoid some of the problems that undermine the usefulness of much of the research done so far in this area (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>For researchers contemplating specific research on closed reduction methods for these fractures, we suggest that the choice of interventions to be compared within large randomised trials should take account of potential differences in resource use including the involvement of clinicians in the care process as well as functional outcomes and adverse events. We propose that mechanical finger trap traction versus manual traction, as tested in <LINK REF="STD-Earnshaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Earnshaw 2002</LINK>, remains a suitable starting choice. Consideration should also be given to the proper evaluation of new devices or methods that are described and promoted without supporting evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Wise-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wise 2004</LINK>). Any trials testing closed reduction methods should abide by the methodological criteria for a well-conducted and well-reported randomised trial (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2001</LINK>). Such trials should record full outcome, including functional outcomes, complications and all relevant costs. Since techniques of anaesthesia or reduction, or both together may influence treatment choices, and hence outcomes, researchers should be aware of the need to reflect this tension in study designs.</P>

<P>Timing of intervention: not known, but acute fractures. Dorsal plaster cast applied after reduction.<BR/>(1) New manual reduction method without anaesthesia. Active participation of patient who lies on their stomach. Doctor holds patient's hand and patient asked to provide counter-traction through an active adduction of the upper arm (particularly from m. latissimus dorsi). Doctor probes or feels fracture site with his or her thumb and when the fracture is pulled out the doctor grabs the patient's arm with his or her other hand and asks the patient to relax in order to reduce the distal fragments. Procedure takes half a minute.<BR/>(2) Manual reduction under intravenous regional anaesthesia with traction and counter-traction applied by two people for 2-5 minutes followed by manipulation of the distal fracture fragment. Patient lies on back - passive involvement. Procedure 20 minutes after IVRA with 5-10 mg/ml injection of Citanest (prilocaine hydrochloride)</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Timing of intervention: not known, but acute fractures. Short-arm plaster cast applied with arm in supination and wrist in neutral (with regards to flexion and extension) after reduction.<BR/>(1) Mechanical reduction using a dynamic bone alignment device designed by the trial authors. Patients placed supine on an operating table that is rigged with the dynamic reduction device. All 5 fingers of the fractured arm placed in Chinese finger traps and forearm vertically suspended with elbow flexed at right angles. Upper arm cuff, connected to the apparatus by a tension spring, applied over the upper arm. Gentle traction was applied across the fracture and gradually increased to 10-14 kg. Patients asked to pronate and supinate their forearm. No anaesthesia used. Reduction monitored using image intensifier; time for reduction usually 10-15 minutes. Generally no manipulation. Plaster cast applied before removal of apparatus.<BR/>(2) Manual reduction under local haematoma block (8-10 ml of 1% lidocaine). Five minutes after injection, fracture reduced by manual traction and with direct pressure on distal fragment. Counter-traction applied by assistant, and plaster cast applied by a third assistant.</P>

<P>This trial, reported only in a conference abstract, randomised 106 patients to one of three interventions:<BR/>(1) mechanically applied continuous traction without anaesthesia then circular plaster cast;<BR/>(2) manual reduction under local infiltration anaesthesia then dorsal plaster splint;<BR/>(3) manual reduction under local infiltration anaesthesia then circular plaster cast.<BR/>No discrete results were available in the short conference abstract report of the trial. While the results for pain at reduction could be deduced, the lack of information on participant characteristics, the interventions and trial methods hindered any meaningful interpretation.

<P>(4) Were important baseline characteristics reported and comparable?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Y = good comparability of groups, or confounding adjusted for in analysis.<BR/>? = confounding small, mentioned but not adjusted for, or comparability reported in text without confirmatory data.<BR/>N = large potential for confounding, or not discussed.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The principal confounders considered were type of fracture, time since injury, existing complications (e.g. medial nerve compression), presence of other acute fractures, gender, age and whether primary or secondary displacement.</P>

</TD>
<TD>
<P>Examples of clinically important differences in other interventions were: differences in anaesthesia (except where the use of anaesthesia was a co-intervention), subsequent treatment (surgery, plaster cast), clinician experience and speciality (fully trained orthopaedic surgeons, others). Also considered were the presence or absence of pre-specified criteria for repeat reduction or change of management.</P>
