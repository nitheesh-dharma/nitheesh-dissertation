<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-02-02 12:48:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>Background</P>
<P>Raynaud's phenomenon is a disorder whereby blood vessels in the fingers and toes constrict and reduce blood flow, causing pain and discolouration. This is usually in response to cold exposure or emotional stress. In a small number of cases, Raynaud's phenomenon is associated with an underlying disease but, for most people, it is idiopathic (of uncertain cause, or 'primary'). Primary Raynaud's phenomenon is extremely common (especially in women), with one UK study suggesting that over 15% of the population are affected. For people with primary Raynaud's phenomenon who do not respond to conservative measures (e.g. keeping warm), calcium channel blockers represent the first line in drug treatment. Calcium channel blockers (sometimes called calcium antagonists) are drugs that affect the way calcium passes into certain muscle cells and they are the most commonly prescribed medication for primary Raynaud's phenomenon.</P>
<P>Study characteristics and key results</P>
<P>This review examined seven randomised trials which included 296 participants. Although overall all the trials were classed as being at low or unclear risk of bias, the sample size of the included trials was small and there was unclear reporting of outcomes. Two different calcium channel blockers were included: nifedipine and nicardipine. Comparisons in six trials were with placebo and in one trial with both placebo and another type of drug (although only data relating to the calcium channel blocker and placebo were used in this case). Treatment with oral calcium channel blockers was found to be minimally effective in primary Raynaud's phenomenon, reducing the frequency of attacks by around 1.7 attacks per person per week. One trial provided information on duration of attacks reporting no difference between the calcium channel blocker and placebo groups . Oral calcium channel blockers had no effect on severity scores in the two trials in which these were assessed. Only two trials reported preference scores (whereby participants are asked which treatment they prefer) specifically in those with primary Raynaud's phenomenon, and in only one of these was there a between-treatment group difference (participants preferred nifedipine to placebo). Physiological measurements (for example measurement of finger blood flow) were performed in five trials, data could not be combined as the methods were too different, no differences found between calcium channel blocker and placebo treatment were seen in any trial. Treatment with calcium channel blockers was associated with a number of adverse events including headaches, flushing and ankle swelling.</P>
<P>Quality of the evidence</P>
<P>The results of this review were limited by the low number of participants recruited to the studies and by the limitations of currently used outcome measures. This review shows moderate quality evidence that oral calcium channel blockers are minimally effective in the treatment of primary Raynaud's phenomenon, as measured by the frequency of attacks, and high quality evidence that they have little effect on severity. We are unable to comment on duration of attacks and patient preference due to the very low and low quality of evidence provided by the trials in relation to these outcomes<B>.</B>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-01-27 13:22:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>We included seven randomised trials with 296 participants. Four trials examined nifedipine and the remainder nicardipine. Comparisons were with placebo in six trials and with both dazoxiben and placebo in one trial (only the nifedipine versus placebo data were used within this review). Treatment with oral calcium channel blockers was minimally effective in primary Raynaud's phenomenon at decreasing the frequency of attacks (standardised mean difference of 0.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.38, P = 0.003). This translates to 1.72 (95% CI 0.60 to 2.84) fewer attacks per week on calcium channel blockers compared to placebo. One trial provided details on duration of attacks reporting no statistically significant difference between the nicardipine and placebo groups (no P value reported). Only two trials provided any detail of statistical comparisons of (unvalidated) severity scores between treatment groups: one of these trials (60 participants) reported a mean severity score of 1.55 on placebo and 1.36 on nicardipine, difference 0.2 (95% CI of difference 0 to 0.4, no P value reported) and the other trial (three participants only with primary Raynaud's phenomenon) reported a median severity score of 2 on both nicardipine and placebo treatment (P &gt; 0.999) suggesting little effect on severity. Participant-preference scores were included in four trials, but in only two were results specific to participants with primary Raynaud's phenomenon, and scoring systems differed between trials: scores differed between treatments in only one trial, in which 33% of participants on placebo and 73% on nifedipine reported improvement in symptoms (P &lt; 0.001). Physiological measurements were included as outcome measures in five trials (different methodologies were used in each): none of these trials found any statistically significant between-treatment group differences. Treatment with calcium channel blockers appeared to be associated with a number of adverse reactions, including headaches, flushing and oedema (swelling). Overall, the trials were classed as being at low or unclear risk of bias; and the quality of the evidence presented was moderate for number of attacks, very low for duration of attacks, high for severity scores and low for patient preference scores.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-02-02 12:48:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>Raynaud's phenomenon (episodic colour changes of the fingers and toes, usually in response to cold exposure or to emotional stress) may be primary (idiopathic); or secondary to a variety of conditions including connective tissue diseases (especially systemic sclerosis-spectrum disorders), extrinsic vascular compression, use of vibratory equipment (hand-arm-vibration-syndrome), hyperviscosity states, and certain drugs or chemicals (<LINK REF="REF-Block-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 2001</LINK>). The classic colour changes are white (ischaemia), blue (deoxygenation) and red (reperfusion).</P>
<P>This review of calcium channel blockers is concerned only with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. A key differentiating feature between primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon is that in primary Raynaud's phenomenon vasospasm is entirely reversible: irreversible tissue injury does not occur (<LINK REF="REF-LeRoy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">LeRoy 1992</LINK>). This is in contrast to the situation in systemic sclerosis, for example, when digital ischaemia can be severe and result in ulceration, scarring, and sometimes even gangrene. Although primary Raynaud's phenomenon is therefore often considered 'benign', it can cause considerable discomfort and distress in severely affected people, with a negative impact on perceived quality of life comparable to in patients with secondary Raynaud's (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pathogenesis of primary Raynaud's phenomenon is not known but it is likely that abnormalities in the neural control elements of vascular tone play a key role (<LINK REF="REF-Herrick-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrick 2005</LINK>). Primary Raynaud's phenomenon is common; its reported prevalence varies, in part related to geography, being less prevalent in warmer climates (<LINK REF="REF-Maricq-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maricq 1997</LINK>). A UK general practice-based study suggested that 15% to 19% of the population experience Raynaud's phenomenon (<LINK REF="REF-Silman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silman 1990</LINK>), and of these most will have primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Women are more affected than men.</P>
<P>A careful history and examination will usually indicate whether or not a person with Raynaud's phenomenon is likely to have the primary form or whether there is an underlying cause. The key investigations to perform are an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (normal in primary Raynaud's phenomenon), antinuclear antibody (ANA) (negative or only weakly positive in people with primary Raynaud's phenomenon) and nailfold capillaroscopy (normal in people with primary Raynaud's phenomenon) (<LINK REF="REF-LeRoy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">LeRoy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wigley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wigley 2002</LINK>). In the person with Raynaud's phenomenon, systemic sclerosis-specific autoantibodies and nailfold capillaroscopic abnormalities are independent risk factors for systemic sclerosis (<LINK REF="REF-Koenig-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koenig 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many people with primary Raynaud's phenomenon are reassured to know that they do not have a serious underlying disease and respond well to conservative measures, including keeping warm and avoiding drugs with vasoconstrictive effects (<LINK REF="REF-Suter-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suter 2005</LINK>). Smoking cessation should be strongly encouraged. Although smoking has not been proven to adversely affect primary Raynaud's phenomenon, it is likely that Raynaud's could be exacerbated via a variety of possible mechanisms including endothelial injury and increased plasma viscosity. Although some sufferers have reported benefit from temperature biofeedback, this was shown to be ineffective in a large randomised controlled trial of 313 participants with primary Raynaud's phenomenon (<LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>For those people with primary Raynaud's phenomenon who do not respond to conservative (i.e. 'non-drug') measures, drug treatment will often be required. The aim of drug treatment is to prevent vasospasm or to increase vasodilation, or both. Despite the high prevalence of primary Raynaud's phenomenon, there have been relatively few controlled clinical trials, probably reflecting how difficult clinical trials of Raynaud's phenomenon are to set up. These have to be run over the winter months, there is a large placebo effect, and there is a lack of reliable outcome measures which are sensitive to change. The Raynaud's Condition Score, a self-assessment score (0 to 10) which incorporates frequency, duration and severity of attacks, is increasingly used in clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Merkel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkel 2002</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-12-17 09:21:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>Calcium channel blockers are generally considered first-line in the drug treatment of primary Raynaud's phenomenon, and are the group of drugs which have been most researched. A meta-analysis published in 2005 concluded that calcium channel blockers had some effect in primary Raynaud's phenomenon in reducing the frequency and severity of Raynaud's attacks, but that this was small (2.8 to 5.0 fewer attacks per week with a 33% reduction in severity) (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2005</LINK>). Other drugs currently used include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Dziadzio-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dziadzio 1999</LINK>) and alpha-adrenergic blockers (<LINK REF="REF-Harding-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harding 1998</LINK>). Intravenous prostanoids, used to treat severe exacerbations of digital ischaemia and ulceration in people with systemic sclerosis-spectrum disorders, are not generally indicated for primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Similarly, surgical intervention, for example digital (palmar) sympathectomy, may be indicated for severe secondary Raynaud's phenomenon but not in people with primary Raynaud's phenomenon.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-12-09 13:03:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Calcium channel blockers bind to L-type voltage-gated calcium channels on cells, preventing influx of extracellular calcium. There are two main categories of calcium channel blocker: the dihydropyridines (these include nifedipine, nicardipine and amlodipine) and the non-dihydropyridines (these include diltiazem and verapamil) (<LINK REF="REF-Sturgill-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sturgill 1998</LINK>). The dihydropyridines are more selective for vascular smooth muscle than the non-dihydropyridines: they are potent vasodilators with minimal effect on cardiac contractility or conduction, and can cause reflex tachycardia. In contrast, verapamil and diltiazem are negatively inotropic and can slow cardiac conduction, and are less potent vasodilators than the dihydropyridines. The calcium channel blockers which have been most studied in primary Raynaud's phenomenon, and forming the basis of this review, are dihydropyridines.</P>

We included trials not analysed on an intention-to-treat basis, provided all randomised participants were accounted for. We included cross-over trials only if they incorporated (a) a placebo or no-treatment 'run-in' of at least one week (or provided baseline data for quantification of the severity of the condition), and (b) a 'wash-out' period of at least one week between treatment arms for all participants. We identified but did not include in the meta-analyses studies in which primary and secondary cases could not be resolved. We also excluded open studies and single-dose studies.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-12-17 09:23:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>The rate of attacks was the only outcome for which we deemed it appropriate to conduct meta-analysis. The results of the remaining outcomes were described separately for each study. For attack rate, the measure of treatment effect used was the difference in mean number of Raynaud's attacks in the treatment and placebo groups. Mean numbers of attacks were reported over different time periods across the studies and, in the case of <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>, geometric means were reported, requiring log transformation in order to make the comparison. Accordingly, we used a standardised mean difference as the parameterisation of treatment effect, calculated by the difference in means divided by the pooled standard deviation (SD) for each study. We calculated the individual study estimates of treatment effect in R (<LINK REF="REF-R-Development-Core-Team-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">R Development Core Team 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Numbers of attacks were reported on different scales across trials. We calculated standardised mean differences for each trial, in order to provide commensurable estimates of treatment effect. Following data synthesis, we transformed the pooled estimate of treatment effect and its 95% confidence interval to an interpretable scale by multiplying by a typical SD, obtained by pooling the standard deviations of the trials in the analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, section 12.6.4).</P>

<P>The individual participant was the unit of analysis. For cross-over trials, the calculation of standard errors accounted for the fact that observations were paired (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>).</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2016-01-14 10:25:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>Five trials had missing data due to participant withdrawal. In three of these (<LINK REF="STD-Sarkozi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkozi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wollersheim-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wollersheim 1991</LINK>), participant-level data were not reported and no intention-to-treat analysis had been attempted. For these studies, we analysed the data as reported based on all participants retained in the study. As such, we assumed missing data to be missing completely at random. In one of the five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>), participant-level data were reported, but the number of participants with primary Raynaud's phenomenon was too low to permit meaningful imputation of missing values. One study (<LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>), presented results having conducted multiple imputation to account for missing data. We used these results in the meta-analysis. We contacted two authors for missing data or if the reporting of data was unclear and, while both responded, no additional data were available.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-12-17 09:23:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>We examined statistical heterogeneity using a Cochrane's Q test and the I² statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Wherever there appeared to be at least moderate statistical heterogeneity (I² &gt; 30%), we performed a random-effects analysis to test the robustness of the results derived from the fixed-effect approach. Assessment of clinical heterogeneity was based on consideration of the protocols of the studies included in the analysis and their individual estimates of effect size. Wherever we suspected clinical heterogeneity, we performed a sensitivity analysis by repeating the meta-analysis with the clinically heterogeneous trials excluded.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-12-17 09:23:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>We entered primary outcome data from all included studies into a funnel plot (trial effect against trial size) to investigate the possibility of publication bias, but the small number of studies (seven) meant that we could reach no definitive conclusion.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-12-17 09:23:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>We performed statistical analysis according to the statistical guidelines provided for authors by the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group and from the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We combined the results of five cross-over trials and two parallel-group trials in a meta-analysis. These compared the calcium channel blockers nifedipine and nicardipine with placebo for the outcome 'frequency of Raynaud's attacks'. We calculated estimates of treatment effect and standard errors for each of the studies.</P>
<P>Two studies did not report SDs for treatment or placebo groups, and did not contain sufficient information to calculate them. This did not, however, prevent the calculation of a standardised mean difference for either study. For one study (<LINK REF="STD-Wollersheim-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wollersheim 1991</LINK>), the mean difference in the number of attacks, and therefore the standardised difference, was zero. We made a conservative assumption that there was no correlation between participants' measurements, resulting in a larger standard error and a relatively low weighting for the study within the meta-analysis. The other study (<LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>) reported geometric means for attack rates and adjusted P values. By using the upper limit of the P value and log-transforming the geometric means, it was possible to calculate a standard error for the difference in means. From this, it was possible to calculate a standardised mean difference and a corresponding standard error.</P>
<P>We then pooled the estimates using the generic inverse variance method, whereby each study is weighted according to the precision of its estimate of treatment effect. Following synthesis, we back-transformed the pooled estimate to an interpretable scale, as described above.</P>
<P>We used a forest plot to show individual study estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI), together with the pooled estimate. We conducted the meta-analysis using the Review Manager 5 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>) provided by The Cochrane Collaboration.</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2013-12-17 09:23:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>We performed separate subgroup analyses for the nifedipine and nicardipine trials. To investigate the influence of clinically heterogeneous trials, we performed sensitivity analyses with the trials in question excluded.</P>

<SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-07-12 07:46:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of the meta-analysis as follows:</P>

<LI>If a study had a weighting that seemed disproportionate to its sample size, we repeated the analysis with that study removed.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of findings</HEADING>
<P>We produced a summary of findings table for the comparison calcium channel blockers versus placebo for patients with primary Raynaud&#8217;s phenomenon, using the GRADEpro GDT software. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence for the primary review outcomes of attack rates, duration of attacks, severity and patient preference. We downgraded the evidence from 'high quality' for serious or very serious study limitations (risk of bias, indirectness and inconsistency of evidence, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias) according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews </I>(<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=165401092620303738&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2011">Higgins 2011</A>) and the GRADE Working Group (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-Working-Group-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE Working Group 2004</LINK>)<I>. </I>
</P>
<P>To highlight, the number of participants in the summary of findings table does differ from the outcome number of attacks because the participants in the crossover studies are counted twice by <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>, due to the fact that each acts as their own control. Our analysis takes this into account, by allowing for the correlation between the paired measurements in the crossover studies.</P>

<P>Seven trials were eligible for inclusion in the review. Three trials had multiple publications (<LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>). In two cases (<LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>), we extracted data from the main trial report and in one case (<LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1987</LINK>) from the English language publication. See the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. The seven included trials had a total of 296 participants with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. The largest study (<LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>) involved 158 participants, three (<LINK REF="STD-Sarkozi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkozi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wollersheim-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wollersheim 1991</LINK>) had between 69 and 16 participants and the remaining three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rodeheffer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rodeheffer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1987</LINK>) had six or fewer participants.

<P>In the 87 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, we identified a total of 11 calcium channel blockers (48 studies involved nifedipine, eight nicardipine, five nisoldipine, four diltiazem, three felodipine, three flunarizine, two isradipine, one amlodipine, one verapamil, one phendilin and one drug in development, with some examining more than one calcium channel blocker).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Types of participants</HEADING>
<P>Four trials had a mixture of participants with primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (<LINK REF="STD-Rodeheffer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rodeheffer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wollersheim-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wollersheim 1991</LINK>). However, results were presented separately for the two groups. The remaining trials included only participants with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. The definitions of primary Raynaud's phenomenon used within the seven trials varied substantially: two referenced specific criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Wollersheim-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wollersheim 1991</LINK> used <LINK REF="REF-Allen-1932" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 1932</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK> used <LINK REF="REF-Priollet-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Priollet 1987</LINK>), four provided descriptions only (<LINK REF="STD-Rodeheffer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rodeheffer 1983</LINK>: symptomatic Raynaud's phenomenon relating to cold or stress without demonstrable systemic disease; <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>: episodic digital pallor and cyanosis on cold exposure without associated demonstrable disease; <LINK REF="STD-Sarkozi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkozi 1986</LINK>: episodic, well-demarcated, digital pallor or cyanosis in response to cold or emotional stimuli, episodes associated with numbness and pain and no clinical evidence of primary disease; and <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1987</LINK>: symptomatic, bilateral Raynaud's without secondary disease) while <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK> screened participants for primary Raynaud's using colour charts (<LINK REF="REF-Maricq-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maricq 1988</LINK>) and, along with <LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK>, used nailfold capillaroscopy, antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing and physical examinations to rule out secondary Raynaud's. In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Rodeheffer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rodeheffer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarkozi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkozi 1986</LINK>), references to positive ANA titres or the development of digital gangrene amongst trial participants indicate that some participants diagnosed as primary Raynaud's phenomenon may not have fulfilled what are now the generally accepted criteria.</P>
<P>Major exclusion criteria were secondary Raynaud's phenomenon in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Sarkozi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkozi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>) although, as above, there were concerns that some participants with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon may have been included in one of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sarkozi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkozi 1986</LINK>). Participants were required to be free of vasoactive medications one week prior in one case (<LINK REF="STD-Sarkozi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkozi 1986</LINK>), four weeks prior in one case (<LINK REF="STD-Wollersheim-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wollersheim 1991</LINK>), and at the start of the trial in four cases (<LINK REF="STD-Rodeheffer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rodeheffer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK> also required participants not to take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), aspirin and drugs affecting the nervous system. One trial did not list medications as exclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Baseline frequency of Raynaud's attacks was provided in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>; as an average daily attack rate during the previous cold season) and five trials had a minimum attack rate as an inclusion criterion. Participants were required to have at least two attacks per day during the previous cold season in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>), one attack per day in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wollersheim-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wollersheim 1991</LINK>), two per week in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sarkozi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkozi 1986</LINK>) and three per week in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK>). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Rodeheffer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rodeheffer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1987</LINK>) did not stipulate a minimum attack rate.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Rodeheffer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rodeheffer 1983</LINK>) had only female participants and four trials had more female than male participants (<LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarkozi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkozi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>), which would reflect the prevalence of primary Raynaud's phenomenon in the population. In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wollersheim-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wollersheim 1991</LINK>), no breakdown by gender was available for participants with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. The age range across the studies also reflected the age distribution of Raynaud's phenomenon in the population by including both young and older participants: three trials included participants aged 18 to 65 years, one trial 18 to 68 years, one trial 20 to 49 years and in two cases the mean age was 39 and 45 years. Ethnicity data were provided in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>). All seven trials were based within a hospital setting: three in the USA, two in France, one in Canada and one in the Netherlands. Five trials were conducted during the cold season, one trial ran from January to June (<LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1987</LINK>) and in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wollersheim-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wollersheim 1991</LINK>) the timing was not specified.

Three trials had a run-in period on no medication lasting either one week (<LINK REF="STD-Sarkozi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkozi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1987</LINK>) or three weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Wollersheim-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wollersheim 1991</LINK>). One trial had a one-week run-in period with single-blind placebo treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK>) and two trials had a two-week run-in period with single-blind placebo treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Rodeheffer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rodeheffer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>All the trials were published prior to 2001 and so predated the use of the Raynaud's Condition Score (<LINK REF="REF-Merkel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkel 2002</LINK>). Frequency of Raynaud's attacks was recorded in all seven trials using participant diaries.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Attack rates of Raynaud's phenomenon</HEADING>
<P>The meta-analysis suggested a statistically significant advantage of treatment with calcium channel blockers compared to placebo as measured by the number of Raynaud's attacks (standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.38, P = 0.003) although the effect size was small and the 95% CI indicated that the actual treatment effect may be very small to moderate (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The transformed results, using a pooled SD of 7.48, indicated a decrease in the number of Raynaud's attacks per week on calcium channel blockers as compared to placebo (1.72; 95% CI 0.60 to 2.84). Calcium channel blockers, therefore, could reduce the weekly number of attacks by as few as 0.6, or as many as 2.8.</P>
<P>Within the meta-analysis, <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK> received a high weighting inconsistent with the number of participants but when we conducted a sensitivity analysis the effect of excluding this study made little difference to the overall results (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK> was the only trial with a 95% CI for the SMD which unequivocally suggested a beneficial effect of treatment (the interval did not span zero). Accordingly, the meta-analysis was repeated with <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK> removed. The effect was a reduction of the point estimate and confidence limits of the overall estimate of treatment effect. We no longer observed a statistically significant treatment effect (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>

<P>Four trials were included (<LINK REF="STD-Rodeheffer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rodeheffer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarkozi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkozi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>): two were parallel (<LINK REF="STD-Sarkozi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkozi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>) and two were cross-over (<LINK REF="STD-Rodeheffer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rodeheffer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>). One parallel trial compared 10 mg nifedipine three times a day rising to 20 mg three times a day if no improvement shown at five weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Sarkozi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkozi 1986</LINK>) with placebo for a total of 10 weeks. The other parallel trial compared 30 mg sustained-release nifedipine once a day rising to 60 mg if well tolerated for a period of one year (<LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>). One cross-over trial compared 20 mg nifedipine three times a day with placebo for a period of two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>), while the other cross-over trial compared 10 mg nifedipine three times a day rising to 20 mg if well tolerated with placebo for a period of two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Rodeheffer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rodeheffer 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effect of excluding the three nicardipine trials was to increase the point estimate and confidence intervals for the size of the treatment effect (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). A significant treatment effect was found at the 5% level (P = 0.004). A pooled SD of 7.51 was calculated for the nifedipine trials to give a difference in means of 2.41; 95% CI 0.75 to 4.06.</P>
<P>Nifedipine therefore could reduce the weekly number of attacks by as few as 0.8, or by as many as 4.1. There was a considerable amount of statistical heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of nifedipine trials alone (I² = 48%). We performed a random-effects analysis to investigate whether the results were robust to heterogeneity and, while this had a negligible effect on the point estimate of treatment effect, the confidence interval was wider and the estimate of treatment effect was no longer statistically significant at the 5% level (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>). The difference in means was 2.33 (95% CI -0.38 to 5.11).</P>

<P>We found no overall effect of nicardipine (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). Multiplying the estimate and CI by the baseline SD reported in <LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK> gave a result of 1.11 (95% CI -0.44 to 2.59). Nicardipine therefore could increase the weekly number of attacks by as much as 0.4, could decrease the weekly number of attacks by as much as 2.6 or have no effect whatsoever.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Duration of attacks</HEADING>
<P>Duration of attacks was recorded in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wollersheim-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wollersheim 1991</LINK>): the average duration of attacks was 11 minutes in participants in the placebo group and 13 minutes in the nicardipine group but this difference was not statistically significant. Insufficient information was available to reproduce this analysis, and no P values or confidence intervals were provided.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Severity scores</HEADING>
<P>Severity of Raynaud's attacks was recorded in six of the seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarkozi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkozi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wollersheim-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wollersheim 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>). In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>), severity scores were not reported specifically for participants with primary Raynaud's and no results were provided in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Wollersheim-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wollersheim 1991</LINK> reported no significant difference between placebo and treatment although insufficient information was available to reproduce the analysis, and no P values or confidence intervals were reported. <LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK> reported no significant difference between 60 participants receiving placebo and nicardipine in a cross-over design (mean score ± SD: 1.55 ± 0.7 in placebo versus 1.36 ± 0.8 in nicardipine; difference 0.2 (95% CI of difference 0 to 0.4)). No P value was reported and it was not possible to reproduce the Wilcoxon signed rank test due to a lack of participant-level data. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sarkozi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkozi 1986</LINK>) reported average percentage change in number of attacks, broken down by severity. A reduction in the average number of mild, moderate and severe attacks was reported for participants on nifedipine, although no statistical comparison was made with the placebo group. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1987</LINK>) a comparison of severity scores in primary Raynaud's participants was not made, but the authors of this review were able to make a comparison using reported participant-level data with a median score of 2 for three participants while on placebo versus 2 while on nicardipine (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P &gt; 0.9999). We did not pool severity data for meta-analysis for the following reasons: scales were generally described and unvalidated, the timing of assessment differed in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1987</LINK>), and no data on severity were reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>).</P>

Finally, <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK> asked participants to rate improvement compared to baseline at quarterly visits and found participants rated symptoms as better on nifedipine in comparison to placebo (33% in placebo group versus 73% in nifedipine group, P &lt; 0.001). We did not pool participant-preference data for meta-analysis for the following reasons: scales were generally described and unvalidated, definitions of participant-preference differed slightly across all four trials, and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>) collected data at a different time point.</P>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>) included quality of life measures, although data were reported only in one (<LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Physiological measurements (including digital temperature and blood flow response to hand cooling)</HEADING>
<P>Physiological measurements were used in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Rodeheffer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rodeheffer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarkozi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkozi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wollersheim-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wollersheim 1991</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK> examined finger systolic pressure after local cooling at the end of each treatment period but no data were available specifically for participants with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. <LINK REF="STD-Rodeheffer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rodeheffer 1983</LINK> assessed digital-artery systolic pressure at 30 and 15 degrees C and found no significant change in the mean cold-induced fall in digital artery systolic blood pressure between nifedipine and placebo (P = 0.625 and P &gt; 0.999 respectively, from Wilcoxon signed rank test conducted by the review authors). <LINK REF="STD-Sarkozi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Sarkozi 1986</LINK> assessed pulse amplitude of digital blood flow (assessed by photoplethysmography) and time to return to baseline pulse amplitude following cold pressor challenge at baseline and on the last day of treatment. No significant differences were found between baseline and at the end of treatment in either the nifedipine or placebo groups. Between-group comparisons of physiological measurements after 10 weeks of treatment conducted by the authors of this review found no significant differences for pulse amplitudes (P = 0.896 and P = 0.815 by unpaired t-tests, right and left hands respectively) or for responses to the cold pressor test (P = 0.542 and P = 0.066) for right index and middle fingers respectively). <LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK> assessed cold-reactive hyperaemia as measured by skin temperature using cold challenge tests at each visit with the exception of the 'wash-out' period but found no significant increase in reactive hyperaemia between the nicardipine and placebo groups (mean of 0.49 ± -2.4 in placebo versus 0.77 ± -1.6 in treatment group, difference of -0.3 ± -3, 95% CI -1.0 to 0.5, but no P value given and insufficient information to reproduce the analysis). <LINK REF="STD-Wollersheim-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wollersheim 1991</LINK> examined response to a finger cooling test as measured by finger skin temperature, laser Doppler flux and transcutaneous oxygen tension. No effects of nicardipine were found for any of these three parameters, nor were there any differences between participants with primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. P values were not reported but were calculated by the review authors using unpaired t-tests, as insufficient data were available to calculate the standard error of the mean difference required for paired t-tests (finger skin temperature P = 0.830, laser Doppler flux P = 0.570, transcutaneous oxygen tension P = 0.812). Accordingly, we acknowledge that these tests will have reduced power. We did not pool physiological data for meta-analysis because the methodology used varied substantially and the results could not be synthesised.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-02 12:57:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>This review summarises the evidence for the use of calcium channel blockers in the treatment of primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Of the 69 studies identified by the search (which examined 11 different calcium channel blockers), seven trials with a total of 296 participants were included in the review. The remaining 62 studies did not match the inclusion criteria of this review. Four of the seven included trials investigated nifedipine, and three investigated nicardipine.</P>
<P>Only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK>), provided any detail of statistical comparisons of (unvalidated) severity scores between treatment groups: one of these trials (60 participants) reported a mean severity score of 1.55 on placebo and 1.36 on nicardipine, difference 0.2 (95% CI of difference 0 to 0.4, no P value reported) and the other trial (three participants only with primary Raynaud's phenomenon) reported a median severity score of 2 on both nicardipine and placebo treatment (P &gt; 0.999). The contrasting results may be partially explained by differences in how severity was quantified across the trials, using unvalidated scales. Participant-preference scores were included in four trials, but in only two were results specific to participants with primary Raynaud's phenomenon, and scoring systems differed between trials: scores differed between treatments in only one trial, in which 33% of participants on placebo and 73% on nifedipine reported improvement in symptoms (P &lt; 0.001). Physiological measurements were included as outcome measures in five trials (different methodologies were used in each): in none of these trials were any between-treatment group differences found. Treatment with calcium channel blockers was associated with a number of adverse reactions including headaches, flushing and oedema.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis of the seven trials indicated a statistically significant advantage of treatment with calcium channel blockers compared to placebo as measured by the number of Raynaud's attacks per week. However, this significant treatment effect was no longer observed when the analysis was repeated without <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>. This trial included the largest number of participants (158), was conducted over a longer period and was the one which suggested most benefit from a calcium channel blocker. It is possible that the larger effect size was attributable to the longer follow-up period. The use of multiple imputation and the number of participants within the treatment arm who received 0 mg of nifedipine may contribute to the different findings in <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>, although these factors would be expected to decrease rather than increase the estimate of effect.</P>
<P>When the meta-analysis was repeated for each of the two calcium channel blockers individually, the estimate of treatment effect was statistically significant for the four nifedipine trials but this result was not robust to a secondary analysis using a random-effects method. No overall effect of nicardipine was found.</P>
<P>All the studies reported adverse events although it was not always possible within studies including participants with both primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon to determine the adverse reactions for the primary Raynaud's group alone.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-12-17 09:25:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
<P>This meta-analysis highlighted several difficulties inherent in the existing clinical trials of calcium channel blockers in primary Raynaud's phenomenon:</P>
<P>a) The overall quality of the data was very variable with the result that the only outcome measure that could be compared using a meta-analysis across all seven included trials was the frequency of Raynaud's attacks. This meta-analysis therefore emphasises the need for validated outcome measures for Raynaud's phenomenon.</P>
<P>b) A large number of trials were excluded because it was not possible to separate out participants with primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, or because of inadequate wash-out periods within cross-over trial designs.</P>
<P>c) Sample size was small, resulting from the small number of trials which could be included, and the small numbers of participants included in most of these seven trials.</P>
<P>d) The dose of calcium channel blockers used may not reflect maximum doses used in current clinical practice: for example, many clinicians increase the nifedipine dose to 80 mg daily. Also, in only one study was treatment duration longer than 10 weeks, with most studies having much shorter treatment periods.</P>
<P>e) The categorisation and assessment of some of the participants classed as having primary Raynaud's phenomenon was sometimes unsatisfactory with reports of digital gangrene and positive ANA titres suggesting that some participants had secondary rather than primary Raynaud's phenomenon. However, this has to be set against the 'real-world' background in which the distinction between primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon can be difficult; around 1% to 2% per year of those who present with what initially seems to be primary Raynaud's phenomenon go on to develop a systemic sclerosis spectrum disorder or some other underlying disease (<LINK REF="REF-Hirschl-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirschl 2006</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-01-27 13:24:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>We conducted an assessment of overall quality of the evidence according to the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-Working-Group-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE Working Group 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). All seven trials included in the review were described as randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and were judged to be sound in terms of design. Allocation concealment was not fully described in six out of the seven trials, and although described as 'double-blinded', details of how blinding was ensured were not provided. Although detail was lacking in this regard, the review authors did not feel that there was a high likelihood of bias as a result.</P>
<P>Our population of interest was people with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and as such we excluded trials where results for primary Raynaud's participants were not identifiable. Although the demographic information reported across the seven included trials was relatively limited, the sample was broadly representative in terms of gender balance and age range. It should be noted, however, that this sample was predominantly hospital-based and all seven trials recruited from hospital clinics, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK> where participants were also recruited via advertisement. A significant proportion of people with primary Raynaud's phenomenon are not referred to hospital for evaluation and treatment: it is likely that those who are may be more severely affected or may not have responded to conservative measures, or both, and these are the participants mainly presented in this meta-analysis. Another potential concern (highlighted above) is that the doses of calcium channel blockers used within the seven trials are lower than the maximum doses administered in clinical practice. The estimates of treatment effect observed in these seven trials may therefore underestimate the effect of calcium channel blockers.</P>
<P>Further comments regarding quality of the evidence relating to specific outcomes considered in the review follow:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Number of attacks</HEADING>
<P>With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK>, which had a higher 95% lower confidence limit for the standardised mean difference in the number of Raynaud's attacks, the 95% CIs were generally consistent across the trials. A sensitivity analysis with <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK> excluded failed to reproduce the significant treatment difference observed in the meta-analysis of all seven trials. In this review, the longer follow-up time of <LINK REF="STD-RTS-2000" TYPE="STUDY">RTS 2000</LINK> has been proposed as a possible explanation for this potentially discordant interval (the difference is not so severe that the intervals do not overlap). Small numbers of participants with primary Raynaud's phenomenon were included in several trials (<LINK REF="STD-Rodeheffer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rodeheffer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1987</LINK>). The 95% confidence intervals for the standardised mean difference in the number of Raynaud's attacks in both <LINK REF="STD-Rodeheffer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rodeheffer 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1987</LINK> were wide, corresponding to a lack of precision in the estimates of treatment effect. The standard error for the estimate of treatment effect in <LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>, however, was small due to the high within-participant correlation (&#961; = 0.953) and the 95% confidence interval calculated from this study was not too wide. Although <LINK REF="STD-Rodeheffer-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Rodeheffer 1983</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1987</LINK> received a very low weighting in the meta-analysis on account of their large standard errors, the presence of studies with small samples constitutes a limiting feature of these trials as a body of evidence. On account of this, the review authors revised their assessment of the quality of evidence provided by these trials to 'moderate' for number of attacks.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Duration of attacks</HEADING>
<P>The quality of evidence for the outcome duration of attacks was considered to be very low due to the fact that only information on 13 participants in one trial was provided (<LINK REF="STD-Wollersheim-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wollersheim 1991</LINK>), and no information on variation in response (precision) was available.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Severity scores</HEADING>
<P>While six trials reported on severity scores, only one trial reported on this outcome in a manner that allowed for robust conclusions to be drawn (<LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK>). This was a well-designed cross-over study of 60 participants and the evidence arising from this study was consistent with the limited information provided by the remainder. As such, we believe the quality of evidence in relation to the outcome severity scores to be high.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Patient preference scores</HEADING>
<P>We considered the quality of evidence in relation to patient preference scores to be low. No information on variation in response was available, incommensurate scales were used between studies and two studies did not report results separately for primary Raynaud's phenomenon participants. Accordingly, it is difficult to comment on the effect of calcium channel blockers on patient preference scores.</P>
<P>Due to the small number of trials meeting the inclusion criteria of this review, a definitive assessment of publication bias using a funnel plot was not possible. However, the search strategy employed in this review was robust, including conference abstracts in addition to published papers. Furthermore, several of the studies included here contained results best described as null findings. We did not deem the risk of publication bias to be substantial enough to downgrade our assessment of the quality of this body of evidence.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-01-14 10:51:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>None of the review authors was involved in any of the included or excluded studies, and none of us has any relevant commercial or other conflicts of interest. The Trial Search Co-ordinator conducted extensive searches for relevant articles and for details of ongoing studies, to reduce the risk of publication bias. Three review authors independently assessed all studies. As described in the review, we also attempted to deal with missing information and data by contacting authors. No further information was available, however, and missing data could introduce bias into the results of four of the seven studies where multiple imputation had not been attempted and could not be performed by the review authors. This, in turn, could introduce bias into the results of the meta-analyses presented here. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ettinger-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ettinger 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vayssairat-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vayssairat 1991</LINK>), are of concern in this respect, as both received high weighting in the meta-analysis of all trials.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-01-14 10:51:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>A previous meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2005</LINK>), indicated a statistically significant advantage of treatment with calcium channel blockers over placebo in primary Raynaud's phenomenon, with a decrease of between 2.8 to 5 attacks per week. The estimate of treatment effect was statistically significant for nifedipine but not significant for nicardipine or nisoldipine. Inclusion criteria, however, differed from those for this Cochrane review. Trials were included if the number of participants with primary Raynaud's phenomenon exceeded 75%, and trials with a cross-over design but no wash-out period were also included. As a result, the following trials were included by <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2005</LINK> but excluded from this review: <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1983a" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1983a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1985a" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1985a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahan-1985b" TYPE="STUDY">Kahan 1985b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aldoori-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Aldoori 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corbin-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Corbin 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gjorup-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Gjorup 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gjorup-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Gjorup 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Redondo-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Redondo 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waller-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Waller 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Challenor-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Challenor 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nilsson-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Nilsson 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Challenor-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Challenor 1989</LINK>. In one case, a trial was excluded by <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2005</LINK> on the grounds of insufficient data for primary Raynaud's participants but was included within this review (<LINK REF="STD-Wollersheim-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wollersheim 1991</LINK>). Despite these different inclusion criteria, the results presented here can be seen as consistent with the findings of <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2005</LINK> .</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2005</LINK> also included data on the severity of Raynaud's attacks within the meta-analysis. However, we decided not to pool these data because of variation across the seven included trials in terms of scale, description and usage. Instead, we have reported the severity results separately for each trial in which they were reported.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-01-27 13:24:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathryn  Broderick">
<P>There is moderate-quality evidence that oral calcium channel blockers are minimally effective in the treatment of primary Raynaud's phenomenon as measured by the frequency of attacks. Participants experienced 1.72 (95% CI 0.60 to 2.84) fewer attacks per week on calcium channel blockers compared to placebo. This effect size was small, although may be greater with longer duration of treatment. There is high-quality evidence that calcium channel blockers have little effect on severity. We are unable to comment on duration of attacks or on patient preference due to the very low and low quality of evidence available for these outcomes. The results of this review were limited by small sample size and variable overall data quality. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-12-17 09:25:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Holly Ennis">
<P>Given that calcium channel blockers are considered by most clinicians as a first-line treatment for primary Raynaud's phenomenon (and are likely to be the comparator drug in clinical trials of new therapies), there is a need to better define their efficacy in adequately powered, well-designed clinical trials. One concern is the current lack of validated, objective outcome measures for the assessment of Raynaud's attacks. The Raynaud's Condition Score (<LINK REF="REF-Merkel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkel 2002</LINK>) has been validated as an outcome measure for Raynaud's phenomenon and future clinical trials should at least include this.</P>

<P>Minor query - for the outcome number of attacks, there are 7 RCTs with 358 participants in the data and analysis section but the Summary of findings reports 7 RCTs with 296 people - I can't quite figure out why the numbers are different.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2016-07-12 07:45:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many thanks for the feedback and minor query.</P>
<P>The discrepancy (between the summary of findings table and the table for the outcome number of attacks) is because the participants in the crossover studies are counted twice by <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>, due to the fact that each acts as their own control. Our analysis takes this into account, by allowing for the correlation between the paired measurements in the crossover studies.</P>
<P>We have added clarification to this effect in the body of the review for completeness.</P>
