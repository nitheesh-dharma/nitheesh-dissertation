<P>There is strong evidence that some antifungal drugs prevent oral candidiasis (thrush) caused by cancer treatment, but nystatin does not appear to work.<BR/>Treatment for cancer can lead to severe fungal infections (thrush) in the mouth. This can cause discomfort, pain, difficulties in eating, longer stays in hospital and more worryingly, systemic infection and risk to life. Different drugs are used to try and prevent this condition. The review found strong evidence from a large number of trials that some of the antifungal drugs (those absorbed and partially absorbed into the body) help prevent fungal infections in the mouth. Some other commonly used drugs such as nystatin, which are not absorbed into the body, do not appear to work.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Treatment of cancer is increasingly more effective but is associated with short and long term side effects. Oral side effects remain a major source of illness despite the use of a variety of agents to prevent and treat them. One of these side effects is oral candidiasis.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of interventions (which may include placebo or no treatment) for the prevention of oral candidiasis for patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy or both.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-08-05 13:31:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Computerised searches of Cochrane Oral Health Group and PaPaS Trials Registers, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CANCERLIT, SIGLE and LILACS were undertaken.<BR/>Reference lists from relevant articles were searched and the authors of eligible trials were contacted to identify trials and obtain additional information.<BR/>Date of the most recent searches: 3 August 2009: CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2009, Issue 3).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Trials were selected if they met the following criteria: design - random allocation of participants; participants - anyone receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment for cancer; interventions - agents prescribed to prevent oral candidiasis; primary outcome - prevention of oral candidiasis. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-06-17 14:43:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were recorded on the following secondary outcomes if present: relief of pain, amount of analgesia, relief of dysphagia, incidence of systemic infection, duration of stay in hospital (days), cost of oral care, patient quality of life, death, use of empirical antifungal treatment, toxicity and compliance.<BR/>Information regarding methods, participants, interventions, outcome measures and results were independently extracted, in duplicate, by two review authors. The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines were followed and risk ratios (RR) calculated using random-effects models. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined in random-effects metaregression analyses.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-07 10:38:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-eight trials involving 4226 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. Drugs absorbed and partially absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract were found to prevent oral candidiasis when compared to a placebo, or a no treatment control group, with RR for absorbed drugs = 0.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.78). For absorbed drugs in populations with an incidence of 20% (mid range of results in control groups), this implies a number needed to treat (NNT) of 9 (95% CI 7 to 13) patients need to be treated to avoid one patient getting oral candidiasis. There was no significant benefit shown for drugs not absorbed from the GI tract.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-07 10:38:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is strong evidence, from randomised controlled trials, that drugs absorbed or partially absorbed from the GI tract prevent oral candidiasis in patients receiving treatment for cancer. There is also evidence that these drugs are significantly better at preventing oral candidiasis than drugs not absorbed from the GI tract.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-07 10:40:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment of solid malignant tumours and the leukaemias with cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy or both is becoming increasingly more effective but it is associated with short and long term side effects. Among the clinically important acute side effects is the disruption in the function and integrity of the mouth. The consequences of this include severe ulceration (mucositis) and fungal infection of the mouth (oral candidiasis). These disease and treatment induced complications may also produce oral discomfort and pain, poor nutrition, delays in drug administration, increased hospital stays and costs and in some patients life threatening infection (septicaemia). These potential problems have prompted clinicians to use agents during cancer treatment to prevent such oral complications.</P>
<P>Antifungal agents are often used during the treatment of cancer to prevent superficial infections including oral candidiasis. Prevention of superficial infection is considered important because of its possible role in the development of systemic fungal infection. The incidence of systemic fungal infection has increased with the development of increasingly effective cancer therapy causing greater mucosal damage and prolonged neutropenia (<LINK REF="REF-De-Pauw-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Pauw 1997</LINK>). Systemic infection is difficult to diagnose early and consequently cure because it rapidly becomes well advanced and disseminated leading to considerable morbidity and mortality. Sometimes empirical antifungal treatment is given to patients without documented fungal infection but with persistent fever despite antibiotic treatment. A current Cochrane review concludes that the only prophylactic or empirical antifungal agent with documented evidence of reducing mortality in cancer patients with neutropenia is intravenous amphotericin B (<LINK REF="REF-Gotzsche-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotzsche 2002</LINK>). In this review studies concerned with the prevention and treatment of oral candidiasis were excluded.</P>
<P>We consider it important to review the evidence for the prevention of oral candidiasis because of the effect a fungal infection in the mouth has on general well being and the possible related systemic consequences. This review is one in a series of four Cochrane reviews evaluating the evidence for the prevention and treatment of oral candidiasis and oral mucositis in patients treated for cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Clarkson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarkson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Worthington-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worthington 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Worthington-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worthington 2007a</LINK>).</P>

<P>This review is part of a series of four reviews on the prevention and treatment of oral candidiasis and oral mucositis in patients with cancer, and the same search strategies were used for all four reviews.<BR/>The searches attempted to identify all relevant trials irrespective of language. Papers not in English were translated by members of The Cochrane Collaboration.</P>
<P>Electronic searching - the databases searched were:<BR/>Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register<BR/>Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care (PaPaS) Group Trials Register<BR/>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2009, Issue 3)<BR/>MEDLINE (from 1966) and MEDLINE Pre-indexed<BR/>EMBASE (from 1974)<BR/>CINAHL<BR/>CANCERLIT via PubMed<BR/>OPEN SIGLE<BR/>LILACS.</P>
<P>Sensitive search strategies were developed for each database using a combination of free text and MeSH terms. These are described in detail in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK>.</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-08-11 09:57:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The titles and abstracts (when available) of all reports identified through the searches were scanned independently by two review authors (Jan Clarkson (JC) and Helen Worthington (HW)). Full reports were obtained for trials appearing to meet the inclusion criteria, or for which there was insufficient information in the title and abstract to make a clear decision. The full reports obtained from all the electronic and other methods of searching were assessed independently, in duplicate, by two review authors to establish whether the trials met the inclusion criteria or not. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>The quality assessment of the included trials was undertaken independently and in duplicate by two review authors as part of the data extraction process.<BR/>Three main quality criteria were examined.<BR/>(1) Allocation concealment, recorded as:<BR/>(A) Adequate<BR/>(B) Unclear<BR/>(C) Inadequate as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 4.2.5.</P>
<P>(2) Treatment blinded to outcome assessors, patients and providers recorded as:<BR/>(A) Yes<BR/>(B) No<BR/>(C) Unclear<BR/>(D) Not possible.</P>
<P>(3) Completeness of follow up (is there a clear explanation for withdrawals and drop outs in each treatment group?) assessed as:<BR/>(A) Yes<BR/>(C) No.</P>
<P>After taking into account the additional information provided by the authors of the trials, studies were grouped into the following categories based on three criteria: allocation concealment, treatment blinded to outcome assessor and completeness of follow up:<BR/>(A) Low risk of bias (plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the results) if all criteria were met.<BR/>(B) Moderate risk of bias (plausible bias that raises some doubt about the results) if one of the criteria was not met.<BR/>(C) High risk of bias (plausible bias that seriously weakens confidence in the results) if two or more criteria were not met as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 4.2.5 section 6.7.</P>
<P>Further quality assessment was carried out to assess sample size calculations, definition of exclusion/inclusion criteria, and comparability of control and test groups at entry. The quality assessment criteria were pilot tested using several articles.</P>
<P>The quality assessment of included trials was undertaken independently and in duplicate by two review authors as part of the data extraction process. Included trials were assessed on the following criteria: concealed allocation of treatment; blinding of patients, carers and outcome assessors; and information on reasons for withdrawal by trial group. The risk of bias was assessed as high, moderate or low, according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 4.2.5. The agreement between the review authors was assessed by calculating the Kappa score.</P>
<P>Data were extracted by two review authors independently using specially designed data extraction forms. The characteristics of the trial participants, interventions and outcomes for the included trials are presented in the study tables. The incidence of oral candidiasis was measured in several different ways ranging from clinical examination to mycological assessment. The clinical assessment was used if present otherwise the mycological assessment was included. Oral candidiasis was recorded as absent or present, and the 'Characteristics of included studies' table includes a description of the methods of measurement used. The duration of trials was recorded along with interim assessments and a decision made about which to use to maximise commonality. We also recorded the country where the trial was conducted, which year it was published and whether a dentist was involved in the investigation. Authors were contacted for clarification or for further information.</P>
<P>We decided a priori to categorise the interventions as whether they were fully absorbed, partially absorbed or not absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the estimates of effect of an intervention was expressed as risk ratios together with 95% confidence intervals. Where there were studies of similar comparisons reporting the same candidiasis outcome measure a meta-analysis was undertaken. Risk ratios were combined for the dichotomous data, and mean differences combined for continuous data, both using a random-effects model.</P>
<P>The significance of any discrepancies in the estimates of the treatment effects from the different trials was assessed by means of Cochran's test for heterogeneity, and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, where I<SUP>2</SUP> describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. Any heterogeneity was fully investigated.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Investigation of publication and other biases</HEADING>
<P>A funnel plot (plots of effect estimates versus the inverse of their standard errors) was drawn. Asymmetry of the funnel plot may indicate publication bias and other biases related to sample size, though it may also represent a true relationship between trial size and effect size. A formal investigation of the degree of asymmetry was performed using the method proposed by Egger et al (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). A further method proposed by Begg and Mazumdar which tests for publication bias by determining if there is a significant correlation between the effect estimates and their variances was also carried out (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1994</LINK>). Both methods were carried out using Stata version 7.0 (Stata Corporation, USA) using the program Metabias.<BR/>
<BR/>It was planned to undertake a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of concealed allocation, blinded outcome assessment and assessment of study as of low risk of bias on the overall estimates of effect. We also proposed a priori to conduct subgroup analyses for different cancer types (solid, leukaemia and mixed) and age groups (children, adults and mixed). These analyses were undertaken using random-effects metaregression, using the Stata version 7.0 (Stata Corporation, USA) using the program Metareg (<LINK REF="REF-Sharp-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharp 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>Electronic searches identified over 6000 titles and abstracts and from this we obtained over 400 full reports for the four reviews in this series. One hundred and nine studies were considered eligible for this review according to the defined criteria for trial design, participants, interventions and outcomes. Of these 81 trials were excluded for reasons summarised in the <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK> section.</P>
<P>For the 28 trials included in the review the results are based on 4226 patients who were assessed for oral candidiasis. The range of patients was from eight to 420 per treatment/control group.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparisons with placebo/no treatment: oral candidiasis (comparison 1, outcome 1.1)</HEADING>
<P>Seven trials involving 1153 patients compared drugs absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with placebo, or 'no treatment' control group and the meta-analysis showed that these drugs prevented oral candidiasis with risk ratio (RR) of 0.47 (95% confidence interval (CI)<SUB>Random Effects</SUB> 0.29 to 0.78, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 10.2, degrees of freedom (df) = 6, P = 0.12, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 41%). In order to illustrate the magnitude of the effect, the number of patients needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one patient getting oral candidiasis were calculated, based on this pooled effect estimate and on the incidence of oral candidiasis in the control groups of the trials that contributed data to this meta-analysis. The incidence was 5% to 60%, median value 20%. In populations with a low incidence of oral candidiasis of 5%, this gives a NNT of 37 (95% CI 29 to 56) patients requiring treatment to avoid one patient getting oral candidiasis during the cancer treatment period. In populations with an incidence of 20% (mid range of results in control groups), this implies a NNT of 9 (95% CI 7 to 13) patients requiring treatment to avoid one patient getting oral candidiasis. For populations with a high incidence (60%) the NNT is 3 (95% CI 3 to 5).</P>
<P>Four trials involving 292 patients compared drugs partially absorbed from the GI tract with placebo and these drugs were also found to prevent oral candidiasis (RR = 0.13, 95% CI<SUB>Random Effects</SUB> 0.06 to 0.46, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 5.3, df = 3, P = 0.15, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 43%).</P>
<P>Eight studies involving 382 patients compared drugs not absorbed from the GI tract with placebo or no treatment control groups, and overall the drugs did not have a significant benefit in preventing oral candidiasis RR = 0.68 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.02, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity = 23.3, df = 7, P &lt; 0.001, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 70%). Since 70% of the total variation across studies is due to heterogeneity rather than chance this was investigated. Subgroup analyses were conducted for age group and cancer type and these factors failed to explain the large heterogeneity present for the eight studies involving the non-absorbed drugs, however, this was investigated further in a meta-analysis presented later in this section.</P>

No other outcomes (systemic fungal infection, death, empirical antifungal treatment, toxicity or compliance) were reported in these studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>Publication bias was assessed for the primary outcome, oral candidiasis, for three groups of trials:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>drugs absorbed from GI tract versus placebo (7 trials, comparison 1, outcome 1.1);</LI>
<LI>drugs not absorbed from GI tract versus placebo (8 trials, comparison 1, outcome 1.1);</LI>
<LI>absorbed drugs versus drugs not absorbed (7 trials, comparison 2, outcome 2.1).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The funnel plot for each appeared asymmetric and there is evidence of bias for all three groups of studies using the Egger (weighted regression) method (P = 0.003, &lt; 0.001, 0.018, respectively), but not using the Begg (rank correlation) method (P = 0.65, 0.30, 0.22) (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Metaregression</HEADING>
<P>
<I>See</I> Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.<BR/>Metaregression models were fitted, using Stata version 7, to investigate how much of the heterogeneity of treatment effect is explained by drug type (three categories), age group (three categories) and cancer type (three categories) for the 19 comparisons in 18 placebo controlled or no treatment control trials. A univariate analysis for drug type showed significant differences for both the absorbed (P = 0.016) and partially absorbed drugs (P = 0.002) when compared with the non-absorbed drugs, the drugs absorbed or partially absorbed from the GI tract being more effective (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). It is recognised that there are weaknesses in using indirect comparisons, however, the indirect comparison for absorbed drugs did support the findings of the direct comparison (comparison 2, outcome 2.1). The model for age group (including drug type) showed no significant differences in the effect size for the different age groups however the model for cancer type (including drug type) showed a significant difference between cancer types, with the treatment effect being greater for trials including patients with blood (P = 0.032) and mixed cancers (P = 0.031) compared to those including patients with solid cancer. Further metaregression models were fitted for both allocation concealment and outcome assessment blinded (including drug type), and no significant difference in effect size was found between studies assessed as adequate or not for either of these quality assessments.</P>
<P>A sensitivity analysis was proposed for studies at low risk of bias. Five studies were categorised as this, but only one in each of the classes of drugs for the comparisons between drugs and placebo or no treatment. For absorbed drugs (<LINK REF="STD-Brincker-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Brincker 1983</LINK>) the RR was 0.25 (95% CI 0.06 to 1.03), for partially absorbed drugs (<LINK REF="STD-Cuttner-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cuttner 1986</LINK>) the RR was 0.09 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.65) and for drugs not absorbed (<LINK REF="STD-Wahlin-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wahlin 1989</LINK>) the RR was 0.89 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.02) so the results were similar to those for all studies.</P>
<P>A priori we decided to categorise the drugs into three categories: absorbed, partially absorbed and not absorbed from the GI tract. When comparing drugs in each of these categories with placebo or 'no treatment' controls it was found that there was significant heterogeneity for the not absorbed category of drugs, whereas the other two categories were fairly homogeneous. In order to investigate this heterogeneity further, the eight comparisons involving not absorbed drugs can be categorised further into drug types: nystatin (two trials), amphotericin B (two trials), chlorhexidine (three trials) and thymostimulin (one trial). The comparisons between the groups were not significant in a metaregression analysis (nystatin versus amphotericin B, P = 0.09; nystatin versus chlorhexidine, P = 0.41; nystatin versus thymostimulin, P = 0.18). However classification by drug type did appear to reduce the heterogeneity, although there are only a few trials in each category. The meta-analysis shown in MetaView (comparison 5, outcome 5.1) indicates that there may be some benefit for amphotericin B with RR = 0.43 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.94), whereas there is no evidence of a benefit for nystatin.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-07 10:43:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have found evidence that antifungal agents absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract prevent oral candidiasis in patients receiving treatment for cancer. Drugs fully absorbed (fluconazole, ketoconazole and itraconazole) and partially absorbed (miconazole and clotrimazole) are effective compared with placebo or no treatment. The quality of the trials was mixed, however no differences in effect size were found when poor quality studies were excluded. There is no evidence that overall the group of non-absorbed drugs are effective and looking at these drugs individually this finding is consistent for the commonly prescribed oral polyene, nystatin, however, there is weak evidence that amphotericin B might be of benefit. Both direct and indirect comparisons demonstrate the superiority of absorbed compared with non-absorbed drugs to prevent superficial oral fungal infections. However, it is not possible to assess the importance in terms of effectiveness, of how long drugs are retained in the mouth, or the local or systemic concentrations.</P>
<P>No trial reported outcomes related to general well being such as relief of pain, relief of dysphagia, amount of analgesia, days stay in hospital and patient quality of life. It is therefore difficult to comment on the importance of these patient based outcomes although, they are frequently cited as justification for the conduct of trials. Neither is it possible to comment on the cost of oral care as no trial reported either specific or comparative data. It is not possible to assess the association between oral candidiasis and systemic infection from the data presented. However, from trials reporting systemic outcomes, the prophylactic use of absorbed drugs reduced the proportion of patients receiving empirical antifungal treatment compared with control patients (two trials).</P>
<P>For patients being treated for cancer the clinical dilemma is whether to prevent, treat or leave oral candidiasis. The findings from our reviews demonstrate that oral candidiasis can be effectively prevented, however the evidence for effective treatment is weaker and unreliable (<LINK REF="REF-Worthington-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worthington 2007</LINK>). Compared with this review, which includes evidence from over 4000 patients, the treatment review included trials on around 400 patients and only two agents were found to be effective (ketoconazole and clotrimazole) each in single trials. The decision to use antifungal agents to prevent or treat superficial oral infections requires consideration of the risks and benefits. In this review toxicity due to adverse events 'probably due to treatment' was documented in 13 trials of the 28 included trials and ranged from 0% to 18%, however little information was given concerning the nature and severity of the toxicity. More careful documentation of this in future trials included in both reviews would help to evaluate the possible risks of these interventions.</P>
<P>The incidence of oral candidiasis is variable and depends primarily on the nature of the underlying disease and the intensity of treatment. The incidence in control groups included in this review ranges from 5% to 100%, with a median value of 50%. The generalizability of the results is difficult to comment on as the trials were mainly adults with blood cancer, with few studies including children, although the metaregression did indicate possible differences in effect with different cancer types. Since there is no evidence of an effect on general well being to support the decision to prevent oral candidiasis, and there is weak evidence that effective prophylaxis is associated with a reduction in systemic disease, other factors require consideration. If the incidence of oral candidiasis for a patient subgroup is likely to be high, and it is considered important to prevent the disease, then a drug absorbed or partially absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract should be prescribed at the start of cancer treatment. Factors for which we have little information and further evidence is required are: the implications of drug toxicity, development of microbial drug resistance and the cost of treatment.</P>
<P>Whilst most of the trials report similar criteria for the diagnosis of oral candidiasis the validity of these descriptions requires consideration and a consensus on how to diagnose and report events in future trials would improve the synthesis of evidence. Epidemiological data and more consistent microbiological reporting would assist our understanding of the importance of this disease. There is some evidence that there may be publication bias, with an under reporting of small trials showing no treatment effect. It is difficult to assess the impact of this on the results of this review, however, the fact that we found such bias indicates the importance for researchers to publish the results of all trials.</P>
<P>The findings of this review should be considered in the context of the general medical management of patients with cancer.</P>

<P>For patients being treated for cancer the clinical dilemma is whether to prevent, treat or leave oral candidiasis. For treating or preventing oral candidiasis, drugs absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract should be prescribed. Overall there is no evidence that drugs not absorbed are effective, however there is weak evidence that amphotericin B may possibly be of benefit.</P>
