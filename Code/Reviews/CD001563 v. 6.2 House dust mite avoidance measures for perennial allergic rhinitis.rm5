<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-04-20 12:21:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Perennial allergic rhinitis (all-year hay fever like symptoms) is an allergic disorder which can be triggered by house dust mites and causes a congested, runny nose, nasal itching and sneezing. Avoiding the allergic triggers (such as house dust mites) should in theory help to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhinitis in sensitised individuals.</P>
<P>There is limited evidence that measures to reduce the numbers of house dust mites might improve symptoms of allergic rhinitis, but more research is needed to clarify the effectiveness of acaricides (chemicals which kill mites) both as a single intervention and as part of a more multi-faceted approach incorporating high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, allergy control bedding or both.</P>
<P>Overall, this review of trials found that acaricides and extensive bedroom-based environmental control programmes might reduce symptoms of allergic rhinitis for some people, but the evidence is not strong. More research is needed.</P>

<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 4, 2001 and previously updated in 2003 and 2007.</P>
<P>It is estimated that in developed countries approximately 30% of the general population suffer from one or more allergic disorders, of which allergic rhinitis is particularly common. Perennial rhinitis is most often due to allergy to the house dust mite. In such patients house dust mite avoidance is logical, but there is considerable uncertainty regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce dust mite exposure.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-04-20 12:18:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, graded methodological quality using the Cochrane approach and extracted data. Meta-analysis was neither possible nor appropriate due to heterogeneity of the patient groups studied.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-06-15 14:30:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nine trials involving 501 participants satisfied the inclusion criteria. Only two studies investigating the effectiveness of mite impermeable bedding covers were of good quality; the remaining seven studies were small and of poor quality. Two trials investigated the efficacy of acaricides, another two trials investigated the role of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. One trial, using a factorial design, investigated the efficacy of both acaricide and house dust mite impermeable bedding covers in isolation and combination; the remaining four trials investigated the efficacy of bedroom environmental control programmes involving use of house dust mite impermeable bedding covers. Seven of the nine trials reported that, when compared with control, the interventions studied resulted in significant reductions in house dust mite load. Of the interventions studied to date, acaricides appear to be the most promising type of intervention, although the findings from these studies need to be interpreted with care because of their methodological limitations. House dust mite impermeable bedding as an isolated intervention is unlikely to offer clinical benefit. No serious adverse effects were reported from any of the interventions.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-04-02 08:40:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trials to date have on the whole been small and of poor methodological quality, making it difficult to offer any definitive recommendations on the role, if any, of house dust mite avoidance measures in the management of house dust mite sensitive perennial allergic rhinitis. The results of these studies suggest that use of acaricides and extensive bedroom-based environmental control programmes may be of some benefit in reducing rhinitis symptoms and, if considered appropriate, these should be the interventions of choice. Isolated use of house dust mite impermeable bedding is unlikely to prove effective.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-04-20 12:24:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 4, 2001 and previously updated in 2003 and 2007.</P>
<P>It is estimated that up to 30% of the general population of developed countries suffer from one or more allergic diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Anandan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anandan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sibbald-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibbald 1993</LINK>), however large cross-sectional studies of adolescents throughout the world have revealed marked geographical variations in the prevalence of rhinitis (<LINK REF="REF-ISAAC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISAAC 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ISAAC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISAAC 2006</LINK>). The most commonly encountered allergic conditions include allergic rhinitis, asthma and eczema. Almost 3% of all general practitioner consultations in the United Kingdom are for allergic rhinitis (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCormick-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2008</LINK>). As with other allergic diseases, there is concern that the prevalence of allergic rhinitis has increased in recent decades (<LINK REF="REF-Flemming-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flemming 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2008</LINK>) for reasons which are poorly understood.</P>
<P>The main clinical symptoms of rhinitis are nasal irritation, sneezing, watery nasal discharge (rhinorrhoea) and the sensation of a blocked nose (<LINK REF="REF-Lund-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lund 1994</LINK>). Rhinitis is responsible for considerable morbidity and significant costs to health services (<LINK REF="REF-Scadding-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scadding 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Traditionally allergic rhinitis has been managed by advising regular use of topical nasal steroids, or the use of systemic antihistamines. Other agents used include topical anticholinergic agents and topical mast cell stabilisers. In more severe cases systemic steroids or immunotherapy may be used. In some cases, surgical treatment is recommended as a complement to medical therapy. Although allergen avoidance has always occupied a central role in the specialist management of allergic rhinitis, this advice has subsequently also been extended to the general management of allergic rhinitis (<LINK REF="REF-Lund-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lund 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mackay-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackay 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MeReC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">MeReC 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woodcock-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodcock 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Allergic rhinitis can be classified as being seasonal (e.g. hay fever), in which case the major allergen trigger is pollen, or perennial (lasting throughout the year). In some countries, for example the United Kingdom, the commonest allergic trigger for perennial allergic rhinitis is the house dust mite. There are a number of techniques designed to decrease exposure to house dust mite. These can be classified as physical (heating, ventilation, freezing, washing, barrier methods, air filtration, vacuuming and ionisers) or chemical treatments (acaricides), or a combination of these approaches.</P>
<P>Attempts at house dust mite reduction in the management of house dust mite sensitive individuals with perennial allergic rhinitis are logical. However, these approaches have received only patchy uptake (<LINK REF="REF-Woodcock-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodcock 1998</LINK>) as there are concerns regarding the practicality, feasibility, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such interventions. The present review aims to ascertain the value of house dust mite control measures in the management of perennial allergic rhinitis by searching the literature systematically and analysing all evidence arising from randomised controlled trials to ascertain the usefulness of house dust mite control measures in the management of perennial allergic rhinitis.</P>

<P>In the event of further trial data being made available we intend to express summary results as relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous data. Risk differences (RD) will be used to ascertain numbers needed to treat (NNT) to achieve significant changes in symptom scores or quality of life measures. Separate analyses will be performed for trials showing evidence of mite antigen reduction and for trials not showing reduction. The mite assessment methods that will be considered acceptable are: mite counts, immunochemical assays for mite allergen and guanine determination. Sub-sets of trials will be analysed depending on the technique employed to reduce house dust mite levels (i.e. physical, chemical or combination) and on the presence or absence of blinding.</P>

<BR/>Forty patients with symptoms of perennial rhinitis (nasal stuffiness, postnasal drainage, rhinorrhoea) and/or asthma, all of whom showed 4 mm or more wheal reaction to intradermal skin test of house dust mite (1:10,000 wt/vol) or house dust mite extract (1:1000 wt/vol), were recruited from two centres into a cross-over trial and randomly allocated to one of two possible groups for bedroom use of a high efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA) for eight weeks (filtering at 300 cu ft/min):</P>
<UL>
<LI>Group 1 participants received HEPAs loaded with an active Enviracaire® filter for the first four weeks, followed by placebo filters for four weeks;</LI>
<LI>Group 2 were given the same HEPAs and filters, but the order in which they were fitted to the HEPAs was reversed.</LI>

<LI>Particulate counts &gt;/= 0.3 um in bedroom air (measured by Climet model 208C light-scattering particle counter).</LI>
<LI>Symptoms scaled by a) duration: 1 to 3 (1 = 30 minutes; 3 = &gt; 2 hours) and b) severity: 1 to 3 (1 = mild; 3 = severe) during each 12-hour day and night-time period over the eight-week study period for: sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal congestion, itchy eyes, ears, nose, throat and asthma. These scores were added to patient medication use scores for the same intervals as follows: 1 = antihistamine or decongestant tablets; 2 = theophylline tablet; and 3 = nasal or systemic steroid, and totalled to yield a symptom medication score (SMS). When divided by the number of days studied, the resulting specific SMS was used to compare filter effects upon disease. Only the results of the last two weeks of treatment in each four-week period were compared, however, to lessen the spill-over effects of treatment prior to the four weeks allocated for use of each filter.</LI>

<BR/>Twenty subjects aged 12 to 36 years with a long-standing history of house dust mite perennial rhinitis and sensitivity to Pyroglyphid mites (12 participants also sensitive to stored product mites) were selected from a sample of 60 outpatients. Selection aimed to ensure identification of 10 matched patient pairs (matched by age, house dust mite, IgE and skin testing results, guanine exposure value, severity of complaints, hyperreactivity, type of dwelling and number of inhabitants). Subjects were allocated to 12 months of intensive home cleaning either with or without addition of acaricide (solidified benzyl benzoate).</P>
<P>Outcome measures were the three-month median of summed daily patient symptom scores (for itching of eye and/or nose, sneezing, nose secretion, nose bleeding, eye irritation and nasal blockage) for each two-week period; use of medication score for use of steroid nasal sprays, cromoglycate nasal sprays and antihistamine tablets after the second, third and fourth three-month period of the study; and physicians' assessments of whether each patient's overall condition had improved (which were informed by patient diary entries). In each patient, total IgE, mite-specific IgE, the intracutaneous test for house dust mite and histamine were measured at the end of the 12-month study and the levels of blood and nose eosinophils, and guaninine exposure measured every three months.</P>

Inclusion criteria were physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis, positive skin prick tests and RAST to house dust mite, negative skin prick tests to all other common aero-allergens and lack of knowledge and practice of environmental control measures to decrease house dust mite exposure. Subjects were aged between six and 31 years with a mean age of 15.6 years. None had a carpet or air-conditioner in their bedroom. Subjects were randomly assigned to experimental group or control group; all subjects continued to use existing rhinitis treatment throughout the four-week trial period. Active intervention was confined to the subject's bedroom and consisted of the following measures provided by the researcher: wrapping the mattress with a vinyl cover, hot washing (55 °C) the top bedding cover fortnightly, removing soft furnishings and wet cleaning the bedroom floor every day. The control group, however, received only verbal instructions regarding ways of reducing house dust mite exposure.</P>

<P>Trials to date have on the whole been small and of poor methodological quality, making it difficult to offer any definitive recommendations on the role, if any, of house dust mite avoidance measures in the management of house dust mite sensitive perennial allergic rhinitis. The results of these studies suggest that the use of acaricides and extensive bedroom-based environmental control programmes may be of some benefit in reducing rhinitis symptoms. There is now reasonably strong evidence that isolated use of house dust mite impermeable bedding is unlikely to prove effective.</P>
<P>With the exception of the <LINK REF="STD-Terreehorst-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Terreehorst 2003</LINK> trial, all studies conducted to date have been small and omit presentation of power calculations. Furthermore, these nine studies provide insufficient information to allow retrospective power calculations to be performed. This makes it difficult to be sure that sample sizes studied have been adequate to exclude the possibility of false negative results (Type II errors) confidently. All the trials identified included both children and adults, but it is unclear how representative the population groups studied are of house dust mite allergic perennial rhinitis sufferers in the general population. In particular, none appear to have recruited from a community care setting, which suggests that the groups of patients being studied had greater disease severity then those routinely seen in a primary care setting.</P>
<P>The studies by <LINK REF="STD-Bernstein-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bernstein 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kniest-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kniest 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Moon-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Moon 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Reisman-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Reisman 1990</LINK> all suggest that the interventions employed can result in some reduction in rhinitis symptoms, though it is not possible to estimate the magnitude or clinical significance of this likely reduction reliably because of various limitations in their study design, rendering them at moderate or high risk of bias. Also noteworthy is that in the study by Moon et al (<LINK REF="STD-Moon-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Moon 1999</LINK>), routine provision of advice on measures to reduce exposure to house dust mite failed either to decrease house dust mite load or (more importantly) to reduce clinical symptoms of rhinitis, which raises important questions about the generalisability of this environmental intervention in routine clinical care.</P>
<P>Neither of the two fully reported studies newly included in this update (<LINK REF="STD-Brehler-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brehler 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Incorvaia-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Incorvaia 2008</LINK>) provided convincing evidence of clinical benefit associated with the interventions studied. Only one small study (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2005</LINK>), which is at present only available in abstract format suggested that house dust mite impermeable bed covers may be associated with improvement in rhinitis symptoms.</P>
<P>Of the interventions studied to date, acaricides still appear to be the most promising and further pragmatic randomised controlled trials to determine the effectiveness of this mono-intervention are warranted in patients not receiving concomitant medical therapy, in order to allow the effectiveness of the control measures to be determined reliably. Such trials need to be adequately powered (and may therefore need to be multi-centred), generalisable, use validated outcome measures, and have long enough follow up (more than six months) to allow clinically meaningful results to be obtained. In the context of the management of a chronic disease such as rhinitis, a broad range of outcome measures should be studied including quality of life measures, school/work absences and other medication usage. Detailed health economic analysis should also be built into future trials. Although house dust mite barrier bedding and HEPA filter use are unlikely to be of much benefit when used individually, studies of more multi-faceted interventions incorporating these interventions are still warranted.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-06-15 12:26:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found very limited evidence to suggest that the use of acaricides to reduce house dust mite exposure in patients with house dust mite allergic perennial rhinitis may be beneficial in reducing rhinitis symptoms. Interventions involving isolated use of house dust mite impermeable bedding are unlikely to be effective.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-04-20 13:08:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for high-quality trials designed to determine the effectiveness of acaricides as a mono-intervention and also more multi-faceted interventions incorporating HEPA filters and allergy control bedding. Future trials need to be pragmatic, adequately powered, have uniform inclusion criteria, and should ensure long enough follow up (more than six months) to allow detection of clinically meaningful outcomes. In the context of the management of a chronic disease such as rhinitis, a broad range of outcomes need to be studied including changes in validated generic and disease-specific quality of life measures, school/work absences, other medication usage, satisfaction and data on the cost-effectiveness of treatments.</P>
