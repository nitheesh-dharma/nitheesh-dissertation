<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-01-28 10:57:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Road traffic crashes are a major cause of death and injury, especially in low and middle-income countries. Worldwide, each year over a million people are killed and some ten million people are permanently disabled in road traffic crashes. Furthermore, it is estimated that road traffic injuries will have risen from ninth to third in world disease burden rankings by 2020, and will account for 2.3 million deaths each year globally.</P>
<P>Street lighting has been suggested as a relatively low-cost intervention with the potential to prevent traffic crashes. Street lighting may improve a driver's visual capabilities and ability to detect roadway hazards. However, it is also argued that street lighting could have an adverse effect on road safety; drivers may 'feel' safer because lighting gives them improved visibility which could result in them increasing speed and reducing concentration.</P>
<P>This systematic review was conducted to assess how street lighting affects the occurrence of road traffic crashes and associated injuries. The authors searched for all controlled trials comparing the effects of new street lighting with unlit roads, or improved street lighting with the pre-existing lighting level. They found 17 controlled before-after studies, all of which were conducted in high-income countries. Twelve studies investigated the effects of newly installed street lighting, four the effects of improved lighting and one investigated both new and improved lighting. Five of the studies compared the effects of street lighting with a separate area control, while the remaining 12 used data from a day-time control. The authors were able to pool crash or injury data from 15 of the studies. The risk of bias in these studies was judged to be high.</P>
<P>The results indicate that street lighting can prevent road traffic crashes, injuries and fatalities. This finding might be of particular interest to low and middle-income countries where the policy on street lighting is less developed and the installation of suitable lighting systems is less common than in high-income countries. However, further well designed studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of street lighting in middle and low-income countries.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-13 15:37:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-02-13 15:37:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The global epidemic of road traffic deaths and injuries is only in its infancy and yet, according to the World Health Organization, road traffic injuries (RTIs) are already the leading cause of death by injury, the ninth cause of all deaths and the ninth contributor to the burden of disease worldwide (estimated using disability adjusted life years - DALYs) (<LINK REF="REF-Peden-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peden 2002</LINK>). Over a million people die each year on the world's roads, and the number of injuries could be as high as 50 million (<LINK REF="REF-Peden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peden 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Crude estimates indicate that RTIs cost anywhere between 1% to 2% of a country's Gross National Product (GNP), depending upon that country's degree of motorisation. The Transport Research Laboratory calculates that this sums to a global bill of $578 billion (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2000</LINK>), but despite these figures average spending in 1990 was only US$1 for every DALY caused by road traffic crashes (<LINK REF="REF-Peden-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peden 2003</LINK>). The problem is likely to become more severe as private car ownership continues to rise. By 2020 it is predicted that RTIs will have risen to third in the world disease burden rankings, accounting for 2.3 million deaths annually, over 90% of which will afflict lower and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Peden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peden 2004</LINK>). As far back as 1991 road deaths in China equalled those in the United States despite there being one hundred times fewer cars per thousand population (five versus 770) (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1995</LINK>). The advance of motorisation is likely to further exaggerate this disparity to even more alarming proportions. Few low-income countries have an infrastructure suited for, and capable of coping with, excessive car travel. The roads in such countries are already dangerous; they are only likely to become more so.</P>
<P>Road traffic crashes should not be dismissed as the unfortunate culmination of chance, but are best considered as risk factors dependent upon epidemiological events. Being young, male, poor, or a pedestrian, pedal cyclist or motorist will all increase an individual's risk of involvement in a road traffic crash, as will driving at night (<LINK REF="REF-Zwi-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwi 1993</LINK>). The risk of a driver having a crash in the dark is about one and a half to two-times higher than in daylight (<LINK REF="REF-Elvik-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elvik 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-01-28 10:57:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Public lighting was first introduced in both London and New York in 1882, well before the rise of the motor car. The popularity of street lighting lay in the assistance it gave to the maintenance of social order and the reduction of crime. Scientific interest in injury prevention did not follow for another 70 years or so. During the 1950s and 1960s studies began to be conducted to assess the role that street lighting could play in improving the safety of the ever busier and more dangerous roads of motorised nations. The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) argued in 1960 that lighting reduced crashes on urban traffic routes (original report updated in 1992 (<LINK REF="REF-CIE-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">CIE 1992</LINK>)), and work during the following decade suggested the magnitude of this reduction to be approximately 30%. Since then the provision of street lighting has generally been justified on the basis of cost savings expected from the increased service and safety levels (<LINK REF="REF-Macauley-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macauley 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is perhaps unfortunate that the readiness with which this figure was accepted has dissuaded researchers from conducting as much research in the field as they might have otherwise done. Although research continued throughout the 1970s, the majority of work is now 30 years or more out of date. Much has changed on the world's roads since then: traffic volume has swelled universally, including in countries where automotive travel was previously rare. As such, the estimates derived from early work may not apply to modern roads and driver behaviour. Furthermore, estimations for the effect of street lighting were never even investigated in many low and middle-income countries where there are more vulnerable road users who are less likely to be segregated from traffic. It is these countries that now carry the greatest burden from road traffic crashes.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-01-28 10:57:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Street lighting may improve a driver's visual capabilities and ability to detect roadway hazards, especially among older drivers. Rockwell found that when lighting quality was increased, drivers exhibited earlier detection of intersections, earlier gas pedal release and speed reduction suggesting an improvement in driver visual certainty (<LINK REF="REF-Rockwell-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockwell 1976</LINK>). In addition to these effects, street lighting can reduce the contrast between headlight glare and the environment, preventing loss of visual certainty from contrast adaptation. However, some argue that these improvements could lead to changes in driver behaviour that may have an adverse affect on safety due to the risk compensation effect. This could cause behavioural adaptation to a perceived low-risk situation: if drivers 'feel' safer because lighting gives them improved visibility then they may increase speed and reduce concentration (<LINK REF="REF-Assum-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assum 1999</LINK>). If correct, this implies that overall risk remains constant over time, regardless of the intervention, because drivers adapt their behaviour to the reduced risk situation.</P>
<P>A literature review analysed the results of eleven previous investigations, and found that there was not sufficient evidence to support the claim that lighting reduced road traffic crashes (<LINK REF="REF-Vincent-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 1983</LINK>). Furthermore, almost all of the eleven included studies were found to be inadequate in some respect, including inappropriate site selection and outcome evaluation. Vincent concluded that despite a widespread faith in street lighting, there was scant evidence in support. He recommended that further justification be sought on the basis of better driver reaction to hazards under lit conditions. The literature was re-examined by Elvik, who concluded that street lighting may reduce night-time fatalities by as much as 65% and night-time injuries by 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Elvik-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elvik 1995</LINK>). Both studies stated that the effect of public lighting varies with crash type and severity, and that numerous other variables may further complicate this effect.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2009-01-28 10:57:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard of experimental design but there may be logistical difficulties in carrying out RCTs of street lighting interventions. A process of randomisation requires many different units to randomise, and whereas in a trial with people as units it is feasible to recruit enough to carry out the randomisation, in a trial with groups of streets as units it is much more likely that investigators will have 'recruited' very few (most likely two) units to compare.</P>
<P>It was vital that the study design incorporated a control and comparison area, and so randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials and controlled before-after studies (CBAs) were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review.</P>

<P>The assessment of the risk of bias in non-randomised trials is problematic, and no universally accepted instrument exists for formally scoring the risk of bias in controlled before-after studies. In order to assess the risk of bias in included studies we collected the following information.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Matching of control to intervention areas - studies with an area control may be matched by characteristics such as location of the roads (e.g. residential or rural), volume of traffic and speed limit. Alternatively, many of the studies used day-time crash statistics for the intervention area as control data. This is because in theory street lighting does not affect traffic behaviour during the day-time, so the intervention area in day-time may be considered a perfectly matched control area as all else is equal. Furthermore, because the same authority collects data on both the intervention and the control scenarios, there is unlikely to be any systematic bias. However, the assumption that street lighting does not affect day-time behaviour could be incorrect; for this reason studies with day-time and area controls have been treated separately.</LI>
<LI>Data collection time - the length of time over which data are collected in a controlled before-after study is important as the longer the time period, the more likely it is that short-term changes will be less significant. For an intervention like street lighting, it is better for data to have been collected over at least a year to account for seasonal adjustments in daylight at different latitudes.</LI>
<LI>Source of outcome data - this is important for an indication of the accuracy and extent of the blinding of outcome assessment.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Incorporating a description of the study's performance against each of the above domains and our overall judgment, we completed a 'Risk of bias' table for each study as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>'yes' indicates low risk of bias;</LI>
<LI>'unclear' indicates unclear or unknown risk of bias; and</LI>
<LI>'no' indicates high risk of bias.</LI>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2009-01-28 10:57:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We conducted analyses to assess the effect of street lighting on the incidence of injuries and crashes. The results of each study are expressed as rate ratios. The rate ratio is the ratio of event rates post and pre-intervention in the intervention area divided by the corresponding post to pre-intervention event ratio in the control area. Provided that any changes in the population at risk are the same in both control and intervention areas, the rate ratio gives the reduction in the event rate in the intervention area compared to that in the control area. For example, a rate ratio of 0.8 corresponds to a 20% reduction in events compared to that predicted from the rates in the control area.</P>
<P>We calculated standard errors for logarithms of rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals for rate ratios assuming that the number of events in each area in each period followed a Poisson Distribution.</P>

The assumption of random-effects both allows for the anticipated heterogeneity between effects across studies and provides rigour if the assumption that events follow the Poisson Distribution is violated, for instance by over dispersion. Where there were no events observed in the intervention or control areas, we added 0.5 to each of the cells (intervention before, intervention after, control before, control after) to avoid computational problems caused by dividing by 0.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-10-27 15:28:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Katharine Ker">
<P>This systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled before-after studies suggests that street lighting may prevent road traffic crashes, injuries and fatalities. </P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-01-28 10:57:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The included trials were conducted in the USA, UK, Germany and Australia, hence it may not be appropriate to generalise the findings to other settings. Particular caution is required when making inferences regarding the effectiveness of street lighting in lower-income countries where roads tend to have different characteristics and usage compared to those in high-income countries.</P>
<P>Most studies located for inclusion in this systematic review were published before 1990, with the earliest dating back to 1948. Traffic behaviour on roads across the world has changed dramatically over the past 20 years as private car ownership has become increasingly common. Conclusions based on studies carried out decades ago may no longer be applicable to modern traffic conditions. It seems unlikely that the direction of effect would have changed but the magnitude of the effect should be treated with caution.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-01-08 15:15:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Katharine Ker">
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies was generally poor. Whilst the appropriateness of collection periods and blinding of outcome assessment were reasonable, the quality of methods to select the control area were mixed, and there was potential for contamination of the control area in some studies. For example, only one study with an area control specified an intention to match the control roads by speed limit, road type and police district (<LINK REF="STD-Sabey-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Sabey 1973</LINK>), while another two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lamm-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Lamm 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richards-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 1981</LINK>) used control areas adjacent to the intervention areas (the intervention and control area in <LINK REF="STD-Richards-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 1981</LINK> were the opposite directions of the same road), hence contamination of the control areas may have occurred.</P>
<P>The data collection periods, both before and after, need to be of sufficient lengths to account for short-term fluctuations in traffic behaviour and to provide a reliable estimate of crash frequency. None of the included studies had a data collection period of less than 12 months for either the before periods (range one to three years) or the after periods (range one to eight years), which may be adequate to avoid the problem of confounding due to changes in the background rate of injury. </P>
<P>Regression to the mean, a statistical phenomenon which can occur when looking at a non-random selection of sites, should also be considered. It describes the tendency for an abnormally high (or low) number of events (such as injuries) to return to values closer to the long term mean. Any observed abnormally high (or low) number of events is thus a result of random fluctuation. It is a particular threat to controlled-before-and-after studies and has important implications when the study interest is a change in outcome. In such cases an apparent intervention effect may actually be a result of the number of events returning to the average rate after a random fluctuation. Consequently, these studies should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>As with all systematic reviews, the validity of the results is dependent on the validity of the individual included studies. No randomised controlled trials were identified for inclusion, hence the review is based on the findings of 17 controlled before-after studies (CBAs). Such non-randomised studies are susceptible to confounding and bias, and assessment of the risk of bias in such study designs is problematic.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-01-08 15:04:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Katharine Ker">
<P>Publication, dissemination and selection bias are potential threats to all systematic reviews, however they are particular threats to reviews of road safety research, as relevant data tend to be published in the grey literature of road safety organisations. Studies with "positive" or "interesting" results may be more likely to be published and accessible; indeed there may be no intention to publish until such results are discovered. In contrast to medical databases, which can be searched with high sensitivity and positive predictive value, road safety databases typically have a very limited range of index terminology, especially describing study methodology. As a result, for transport databases it is necessary to first apply a more inclusive strategy, involving comprehensive terminology, and then to assess more relevant results. Despite our efforts to identify all eligible studies, published and unpublished and irrespective of language of publication, we cannot exclude the possibility of selection bias.</P>
<P>We calculated rate ratios as the measure of intervention effect. An assumption of using the rate ratio as an effect estimate is that any changes in the population at risk are the same for both control and intervention areas. We cannot be certain that such an assumption was realistic for all of the included studies, thus caution is required in the interpretation of the rate ratios.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-01-08 15:04:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Katharine Ker">
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Vincent-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 1983</LINK> investigated the literature and considered 29 studies, of which the vast majority were labelled in the paper as methodologically flawed due to the selection of sites, the design of the study, or the statistical analysis. Vincent concluded that the literature did not support most of the study authors' conclusions that street lighting can reduce injuries. Twelve years later, Elvik reassessed the literature and carried out a meta-analysis of 37 studies of newly lit compared to previously unlit roads (<LINK REF="REF-Elvik-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elvik 1995</LINK>). He found a reduction in fatal injury crashes of 65% and a reduction of injury only crashes of 30%. He found the results robust with respect to different road types (freeway, urban, rural) and study design. This work was updated to include improvements in lighting compared to existing lighting (<LINK REF="REF-Elvik-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elvik 2004</LINK>). Increasing the level of lighting by up to double the previous level has a limited effect on the number of crashes, but it is not so pronounced as for newly installed lighting compared to a previously unlit road.</P>
<P>We have carried out a similar meta-analysis but have restricted the study designs to controlled before-after studies. A meta-analysis of 15 of these studies gives very similar results to Elvik in terms of total crashes, fatal crashes and improved lighting compared to a previously unlit road.</P>

<P>The results of this review suggest that street lighting may prevent road traffic crashes, injuries and fatalities. The results are unlikely to have a significant impact on the road planning policy of high-income countries. It is already widely accepted that street lighting has a safety function and has become an integral part of road design. However, in the UK, an increasing number of local councils are turning off public street lighting in certain areas in a move to reduce costs and carbon emissions (<LINK REF="REF-BBC-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">BBC 2008</LINK>). The potential adverse road safety impact of such a policy should be carefully considered in light of the findings of this review.</P>
<P>In low and middle-income countries, however the policy on street lighting is less developed and the installation of suitable lighting systems is less common. Therefore the positive findings of this review may further encourage attention to the improvement of street lighting in lower income countries as a road safety measure.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-01-28 10:57:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>No randomised controlled trials were identified in this review. Additional well designed controlled trials are needed to estimate effects accurately, with a focus on effectiveness in middle and lower-income countries. In particular, further research investigating the impact of street lighting on vulnerable road users is required.</P>

<P>I feel some response is necessary concerning this review as there are considerable problems in accepting the review as it stands.

<P>The data do not arise from randomised controlled trials and one has to wonder how comparable the comparators are to the treatment areas. It is not possible to judge from the data given.

<P>Another major effect is that of dissemination bias (A more general form of publication bias).This is a problem leading to an incomplete and unrepresentative sample of trial results being available for meta-analysis. This is even a problem for conventional trials in health care, where there is usually an intention to produce a written output at the inception of a trial. Matters become more problematic with results from 'trials' in policy, especially when the intervention is regarded as routine. Policy implementations are regrettably not as yet routinely set out as scientific experiments.  In policy 'trials' it may be that there is no intention to report prior to the implementation and the decision to publish is made later.

<P>The results of this review are different from the conclusions of the UK Highways Agency, which manages the UK's strategic road network, based on its research on its roads to assess the value of lighting.

<P>There are statistical issues which need to be recognised in work of this nature.

The later may be due to intrinsic factors influencing variation at different sites; this will impact on the weights which should be given to each study in the meta analysis.</P>
<P>Recommendations</P>
<UL>
<LI>A trial register for policy studies is needed to combat dissemination bias.</LI>
<LI>Proper (tamper proof) randomisation needs to be applied in deciding which units are active and which are control, again to counter bias.</LI>
<LI>Collecting data from multiple time periods before and after will help separate heterogeneity of effect between studies and variation within areas.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Without such improvements it seems that reviews of studies are likely to be seriously misleading and could lead to expensive false 'solutions' being implemented. False solutions will not help alleviate serious problems.</P>
<P>I state for the purposes of transparency that my interest in this matter is sparked by concerns about the environmental impacts of exterior artificial lighting, see Marchant 2007.</P>
<P>I thank Fiona Beyer for clarifying some issues for me via personal communication.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2010-01-12 14:33:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The review authors have responded to each of Paul Marchant's comments in turn.</P>
<P>
<I>I feel some response is necessary concerning this review as there are considerable problems in accepting the review as it stands. There is a danger that this review might be read as &#8220;street lighting will have a substantial beneficial effect in reducing injuries&#8221;, in spite of some cautionary words within the review.</I>
</P>
<P>We agree that some clarification would benefit the review. We are grateful to Dr Marchant for his comments and have made alterations as described below. However, we disagree that the review is fundamentally flawed, for the following reasons:</P>
<P>This is a high-quality systematic review conducted using gold-standard methodology. We defined a priori the levels of evidence that would be included in the review (randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled before-after studies (CBAs)), and searched exhaustively for appropriate studies to include. Our conclusion ("street lighting may prevent road traffic crashes, injuries and fatalities") follows from the statistically significant results reported in the analysis.</P>
<P>We believe that there is a danger of inappropriately conflating weaknesses in the methodology of the included studies (which have been discussed in the review) with weaknesses in the review methods.</P>
<P>In the absence of good quality studies, there is a risk of implementing ineffective interventions. Our review has highlighted this absence of good-quality evidence and we hope that its publication might help rectify this problem.</P>
<P>
<I>The data do not arise from randomised controlled trials and one has to wonder how comparable the comparators are to the treatment areas. It is not possible to judge from the data given. One notices that the counts in the areas being compared are sometimes very different.</I>
</P>
<P>Given that our exhaustive search revealed no RCTs of street lighting with injury/fatality outcomes, we used a &#8220;next best&#8221; study design and included only CBAs. These are acknowledged to be methodologically less robust than randomised controlled trials, but are the most robust available to make any assessment of the impact of street lighting on injuries and fatalities. We assessed the risk of bias of the studies as best we could by collecting information about whether the control and intervention areas were matched, the length of time over which data was collected, and the source of the outcome data (whether it was collected independently of the study). The counts in the areas compared are likely to be different if a daytime control is being used, but the absolute difference between intervention and control arms is less important than the ratio within each arm of the before count compared to the after count.</P>
<P>
<I>There is also likely to be specific bias in that the areas are given lighting because of concerns about a stretch of road having a poor accident record. This lack of equivalence between areas is likely to generate a spurious seemingly beneficial effect, purely by chance, due to Regression towards the Mean (Marchant 2008, Baxter and Marchant 2009).</I>
</P>
<P>We agree that this is an issue. We omitted to include an explanation of regression towards the mean (despite having discussed it before publication) &#8211; this has been added to the discussion section.</P>
<P>
<I>Another major effect is that of dissemination bias (A more general form of publication bias).This is a problem leading to an incomplete and unrepresentative sample of trial results being available for meta-analysis. This is even a problem for conventional trials in health care, where there is usually an intention to produce a written output at the inception of a trial. Matters become more problematic with results from trials in policy, especially when the intervention is regarded as routine. Policy implementations are regrettably not as yet routinely set out as scientific experiments. In policy trials it may be that there is no intention to report prior to the implementation and the decision to publish is made later. This decision is likely to be heavily influenced by the result; one can imagine a number of pressures generating publication in the case of good news. A trial register for policy trials would help reduce dissemination bias. </I>
</P>
<P>We agree that dissemination bias is a potential issue in this area, and have added a sentence in the discussion section to this effect. We already discussed publication bias in the discussion section of the review, and we made every effort to overcome this by the extensive nature of our search for evidence.</P>
<P>
<I>The results of this review are different from the conclusions of the UK Highways Agency, which manages the UK&#8217;s strategic road network, based on its research on its roads to assess the value of lighting. The Agency gave revised guidance in March 2007 (Chief Highway Engineer Memorandums189/07 and 190/07) downplaying the importance of lighting as a cost effective safety measure. This was after years of implementing lighting based on accepting a 30% accident reduction benefit for lighting.</I>
</P>
<P>Whereas the conclusions of our review are based on all existing RCTs and CBAs, the conclusions of the UK Highways Agency (HA) are based on two observational studies. The HA acknowledged in this work that a controlled before/after study would be the optimum in terms of methodology, but resource and time constraints precluded this. We were unable to include these two studies in our review because they do not satisfy the methodological inclusion criteria (i.e. they are not RCTs or CBAs). The first study compares the proportions of personal injury accidents on lit sections of the entire HA network (stratified by road type) compared to unlit sections, and concludes that for the period 1994-2004 10% fewer accidents occurred on lit sections of motorway in the dark compared to unlit sections. The second is a matched case control study, where 30 lit/unlit pairs of similar motorway sections were identified and the number of non-junction accidents occurring in the period 1994-2004 was noted. No statistically significant difference in personal injury between lit and unlit sections in the dark was detected in any of the matched pairs. We have added the HA studies to our list of excluded studies to add transparency about why they were excluded.</P>
<P>
<I>There are statistical issues which need to be recognised in work of this nature. While it is true that running a random effects meta-analysis, as the authors do, will get a result in that it will fix a large heterogeneity statistic, it cannot distinguish between heterogeneity of treatment effect in different circumstances and the over dispersion in the Poisson counts. The later may be due to intrinsic factors influencing variation at different sites; this will impact on the weights which should be given to each study in the meta-analysis.</I>
</P>
<P>We agree that a simple random effects meta-analysis cannot determine sources of the heterogeneity. However our primary aim in this analysis is to estimate relative risks with confidence intervals that allow for this heterogeneity, whatever its cause. We disagree that there is one correct weighting to use in a meta-analysis of this type. We would argue that the weighting used in a random effects analysis is a reasonable choice and that the confidence intervals we obtain do appropriately allow for heterogeneity in relative risks. We also point that there was little evidence of substantial heterogeneity in our analyses and hence that our results are likely to be robust to choice of analytical method. </P>

<P>Introduction</P>
<P>There is a need to respond further to the updated review &#8216;Street Lighting for preventing road traffic injuries&#8217; by Fiona R Beyer &amp; Katherine Ker published 17 Feb. 2010.</P>
<P>The authors acknowledge some of the concerns express in my earlier comments but they do not go far enough.</P>
<P>Note the website &#8216;Understanding Uncertainty&#8217; understandinguncertainty.org/node/231 associated with David Spiegelhalter (FRS, Prof. of Public Understanding of Risk) and his team give, independently, criticisms very similar to mine.</P>
<P>The problems with the review are severe because of the nature of the studies used. We have no idea how well these studies, i.e. those that have generated a written report and therefore get included in the review, represent the situation in its totality. Also we do not know how much worse studies of the type used are, compared with good RCTs, i.e. ones having protocols and other protection against bias.</P>
<P>Indeed the authors rightly state &#8216;The risk of bias in these studies was judged to be high&#8217;. They then go on to state, wrongly, that the results (from positive meta-analysis findings) suggest that lighting may be beneficial. Indeed the plain language summary states &#8216;the results indicate that street lighting can prevent road traffic crashes, injuries and fatalities'. (Remember we are discussing the average effect). Lighting might be beneficial, on average, but also it might not and indeed it could make things substantially worse because the quality of these studies means we have no real information. The high risk of bias within the studies means that the naive interpretation of results is suspect. Indeed the high risk of bias implies that the correction conclusion may, in fact, be different from the one the authors have given. Indeed a result indicating a poor safety benefit would be of considerable interest.</P>
<P>The authors go on to say that well designed studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of street lighting in middle and low income countries. I say well designed (and executed) studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of street lighting in all types of country. The studies used in the review are from high income countries but as is clear the existing studies are unreliable and potentially biased.</P>
<P>I also would argue that well designed (and executed) epidemiological studies need to be undertaken using unbiased selection, when lighting is changed. Change of lighting is happening in many local authority areas in the UK at the present time at the cost of billions of pounds. Using the recorded accident data (STATS19) for a sufficient period before and after the change can indicate whether there has been a substantial overall benefit. I would argue that this must be done at the earliest opportunity to ensure that the public is getting value.</P>
<P>The authors also refer to &#8216;improved lighting&#8217;. Improved is an unscientific term, that is used in marketing. It is imprecise. The authors probably mean brighter when it replaces existing lighting (and of course any lighting when compared with none). Improved, in other circumstances, could mean having well-shielded lighting, which would reduce glare. (This is an issue for the American Medical Association&#8217;s resolution 516 against light pollution). Indeed having more lighting might not be an improvement in overall terms, when environmental impacts are considered. See the report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution &#8216;Artificial Light in the Environment&#8217; Nov. 2009. www.rcep.org.uk/reports/sr?2009?light/documents/RCEP_artificiallight.pdf</P>
<P>In the &#8216;discussion&#8217; section on regression towards the mean one should note that the effect is likely to be particularly strong if the reason the lights were installed was because the road had an unexpectedly high accident rate. In the &#8216;implications for practice&#8217; section the review cautions against reducing lighting; &#8216;in the UK an increasing number of local councils are turning off public street lighting in certain areas&#8217;. One should note that there might be an increase in the number of road traffic accidents recorded, when lights are turned off, even if lighting has no benefit in safety terms, simply due to regression towards the mean. The reason for this is that because, as the authors state, it is &#8216;widely accepted that street lighting has a safety function&#8217; means that through the nervousness of local councils, switch offs only occur in places that are deemed to be particularly safe. My understanding is that the switch-offs have not had bad safety impacts, such as in the Essex County Council trial. Such trials are continuing and being initiated in other areas.</P>
<P>The big problem with the studies in the review is that insufficient is known about them. We don&#8217;t know in general if there was an intention to produce a report before collecting data. Are the protocols of all the studies available? It would be interesting to know the sources of any funding for the studies as there is the phenomenon that results tend to be produced which the paymaster would welcome. Corporate influence can be problematic, see for example &#8216;Science and the Corporate Agenda&#8217; www.sgr.org.uk/SciencePolicy/SGR_corp_science_full.pdf</P>

The correct attribution is Baxter PD and Marchant PR (2010) &#8216;The cross product ratio in the bivariate log normal distribution and gamma distribution, with an application to non-randomised trials&#8217;, Journal of Applied Statistics pp1-8.</P>
<P>The conclusion of the systematic review must surely be that better evidence is needed before any substantive effect of lighting can be determined. The danger of allowing the current conclusion to stand is that new, adequate studies will not be done to provide the evidence so desperately needed.</P>
<P>Below I give annotated comments to the authors&#8217; previous reply.</P>
<P>
<I>Reply --</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>The review authors have responded to each of Paul Marchant&#8217;s comments in turn.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>I feel some response is necessary concerning this review as there are considerable problems in accepting the review as it stands. There is a danger that this review might be read as &#8216;street lighting will have a substantial beneficial effect in reducing injuries&#8217;, in spite of some cautionary words within the review. We agree that some clarification would benefit the review. We are grateful to Dr Marchant for his comments and have made alterations as described below. However, we disagree that the review is fundamentally flawed, for the following reasons:</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>This is a high-quality systematic review conducted using gold-standard methodology. We defined a priori the levels of evidence that would be included in the review (randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled before-after studies (CBAs)), and searched exhaustively for appropriate studies to include. Our conclusion (&#8216;street lighting may prevent road traffic crashes, injuries and fatalities&#8217;) follows from the statistically significant results reported in the analysis.</I>
</P>
<P>PM: Statistical significance means nothing if the data is unreliable.</P>
<P>
<I>We believe that there is a danger of inappropriately conflating weaknesses in the methodology of the included studies (which have been discussed in the review) with weaknesses in the review methods.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>The reason that one has criteria for study inclusion is because this affects the outcome. The reason one does a systematic review is to find the underlying scientific truth of the real situation. When the review is based on studies which are potentially biased by a large unknown amount the outcome will be potentially biased by a large unknown amount and this needs to be stated strongly up front and in the conclusion. This means we cannot tell anything useful substantively except we need to get some evidence that can be trusted.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>In the absence of good quality studies, there is a risk of implementing ineffective interventions. Our review has highlighted this absence of good-quality evidence and we hope that its publication might help rectify this problem.</I>
</P>
<P>PM: This is naive. My view is the headline conclusion is likely to be taken at face value, as regrettably most people and particularly salespersons are woefully ignorant of the subtleties of scientific methods and statistics. This danger is not reduced by a somewhat simplistic podcast &amp; summary. Although the summary correctly states &#8216;The risk of bias in these studies was judged to be high&#8217;, it ought to go further to state explicitly that the result of the meta-analysis therefore also suffers from the risk of high bias.</P>
<P>The data do not arise from randomised controlled trials and one has to wonder how comparable the comparators are to the treatment areas. It is not possible to judge from the data given. One notices that the counts in the areas being compared are sometimes very different.</P>
<P>
<I>Given that our exhaustive search revealed no RCTs of street lighting with injury/fatality outcomes, we used a &#8216;next best&#8217; study design and included only CBAs. These are acknowledged to be methodologically less robust than randomised controlled trials, but are the most robust available to make any assessment of the impact of street lighting on injuries and fatalities. We assessed the risk of bias of the studies as best we could by collecting information about whether the control and intervention areas were matched, the length of time over which data was collected, and the source of the outcome data (whether it was collected independently of the study). The counts in the areas compared are likely to be different if a daytime control is being used, but the absolute difference between intervention and control arms is less important than the ratio within each arm of the before count compared to the after count.</I>
</P>
<P>PM: The issue is quantitatively how much worse are CBA studies than RCTs. This is the issue rather than asserting that CBAs are better than just Before-After studies without any comparator / &#8216;control&#8217;. Clearly the estimate of effect from a CBA will be less well-determined than that of an RCT of equivalent size-but how different is it likely to be? Assuming there to be exactly zero difference, as the authors effectively do, is &#8216;optimistic&#8217;.</P>
<P>There is also likely to be specific bias in that the areas are given lighting because of concerns about a stretch of road having a poor accident record. This lack of equivalence between areas is likely to generate a spurious seemingly beneficial effect, purely by chance, due to Regression towards the Mean (Marchant 2008, Baxter and Marchant 2009&#8217; This should be 2010, Journal of Applied Statistics pp1-8).</P>
<P>
<I>We agree that this is an issue. We omitted to include an explanation of regression towards the mean (despite having discussed it before publication) - this has been added to the discussion section.</I>
</P>
<P>PM: This addition is welcome.</P>
<P>Another major effect is that of dissemination bias (A more general form of publication bias). This is a problem leading to an incomplete and unrepresentative sample of trial results being available for meta-analysis. This is even a problem for conventional trials in health care, where there is usually an intention to produce a written output at the inception of a trial. Matters become more problematic with results from trials in policy, especially when the intervention is regarded as routine. Policy implementations are regrettably not as yet routinely set out as scientific experiments. In policy trials it may be that there is no intention to report prior to the implementation and the decision to publish is made later. This decision is likely to be heavily influenced by the result; one can imagine a number of pressures generating publication in the case of good news. A trial register for policy trials would help reduce dissemination bias.</P>
<P>
<I>We agree that dissemination bias is a potential issue in this area, and have added a sentence in the discussion section to this effect. We already discussed publication bias in the discussion section of the review, and we made every effort to overcome this by the extensive nature of our search for evidence.</I>
</P>
<P>PM: But if the negative studies are just not written up, extensive searching can not find them. &#8216;Note there is a strong possibility that such studies are missing because of their &#8216;uninteresting&#8217; or &#8216;unwelcome&#8217; findings&#8217;; see 16.1.1 V5 Cochrane Handbook. Such absence may be associated with the sponsor.</P>
<P>Former comment from PM: The results of this review are different from the conclusions of the UK Highways Agency, which manages the UK&#8217;s strategic road network, based on its research on its roads to assess the value of lighting. The Agency gave revised guidance in March 2007 (Chief Highway Engineer Memorandums189/07 and 190/07) downplaying the importance of lighting as a cost effective safety measure. This was after years of implementing lighting based on accepting a 30% accident reduction benefit for lighting.</P>
<P>
<I>Former comment from authors: Whereas the conclusions of our review are based on all existing RCTs and CBAs, the conclusions of the UK Highways Agency (HA) are based on two observational studies. The HA acknowledged in this work that a controlled before/after study would be the optimum in terms of methodology, but resource and time constraints precluded this. We were unable to include these two studies in our review because they do not satisfy the methodological inclusion criteria (i.e. they are not RCTs or CBAs). The first study compares the proportions of personal injury accidents on lit sections of the entire HA network (stratified by road type) compared to unlit sections, and concludes that for the period 1994?2004 10% fewer accidents occurred on lit sections of motorway in the dark compared to unlit sections. The second is a matched case control study, where 30 lit/unlit pairs of similar motorway sections were identified and the number of non?junction accidents occurring in the period 1994?2004 was noted. No statistically significant difference in personal injury between lit and unlit sections in the dark was detected in any of the matched pairs. We have added the HA studies to our list of excluded studies to add transparency about why they were excluded.</I>
</P>
<P>PM: It is of course right that the inclusion criteria are respected. However, it is worth taking note of the fact that the Highways Agency has little motive to produce biased work. It presumably wants to maximise safety at minimum cost using any means available. In order to obtain the correct understanding it is important not to rely solely on trials but to consider other relevant evidence such as the results of data collected when schemes have been implemented, as pointed out above in connection with the possibilities arising from the large scale changes in UK street lighting.</P>
<P>Former comment from PM: There are statistical issues which need to be recognised in work of this nature. While it is true that running a random effects meta-analysis, as the authors do, will get a result in that it will fix a large heterogeneity statistic, it cannot distinguish between heterogeneity of treatment effect in different circumstances and the over dispersion in the Poisson counts. The latter may be due to intrinsic factors influencing variation at different sites; this will impact on the weights which should be given to each study in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<I>Former comment from authors: We agree that a simple random effects meta-analysis cannot determine sources of the heterogeneity. However our primary aim in this analysis is to estimate relative risks with confidence intervals that allow for this heterogeneity, whatever its cause. We disagree that there is one correct weighting to use in a meta-analysis of this type. We would argue that the weighting used in a random effects analysis is a reasonable choice and that the confidence intervals we obtain do appropriately allow for heterogeneity in relative risks. We also point that there was little evidence of substantial heterogeneity in our analyses and hence that our results are likely to be robust to choice of analytical method.</I>
</P>
<P>PM: The point remains that we are uncertain of the weights that each study should be given when entering the meta-analysis and this will lead to uncertainty in the effect size.</P>
<P>PM: Some Quotations:</P>
<P>&#8216;If we manage to find a selection process that is reasonably plausible in the context of the topic being reviewed but which undermines the result that has been claimed then that result must surely be viewed with considerable caution, however impressive the analysis leading to it might appear to be.&#8217; John Copas in the Royal Statistical Society&#8217;s publication Significance Dec. 2005</P>
<P>'...you should report everything that you think might make it invalid - not only what you think is right about it: other causes that could possibly explain your result&#8217; in Cargo Cult Science by Richard Feynman</P>
<P>&#8216;Meta-analyst; one who thinks that if enough manure is piled high enough it will smell of roses.&#8217; In &#8216;Dicing with Death&#8217; by Stephen Senn</P>
<P>Final Conclusion</P>
<P>So I conclude: to meta-analyse when the original studies are seriously problematic is wrong. The systematic review should be left without meta-analysis and simply have a call for sound studies.</P>

<P>We would like to thank Dr Marchant for his continuing interest in our systematic review.<BR/>
<BR/>We have previously answered his comments about publication bias and regression to the mean. We would like to add the following:<BR/>
<BR/>Risk of bias: although the CBAs included in this review would tend to have a higher risk of bias than RCTs, we would reiterate that they are the best type of study available to answer the question about the impact of street lighting on injuries. In two of the three specific areas for which we assessed risk of bias (matching of control/intervention areas and source of outcome data), it was judged to be low. Even in the absence of pooling the data, the forest plots demonstrate a tendency to a protective effect. Our conclusion that street lighting *may* prevent road traffic crashes, injuries and fatalities (with several caveats in the review about potential bias), and our call for better-designed studies, follows from the data.<BR/>
<BR/>Location of further work: the reason we have mentioned lower and middle income countries (LMCs) in our recommendations is that no RCTs or CBAs have been carried out in LMCs. The road environment is often very different in LMCs with vulnerable road users not separated from traffic in the same way as they tend to be in higher income countries (HMCs). Moreover, many LMICs are at comparatively low levels of motorisation and the risk of road crashes in these countries can only be expected to increase with greater motorisation, it therefore makes them a worthy setting for future research into all road safety interventions.<BR/>
<BR/>In the absence of any studies at all in LMCs, we have suggested that &#8220;additional well designed controlled trials are needed to estimate effects accurately, with a focus on effectiveness in middle and lower-income countries&#8221;.<BR/>
<BR/>Improved lighting: we acknowledge that improved lighting may be subject to different definitions. We have reported this term as used in the studies. Since they investigated the impact of lighting on injuries, in this context improved means brighter.<BR/>
<BR/>Authorship: because Cochrane reviews are dynamic documents which are regularly updated, an author who carried out early work for a review is sometimes removed (with their agreement) from the authorship list on later iterations, when they are no longer able to contribute to the review. In this case, Philip Pond was an author early on in the life of the review, but has now moved on to other things. We have removed the references to specific authors in order to avoid confusion.<BR/>
<BR/>The correct attribution for the paper on regression to the mean is as follows:<BR/>Baxter, Paul D. and Marchant, Paul R.(2010) 'The cross-product ratio in bivariate lognormal and gamma distributions, with an application to non-randomized trials', Journal of Applied Statistics, 37: 4, 529 &#8212; 536.<BR/>
