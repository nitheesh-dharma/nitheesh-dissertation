<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-12-07 09:56:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterised by progressive inflammation and scarring of liver bile ducts. Destruction of bile ducts leads to incidence of bile flow to the gut, resulting in the development of biliary cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. PSC is most common in young males and its aetiology is still not fully understood. The disease is usually classified as an autoimmune disorder, but other aetiological factors cannot be excluded. There is a strong association of PSC with inflammatory bowel diseases, particularly ulcerative colitis, which coexists in approximately 70% of patients. Besides its progressive and irreversible nature, PSC is also associated with an increased risk for cholangiocarcinoma, which contributes to an even higher morbidity and mortality of this disease.</P>
<P>The diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis is based on a combined approach that includes clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings. Since the disease is usually asymptomatic in its initial stage, early recognition and diagnosis is actually rather rare. Because of poor understanding of aetiology and pathogenesis, treatment of PSC is still not satisfactory. Numerous medications have been evaluated for therapy of PSC, but most of them showed none or minimal effect, and certain drugs were associated with serious adverse events. Bile acids have also been considered for the treatment of PSC demonstrating a possible beneficial effect. However, further investigation of their role in PSC therapy is needed. Therefore, the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage liver disease due to PSC remains liver transplantation. Despite the relatively low incidence of PSC in the general population, PSC remains among the most common indications for liver transplantation in Europe and the United States.</P>
<P>Based on eight randomised clinical trials of high risk of bias, the administration of ursodeoxycholic acid to patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis did not significantly reduce mortality, hepatic decompensation, need for liver transplantation, liver histological deterioration, or radiological deterioration compared with placebo or no intervention. The use of ursodeoxycholic acid showed a statistically significant improvement of liver biochemistry. However, evidence of these beneficial effects is weak as it is produced from trials with high risk of bias and a rather small number of patients. Furthermore, these observations are at risk of outcome measure reporting bias as half or less than half of the trials reported on these outcomes. One trial assessed the self-estimated quality of life of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis treated with ursodeoxycholic acid. No significant difference was found in any of the studied components, physical as well as mental. Based on an analysis of six of the eight included trials, the use of ursodeoxycholic acid seemed safe and well tolerated, without reports of serious adverse events. We were unable to identify trials evaluating other bile acids for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Accordingly, the evidence does neither support nor refute bile acids for primary sclerosing cholangitis.</P>

<P>Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a progressive chronic cholestatic liver disease that usually leads to the development of cirrhosis.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-10-09 15:57:46 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I>, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, <I>MEDLINE</I>, <I>EMBASE </I>and <I>Science Citation Index Expanded</I> generally from inception through to October 2010.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-12-07 09:48:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Randomised clinical trials comparing any dose of bile acids or duration of treatment versus placebo, no intervention, or another intervention were included irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-12-07 09:48:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Two authors extracted data independently. We evaluated the risk of bias of the trials using prespecified domains. We performed the meta-analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle. We presented outcomes as relative risks (RR) or mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-12-07 09:56:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Eight trials evaluated ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo or no intervention (592 patients). The eight randomised clinical trials have a high risk of bias. Patients were treated for three months to six years (median three years). The dosage of ursodeoxycholic acid used in the trials ranged from low (10 mg/kg body weight/day) to high (28 to 30 mg/kg body weight/day). Ursodeoxycholic acid did not significantly reduce the risk of death (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.46 to 2.20); treatment failure including liver transplantation, varices, ascites, and encephalopathy (RR 1.22; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.64); liver histological deterioration (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.74); or liver cholangiographic deterioration (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.23 to 1.57). Ursodeoxycholic acid significantly improved serum bilirubin (MD -14.6 µmol/litre; 95% CI -18.7 to -10.6), alkaline phosphatases (MD -506 IU/litre; 95% CI -583 to -430), aspartate aminotransferase (MD -46 IU/litre; 95% CI -77 to -16), and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (MD -260 IU/litre; 95% CI -315 to -205), but not albumin (MD -0.20 g/litre; 95% CI -1.91 to 1.50). Ursodeoxycholic acid was safe and well tolerated by patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-12-07 09:56:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>We did not find enough evidence to support or refute the use of bile acids in the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis. However, bile acids seem to lead to a significant improvement in liver biochemistry. Therefore, more randomised trials are needed before any of the bile acids can be recommended for this indication.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-12-07 12:51:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic disease of progressive course that usually leads to the development of biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Silveira-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silveira 2008</LINK>). The aetiology of PSC is still unknown and genetic factors as well as environmental factors may be involved. There is increasing evidence that autoimmune processes may have an important role, but other components such as portal bacteraemia, viral infections, toxic and metabolic liver injury, and innate predispositions cannot be excluded (<LINK REF="REF-Wee-1985a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wee 1985a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Donaldson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donaldson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olerup-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olerup 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Talwalkar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talwalkar 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2008</LINK>). The reported incidence of PSC in the United States and Northern Europe ranges from 0.9 to 1.3 per 100,000 population and prevalence from 8 to 14 per 100,000 population. However, a recent population-based cohort study by <LINK REF="REF-Card-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Card 2008</LINK> showed appreciably lower rates of incidence and prevalence in the United Kingdom (0.41 and 3.85, respectively). PSC is more common in young middle-aged men and a large proportion of patients have associated inflammatory bowel disease, especially ulcerative colitis. Seventy to eighty per cent of patients with PSC in the United States and Northern Europe will have or develop inflammatory bowel disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silveira-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silveira 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>PSC is characterised by inflammation and fibrosis of intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic bile ducts and can be classified into large-duct or small-duct variants according to the involvement of the biliary tree (<LINK REF="REF-Ludwig-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludwig 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 2007</LINK>). Large-duct PSC principally involves the extrahepatic ducts and those parts of the intrahepatic biliary ductal system that can be visualised cholangiographically. Characteristic histological findings may or may not be found on liver biopsy. Small-duct PSC involves the intrahepatic ducts at the microscopic level and is characterised by typical findings on liver biopsy, while the bile ducts visible by imaging methods are normal (<LINK REF="REF-Ludwig-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludwig 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ludwig-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludwig 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>PSC progresses slowly, perhaps over decades, and leads to liver fibrosis. This may cause portal hypertension and, eventually, death from liver failure (<LINK REF="REF-Wee-1985b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wee 1985b</LINK>). Diagnosis usually relies on a combination of clinical, laboratory and imaging findings. Approximately 15% to 55% of the patients are asymptomatic at presentation. The most common symptoms are fatigue, pruritus, jaundice, abdominal discomfort and fever (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silveira-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silveira 2008</LINK>). There are no specific biochemical changes, although a cholestatic picture with serum alkaline phosphatase elevation and fluctuations of serum bilirubin levels are frequently present. Due to lack of clinical findings in the early stage of disease the diagnosis of PSC is made by a mean delay of four years from the first presentation of biochemical abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Tischendorf-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tischendorf 2008</LINK>). Cholangiography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) have been the golden diagnostic standards in PSC patients. Recently, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has become the leading diagnostic technique in PSC patients, mainly because of its non-invasiveness and cost-effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Talwalkar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talwalkar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meagher-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meagher 2007</LINK>). The major radiological criterion is diffuse, multifocal stricturing characterised by irregularity of both the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1984</LINK>). Histological findings are frequently non-specific, therefore the role of liver biopsy in PSC evaluation is questionable. Pathognomonic concentric periductal fibrosis ('onion-skinning'), narrowing, obliteration and disappearing of small bile ducts are found in less than 15% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Burak-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burak 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment of PSC, as well as diagnostic evaluation, is also based mainly on a combined approach that includes medical, endoscopic, and surgical interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Lindor-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindor 1987</LINK>). Endoscopic treatment includes balloon dilation, stenting and nasobiliary catheter perfusion. It is mostly reserved for patients with dominant strictures that involve larger extrahepatic biliary ducts. Stenting of such lesions has been associated with a greater number of intervention-related complications, therefore balloon dilation of strictures alone is preferred (<LINK REF="REF-Stiehl-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiehl 1997;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Linder-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linder 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Michaels-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michaels 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Silveira-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silveira 2008</LINK>). The actual benefits and harms of endoscopic procedures in PSC are still unknown, since there are no published randomised clinical trials evaluating this subject. Surgical procedure of choice in PSC patients is liver transplantation. Liver transplantation remains the only long-term treatment in PSC (<LINK REF="REF-Cullen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cullen 2005</LINK>). Resection of extrahepatic biliary tree and long-term transhepatic stenting are reserved for carefully selected non-cirrhotic patients with pronounced cholestasis or recurrent cholangitis caused by extrahepatic strictures that cannot be managed endoscopically (<LINK REF="REF-Angulo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angulo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Michaels-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michaels 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Medical approaches for the treatment of PSC have included the use of cupriuretic, immunosuppressive, anti-fibrotic, and choleretic agents (<LINK REF="REF-LaRusso-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaRusso 1999</LINK>). A variety of drugs have been evaluated (eg, budesonide, colchicines, cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycofenolate mofetil, prednisone, tacrolimus) and despite certain encouraging results none of them showed convincing evidence of benefit and some of them were accompanied by major adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Beuers-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beuers 2009</LINK>). Considerable interest has been directed towards the potential benefit of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in the treatment of chronic cholestatic liver diseases. Other bile acids, besides UDCA, include chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, lithocholic and tauro-ursodeoxycholic acid. Endogenous bile acids, such as deoxycholic and chenodeoxycholic acid, accumulate in the liver in the course of cholestasis and induce liver injury by damaging cellular membranes with their hydrophobic detergent-like properties (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sholmerich-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sholmerich 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perez-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez 2009</LINK>). The hepatocyte toxicity of hydrophobic bile acids has been observed both in animals and humans (<LINK REF="REF-Jaeschke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaeschke 2002</LINK>). The addition of UDCA is associated with several potentially protective mechanisms of action. UDCA increases the fraction of hydrophilic bile acids which directly stabilises cell membranes (<LINK REF="REF-Perez-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez 2009</LINK>), competitively inhibits the absorption of toxic endogenous bile acids in the terminal ileum (<LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2008</LINK>), and has potential immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting the expression of abnormal major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, thus resulting in suppression of cytokine and immunoglobulin production and T-cell mediated cytotoxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Calmus-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calmus 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yoshikawa-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoshikawa 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several randomised clinical trials have shown that UDCA improves serum biochemical indices of cholestasis and cytolysis in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2008</LINK>), another cholestatic liver disease, and those with viral hepatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2007</LINK>). Similar effects have been shown in PSC patients on UDCA (<LINK REF="REF-Stiehl-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiehl 1996</LINK>). Additional trials have been performed to evaluate the effect of other bile acids like tauro-UDCA for primary biliary cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Crosignani-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crosignani 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Podda-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Podda 1996</LINK>), but we are not aware of trials examining tauro-UDCA for patients with PSC. Our previous Cochrane systematic review on the topic (New Reference), including six trials that had enrolled 223 patients, was unable to support or refute the bile acids treatment for PSC patients. We have been able to identify a meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Shi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shi 2009</LINK> addressing this issue. The meta-analysis included eight randomised clinical trials with a total of 465 patients showing a statistically significant improvement in liver biochemistry and histology in patients treated with UDCA. However, no significant effect was confirmed on the incidence of death and/or liver transplantation, as well as on pruritus and fatigue.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-12-07 09:50:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Risk of bias was defined as the confidence that the design and reporting of the trial restricted bias in the intervention comparison (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>). Due to the risk of overestimation of intervention effects in randomised trials with unclear or inadequate components, we assessed the risk of bias using the definitions in the following domains of risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<B>Allocation sequence generation</B> <BR/>- Low risk of bias: sequence generation was achieved using computer random number generation or a random number table. Drawing lots, tossing a coin, shuffling cards and throwing dice are adequate if performed by an independent adjudicator.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the trial was described as randomised, but the method of sequence generation was not specified.<BR/>- High risk of bias: the sequence generation method is not, or may not be, random. Quasi-randomised studies, those using dates, names, or admittance numbers in order to allocate patients are inadequate and were excluded for the assessment of benefits but not for harms.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Allocation concealment</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: allocation was controlled by a central and independent randomisation unit, sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes or similar, so that intervention allocations could not have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the trial was described as randomised but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described, so that intervention allocations may have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.<BR/>- High risk of bias: if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants or if the study was quasi-randomised. Quasi-randomised studies were excluded for the assessment of benefits but not for harms.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Blinding</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: the trial was described as blinded, the parties that were blinded, and the method of blinding was described, so that knowledge of allocation was adequately prevented during the trial.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the trial was described as blind, but the method of blinding was not described, so that knowledge of allocation was possible during the trial.<BR/>- High risk of bias, the trial was not blinded, so that the allocation was known during the trial.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Incomplete outcome data</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: the numbers and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals in all intervention groups were described or if it was specified that there were no dropouts or withdrawals.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the report gave the impression that there had been no dropouts or withdrawals, but this was not specifically stated.<BR/>- High risk of bias: the number or reasons for dropouts and withdrawals were not described.</P>
<P>
<B>Selective outcome reporting</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: pre-defined, or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were reported on.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: not all pre-defined, or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were reported on or were not reported fully, or it is unclear whether data on these outcomes were recorded or not.<BR/>- High risk of bias: one or more clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were not reported on; data on these outcomes were likely to have been recorded.</P>
<P>Trials assessed as having 'low risk of bias' in all individual domains above were considered 'trials with low risk of bias'. Trials assessed as having 'uncertain risk of bias' or 'high risk of bias' in one or more of the specified above individual domains were considered trials with 'high risk of bias'.</P>

<P>We were unable to perform several of the planned sensitivity analyses for a number of reasons: the bias risk of all eight trials was high; co-interventions were not used in any of the trials; we were unable to identify whether the included patients had large-duct or small-duct PSC, with the exception of one trial; and we did not find any unpublished studies. The sensitivity analyses that we could perform are regarding duration of treatment and dose of UDCA administered.</P>
<P>According to the review protocol, we defined short treatment duration as being less than 24 months and long treatment duration as being 24 months or longer. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Beuers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beuers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stiehl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stiehl 1994</LINK>) had short treatment duration while the other six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Maria-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Maria 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 2009</LINK>) had long treatment duration. We also defined a low dose of UDCA (less than 13 mg/kg body weight/day) and a high dose (13 mg/kg body weight/day or more) by the median dose of UDCA used in the trials included in this review. The low dose of UDCA was applied in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stiehl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stiehl 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Maria-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Maria 1996</LINK>), and the high dose of UDCA in the other five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Beuers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beuers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Regarding the number of deaths at the end of treatment, we did not find any significant difference between the short treatment duration (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.02 to 9.00) and long treatment duration (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.48 to 2.44) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) or between a low dose of UDCA (no deaths in this comparison) and a high dose of UDCA (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.46 to 2.20) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). In order to explore the relationship between treatment duration and dose of UDCA, we conducted a post hoc sensitivity analysis by dividing trials into four groups: long treatment duration with high dose of UDCA (<LINK REF="STD-Lindor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 2009</LINK>); short treatment duration with high dose of UDCA (<LINK REF="STD-Beuers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beuers 1992</LINK>); long treatment duration with low dose of UDCA (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Maria-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Maria 1996</LINK>); and short treatment duration with low dose of UDCA (<LINK REF="STD-Stiehl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stiehl 1994</LINK>).

<B>Patients</B>
<BR/>Patients with PSC diagnosed by standard biochemical, histological, and radiological features in the absence of secondary cholangitis, hepato-biliary malignancy, and viral, metabolic, or autoimmune liver disease were included in the review. In total, 592 patients were randomised with a median size for the eight trials of 33 patients (range from 14 to 219). The mean age of the patients in all included trials ranged from 31 to 52 years. The male to female ratio was 370:200, while for the 22 patients that were lost to follow-up in the <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 2005</LINK> trial no specification of sex was reported.</P>
<P>Concomitant inflammatory bowel disease was common. The proportion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease was 42.5% in the <LINK REF="STD-de-Maria-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Maria 1996</LINK> trial, 61% in the <LINK REF="STD-Lo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1992</LINK> trial, and over 71% in the other four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Beuers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beuers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stiehl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stiehl 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2001</LINK>). Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Stiehl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stiehl 1994</LINK>) reported the ratio of patients with intrahepatic (10 patients) and extrahepatic (9 patients) PSC according to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography findings.</P>
<P>
<B>Bile acids and collateral interventions</B>
<BR/>UDCA was the only bile acid that was evaluated in the eight trials. Seven trials compared UDCA versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Beuers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beuers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stiehl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stiehl 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 2009</LINK>) and one trial compared UDCA versus no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-de-Maria-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Maria 1996</LINK>).

<P>Patients received 10 mg/kg body weight/day of UDCA in the <LINK REF="STD-Lo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1992</LINK> trial, and a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg body weight/day was used in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Beuers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beuers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stiehl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stiehl 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Maria-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Maria 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 1997</LINK>).

The trials by <LINK REF="STD-Beuers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beuers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 2009</LINK> are the only considered free of selective reporting. Three trials did not perform sample size calculation (<LINK REF="STD-Lo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Maria-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Maria 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2001</LINK>). The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 2005</LINK> performed sample size calculation, but did not attained the pre-specified sample size. Reasons for early termination of the trial were not reported. Another trial <LINK REF="STD-Beuers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beuers 1992</LINK> was terminated early, because an interim analysis performed six months after study initiation showed a significant difference in activity of alkaline-phosphatases between the two groups of patients. Two trials fairly used intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="STD-de-Maria-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de Maria 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 2009</LINK>).

Accordingly, none of the trials were of low risk of bias, that is, being judged with having low risk of bias in generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, double blinding, incomplete data and outcome reporting, and no other potential sources of bias (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2010-12-07 09:56:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>We included eight trials in this review. Seven trials with a total of 552 patients compared UDCA versus placebo, and one trial compared UDCA versus no intervention in a total of 40 patients. In all cases of analyses containing a single trial, the results obtained by RevMan 5 were identical or very similar to the results obtained by recommended Fisher's exact test, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test, or t-test.</P>
<P>
<B>All-cause mortality</B>
<BR/>All included trials reported on all-cause mortality at the end of treatment. UDCA did not significantly reduce overall mortality (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.20) when compared with the control group. There were 11 deaths out of 296 patients (3.7%) in the UDCA group as well as in the control group, with no statistically significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 1997</LINK> trial, causes of death included cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer in three patients, and liver failure or complications of portal hypertension in four patients. One patient (in the placebo group) from <LINK REF="STD-Beuers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beuers 1992</LINK> reported that one patient in the placebo group died of decompensated cirrhosis with gastrointestinal bleeding, while <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2001</LINK> reported that the one death in the placebo group was unrelated to liver disease. Five deaths occurred in the <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 2005</LINK> trial, one caused by hepatic failure and four due to cholangiocarcinoma. We were not able to find the causes of the eight deaths occurred in the <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 2009</LINK> trial, while no deaths were reported in the remaining three trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Treatment failures</B>
<BR/>There was no significant difference between UDCA and placebo with respect to treatment failures such as liver transplantation, varices, ascites, and encephalopathy (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.64) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lindor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 2009</LINK>) reported the number of treatment failures. A total of 66 treatment failures among 252 patients in the UDCA groups (26.2%) (liver transplantation = 23, cirrhosis = 6, varices = 23, ascites = 3, encephalopathy = 3, liver failure = 3, cholangiocarcinoma = 5), and 53 among 248 patients in the control groups (21.4%) (liver transplantation = 21, cirrhosis = 4, varices = 12, ascites = 8, encephalopathy = 0, liver failure = 2, cholangiocarcinoma = 6) were reported.</P>

<B>Adverse events</B>
<BR/>Six trials among all the included and excluded trials reported on adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Beuers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beuers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charatcharoenwitthaya-_x0027_08" TYPE="STUDY">Charatcharoenwitthaya '08</LINK>) on a total of 444 patients. However, we analysed only the data from included trials on a total of 402 patients. In the <LINK REF="STD-Beuers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beuers 1992</LINK> trial, one patient in the UDCA group developed diarrhoea. In the <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 1997</LINK> trial, in the placebo group one patient experienced a flare up of chronic ulcerative colitis while another developed diarrhoea. The trials by <LINK REF="STD-Lo-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lo 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2001</LINK> stated that no adverse events occurred during the study period. There was no statistically significant difference between treatment with UDCA versus placebo or no intervention with respect to the number of adverse events (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.60) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The excluded trial by <LINK REF="STD-Charatcharoenwitthaya-_x0027_08" TYPE="STUDY">Charatcharoenwitthaya '08</LINK> reported a flare of ulcerative colitis in the studied cohort of patients.

<B>Quality of life and cost-effectiveness</B>
<BR/>Only the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Olsson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 2005</LINK>) reported the analysis of self-estimated quality of life, assessing separately physical and mental components. No significant differences were found between the groups of patients for both, physical (MD -0.80; 95% CI -3.19 to 1.59) and mental (MD -0.20; 95% CI -2.69 to 2.29) components (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>

Twelve out of 92 patients in the UDCA groups and 14 out of 93 patients in the control groups had deterioration of liver histology. UDCA did not significantly decrease the risk of liver histology deterioration (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.74) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial including 21 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2001</LINK>) reported the histological inflammatory score at the end of treatment (mean 3.50, standard deviation = 2.10 in the UDCA group and mean 4.50, standard deviation = 3.00 in the placebo group).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-12-07 10:45:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review could not demonstrate any significant effects of UDCA on mortality, treatment failures (including liver transplantation, varices, ascites, and encephalopathy), clinical symptoms, liver histology, or cholangiography in patients with PSC compared with placebo or no intervention. However, we find a significant reduction in liver biochemical variables, including serum bilirubin and liver enzyme activities, following UDCA administration. This observation is, however, at risk of outcome reporting bias as half or less of the trials reported these outcomes. Moreover, other error risks may be operative (please see below). UDCA appeared to be safe and well tolerated since we did not observe any significant increase in the occurrence of serious or non-serious adverse events in patients with PSC.</P>
<P>Four out of the eight trials reported the method used to generate the allocation sequence, but none of the trials reported the method for allocation concealment. Five trials, as considered by the study authors, used adequate blinding methods achieving successful blinding of both patients and study investigators. However, as we have stressed earlier, trials with UDCA may be difficult to blind (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2008</LINK>). 'Intention-to-treat analysis' was fairly performed only in two trials. Two other trials stated the use of 'intention-to-treat' analysis, while in fact all of the results were based on the patients who remained at the end of treatment. Based on these observations, we suggest that more attention ought to be paid to these important methodological issues in future trials. The dimensions of methodological quality of trials have significant influence on the effect of interventions, eg, trials with high risk of bias may significantly overestimate intervention effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>). As all of the included trials were of high risk of bias, we cannot exclude the possibility that the beneficial effects of UDCA on liver biochemistry may be due to bias or random errors (<LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>). However, comparable observations in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2008</LINK>) and viral hepatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2007</LINK>) may support the positive effects of UDCA on some liver biochemical variables.</P>
<P>We also cannot exclude the possibility that the identified trials did not correctly assess the potential beneficial effects of bile acids on hard outcomes in patients with PSC. First, the treatment duration in the included trials may have been too short; the median duration of UDCA treatment in the included trials was three years. This is a relatively short duration, considering the slow progress of PSC, which commonly takes decades to cause portal hypertension and eventual premature death from liver failure (<LINK REF="REF-LaRusso-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">LaRusso 1999</LINK>). Second, the apparent lack of clinical benefit of UDCA may also be due to patient selection. Most of the patients in the eight trials had an advanced histological stage of PSC with substantial fibrosis. Thus, the disease may have been too advanced in many of the included patients to achieve a positive response from medical therapy. However, the majority of patients with PSC do not present with early disease. Third, the sample size of the included trials ranged from 14 to 219 patients. Further, the sample size calculation in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Beuers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beuers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stiehl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stiehl 1994</LINK>) was based on biochemical variables, such as serum transaminases, rather than on hard outcomes (death or liver transplantation). This may explain our failure to detect a significant effect of UDCA on clinically important outcome measures. Due to the difficulty in identifying many patients with PSC, multicentre randomised trials are required to examine the effects of UDCA on clinically important outcomes.</P>
<P>PSC is a chronic cholestatic hepato-biliary disease in which progressive obliterative fibrosis of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts leads to biliary cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and liver failure. The purpose of the trials assessing UDCA for PSC has not been to evaluate whether this bile acid could reverse the decompensated or terminal stage of the disease, but rather if UDCA could slow progression towards the more advanced stages. It has also been a main goal to study the effect of UDCA on liver histology and cholangiography. We were not able to identify any significant effect of UDCA on these outcome measures. We also performed sensitivity analyses to examine whether this failure may be due to insufficient doses of UDCA or too short a duration of treatment and follow-up, but could not find any significant difference either. We have also been unable to find evidence that the improvement of biochemical variables can predict a decrease of death or stop the progress of the disease. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2001</LINK>) reported a significant reduction in the progression of cholangiographic appearances and liver fibrosis as assessed by disease staging under treatment with high dose UDCA (20 mg/kg body weight/day) for two years. However, two newly included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Olsson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Olsson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 2009</LINK>) used an even higher dosage of UDCA throughout a longer period of time, but without reporting positive changes in the progression of the mentioned parameters. It is possible that absorption of UDCA is decreased in patients with PSC due to impaired alkalinisation of bile by the diseased biliary epithelium (<LINK REF="REF-Paumgartner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paumgartner 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paumgartner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paumgartner 2004</LINK>) and that higher doses of UDCA could have beneficial effects. However, evidence for this is still very poor (<LINK REF="REF-Beuers-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beuers 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Kim et al (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2000</LINK>) have developed a prognostic model for PSC patients based on 405 patients, followed up for a median of 36 months. Age; presence of ascites, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and variceal bleeding; haemoglobin level, platelet count, and prothrombin time; and serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, and total bilirubin were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) associated with patient survival (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2000</LINK>). However, these observations do not prove that the effect of UDCA on surrogate outcome measures such as bilirubin and liver enzyme activities translates into a more favourable prognosis. In clinical practice, some physicians still base therapeutic decisions on non-validated surrogate outcomes such as the biochemical variables mentioned above (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007</LINK>). Two systematic reviews on the effect of bile acids in primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2008</LINK>) and viral hepatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2007</LINK>) reported significant improvement in liver biochemistry, but not on hard outcome measures such as mortality or liver transplantation. The recent meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Shi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shi 2009</LINK> also reports a statistically significant beneficial effect of UDCA on liver biochemistry in patients with PSC, but without significant effect on mortality, symptoms, and need for liver transplantation. One could argue whether more trials should be performed to eventually confirm a beneficial effect of UDCA on clinically important outcomes in PSC. However, we have to state that current results and conclusions are based mostly on trials with a rather small number of patients and a high risk of bias, and that some of the trials are published only as abstracts. Another important aspect that perhaps should be more investigated is the quality of life in PSC patients undergoing UDCA treatment. Only one trial included in our review reported on this aspect, without finding any statistically significant difference in various physical and mental components of patients' quality of life.</P>
<P>The mechanisms for the beneficial effects of UDCA on PSC include the protection of cholangiocytes against the cytotoxicity of hydrophobic bile acids, stimulation of hepato-biliary secretion, and protection of hepatocytes against bile acid-induced apoptosis (<LINK REF="REF-Paumgartner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paumgartner 2004</LINK>). Phospholipids in bile can protect cholangiocytes against membrane damage induced by hydrophobic bile acids. Administration of UDCA is also helpful in rendering bile more hydrophilic and less cytotoxic (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Nieuwkerk-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Nieuwkerk 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perez-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez 2009</LINK>). The protection of UDCA may also result from stimulation of hepato-biliary secretion (<LINK REF="REF-Beuers-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beuers 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beuers-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beuers 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beuers-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beuers 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paumgartner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paumgartner 2004</LINK>). Furthermore, recent data from basic research demonstrate that bile acids including UDCA appear to affect both death receptors (Caspase 8/10) and cell survival cascades (UDCA-epidermal growth factor-mitogen activated protein kinase) (<LINK REF="REF-Guicciardi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guicciardi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Qiao-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qiao 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paumgartner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paumgartner 2004</LINK>). The beneficial effects of UDCA on liver biochemical variables suggest that in patients with PSC (the present review), primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2008</LINK>), and viral hepatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2007</LINK>) the stimulation of the cell survival cascades by UDCA seems to overpower its concomitant stimulation of the cell death receptors. However, beneficially affecting cell death of, for example, hepatocytes may not be important enough to arrest or slow the progression of a disease such as PSC, which primarily affects the biliary tract. Similar or alternative disease mechanisms may be at play in primary biliary cirrhosis and viral hepatitis. Therefore, clinicians should base their clinical practice on solid research evidence rather than on evidence from animal studies or the opinion of experts. Furthermore, when UDCA induced mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling (for survival cascades) was abolished in rodent hepatocytes, UDCA induced apoptosis was enhanced (<LINK REF="REF-Qiao-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qiao 2002</LINK>). At present we know too little about the effects of the abolishment of mitogen-activated protein kinase in humans. The mechanisms mentioned above may explain the observed improvement of liver biochemistry but this does not provide an impetus to treat PSC patients with UDCA. Evidence of beneficial effects of UDCA on clinically meaningful outcomes is needed to recommend UDCA for PSC patients.</P>
<P>Long-term UDCA administration in patients with PSC was associated with a very low incidence of adverse events in the eight included trials; these findings confirm previous observations in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and viral hepatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gong-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2008</LINK>). The major adverse event reported in these trials was diarrhoea. In the treatment of PSC, it was unclear whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease, a frequently associated condition, would tolerate UDCA treatment as well as patients without inflammatory bowel disease. In the <LINK REF="STD-Beuers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Beuers 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stiehl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Stiehl 1994</LINK> trials, patients treated with UDCA experienced severe diarrhoea without signs of inflammation. This seemed to have been related to UDCA because the diarrhoea stopped promptly following the termination of treatment or lowering the dosage of UDCA. In the <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 2001</LINK> trial, although the patients received high-dose UDCA treatment, no adverse events, such as diarrhoea, were reported.<BR/>
<BR/>In summary, the evidence collected in this review does not show any convincing beneficial effects of UDCA on death, liver complications, liver histology, or cholangiographic deterioration in patients with PSC. Treatment of PSC patients with UDCA needs to be evaluated in appropriately powered randomised trials of low risk of bias.</P>

<P>A need for adequately powered and long-term conducted randomised clinical trials to support or change the current results and knowledge of the effects of UDCA for PSC still exist. Since UDCA seems to be well-tolerated, the effects of high-dose UDCA (eg, greater than 20 mg/kg body weight/day) compared with placebo intervention are worth exploring. We were not able to find trials evaluating other types of bile acids in the treatment of patients with PSC, so these investigations could also be worth performing. The relative rarity of PSC necessitates multicentre and likely multi-national co-operation.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2010-12-07 09:56:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>We assessed the risk of bias in included trials for two more components than it was stated in the review protocol - incomplete outcome data and selective outcome measure report. Quasi-randomised, observational, and case-control studies were included for the report of adverse events.</P>

<P>
<B>Changes to the protocol</B>
<BR/>While working on this review we found some shortcomings in the protocol. We amended these shortcomings as described below. None of the amendments were data driven.</P>
<P>General style<BR/>We have used fewer abbreviations in order to make the review easier to read.</P>
<P>Types of studies<BR/>To document adverse events, we considered study types other than randomised clinical trials because rare adverse events are seldom captured in small trials. Accordingly, we sought information on rare adverse events from large cohort studies as well as previously published meta-analyses and systematic reviews.</P>
<P>Outcome measures<BR/>We changed the outcomes as follows:<BR/>5. Radiological response: number of patients with radiological progression or no improvement.<BR/>into<BR/>5. Radiological response: number of patients with radiological deterioration.</P>
<P>and</P>
<P>6. Histological response: number of patients with histological progression or no improvement.<BR/>into<BR/>6. Histological response: number of patients with histological deterioration.<BR/>
