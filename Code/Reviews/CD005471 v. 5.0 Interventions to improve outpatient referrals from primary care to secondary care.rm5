<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Are there effective methods to improve the process of referring patients to specialised care?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Patients are referred to a specialist when more specialised care is needed. It has however been shown that the process by which patients are referred could be improved. Some patients may be referred to a specialist inappropriately or not be referred when they should have, or when they were referred have unnecessary tests or procedures. </P>
<P>This review found 17 studies that evaluated whether educating health care professionals about referrals, changing the organisation or system of referrals, and changing the fees or payments for referrals, could improve the referral process. </P>
<P>Education: The referral process will most likely improve when guidelines for referral are distributed with standard referral forms and when the health care professionals who are the consultants are involved in teaching about referring. But simply distributing guidelines and providing health care professionals with feedback about how they are referring may not improve the process. </P>
<P>Organisation: There is little evidence about organisational changes. But providing a second opinion before referring, or enhancing the services provided before a referral (e.g. providing access to a physiotherapist) may improve the referral process. </P>
<P>Financial: There is not enough evidence to draw firm conclusions about financial changes. Financial changes can change the number of referrals but it is not known whether they improve the quality or appropriateness of referrals.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The primary care specialist interface is a key organisational feature of many health care systems. Patients are referred to specialist care when investigation or therapeutic options are exhausted in primary care and more specialised care is needed. Referral has considerable implications for patients, the health care system and health care costs. There is considerable evidence that the referral processes can be improved. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To estimate the effectiveness and efficiency of interventions to change outpatient referral rates or improve outpatient referral appropriateness.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) group specialised register (developed through extensive searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Healthstar and the Cochrane Library) (February 2002) and the National Research Register. Updated searches were conducted in MEDLINE and the EPOC specialised register up to October 2007.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series of interventions to change or improve outpatient referrals. Participants were primary care physicians. The outcomes were objectively measured provider performance or health outcomes.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>A minimum of two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seventeen studies involving 23 separate comparisons were included. Nine studies (14 comparisons) evaluated professional educational interventions. Ineffective strategies included: passive dissemination of local referral guidelines (two studies), feedback of referral rates (one study) and discussion with an independent medical adviser (one study). Generally effective strategies included dissemination of guidelines with structured referral sheets (four out of five studies) and involvement of consultants in educational activities (two out of three studies). Four studies evaluated organisational interventions (patient management by family physicians compared to general internists, attachment of a physiotherapist to general practices, a new slot system for referrals and requiring a second 'in-house' opinion prior to referral), all of which were effective. Four studies (five comparisons) evaluated financial interventions. One study evaluating change from a capitation based to mixed capitation and fee-for-service system and from a fee-for-service to a capitation based system (with an element of risk sharing for secondary care services) observed a reduction in referral rates. Modest reductions in referral rates of uncertain significance were observed following the introduction of the general practice fundholding scheme in the United Kingdom (UK). One study evaluating the effect of providing access to private specialists demonstrated an increase in the proportion of patients referred to specialist services but no overall effect on referral rates.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There are a limited number of rigorous evaluations to base policy on. Active local educational interventions involving secondary care specialists and structured referral sheets are the only interventions shown to impact on referral rates based on current evidence. The effects of 'in-house' second opinion and other intermediate primary care based alternatives to outpatient referral appear promising. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-12-01 08:52:35 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary-secondary care interface is a key organisational feature of many health care systems. Primary care physicians provide primary health care and act as 'gatekeepers' with responsibility for defining which patients require secondary care. The referral system is the 'organisational structure for referring medical problems from generalists to specialists' (<LINK REF="REF-Coulter-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulter 1992</LINK>). Some countries have a similar formal referral system, for example Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK, where primary care physicians provide health care and act as gatekeepers with responsibility for defining which patients require specialist care. Other countries have a less formalised referral system, for example France, Germany and the United States of America (USA) (<LINK REF="REF-Casparie-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casparie 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gervas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gervas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marinker-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinker 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roland-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roland 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients are referred to specialist care to obtain advice on diagnosis or management, to obtain a specialised procedure when investigation or therapeutic options are exhausted in primary care and more specialised care is needed, and to obtain a second opinion. During referral, there is 'a transfer of responsibility for some aspect of the patient's care' from primary to secondary care (<LINK REF="REF-McWhinney-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">McWhinney 1989</LINK>). Referral has considerable implications for patients, the health care system and health care costs. However, there is considerable evidence that the process of referral is sub optimal. There are unexplained variations in referral rates (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkin 1992</LINK>), suggesting that some patients are referred inappropriately, consuming health care resources which could have been used to provide other services, and that some patients are inappropriately managed in primary care settings who would benefit from specialist care. There is also evidence of inappropriateness of referral and poor communication at the time of referral (<LINK REF="REF-Roland-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roland 1992</LINK>). As a result, patients may undergo unnecessary diagnostic or therapeutic procedures (including hospitalisation).</P>
<P>Despite the growing awareness of problems associated with referrals, there has been relatively little research evaluating interventions to improve referral behaviour compared with other types of behaviour (for example, prescribing). A systematic review of studies evaluating professional interventions to improve referral behaviour identified only four studies published between 1966 and 1995 (<LINK REF="STD-Grimshaw-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grimshaw 1998</LINK>). Mixed results were found; training plus structured assessment cards and joint consultation sessions were effective. However, development and dissemination of local consensus guidelines and the introduction of fundholding in UK primary care were found to have little effect. The review concluded that it was difficult to draw firm conclusions as a result of the limited number of rigorous studies identified and that further research was needed on interventions to improve the referral process. Since that review was undertaken, the NHS (Primary and secondary care interface programme) in the UK and other funders have commissioned a number of further studies.</P>
<P>This is an updated version of the Cochrane review published in 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2005</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aims of the review were:<BR/>(1) To identify which interventions have been evaluated to change primary care outpatient referral rates or improve referral appropriateness. <BR/>(2) To estimate the effectiveness of interventions to change primary care outpatient referral rates or improve outpatient referral appropriateness. </P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series (ITSs). </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Primary care physicians, defined broadly as any medically qualified physician who provides primary health care. Primary health care provides 'integrated, easy to access, health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal health care needs, developing a sustained and continuous relationship with patients, and practising in the context of family and community' (<LINK REF="REF-Vanselow-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanselow 1995</LINK>). Primary care physicians include general practitioners, family doctors, family physicians, family practitioners and other physicians working in primary health care settings who fulfil primary health care tasks (for example, general pediatricians in the USA). </P>
<P>Specialist physicians working in hospitals or community outpatient settings. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The review focused on interventions to change outpatient referral rates or improve outpatient referrals appropriateness. During outpatient referral, there is 'a transfer of responsibility for some aspect of the patient's care' from primary to secondary care (<LINK REF="REF-McWhinney-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">McWhinney 1989</LINK>). Referral is a management option in most diseases, therefore any intervention aiming to influence clinical behaviour could have indirect effects on the quality and quantity of referrals. Studies had to report explicitly that influencing referral was a primary objective of the intervention to be included. Interventions were classified according to the Cochrane EPOC taxonomy of interventions (<I>see </I>SCOPE in GROUP DETAILS). </P>
<P>Interventions to change or improve referrals for open access radiological or laboratory diagnostic investigations (eg radiology) were excluded. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Objectively measured provider performance in a health care setting (for example, referral rates or appropriateness of referral) or health outcomes were included. </P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>
<B>(1) Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Register</B>
<BR/>For the original review, we searched the specialised register and pending register of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care group using the terms: refer* and consultation* with the term outpatient*. The register is based upon retrospective and prospective sensitive searches of key bibliographic databases (including MEDLINE and CINAHL), hand searching of key journals and reference lists of published literature reviews (<I>see</I> SEARCH STRATEGIES FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF STUDIES under GROUP DETAILS). Potentially relevant studies are entered into the pending register for assessment of the full text articles. Studies are included in the specialised register if they use RCT, CCT, CBA or ITS designs and evaluate interventions within EPOC's scope. Studies in the specialised register are coded by their design, type of intervention and type of targeted behaviour and include the full MEDLINE, EMBASE or Healthstar reference. The register was searched on February 2002 by the EPOC TSC for the initial version of the review. For the update, the EPOC register was searched up to October 2007 (refer to Appendix 01). </P>
<P>
<B>(2) MEDLINE <BR/>
</B>For the initial review, we conducted additional test searches of MEDLINE using a search strategy developed by CF. However, a search of the MEDLINE 1995 to 1999 database identified 6,000 records (after records identified by the existing EPOC search strategy were excluded). No additional potentially relevant studies were identified when we screened the first 500 records. As a result, we did not undertake further MEDLINE searches. </P>
<P>For this update, Medline was searched using the following search strategy: </P>

<P>
<B>(3) UK National Research Register </B>
<BR/>We searched the UK National Research Register with the terms: (outpat* and refer*) and interface. We searched MEDLINE for published reports of completed projects by the name of the lead researcher. </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The review was conducted using standard EPOC methods (<LINK REF="REF-Bero-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bero 2008</LINK>). </P>
<P>EG, CF, RT and CP screened the results of searches to identify potentially relevant papers. AA and AM screened the results of the updated searches. Two difficulties arose when identifying potentially relevant studies:</P>
<P>(1) Problems associated with definition of intervention - We identified many studies which reported the effects of interventions on referral rates, however the majority of these focused on the general management of a clinical condition rather than on referral. As specified in our inclusion criteria we only considered interventions if they explicitly reported that a primary objective was to influence referrals.<BR/>(2) Problems associated with definition of primary care - A significant number of potentially relevant studies were conducted in US ambulatory care clinics and it was difficult to determine whether the professionals targeted fulfilled our inclusion criteria. We contacted a number of experts in the US who advised us to consider family physicians and general internal medicine physicians as primary care physicians.</P>
<P>Two reviewers (EG and JG or CP or RT), independently selected the studies to be included in the review, and AA and AM selected studies for the update, with input from JG. A list of excluded studies can be obtained from the authors. </P>
<P>Data from each paper were abstracted independently by two authors (EG and at least one of CP, JG, AM, RT or RW) using the standard EPOC checklist (<LINK REF="REF-Bero-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bero 2008</LINK>) and by three authors (AA, AM and MA) for the update. Data abstraction was checked and discrepancies were resolved through discussion by the relevant two authors. JG acted as arbiter for any unresolved discrepancies. If one of the authors of this review was involved in one of the reviewed studies, they did not participate in the abstraction of that study.</P>
<P>Given the substantial heterogeneity of interventions and methods across studies, it was not sensible to use meta-analysis to pool the results of studies. Instead, we present the results of studies in tabular form and make a qualitative assessment of the effects of studies, based upon the quality, the size and direction of effect observed and the statistical significance of the studies. We report the following data (where available): pre intervention study and control data in natural units and statistical significance across groups, post intervention study and control data in natural units and statistical significance across groups, absolute and relative percentage improvement. If a unit of analysis error was present, we attempted to re-analyse the study using data provided in the original paper. If this was not possible, we present the point estimates of effects without p-values or 95% confidence intervals. If the study authors had stated the hypothesised direction of effect for any outcome variable, we noted whether the result favoured the study or control groups.</P>

<B>Professional education interventions</B>
<BR/>Seven studies evaluated different methods of disseminating and implementing referral guidelines. Two evaluated passive dissemination of local guidelines (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grimshaw-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grimshaw 1998</LINK>). Jones (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1993</LINK>) evaluated the effects of disseminating consensus guidelines for management and referral of patients with dyspepsia. Grimshaw (<LINK REF="STD-Grimshaw-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grimshaw 1998</LINK>) evaluated the effects of disseminating locally developed guidelines for four common tracer conditions (low back pain, menorrhagia, suspected peptic ulcer, varicose veins) that accounted for 8% of total referrals. Five studies evaluated dissemination of referral guidelines with structured referral sheets - checklists to be completed at the time of referral prompting the primary care physician about important elements of pre-referral investigation and management (<LINK REF="STD-Abu_x002d_Ramadan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Abu-Ramadan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK>). Two of these focused on general practitioner management and referral of infertility: Emslie's study (<LINK REF="STD-Emslie-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 1993</LINK>) was based in a relatively simple referral setting (one referral hospital, traditionally good links between local general practitioners and the hospital), whereas Morrison's study (<LINK REF="STD-Morrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison 2001</LINK>) was set in a more complex referral settings (five referral hospitals in large city setting). Thomas' study (<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK>) evaluated the effects of a guideline based, open access investigation service for two common urological conditions. General practitioners could refer patients to a fast track investigation service if they used a structured letter based upon referral guidelines. Abu-Ramadan's study (<LINK REF="STD-Abu_x002d_Ramadan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Abu-Ramadan 2002</LINK>) evaluated the effect of a multifaceted intervention involving educational meetings, a new referral and reply sheet, new staff and changes in equipment and facilities. Bennett (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2001</LINK>) included a risk factor checklist and a training video to train the practitioners. </P>
<P>Three studies evaluated secondary care provider-led educational strategies (<LINK REF="STD-Banait-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Banait 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grimshaw-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grimshaw 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vierhout-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vierhout 1995</LINK>). Vierhout's study (<LINK REF="STD-Vierhout-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vierhout 1995</LINK>) evaluated the effects of joint general practitioner-consultant sessions for patients whose general practitioners were uncertain of diagnosis or management and were considering orthopaedic referral. The sessions were held monthly for 18 months; each of four orthopaedic surgeons saw patients with the same three general practitioners. Grimshaw (<LINK REF="STD-Grimshaw-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grimshaw 1998</LINK>) evaluated GP-consultant small group discussions for four common tracer conditions (see above). Banait (<LINK REF="STD-Banait-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Banait 2000</LINK>) evaluated consultant-led education outreach visits to disseminate guidelines for the management and referral of patients with dyspepsia. Finally Grimshaw's study (<LINK REF="STD-Grimshaw-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grimshaw 1998</LINK>) also evaluated the effects of feeding back information about referral rate to general practitioners and discussions between general practitioners and an independent adviser about referral. Due to the complex design, Grimshaw (<LINK REF="STD-Grimshaw-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grimshaw 1998</LINK>) was able to explore the effects of the four interventions separately and in combination.</P>
<P>
<B>Organisational interventions</B>
<BR/>Bertakis (<LINK REF="STD-Bertakis-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bertakis 1987</LINK>) evaluated the effects of the primary care physician's discipline (general internal medicine versus family physician) on referral behaviour. O'Cathain (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Cathain-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Cathain 1995</LINK>) evaluated the effect of providing primary care based physiotherapy services on referrals to orthopaedics and rheumatology. Kinnersley (<LINK REF="STD-Kinnersley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kinnersley 1999</LINK>) evaluated the effects of requiring an 'in house' second opinion prior to referral. General practitioners considering referral arranged for the patient to see a different partner in the same practice for an independent assessment. <LINK REF="STD-Bridgman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bridgman 2005</LINK> evaluated the effect of a new system where the number of appointment slots was allocated based on the size of the practices.</P>
<P>
<B>Financial interventions</B>
<BR/>Davidson (<LINK REF="STD-Davidson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Davidson 1992</LINK>) evaluated the effects of a change in remuneration system from a low cost fee-for-service system to either a high cost fee-for-service system or capitation-based budgetary system (with some degree of risk sharing by the provider for secondary care provision) for the management of Medicaid eligible paediatric care. Two UK based studies evaluated the effect of fundholding on referral patterns (<LINK REF="STD-Coulter-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Coulter 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kammerling-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kammerling 1996</LINK>). Linnala (<LINK REF="STD-Linnala-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Linnala 2001</LINK>) examined the impact of charging patients the same (lesser) rate to be seen by a private specialist as they would have been charged to see a hospital based specialist.</P>
<P>All of the professional educational interventions focused on a single or a small number of tracer conditions whereas the organisational and financial interventions focused on a broader range of conditions and problems.</P>

<B>Study designs</B>
<BR/>Study designs included: eight cluster randomised trials (which randomised by professional or practice) (<LINK REF="STD-Banait-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Banait 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davidson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Davidson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinnersley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kinnersley 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK>); two patient randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bertakis-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bertakis 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vierhout-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vierhout 1995</LINK>); one controlled clinical trial (which allocated by practice) (<LINK REF="STD-Grimshaw-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grimshaw 1998</LINK>); five controlled before and after studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bridgman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bridgman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coulter-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Coulter 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kammerling-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kammerling 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linnala-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Linnala 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Cathain-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Cathain 1995</LINK>) and one interrupted time series (<LINK REF="STD-Abu_x002d_Ramadan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Abu-Ramadan 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>Quality assessments</B> (<LINK REF="REF-Bero-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bero 2008</LINK>)<BR/>There were eleven randomised or controlled clinical trials. Randomisation concealment was done in four of these studies and was not clear in the remaining seven studies. Adequate follow up of providers (greater than 80%) was done in five studies. Blinded assessment of outcomes (protection against detection bias) was present in one study, was not clear in eight studies and not done in two studies. Baseline measurement was done and no substantial differences were present across study groups in three studies, baseline measurement was not done or it was unclear whether there were significant differences across study groups in six studies and there were baseline differences likely to undermine the post intervention differences in two studies. Reliable outcomes were only used in three studies. Protection against contamination was done for nine studies, not clear for one study and not done for one study. Contamination could have occurred within the Vierhout (<LINK REF="STD-Vierhout-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vierhout 1995</LINK>) study because participating general practitioners would have looked after both study and control patients. </P>
<P>There were five controlled before and after studies. Baseline measurement was reported and similar across study groups for one study, baseline measurement was not done or it was unclear whether there were significant differences across study groups in one study and there were baseline differences likely to undermine the post intervention differences in three studies. The characteristics of the second site were reported and similar for one study; it was not clear whether the characteristics of the second site were similar for the other studies. Follow up of providers was not specified in four studies (reported as NOT CLEAR) and not adequate (less than 80% follow up) in one study (reported as DONE). Blinded assessment of outcomes was done for three studies and not done for two studies. Reliable outcome measures were used in four studies and not clear in one study. All studies adequately protected against contamination. </P>
<P>There was one interrupted time series study. Abu Ramadan (<LINK REF="STD-Abu_x002d_Ramadan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Abu-Ramadan 2002</LINK>) monitored referral rates from general practitioners to an eye hospital monthly for 18 months prior and 30 months following the intervention. The intervention was multifaceted and included a new referral and reply sheet, new group and self training of staff and a monitoring system to evaluate and provide advice. The only data reported is the number of referrals, so it is impossible to assess if the data set is complete. There are sufficient points to include the study, but no formal test for trend. The intervention is apparently solely targeted at referrals, but because it is multifaceted, it is difficult to assess what aspect of the intervention is effective.<B>

<B>Other methodological characteristics</B>
<BR/>Proportion of eligible providers participating in the study <BR/>In eight studies, the majority of eligible providers participated in the study (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Banait-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Banait 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davidson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Davidson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Linnala-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Linnala 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK>). In two studies less than 50% of the eligible providers were included (<LINK REF="STD-Coulter-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Coulter 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grimshaw-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grimshaw 1998</LINK>). It was not clear what proportion of eligible providers participated in seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Abu_x002d_Ramadan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Abu-Ramadan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bridgman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bridgman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bertakis-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bertakis 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kammerling-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kammerling 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinnersley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kinnersley 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Cathain-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Cathain 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vierhout-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vierhout 1995</LINK>). Only 12 general practitioners were involved in Vierhout's study (<LINK REF="STD-Vierhout-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vierhout 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>Types of outcomes reported</B>
<BR/>Studies of professional educational interventions typically reported a combination of data relating to quantity of referrals, quality of referrals and other related outcomes (for example, impact on prescribing or subsequent hospital management). However, all but one (<LINK REF="STD-Linnala-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Linnala 2001</LINK>) of the studies of organisational and financial interventions only reported data on quantity of referrals. </P>
<P>
<B>Unit of analysis errors</B>
<BR/>In cluster randomised trials, providers or groups of providers are randomised but data is collected at the patient level. A fundamental assumption of the statistics used to analyse patient-randomised trials is that the outcome for an individual patient is completely unrelated to that for any other patient - they are said to be 'independent'. This assumption is violated, however, when cluster randomisation is adopted, because patients within any one cluster are more likely to respond in a similar manner. The primary consequence of adopting a cluster randomised design is that it is not as statistically efficient and has lower statistical power than a patient-randomised trial of equivalent size. Because of this lack of independence, sample sizes require to be inflated to adjust for the clustering effect, and special analytic techniques, such as multi-level modelling need to be adopted, unless simple cluster-level analysis is undertaken. If patient level analyses using standard statistical tests are used, the results are likely to be over precise with artificially extreme p-values and over-narrow confidence intervals, increasing the chances of spuriously significant findings and misleading conclusions. This is known as a unit of analysis error. </P>
<P>Unit of analysis errors were potentially present in six of the cluster randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Banait-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Banait 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davidson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Davidson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinnersley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kinnersley 1999</LINK>) and all but one (<LINK REF="STD-Bridgman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bridgman 2005</LINK>) of the controlled before and after studies. </P>

<B>Economic evaluation</B>
<BR/>Only two studies conducted an economic evaluation (<LINK REF="STD-Morrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>Professional educational interventions</B>
<BR/>Two studies evaluated passive dissemination of locally developed consensus referral guidelines and neither observed changes in quantity or quality of referrals (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grimshaw-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grimshaw 1998</LINK>). Jones and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1993</LINK>) evaluated the development and dissemination of management guidelines for dyspepsia. They hypothesised that the guidelines would lead to an increase in the use of endoscopy compared with barium meals, fewer investigations of younger patients and changes in prescribing patterns of H2-antagonists. They observed an increase in the number of referrals for upper gastrointestinal problems, referrals for endoscopy and upper gastrointestinal radiology investigations. Unfortunately, there was baseline imbalance for all of these outcomes which could undermine the post intervention differences. If differences in absolute change from baseline is considered, the direction of the observed effects support the authors' hypotheses. Unfortunately, because these outcomes also had unit of analysis errors which could not be re-analysed, the statistical significance of these findings is uncertain. There were statistically significant increases in prescribing costs for upper gastrointestinal drugs and ulcer healing drugs. The authors concluded that the guidelines 'acceptance and adoption was variable and their measured effects on some aspects of clinical behaviour were relatively weak and not necessarily associated with either decreased costs or improved quality of care' (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1993</LINK>). Grimshaw (<LINK REF="STD-Grimshaw-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grimshaw 1998</LINK>) evaluated postal dissemination of referral guidelines for four tracer conditions; he observed no significant changes in referral patterns or appropriateness of referral. </P>
<P>Five studies evaluated dissemination of referral guidelines with structured management sheets and observed improved pre-referral management of patients (<LINK REF="STD-Abu_x002d_Ramadan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Abu-Ramadan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK>). Abu-Ramadan (<LINK REF="STD-Abu_x002d_Ramadan-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Abu-Ramadan 2002</LINK>) used an interrupted time series design to evaluate appropriate referrals for treatment of eye conditions. Prior to the implementation of the intervention, it was reported that general practitioners were not dealing with eye injuries and referring them too frequently. This resulted in increased workload for the opthamologists at the hospital, which in turn led to time limited consultations and increased expenses. Training programs were provided to 40 primary care physicians to educate them about screening, emergency issues and appropriate referrals. The trained physicians were then distributed to various sites to facilitate the teaching of the other practitioners. A new referral reply sheet was used, eye medications were made available and a monitoring, evaluating and advice system set up. The study reports an over 50% reduction in the number of referrals to the eye hospital post intervention. However, it is very difficult to interpret which aspect of the intervention contributed most to the change in the number of referrals.</P>
<P>Bennett (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2001</LINK>) evaluated the use of a training video, checklist or both against a control group for referrals to specialists for otitis media with effusion (OME). There has been a wide range of general practice variation in referral rates for this condition and there are concerns about both over referral and under referral. There was no effect of any of the interventions on the referral rates. However, the authors analyzed data from 68% of the practices to determine 'quality of referrals'. They examined the percentage of children who at the time they were seen by a specialist, had a hearing loss greater than 20 dB in the better ear (an accepted indication for referral). In the group of physicians who saw the video and had access to the checklist, the percentage of appropriate referrals increased following the intervention; in all other groups including the control group it decreased.</P>
<P>Emslie and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Emslie-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 1993</LINK>) evaluated dissemination of guidelines for general practitioner management and referral of infertile couples in the Grampian region of Scotland. The guidelines were disseminated with an infertility management package which included a structured referral sheet. They observed improvements in: eliciting five items of sexual history (median improvement in post intervention absolute difference +16.0%); undertaking five pre referral examinations and investigations in the female partner (median improvement in post intervention absolute difference +24%); and undertaking two pre referral examinations and investigations in the male partner (median improvement in post intervention absolute difference +18%). There was also an increase in the number of referrals in which the male partner had been seen prior to referral (improvement in post intervention absolute difference +17%). Unfortunately there was a unit of analysis error and the statistical significance of these findings is unclear. Furthermore, data from study and control groups were collected by different methods; data about referrals made by study general practitioners including the structured management sheet with the referral letter were abstracted from the referral document, whereas data from study general practitioners not using the structured referral document and control general practitioners were collected by computer assisted telephone interview. </P>
<P>Morrison and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Morrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison 2001</LINK>) evaluated a similar intervention in the Greater Glasgow Health Board area. They observed no difference in referral rates per 1000 registered women aged 20 to 44. There was little evidence of inappropriate referral; only 1.1% of patients were referred after less than 12 months of infertility without an indication for early referral. There were improvements in five items of pre-referral investigations/advice, with a median improvement in post intervention absolute difference of + 7.3%, but none of the improvements in individual tests were statistically significant. However there was a statistically significant improvement in the proportion of couples receiving all appropriate investigations/advice (improvement in post intervention absolute difference +9.6%, Odds ratio 1.324; 95%CI 1.001 to 1.752, p=0.025). Following referral, hospitals commonly repeated investigations (100% of patients with a normal midluteal progesterone and 34.5% of patients with a normal semen analysis as reported in the referral letter received repeat investigations in hospital). There were no differences in the time from first appointment to establishing a management plan or in the proportion of couples with a management plan after one year of referral. There were 8% fewer pregnancies within 12 months in the study group. General practice and hospital costs were greater in the study group (unfortunately there was a unit of analysis error and the statistical significance of these findings is unclear). </P>
<P>Thomas and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK>) evaluated the effect of a guideline based open access investigation service for two common urological conditions (prostatism and microscopic haematuria). Participating general practitioners were offered a two-hour educational meeting and were mailed a guideline package (including a guideline booklet, quick reference flowchart and structured referral checklists). Under the existing system, patients usually attended an initial outpatient appointment and at least one further appointment for routine day case investigations. The open access investigation service allowed doctors to refer patients directly for day case investigations using the guidelines. Patients attending the open access service had all routine hospital-based investigations and a management plan determined at this single consultation. Thomas and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK>) hypothesised that the intervention would have little effect on general practitioners' referral patterns or patient outcomes, increase general practitioner compliance with referral guidelines, reduce patient waiting times, increase likelihood that patient would receive a management plan at first appointment and be discharged at 12 months. They observed that 48.2% of eligible patients were referred through the new system, freeing up the equivalent of 350 new outpatient slots over a 12 month period. There were no differences in referral patterns or case mix of the patients referred. Compliance with referral guidelines increased significantly. Waiting times for first appointments for the tracer conditions decreased (Ratio of means of waiting times 0.7 95% CI 0.55 to 0.89) although the post intervention difference is likely to underestimate the true effect of the intervention as there was a substantial fall in waiting times for control patients probably as a result of the freed up new outpatient appointments. There was also a reduction in waiting times for all urology patients of 11 weeks (95% CI 7.1 to 15 weeks). The probability of patients receiving a management decision at first appointment increased significantly (Odds ratio 5.8 95% CI 2.9 to 11.5). There was a non significant increase in the probability of discharge at 12 months (Odds ratio 1.7; 95% CI 0.92 to 3.27). The annual cost of the intervention was estimated to be 9555 (representing the total costs of guideline development and dissemination, however in many settings these costs would be subsumed into normal running costs). There were non-significant reductions in post referral general practice costs (for prostatism only) and the travel costs of patients attending health services. There were significant reductions in the mean hospital management costs per patient of 80.26 for prostatism and 44.79 for haematuria. </P>
<P>Two of the three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Banait-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Banait 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grimshaw-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grimshaw 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vierhout-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vierhout 1995</LINK>) evaluating secondary care provider-led educational activities observed improvements. Vierhout and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Vierhout-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Vierhout 1995</LINK>) evaluated the effects of joint monthly consultant-general practitioner workshops for patients with orthopaedic problems. There were no significant differences detected 12 months following recruitment in the number of patients receiving laboratory tests, radiography, medication or physiotherapy referrals. They did observe an increase in general practitioners' use of injection therapy (30.6% study versus 11.7% control p&lt;0.001), a reduction in subsequent referral to orthopaedic surgeons (35.4% study versus 68.0% p&lt;0.001) and an increase in proportion of patients disorder free after one year (35.4% study versus 23.7% control p&lt;0.05). </P>
<P>Banait and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Banait-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Banait 2000</LINK>) evaluated the effects of consultant-led, general practice-based, small group educational workshops to disseminate guidelines for management of dyspepsia. They hypothesised that the intervention would increase appropriateness of referral for endoscopy, increase diagnostic yield of endoscopies, reduce expenditure on acid suppressing drugs and increase serological Helicobacter Pylori testing. Study practices had higher endoscopy referral rates, increased appropriateness of referral, marginally higher diagnostic yields, higher serology testing rates. However there was no reduction in prescriptions for acid suppressing drugs. Unfortunately there was a unit of analysis error and the statistical significance of these findings is unclear.</P>
<P>Grimshaw (<LINK REF="STD-Grimshaw-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grimshaw 1998</LINK>) evaluated small group general practitioner-consultant workshops for four tracer conditions. He observed a significant increase in the number of tracer referrals following the intervention against the hypothesised direction of effect.</P>
<P>Grimshaw (<LINK REF="STD-Grimshaw-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Grimshaw 1998</LINK>) also found no significant improvements in referral following feedback on referral rates or discussion with an independent adviser.</P>

<B>Organisational interventions</B>
<BR/>Bertakis and colleagues<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Bertakis-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bertakis 1987</LINK>) evaluated primary care provision for new patients in an Internal Medicine Clinic compared with a Family Practice Clinic. They observed fewer referrals and a lower annual per patient cost of laboratory tests for those patients seen in family practice. The difference in referral patterns was still noted whether the target of the referral was non-primary care, obstetrics-gynecology, general surgery or dermatology. There were fewer primary care attendances, fewer acute care visits and fewer emergency room visits for patients receiving primary care from family physicians. However, the authors report that the difference in emergency room visits may be due to access issues.</P>
<P>O'Cathain and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Cathain-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Cathain 1995</LINK>) evaluated the effect of providing primary care based physiotherapy services. The aim of this service was to reduce orthopaedic referrals. They observed greater physiotherapy referrals, fewer orthopaedic referrals and fewer rheumatology referrals. Unfortunately, there was baseline imbalance for all of these outcomes which could undermine the post intervention differences. Furthermore, there was a unit of analysis error and the statistical significance of these findings is unclear. </P>
<P>Kinnersley and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Kinnersley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kinnersley 1999</LINK>) evaluated the effects of an in-house second opinion before outpatient referral. They found that approximately 70% of patients having an in-house second opinion were judged to need referral to the same hospital discipline immediately (63.0%) or within 12 months (9.8%). Patients referred in-house were more likely to report themselves as satisfied with their care.</P>
<P>Bridgman et al (<LINK REF="STD-Bridgman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bridgman 2005</LINK>) evaluated the effect of a 'slot system' designed to reduce waiting times by allocating a predetermined number of consultations to an orthopedic specialist. There were relative reductions in the monthly referral rate per 10,000 population of 22% in the intervention group and 10% in the control group. No significance levels were reported, but the authors state that multifactorial linear regression demonstrated a significant reduction in referrals from the intervention group. However, the intervention group had a 14% lower referral rate at baseline and it is unclear whether the analyses corrected for this. The imbalance raises concerns about the comparability of the intervention and control sites. </P>
<P>
<B>Financial interventions</B>
<BR/>One study evaluated the effects of changing remuneration systems. Davidson and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Davidson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Davidson 1992</LINK>) evaluated the effects of a change in remuneration system from a low cost fee-for-service system to either a high cost fee-for-service system or capitation-based budgetary system. They observed a reduction in the number of non-primary care referrals by providers receiving capitation based remuneration but little effect in providers receiving increased fee-for-service.<BR/> <BR/>Two studies evaluated the effects of the general practice fundholding scheme within the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Coulter-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Coulter 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kammerling-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kammerling 1996</LINK>). Coulter and colleague (<LINK REF="STD-Coulter-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Coulter 1993</LINK>) compared referral rates from 10 'first wave' fundholding with 6 non-fundholding practices during the preparatory year (phase 1) and first year following the introduction of the scheme (phase 2). Referral rates during the preparatory year were used to set the budget for the first year. Referral rates were higher in fundholding practices during phase 1 but fundholding and non-fundholding practices had similar referral rates during phase 2. In the original report, the authors state that fundholders referral rates had significantly increased, however there was a unit of analysis error and re-analysis at practice level using T-tests did not detect a significant difference. There was a significant increase in non-fundholders referral rates from the pre to post intervention period (median pre intervention 95.9 annual referrals per 1000 population versus median post intervention 117.2 annual referrals per 1000 population, Mann Whitney test p&lt;0.01). The authors also report referral rates for individual specialties. However, there was a unit of analysis error and insufficient data were presented to allow re-analysis of the data. Surender and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Surender-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Surender 1995</LINK>) published a follow up study presenting data for a third time period; however, by this time, four control practices had become fundholders or shadow-fundholders. </P>
<P>Kammerling and colleague (<LINK REF="STD-Kammerling-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kammerling 1996</LINK>) evaluated the effects of fundholding on orthopaedic referral rates one and two years following referral in ten fundholding and twenty-two non-fundholding practices. There were reductions in the fundholding practices compared to controls but these were modest at best. There was a unit of analysis error and the statistical significance of these findings is unclear. </P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Linnala-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Linnala 2001</LINK>) evaluated the effect of providing access to private specialists or a hospital based specialist at the same cost to the patient. Normally, the cost for the private specialist was double or more the cost of the hospital based specialist. At baseline the rates of referral to a specialist were higher in the experimental group (5.7% age sex adjusted) than in the control group (4.4% age sex adjusted), increasing to 6.8% on the experimental group and 5.5% in the control group. The percentage of referrals sent to private specialist by the GPs in the control group increased from 5.7% to 33.6% in the experimental group but decreased slightly (8.8% to 5.6%) in the control group suggesting that there was a change in the destination rather than number of referrals.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Despite the important role referral systems play in many health care systems, surprisingly few interventions have been rigorously evaluated. The majority of studies were conducted in the UK and the generalisability of these findings to other settings especially countries without a formal referral system is uncertain. As a result there is a limited evidence base to support policy decisions. Nevertheless it is possible to draw a number of preliminary conclusions. Passive dissemination of referral guidelines appears unlikely to lead to improvements in referral behaviour. This has implications for local or national referral guidelines; local dissemination and implementation activities appear necessary. The likely success of such local dissemination and implementation strategies appears to be increased if local secondary care providers are involved in educational activities. </P>
<P>Several studies observed improvements in the quality of referral when referral guidelines were disseminated with structured referral sheets which could be included in the referral letter. Structured referral sheets are checklists to be completed at the time of referral prompting the primary care physician about important elements of pre-referral investigation and management. In all three studies, the use of these structured referral sheets led to improved pre-referral investigation of patients ensuring that all appropriate examinations and investigations had been completed prior to referral. Whilst this is a potentially attractive intervention, general practices were only asked to use structured referral sheets for single conditions in each study and at best only about half of patients were referred with a completed sheet. There is a potential danger of overload if general practitioners are requested to use referral sheets for a wider range of conditions. In the future, this might be addressed by advances in informatics (for example, on-line booking systems with embedded referral management sheets) but at present, these interventions should probably be used sparingly for referrals for common important conditions. </P>
<P>In the Thomas study (<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK>), the guidelines and structured referral sheets were part of a complex intervention which included re-organisation of the secondary care system to streamline the referral process. The results of the study suggest that this was successful; patients were seen and had a management decision more rapidly. It is likely that this non-financial incentive was important for practitioners buy-in to the intervention. In contrast, in the Morrison study (<LINK REF="STD-Morrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morrison 2001</LINK>) there was little evidence that secondary care management was influenced by the introduction of referral guidelines and that many investigations were unnecessarily repeated. The authors suggest that this might act as a disincentive to practitioners to comply with guidelines. Thus, it appears important that dissemination and implementation strategies for referral guidelines and similar interventions should consider the process of care across the primary - secondary care interface ensuring that secondary care providers make appropriate changes in the content and organisation of care to optimise the efficiency of the referral system. </P>
<P>Relatively few organisational interventions have been evaluated. Enhancement of primary care capacity (for example, providing general practice based physiotherapy services) may be useful although the effects of on-site mental health workers in primary care were uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Bower-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bower 1999</LINK>). One study evaluating the effects of in-house second opinions prior to referral observed that approximately 30% of patients avoided subsequent referral. This is a potentially attractive intervention for primary care physicians working in group practices or multi-practice organisations (for example, independent practitioner associations in New Zealand, primary care groups or trusts within the UK) and should be explored further. In this update, one study with a slot system intervention was included; however it is unclear if this new system has any benefit and further research is required. </P>
<P>Four of the studies of financial interventions observed modest reductions in referral rates, although none of the studies attempted to evaluate quality of care. At this time there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the potential effects of financial interventions. There is a danger that financial interventions may lead to an unselective reduction in referral, both rational and non-rational. A study allowing primary care physicians to refer patients to private specialist appeared to increase referrals to private specialists with little or no effect on overall referral rates.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>The main weakness of the review is inevitably the limited number, methodological quality and limited evaluation of the identified studies. There have been relatively few evaluations of individual interventions, limiting ability to explore effect modifiers and confidence in the generalisability of the results to referrals for other conditions or in other settings. All of the studies had some methodological weaknesses, in particular, relatively few studies correctly analysed data from clustered randomised trials limiting statistical interpretation of the results. The studies demonstrate the complexity of undertaking research in this area. Interventions to improve referral may influence general practice management of non-referred patients, referral behaviour (number and quality of referrals), secondary care management of patients, the flow of patients through the referral system, patient outcomes and satisfaction, and resource use. No individual study managed to evaluate all these aspects. There is little evidence about the relationship between referral rates and appropriateness. As a result, it is difficult to interpret studies which only reported effects of interventions on referral rates. Only two studies undertook an economic evaluation despite the important impact of referral on resource use; furthermore the likely resources required for the different interventions would vary considerably. </P>
<P>For the update, we revisited the studies that were included in the original review for inclusion consideration, particularly the CBA designs. The decision was made by the EPOC review group not to include CBA studies with only one control and one intervention group. This resulted in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Krasnik-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Krasnik 1990</LINK>) being removed for the update.</P>
<P>Faulkner and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Faulkner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Faulkner 2003</LINK>) undertook a broader review of primary-care based service innovations on the quality and patterns of referral to specialist secondary care. Some studies evaluated interventions that did not primarily aim to change outpatient referral rates or improve outpatient referrals appropriateness. Nevertheless their conclusions were broadly similar about the limitations of the current evidence base.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Referral guidelines are more likely to be effective if local secondary care providers are involved in dissemination activities, structured referral sheets are used, secondary care management is responsive to changes in primary care behaviour as a result of the guidelines and if they reflect local circumstances and address local barriers. </P>
<P>There are a limited number of rigorous evaluations to base policy on. Nevertheless, passive dissemination of referral guidelines is unlikely to lead to improvements in referral practice. Referral guidelines are more likely to be effective if: local secondary care providers are involved in dissemination activities; structured referral sheets are used; secondary care management is responsive to changes in primary care behaviour as a result of the guidelines; and if they reflect local circumstances and address local barriers. There is little evidence on the effects of organisational interventions but the use of 'in-house' second opinion and other intermediate primary care based alternatives to outpatient referral appear promising. Financial interventions can change referral rates but their effect on quality of referral is uncertain. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research is needed to replicate the results of current evaluations (focusing on potentially effective interventions such as secondary care provider-led educational activities, structured referral management sheets, enhancement of primary care and in-house second opinions). Further research is also needed to explore a wide range of available interventions which do not appear to have been evaluated to date. In particular, it would be worth evaluating other intermediate primary-care based referral systems. These evaluations should evaluate the effects of the intervention on the quantity and quality of referrals and include an economic evaluation.</P>
