<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-30 09:45:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The number of red blood cells falls after birth in preterm infants due to the natural breakdown of erythrocytes and blood letting. Low levels of erythropoietin (EPO), a substance in the blood that stimulates red blood cell production in preterm infants, provide a rationale for the use of EPO to prevent or treat anaemia. A total of 262 infants born preterm have been enrolled in two studies of early versus late administration of EPO to prevent blood transfusions. There were no demonstrable benefits of early versus late administration of EPO with regards to reduction in the use of red blood cell transfusions, number of transfusions, the amount of red cells transfused or number of donor exposures per infant. However, the use of early EPO compared with late EPO administration increases the risk of retinopathy of prematurity, a serious complication in babies born before term. Currently, there is a lack of evidence that either treatment confers any substantial benefits with regard to any donor blood exposure, as many infants enrolled in both studies were exposed to donor blood prior to study entry, and early EPO increases the risk of retinopathy of prematurity. Neither early nor late administration of EPO is recommended.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-30 09:44:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No new trials were identified in March of 2012. Two high quality randomised double-blind controlled studies enrolling 262 infants were identified. A non-significant reduction in the 'Use of one or more RBC transfusions' [two studies 262 infants; typical RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.06); typical RD -0.07 (95% CI -0.18 to 0.04; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% for both RR and RD] favouring early EPO was noted. Early EPO administration resulted in a non-significant reduction in the "number of transfusions per infant" compared with late EPO [typical MD - 0.32 (95% CI -0.92 to 0.29)]. There was no significant reduction in total volume of blood transfused per infant or in the number of donors to whom the infant was exposed. Early EPO led to a significant increase in the risk of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (all stages) [two studies, 191 infants; typical RR 1.40 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.86); typical RD 0.16 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.29); NNTH 6 (95% CI 3 to 33)]. There was high heterogeneity for this outcome (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 86% for RR and 81% for RD). Both studies (191 infants) reported on ROP stage <U>&gt;</U> 3. No statistically significant increase in risk was noted [typical RR 1.56 (95% CI 0.71 to 3.41); typical RD 0.05 (-0.04 to 0.14)] There was no heterogeneity for this outcome (0% for both RR and RD). No other important favourable or adverse neonatal outcomes or side effects were reported.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-08-30 09:45:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The haemoglobin concentration falls to minimal levels of 11 g/dL in term infants by eight to 12 weeks of age and 7.0 to 10.0 g/dL in preterm infants by six weeks of age (<LINK REF="REF-Stockman-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockman 1978</LINK>). This process is called physiologic anaemia of infancy (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 1986</LINK>). In very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, the haematocrit falls to approximately 24% in infants weighing 1.0 to 1.5 kg and to 21% in infants weighing less than 1.0 kg at birth (<LINK REF="REF-Stockman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockman 1986</LINK>). In extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants, this decline in haematocrit is not "physiologic", as it is associated with clinical findings that prompt red blood cell transfusions. The diagnostic accuracy of different clinical signs and laboratory findings has not been studied. It is still unknown how low haematocrit levels can fall before clinical signs of anaemia of prematurity occur and what is the minimal haematocrit level acceptable in infants requiring supplemental oxygen (<LINK REF="REF-Ohls-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohls 2002</LINK>). Nevertheless, "top-up" transfusions to treat low haemoglobin or low haematocrit levels are frequently used. As many as 80% of VLBW infants and 95% of ELBW infants receive blood transfusions during their hospitalisations (<LINK REF="REF-Widness-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widness 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-08-30 09:45:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Erythropoietin (EPO) and iron effectively stimulate erythropoiesis. Plasma erythropoietin levels in neonates are lower than those for older children and adults. Brown and colleagues reported that, between days two and 30 of life, the mean EPO concentration was 10 mLU/mL, as compared to 15 mLU/mL in concurrently studied adults (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1983</LINK>). A low plasma EPO level is a key reason that nadir haematocrit values of preterm infants are lower than those of term infants (<LINK REF="REF-Stockman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dallman-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dallman 1981</LINK>). Low plasma EPO levels provide a rationale for use of EPO in the prevention or treatment of anaemia of prematurity. Studies in newborn monkeys and sheep have demonstrated that neonates have a large volume of distribution and more rapid elimination of EPO, necessitating the use of higher doses than required for adults (<LINK REF="REF-Ohls-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohls 2000</LINK>). A systematic review of EPO administration noted a wide range of doses used, from 90 to 1400 IU/kg/week (<LINK REF="REF-Kotto_x002d_Kome-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotto-Kome 2004</LINK>). Side effects reported in adults include hypertension, bone pain, rash and rarely seizures. Only transient neutropenia has been reported in neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Ohls-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohls 2000</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-08-30 10:17:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary goal of EPO therapy is to reduce transfusions. Most transfusions are given during the first three to four weeks of life. The larger or stable preterm infants, who respond best to EPO, receive few transfusions. ELBW infants, who are sick and have the greatest need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions shortly after birth, have not consistently responded to EPO. This suggests that EPO is a more effective erythropoietic stimulator in more mature neonates. ELBW neonates are more likely to need transfusions even if their erythropoiesis is stimulated (<LINK REF="REF-Kotto_x002d_Kome-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotto-Kome 2004</LINK>). In addition, ELBW neonates have a smaller blood volume and the relatively larger phlebotomy volumes that are required during hospital stay often necessitate "early" transfusions. In contrast "late" transfusions are more often given because of anaemia of prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 2002</LINK>). Most preterm infants who require blood transfusions will receive their first transfusion in the first two weeks of life (<LINK REF="REF-Zipursky-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zipursky 2000</LINK>). Reducing the number of RBC transfusions reduces the risk of transmission of viral infections and may reduce costs. Frequent RBC transfusions may be associated with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (<LINK REF="REF-Hesse-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hesse 1997</LINK>) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).</P>
<P>Preterm infants need iron for erythropoiesis. As neonatal blood volume expands with rapid growth, infants produce large amounts of haemoglobin. Several studies have observed a decrease in serum ferritin concentration - an indication of iron deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Finch-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finch 1982</LINK>) - during EPO treatment. The use of higher, more effective doses of EPO might be expected to be particularly likely to increase iron demand and the risk of iron deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Genen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Genen 2004</LINK>). Iron supplementation during EPO treatment has been observed to reduce the risk of the development of iron deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Shannon-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shannon 1995</LINK>). The range of iron doses used in EPO treated infants is between 1 mg/kg/day to 10 mg/kg/day (<LINK REF="REF-Kotto_x002d_Kome-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotto-Kome 2004</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-08-30 10:17:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The efficacy of EPO in anaemia of prematurity has recently been systematically reviewed (<LINK REF="REF-Vamvakas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vamvakas 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kotto_x002d_Kome-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotto-Kome 2004</LINK>). Vamvakas et al concluded that there is extreme variation in the results, and until this variation is better understood, it is too early to recommend EPO as standard treatment for the anaemia of prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-Vamvakas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vamvakas 2001</LINK>). Garcia et al concluded that administering EPO to VLBW neonates can result in a modest reduction in late erythrocyte transfusions and that this effect is dependent on the dose of EPO used (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 2002</LINK>). Kotto-Kome et al concluded that if EPO is begun in the first week of life, a moderate reduction can be expected in the proportion of VLBW neonates transfused. The reduction is less significant for early transfusion than for late transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Kotto_x002d_Kome-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotto-Kome 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Additional studies of EPO in preterm or LBW infants have been published since the reviews noted above, justifying additional reviews. The cut-off of less than eight days of age for early and <U>&gt;</U> eight days for late treatment with EPO, although somewhat arbitrary, was chosen based on previously published meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kotto_x002d_Kome-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotto-Kome 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review compares early administration of EPO (starting in infants less than eight days of age) versus late administration of EPO (starting <U>&gt;</U> eight days). The main rationale for this review was to evaluate whether early treatment with EPO in preterm infants is more effective than late treatment to decrease exposure to RBC transfusion and the total transfusions required. We performed a systematic review to compare all available studies where EPO was begun during first week of life versus EPO started after the first week of life to assess the effect on any and total number of erythrocyte transfusions.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-08-30 10:17:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the original review, the quality of included trials was evaluated independently by the review authors, using the following criteria:<BR/>Blinding of randomisation; Blinding of intervention; Blinding of outcome measure assessment; Completeness of follow-up. There are three potential answers to these questions yes, no, cannot tell. This information was added to the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>For the update in 2012, the following issues were evaluated and entered into the 'Risk of bias' table.</P>
<P>
<B>Selection bias</B> (random sequence generation and allocation concealment).</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the risk of selection bias as:</P>
<P>
<I>Random sequence generation</I>
</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);<BR/>
<BR/>High risk - inadequate (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);<BR/>
<BR/>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>
<I>Allocation concealment</I>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the risk of bias regarding allocation concealment as:</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);<BR/>
<BR/>High risk - inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);<BR/>
<BR/>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided</P>
<P>
<B>Performance bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. (As our study population consisted of neonates they would all be blinded to the study intervention).</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate for personnel (a placebo that could not be distinguished from the active drug was used in the control group);</P>
<P>High risk - inadequate - personnel aware of group assignment;</P>
<P>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>
<B>Detection bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. (As our study population consisted of neonates they would all be blinded to the study intervention). Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised the methods used with regards to detection bias as:</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate; follow-up was performed with assessors blinded to group assignment;<BR/>
<BR/>High risk - inadequate; assessors at follow-up were aware of group assignment;<BR/>
<BR/>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided</P>
<P>
<B>Attrition bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods with respect to the risk attrition bias as:<BR/>
<BR/>Low risk - adequate (&lt; 10% missing data);<BR/>
<BR/>High risk - inadequate (&gt; 10% missing data);<BR/>
<BR/>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>
<P>
<B>Reporting bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the risk of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</P>
<P>High risk - inadequate (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</P>
<P>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided (the study protocol was not available).</P>
<P>
<B>Other bias</B>
</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:<BR/>
<BR/>Low risk - no concerns of other bias raised;<BR/>
<BR/>High risk - concerns raised about multiple looks at the data with the results made known to the investigators, difference in number of patients enrolled in abstract and final publications of the paper;<BR/>
<BR/>Unclear - concerns raised about potential sources of bias that could not be verified by contacting the authors.</P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.<BR/>
</P>
<P>For the original review, independent quality assessments were conducted by two review authors (SA, AO), who were not blinded to authors, institution or journal of publication.</P>
<P>The update in 2012 was conducted by one author (AO).</P>

<UL>
<LI>Objective: To evaluate whether early treatment (day two to three of life) with EPO in preterm infants with birthweight &lt; 1250 g 1) decreases the number of transfusions during the first two weeks of life; and 2) is more effective than late treatment (day 15) to decrease the total transfusion requirement.</LI>
<LI>Population: Infants with a birthweight &lt; 1250 g and a gestational age &lt; 32 weeks. Infants were excluded if they had major congenital malformations, chromosomal anomalies, haemolytic and/or haemorrhagic disease, intrauterine infections, systemic hypertension, and neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1.5x10<SUP>9</SUP>/L). No infant was excluded based on severity of illness.</LI>
<LI>Intervention: In the early EPO group, infants received EPO 1250 IU/kg/week (high dose) intravenously (iv) from day two to day 14 of life; in the late EPO group, infants received placebo during this time period. Subsequently, all infants received EPO 750 IU/kg/week (high dose) subcutaneously (sc) for six additional weeks. All infants were given oral iron 6 mg/kg/day as ferrous sulphate (high dose), starting as soon as enteral feedings were initiated and continuing during the entire treatment period as well as folic acid.</LI>
<LI>Outcomes assessed: Number of transfusions during the first two weeks of life and the total transfusion requirement per infant. Other outcomes included use of one ore more RBC transfusions, mortality during hospital stay, intraventricular haemorrhage (grade III/IV), weight gain, ROP (during the study period and among infants examined during the first year of life) and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).</LI>

</P>
<UL>
<LI>Objective: To investigate whether EPO reduces the need for transfusion in ELBW infants and to determine the optimal time for treatment.</LI>
<LI>Population: Infants with a birthweight between 500 to 999 g were eligible. Infants were excluded prior to randomisation if they had cyanotic heart disease, major congenital malformation requiring surgery, mother had received an investigational drug during pregnancy, gestational age &gt; 30 completed weeks or lack of consent.</LI>
<LI>Intervention: In the early EPO group infants received 750 IU/kg/week of EPO (high dose) from the first week of life for nine weeks. In the late EPO group, infants received the same treatment three weeks later (high dose). Treatment in both groups continued until days 65 to 68 of life. EPO was given iv in both groups as long as the infant had an iv line in place and sc thereafter. The late EPO group (until EPO was given) received sham-injections. Enteral iron 3 mg/kg was given to all infants from days three to five (low dose) and was increased at days 12 to 14 to 6 mg/kg/day (high dose) and to 9 mg/kg/day at days 24 to 26 of life (high dose).</LI>
<LI>Outcomes assessed: The primary outcome was no transfusion and haematocrit levels never below 30%. Other outcomes included use of one ore more RBC transfusions, mean number of transfusions per infant, volume of red cells transfused (ml/kg/day), mortality during hospital stay, NEC, IVH (grade III/IV), PVL, ROP, BPD, length of hospital stay).</LI>

<P>Neither of the two trials provided information on how the random sequence was generated. Both included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Donato-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donato 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2002</LINK>) were randomised double-blind controlled studies with concealed allocation. Donato et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Donato-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donato 2000</LINK>) report that infants were assigned to one of the two groups at birth through a central randomisation process. Placebo and EPO were indistinguishable before and after reconstitution. Parents, investigators, and nurses were unaware of each patient's treatment group. Maier et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2002</LINK>) concealed the allocation by means of numbered sealed envelopes. To assure blinding and to avoid placebo injections, sham injections were given to the late EPO group prior to starting treatment with EPO. In both studies, outcomes were assessed by individuals unaware of treatment assignment. Sample size calculations were performed in both studies. Six infants with significant protocol violations were excluded from the study by Donato et al (<LINK REF="STD-Donato-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donato 2000</LINK>). The group assignment was not reported, but it is likely that the excluded infants were equally distributed between the groups as 57 infants remained in each group. In the study by Maier et al (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2002</LINK>), no infant was withdrawn from the early EPO and late EPO groups.

<BR/>In the study by Donato (<LINK REF="STD-Donato-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donato 2000</LINK>), the MD for weight gain during the entire study period was 6.0 g (95% CI -137.37 to 149.37) comparing the early EPO group to the late EPO group. In the study by Maier (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2002</LINK>), the median weight gain was 890 g in the early EPO group and 872 g in the late EPO group during the first nine weeks of life.

<BR/>Donato (<LINK REF="STD-Donato-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donato 2000</LINK>) reported on thrombocytosis (platelet count &gt; 500 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L) in 114 infants. The study did not show a significant effect [RR 1.06 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.84); RD 0.02 (95% CI -0.15 to 0.19)].</P>
<P>In the study by Maier (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2002</LINK>) the median increase in platelet count during the study was 118 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L in the early EPO group, 155x10<SUP>9</SUP>/L in the late EPO group and 186 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L in the control group.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-08-30 09:53:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main objective of this review was to assess whether early versus late treatment with EPO would reduce the need for one or more red blood cell transfusions. Two high quality placebo-controlled, multicentre trials conducted in Argentina and in four European countries were identified for this review. These two studies included a total of 262 preterm infants with very low/extremely low birth weight, who were enrolled at approximately three days of age. The dose of EPO varied from 750 to 1250 IU/kg/week (high dose). All infants received supplemental iron (high dose). Both studies used well defined, although not identical, criteria for red blood cell transfusions (see Additional table; <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> Transfusion guidelines). In the study by Maier et al (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2002</LINK>), more than 30% of the enrolled infants had received red blood transfusions prior to study entry. In the study by Donato et al (<LINK REF="STD-Donato-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donato 2000</LINK>), 14% had received red blood cell transfusions prior to enrolment.</P>
<P>Early treatment with EPO did not significantly reduce the risk for an infant of receiving a red blood cell transfusion compared with late treatment. There was no statistically significant heterogeneity for this or any of the other effectiveness outcomes of interest, justifying the combination of the results from the two studies when possible. There was no significant reduction in the number of transfusions per infant nor in the number of donors to whom the infant was exposed.</P>
<P>The results for other secondary outcomes included in this review reached statistical significance only for periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). PVL was reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2002</LINK>). There was a statistically significant reduction for risk difference (RD) but not for risk ratio (RR) (there was no case of PVL in the early EPO group). We consider this finding of borderline statistical significance.<BR/>
</P>
<P>A total of 191 infants of 268 infants enrolled were assessed for ROP (all stages, and stage <U>&gt;</U> 3). The lack of outcome ascertainment in a large number of infants is of concern. There was a statistically significant increased risk of ROP (any stage reported). The typical RR was 1.45 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.95), the typical RD was 0.18 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.31) and the number needed to harm (NNTH) was six (95% CI 3 to 20). There was statistically significant (high) heterogeneity for this outcome. The heterogeneity is likely at least in part due to differences in the rates of ROP and the different times in the life of the infants when ROP was assessed. There were no striking differences in the dose of EPO or iron used in the two studies. The transfusion guidelines were most strict in the study by Donato et al (<LINK REF="STD-Donato-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donato 2000</LINK>). It is possible that there were differences in many aspects of care between Argentina and the four countries enrolling infants in Europe. These differences may have contributed to the differences in rates of ROP. The outcome of ROP (stage <U>&gt;</U> 3) was assessed in the same population as all stages of ROP. The meta-analysis did not find a significant effect [typical RR 1.56 (95% CI 0.71 to 3.41); typical RD 0.05 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.14)]. This result was consistent across studies. There was no heterogeneity for this outcome. The increased risk of ROP is of concern. The results are similar to the Cochrane review of "Early erythropoietin for preventing red blood cell transfusion in preterm and/or low birth weight infants" (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2006</LINK>) (updated in 2012). No other important neonatal adverse outcomes or side effects were noted.</P>
<P>The results of this systematic review should be considered in conjunction with our other two Cochrane reviews (both updated in 2012) that have been conducted "Early erythropoietin for preventing red blood cell transfusion in preterm and/or low birth weight infants" (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2006</LINK>) and "Late erythropoietin for preventing red blood cell transfusion in preterm and/or low birth weight infants" (<LINK REF="REF-Aher-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aher 2006a</LINK>). In our review of "Early erythropoietin for preventing red blood cell transfusion in preterm and/or low birth weight infants" (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2006</LINK>), we noted an increased risk of ROP. Based on current evidence, an increased risk of developing ROP with early EPO cannot be excluded. For detailed discussion of the potential association with ROP and EPO, please refer to the Cochrane review of "Early erythropoietin for preventing red blood cell transfusion in preterm and/or low birth weight infants" (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2006</LINK>) that was updated in 2012.</P>
<P>Other systematic reviews of EPO do not address the issue of early versus late treatment. The trials included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Donato-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donato 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2002</LINK>) were not included in the meta-analyses by Vamvakas et al (<LINK REF="REF-Vamvakas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vamvakas 2001</LINK>) and Garcia et al (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 2002</LINK>). Kotto-Kome et al (<LINK REF="REF-Kotto_x002d_Kome-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotto-Kome 2004</LINK>) included both trials in their meta-analysis of the effect of early EPO on early and late erythrocyte transfusions, but did not compare the effectiveness of early versus late EPO administration. None of these meta-analyses included analyses on the incidence of ROP.</P>
<P>Early treatment with EPO did not confer any major benefits compared with late EPO treatment. The major obstacle to reduce any donor exposure during the hospital stay is that as many as one third of these infants will require a red blood cell transfusion prior to the initiation of treatment with EPO. In the study by Maier et al (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2002</LINK>), 12 of the 14 centres used satellite packs of the original red cell pack to reduce donor exposure in both groups. The use of satellite packs and conservative transfusion guidelines reduces the exposure to multiple donors during the hospitalisation for preterm infants.</P>
<P>It is unlikely that long-acting EPO [Aranesp (Darbepopoietin alfa, Amgen)] would confer any benefits with regards to any donor exposure, but could reduce the number of injections the infant would require (<LINK REF="REF-Ohls-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohls 2004</LINK>). To date, only a dose finding trial has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Warwood-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warwood 2005</LINK>). The authors concluded, based on pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic findings, that darbepoetin dosing in neonates would require a higher unit dose/kg and a shorter dosing interval than are generally used for anaemic adults (<LINK REF="REF-Warwood-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warwood 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Administration of EPO could potentially have a neuroprotective effect in preterm infants, especially in infants with perinatal asphyxia (<LINK REF="REF-Dame-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dame 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Juul-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juul 2002</LINK>). This aspect of EPO use will be systematically reviewed separately (<LINK REF="REF-Yu-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu 2010</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-08-30 10:17:43 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Currently there is a lack of evidence that early EPO confers any substantial benefits compared with late administration of EPO, particularly with regard to any donor blood exposure, as a large proportion of infants enrolled in both studies were exposed to donor blood prior to study entry. There is a concern of an increased risk of ROP following early administration of EPO, and such treatment is not recommended.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-08-30 09:53:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The impact of either early or late administration of EPO on 'any donor exposure' is likely to be minimal, as many infants would have been exposed to donor blood during the first few days of life, when they are most likely to receive a red blood cell transfusion; a time period during which EPO treatment could not possibly prevent donor exposure. Any ongoing study of EPO should carefully monitor the incidence of ROP and data/safety monitoring committees should be informed of its occurrence. Further studies to compare early versus late administration of EPO are not justified. Research should focus on reducing blood letting and the use of satellite packs from the same donor, should red blood cell transfusions be necessary.</P>

<P>Infants on assisted ventilation or &gt; 40% of inspired oxygen were not transfused unless Hct dropped below 0.40. Spontaneously breathing infants were not transfused unless Hct dropped below 0.35 during the first 2 weeks of life, 0.30 during the 3rd to 4th weeks, and 0.25 thereafter. Transfusion was allowed when life threatening anaemia or hypovolaemia was diagnosed by the treating neonatologist, or surgery was planned. Twelve of the 14 centres used satellite packs of the original red cell pack to reduce donor exposure. The amount of packed red cells transfused was not reported.<BR/>
