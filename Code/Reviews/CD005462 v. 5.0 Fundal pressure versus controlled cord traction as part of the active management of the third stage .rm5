<P>Controlled cord traction to deliver the placenta should remain as part of the active management of third stage of labour.</P>
<P>The third stage of labour is the period from the birth of the baby until delivery of the placenta. There are two basic interventions to help to deliver the placenta as part of the active management of the third stage of labour: fundal pressure or controlled cord traction. Fundal pressure (Crede manoeuvre) involves placing one hand on the top of the uterus (uterine fundus) and squeezing it between the thumb and other fingers to help placental separation and delivery. Controlled cord traction involves traction on the umbilical cord while maintaining counter-pressure upwards by placing a hand on the lower abdomen. Also, controlled cord traction should only follow signs of placental separation. Both these interventions, if not performed correctly, may have adverse outcomes including pain, haemorrhage and inversion of the uterus. Two other methods of placenta delivery are not advised because they may be dangerous: these are uterine manipulation and cord traction. The review found no randomised controlled trials to assess the use of fundal pressure as part of the active management of the third stage of labour. Therefore, controlled cord traction should continue as the method of placental delivery in the active management of third stage of labour.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-09-17 11:09:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The third stage of labour is the period from the birth of the baby until delivery of the placenta. After the birth of the baby and the cessation of umbilical cord pulsation, the placenta separates from the uterine wall through the sponge lining of the decidua spongiosa and is delivered through the birth canal (<LINK REF="REF-Burnett-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burnett 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Inch-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inch 1985</LINK>). Separation of the placenta usually begins after the birth of the baby, as a result of uterine retraction or with the first contractions of the empty uterus. The classical signs of placental separation are: alteration of the form and size of the uterus, blood loss, descent and lengthening of the umbilical cord and the elevation of the uterine fundus (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2003</LINK>). All signs are not always as apparent as this. The only definite sign of separation is when the placenta is expelled through the birth canal. There are a number of techniques to deliver the placenta once it has separated. According to popular opinion, two are not advised because they may be dangerous: (1) uterine manipulation, and (2) traction of the umbilical cord. Uterine manipulation may interrupt the process of placental detachment, and can cause pain, haemorrhage and uterine inversion. Traction of the umbilical cord, if undertaken before placental separation and without counter pressure, or without prior administration of a uterotonic drug, may also cause pain, haemorrhage or uterine inversion (<LINK REF="REF-K_x00e4_ser-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Käser 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipitz-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipitz 1988</LINK>). <I>
<U>

</I>
<BR/>The estimated number of maternal deaths in 2000 for the world was 529,000 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). Many of these deaths resulted from complications of the third stage of labour. The pregnancy-related (direct) maternal mortality rate in the United States is approximately seven to 10 women per 100,000 live births. National statistics suggest that approximately 8% of these deaths are caused by postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1996</LINK>). In the developing world, maternal deaths due to PPH range from 5.9% to 48.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2006</LINK>). The death of these mothers has serious implications for the newborn and any other surviving children.</P>
<P>PPH is defined as an estimated maternal blood loss of 500 ml or more within 24 hours of delivery. Most healthy women can tolerate 500 to 1000 ml blood loss without serious morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Bais-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bais 2004</LINK>). The degree of blood loss associated with placental separation and delivery depends on how effectively the uterine muscles contract around the placental bed during and after separation, and whether there is any interference such as pulling on the cord prior to placental separation. The degree of blood loss will also be associated with the woman's blood clotting profile. The absolute timing for delivery of the placenta, without evidence of significant bleeding, remains unclear, but a period of about 10 minutes has been identified with active management of third stage (<LINK REF="REF-G_x00fc_lmezoglu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gülmezoglu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 2000</LINK>). The most important aim of the management of the third stage of labour is to avoid large amounts of blood loss (<LINK REF="REF-K_x00e4_ser-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Käser 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence shows that management of the third stage can directly influence important maternal outcomes such as blood loss, and the need for manual removal of the placenta (<LINK REF="REF-Brucker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brucker 2001</LINK>). The third stage of labour can be managed actively or expectantly. For the mother, the third stage of labour is potentially the most hazardous part of childbirth, mainly because of the risk of PPH. As a measure to prevent PPH, active management has been widely adopted. Active management generally involves all three of the following interventions: routine prophylactic administration of a uterotonic agent, early cord clamping and controlled cord traction (<LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1998</LINK>). Controlled cord traction involves traction on the cord while maintaining counter-pressure upwards on the lower segment of the uterus, using a hand placed on the lower abdomen. The Crede manoeuvre for fundal pressure is a method to separate the placenta after delivery. One hand is placed on the uterine fundus and the uterus squeezed between the thumb and other fingers to facilitate placental separation and expel the placenta through the birth canal (<LINK REF="REF-Brandt-1933" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandt 1933</LINK>). However, this manoeuvre may produce great pain, so some do not recommend it (<LINK REF="REF-Beisher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beisher 2000</LINK>). The length of third stage using this method is usually between five and 15 minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Beisher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beisher 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>An alternative to active management of the third stage of labour is expectant management (sometimes called conservative or physiological management). In expectant management, uterotonic drugs are not given prophylactically, the cord is neither clamped nor cut early, nor is controlled cord traction performed and the placenta is expelled by maternal effort in its own time. The length of expectant management is about 15 to 30 minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Usandizaga-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Usandizaga 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Faulty management of the third stage of labour may increase the risk of inversion of the uterus (<LINK REF="REF-Miras-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miras 2002</LINK>). Whether cord traction is free of danger, as has been claimed in recent years, remains unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Meinert--1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meinert 1984</LINK>). However, the cord traction method in the third stage of labour could be dangerous in spite of other advantages (<LINK REF="REF-Sterigev-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterigev 1979</LINK>), whereas controlled cord traction is the standard third component of the active management of third stage (<LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 2000</LINK>). Whether fundal pressure might be a more effective third component of the active management of third stage of labour merits investigation. </P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>There are currently no randomised, or quasi-randomised, controlled trials comparing fundal pressure with controlled cord traction as part of the active management of the third stage of labour. One trial, which probably came closest to the research question, assessed (following intramuscular oxytocic administration) the use of controlled cord traction compared with maternal effort and fundal pressure only if maternal effort was unsuccessful (<LINK REF="STD-Bonham-1963" TYPE="STUDY">Bonham 1963</LINK>). This trial showed controlled cord traction associated with less blood loss. </P>
<P>In order to consider the benefits and risks of fundal pressure compared with controlled cord traction as part of the active management of third stage, a randomised controlled trial comparing both interventions would need to be conducted. However, it may not be a research priority given the suggested disadvantages of Crede fundal pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Lipitz-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipitz 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miras-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miras 2002</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The evidence shows there are no randomised controlled trials to support the use of fundal pressure rather than controlled cord traction as part of the active management of the third stage of labour. Therefore, controlled cord traction should continue as the method of placental delivery in the active management of third stage of labour. <B>
