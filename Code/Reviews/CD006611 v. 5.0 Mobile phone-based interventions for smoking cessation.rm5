<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-04-07 10:47:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Robyn A Whittaker">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Mobile phones are being used more to support healthy lifestyles. We wanted to know whether they could be used to support people to stop smoking. We reviewed the evidence on the effect of quit smoking programmes delivered by mobile phones to people who want to stop smoking.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found 12 studies up to April 2015 that could be included. These studies included 11,885 people who were monitored to see if they managed to quit smoking and if they were still quit six months later.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>When the information from all the studies were combined, smokers who received the support programmes were around 1.7 times more likely to stay quit than smokers who did not receive the programmes (9.3% quit with programmes compared with 5.6% quit with no programmes). Most of the studies were of programmes relying mainly on text messages.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality and completeness of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We are moderately confident in the findings of this review. However, all studies took place in high-income countries and mainly used text messages, so these results may not hold true in people from poorer countries or with other types of mobile phone programmes. There were no published trials of smartphone 'apps' to help people stop smoking that met the inclusion criteria.</P>

<P>Access to mobile phones continues to increase exponentially globally, outstripping access to fixed telephone lines, fixed computers and the Internet. Mobile phones are an appropriate and effective option for the delivery of smoking cessation support in some contexts.

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-04-07 11:21:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Robyn A Whittaker">
<P>For the most recent update, we searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register in April 2015. We also searched the UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio for current projects in the UK, and the ClinicalTrials.gov register for ongoing or recently completed studies. We searched through the reference lists of identified studies and attempted to contact the authors of ongoing studies. We applied no restrictions on language or publication date.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-04-07 11:21:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Robyn A Whittaker">
<P>We included randomised or quasi-randomised trials. Participants were smokers of any age who wanted to quit. Studies were those examining any type of mobile phone-based intervention for smoking cessation. This included any intervention aimed at mobile phone users, based around delivery via mobile phone, and using any functions or applications that can be used or sent via a mobile phone.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-04-07 10:45:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Robyn A Whittaker">
<P>Review authors extracted information on risk of bias and methodological details using a standardised form. We considered participants who dropped out of the trials or were lost to follow-up to be smoking. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each included study. Meta-analysis of the included studies used the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method. Where meta-analysis was not possible, we presented a narrative summary and descriptive statistics.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-07 10:46:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Robyn A Whittaker">
<P>This updated search identified 12 studies with six-month smoking cessation outcomes, including seven studies completed since the previous review. The interventions were predominantly text messaging-based, although several paired text messaging with in-person visits or initial assessments. Two studies gave pre-paid mobile phones to low-income human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive populations - one solely for phone counselling, the other also included text messaging. One study used text messages to link to video messages. Control programmes varied widely. Studies were pooled according to outcomes - some providing measures of continuous abstinence or repeated measures of point prevalence; others only providing 7-day point prevalence abstinence. All 12 studies pooled using their most rigorous 26-week measures of abstinence provided an RR of 1.67 (95% CI 1.46 to 1.90; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 59%). Six studies verified quitting biochemically at six months (RR 1.83; 95% CI 1.54 to 2.19).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-04-07 10:46:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Robyn A Whittaker">
<P>The current evidence supports a beneficial impact of mobile phone-based smoking cessation interventions on six-month cessation outcomes. While all studies were good quality, the fact that those studies with biochemical verification of quitting status demonstrated an even higher chance of quitting further supports the positive findings. However, it should be noted that most included studies were of text message interventions in high-income countries with good tobacco control policies. Therefore, caution should be taken in generalising these results outside of this type of intervention and context.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-04-07 10:47:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Robyn A Whittaker">
<P>This is the second update of a review of the evidence on the effectiveness of mobile phone-delivered smoking cessation support. Since the previous review, the use of mobile phones globally has continued to increase at an exponential rate, far exceeding access to the Internet or fixed telephone lines in many regions. The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) estimated that there were more than seven billion mobile phone subscriptions in 2015; approximately 96.8 per 100 inhabitants, ranging from 120.6/100 in high-income countries to 91.8/100 in low-income countries. Access to mobile broadband is also growing fast, with an estimated 47% of the world's population subscribing to mobile broadband, compared with the 29% who have fixed broadband subscriptions (<LINK REF="REF-ITU-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">ITU 2015</LINK>). The smartphone (mobile phone with a computer operating system) is fast becoming the computer of choice, or at least the most accessible computer, in many countries. It is reported that about 45% of global mobile phone subscriptions are associated with smartphones and that, with 75% of new sales of mobile phones being smartphones, this will continue to increase (<LINK REF="REF-Ericsson-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ericsson 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mobile phones are increasingly useful in health information and healthcare delivery around the world. Text messaging has been used for health service appointment reminders, preventive activities and medication adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Free-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Free 2013</LINK>). Mobile phones have also been used in monitoring and the self management of chronic disorders such as diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Holtz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holtz 2012</LINK>). In addition, smartphone applications for health and wellness are proliferating, although there is little published research in this area (<LINK REF="REF-Abroms-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abroms 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Smoking cessation services internationally are using mobile phones to deliver support, particularly as adjuncts to other services. In 2014, the UK's National Health Service rolled out text messaging integrated into routine clinical practice and in 2013 almost half of US quitlines offered text messaging in addition to phone counselling services (<LINK REF="REF-Abroms-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abroms 2015</LINK>). The potential benefits of mobile phone-based smoking cessation interventions include: the ease of use anywhere at anytime; cost-effective delivery and scalability to large populations, regardless of location; the ability to tailor messages to key user characteristics (such as age, sex, ethnicity); the ability to send time-sensitive messages with an 'always on' device; the provision of content that can distract the user from cravings; and the ability to link the user with others for social support.</P>
<P>It is likely that the use of mobile phones for smoking cessation will continue to grow as they become even more ubiquitous and as technological advances increase the number of applications and functions available. While mobile technology continues to change, it is important to review the body of research on interventions using mobile phones regularly to support people to stop smoking. This is particularly so, given the exponential increase in access to mobile phones in high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-ITU-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">ITU 2015</LINK>), where the burden of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality is predicted to be greatest (<LINK REF="REF-Jha-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jha 2014</LINK>).</P>

<P>We included studies that examined any type of mobile phone-based intervention for smoking cessation. This included any intervention aimed at mobile phone users, based around delivery via mobile phone, and using any functions or applications that could be used or sent via a mobile phone. We excluded trials where mobile phones were seen as an adjunct to face-to-face or Internet-based programmes, such as to remind participants of appointments or where the effects of the various components of a multi-faceted programme could not be separated.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2016-04-07 11:21:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Robyn A Whittaker">
<P>For the present update of the review, we searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group in April 2015 using the terms 'mobile phone', 'cell phone', 'txt', 'pxt', 'sms', or 'mms' in the title, abstract or keyword fields. The Specialised Register includes reports of possible controlled trials of smoking cessation interventions identified from sensitive searches of databases. At the time of the search, the Register included the results of searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL; 2015 Issue 3); MEDLINE (via Ovid, to update 13 March 2015), EMBASE (via Ovid, to update week 12 2015) and PsycINFO (via Ovid; to 23 March 2015). See <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clabout/articles/TOBACCO/frame.html">the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Module</A> in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> for full search strategies and a list of other resources searched. We also searched the UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio for current projects in the UK and the US ClinicalTrials.gov register for ongoing or recently completed studies.

<P>The Tobacco Addiction Group Trial Search Co-ordinator pre-screened the titles and abstracts of records identified from the Register search to exclude reports that had no relevance to the topic and to provide a list of potentially relevant citations. Two review authors (RW, YG) identified potentially eligible studies and obtained full-text copies. The same review authors independently selected studies to be included against the criteria listed above and resolved any disagreements by discussion, by contacting study authors, or by referring to a third review author (HM) to act as arbiter where required. We recorded reasons for exclusion of studies.</P>

Some of these were not focused around delivery via mobile phone (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mehring-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mehring 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peng-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Skov_x002d_Ettrup-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Skov-Ettrup 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stanczyk-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Stanczyk 2014</LINK>); one was not randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Pechmann-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Pechmann 2015</LINK>); one was a pilot study with only two-month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Bricker-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Bricker 2014</LINK>); four only followed participants up to three-months (<LINK REF="STD-Buller-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Buller 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mehring-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mehring 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Shi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vilaplana-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Vilaplana 2014</LINK>); one was investigating gradual reduction of smoking in pregnant women, rather than quitting (<LINK REF="STD-Pollak-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Pollak 2013</LINK>); and one compared tailored with untailored text messages (<LINK REF="STD-Skov_x002d_Ettrup-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Skov-Ettrup 2014</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>).</P>
<P>Approaching authors of ongoing studies revealed several that were in the process of being finalised or submitted for publication. We were able to get data directly from the authors of five studies - two of which we included (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shelley-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Shelley 2015</LINK>); however, one study was not eligible, with only three months' follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Jordan-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jordan 2015</LINK>), and a further two were focused on cardiovascular disease secondary prevention rather than smoking cessation (<LINK REF="STD-Chow-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dale-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Dale 2014</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention programmes</HEADING>
<P>Almost all of the included trials used text messaging (SMS) as a central component of the intervention. A major exception to this was <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2013</LINK> who gave pre-paid mobile phones to participants, which were used to provide cognitive behavioural and motivational counselling, and access to a reactive telephone helpline. The intervention was based on US guidelines around cognitive-behavioural and motivational interviewing techniques over the mobile phone (<LINK REF="REF-Fiore-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiore 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Shelley-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Shelley 2015</LINK> also gave mobile phones to participants in a three-arm trial comparing standard pharmacotherapy, with pharmacotherapy plus text messages, and with pharmacotherapy plus text messages and phone counselling. We included this as the pre-paid mobile phone was specifically provided as part of the study to facilitate the interventions (indicating it could not have been delivered without the mobile phone), and this was very similar in concept to the <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2013</LINK> study. <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 2011</LINK> sent SMS containing links to theoretically driven video messages from 'ordinary' role models coping with quitting.</P>
<P>Several studies paired SMS with in-person visits or assessments (<LINK REF="STD-Bock-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bock 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Haug-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naughton-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Naughton 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shelley-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Shelley 2015</LINK>). The remainder were purely text messaging interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Abroms-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abroms 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Free-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Free-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodgers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rodgers 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many of the studies stated that their interventions were theory based (<LINK REF="STD-Abroms-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abroms 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bock-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bock 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naughton-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Naughton 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haug-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2009</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Haug-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2013</LINK>, the intervention was said to be based on cognitive behavioural components, stages of change and the social norms approach, with an online assessment that allowed tailoring based on stage of change and other baseline data.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bock-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bock 2013</LINK> conducted an initial counselling session then randomised participants to an eight-week intervention based on national guidelines, social cognitive theory and the stages of change. The programme was tailored to stage of readiness, starting with either 'not ready' or 'prepared to quit', that could change according to text message questions and answers. There were also on-demand components.</P>
<P>The text messaging intervention in <LINK REF="STD-Rodgers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rodgers 2005</LINK> was developed in New Zealand, and later adapted for the UK and tested in a pilot study (<LINK REF="STD-Free-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2009</LINK>), and then a large randomised controlled study (<LINK REF="STD-Free-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2011</LINK>). Messages commenced prior to quitting and were based on effective brief interventions including quitting advice and motivational messages. Interactive components included the ability to text in for more support (in the instance of cravings or lapses) and an optional Quit Buddy in <LINK REF="STD-Rodgers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rodgers 2005</LINK>. A cost-effectiveness analysis was also conducted as part of the <LINK REF="STD-Free-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2011</LINK> trial (<LINK REF="REF-Guerriero-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guerriero 2013</LINK>). This showed that the cost of text-based support per 1000 enrolled smokers was GBP278 per quitter. When the future health service costs saved (as a result of reduced smoking) were included, text-based support was considered to be cost saving, with 0.5 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per quitter.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2013</LINK>, participants received offers of support via a personalised tailored Internet programme, an SMS programme, both programmes, a choice of all three or a minimal control. The SMS programme provided advice on strategy and motivational messages relevant to their stage of readiness for quitting, plus messages on demand. For the purposes of meta-analyses, we compared the SMS group with the control group.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Naughton-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Naughton 2014</LINK>, the intervention group received the 'usual care' received by the control group (described below), as well as a four-page tailored advice report and a tailored theoretically based SMS message programme for 90 days, with interactive components (i.e. they could text for help when in difficult situations, or if they had lapsed).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Control programmes</HEADING>
<P>The control programmes across the studies varied from nothing (<LINK REF="STD-Haug-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2013</LINK>), to fortnightly (<LINK REF="STD-Free-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Free-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodgers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rodgers 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 2011</LINK>) or daily (<LINK REF="STD-Bock-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bock 2013</LINK>) text messages, written/Internet untailored materials (<LINK REF="STD-Abroms-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abroms 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2013</LINK>), and untailored messages, to standard cessation advice and treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Naughton-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Naughton 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shelley-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Shelley 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The control group of <LINK REF="STD-Naughton-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Naughton 2014</LINK> received support from practice staff who had received smoking cessation training. This support included setting a quit date within 14 days, a prescription for pharmacotherapy, the opportunity for multiple follow-up visits and routine measurement of carbon monoxide (CO) in expired breath.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Context and participants</HEADING>
<P>The settings and recruitment methods, and therefore the participants, varied considerably across studies. Two studies targeted young people (<LINK REF="STD-Haug-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Bock-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bock 2013</LINK> found usual in-person recruitment methods slow and shifted to online recruitment methods during the study. <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Abroms-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abroms 2014</LINK> also used online recruitment via Internet advertisements. In <LINK REF="STD-Abroms-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abroms 2014</LINK>, this initially led to some fraudulent participants who were discovered and disqualified, and extra procedures were put in place to prevent this from happening again.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Naughton-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Naughton 2014</LINK> was set in primary care practices in the UK with trained smoking cessation advisors providing smoking cessation advice. The <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2013</LINK> study recruited in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive, multi-ethnic, low-income population. Participants in this study were 76% African American, 79% unemployed, with high levels of depression and other alcohol/drug problems. <LINK REF="STD-Shelley-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Shelley 2015</LINK> similarly recruited from urban HIV clinics in a different region of the US.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Haug-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2013</LINK> recruited in vocational schools and differed from the other studies by allowing the inclusion of occasional smokers (at least four cigarettes in the past month or at least one in the preceding week). All other studies used a definition related to daily smoking.</P>
<P>Where recorded, participants in most of the studies had similar degrees of nicotine dependence, although in <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 2011</LINK>, the 'Hooked on Nicotine Checklist' mean scores of 8 indicated a more highly addicted group (<LINK REF="REF-Wellman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wellman 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Participants in three trials were younger (mean age 18.2 years in <LINK REF="STD-Haug-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2013</LINK>, 22 years in <LINK REF="STD-Rodgers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rodgers 2005</LINK>, and 27 years in <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 2011</LINK>) than in the other trials (means ranged from 30.7 years in <LINK REF="STD-Bock-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bock 2013</LINK> to 44.8 years in <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2013</LINK>). Most trials had slightly more women than men, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2013</LINK> with 70% male participants.</P>

<P>Randomisation was adequate in all trials. <LINK REF="STD-Haug-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2013</LINK> was the only cluster randomised trial, and recruited via vocational schools. The vocational school class was the unit of randomisation, stratified by school and with randomly permuted blocks of four cases.</P>
<P>In all trials except for <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2013</LINK>, participants were not blinded to treatment assignment, although research staff were blind to allocation at follow-up data collection. As seen in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>, all trials but <LINK REF="STD-Rodgers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rodgers 2005</LINK> were at low risk of bias in all domains.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Rodgers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rodgers 2005</LINK>, incentives for providing final follow-up data differed between groups - one month of free text messaging was received by the control group on completion of follow-up whereas the intervention group had already received their month of free text messaging from their Quit Day and did not receive a further incentive at follow-up. This may have caused the differential loss to follow-up seen at six months (69.4% providing data at six months in the active group compared with 79% in the control group), which in turn may have affected the long-term results of this study. The authors also suggested that some participants in the control group may have thought their month of free text messaging depended on reporting quitting. This could account for an unexpected increase in control group participants reporting quitting from six weeks (109 participants) to six months (202 participants reporting no smoking in the past seven days). Both of these elements may have potentially led to an underestimation of the effect of the intervention.</P>
<P>Two papers stated that they had difficulty recruiting their target sample size (<LINK REF="STD-Haug-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 2011</LINK>). Both targeted a younger population and, as a result, did not recruit their target sample size.</P>
<P>All studies presented long-term outcomes at six months, either as self reported point prevalence (no smoking in past seven to 28 days) or repeated measures of point prevalence abstinence (<LINK REF="STD-Abroms-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abroms 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bock-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bock 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2013</LINK>) (or both), or continuous abstinence, defined as no smoking since quit day, but with up to three lapses (<LINK REF="STD-Rodgers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rodgers 2005</LINK>), or five cigarettes (<LINK REF="STD-Free-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Free-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 2011</LINK>), allowed.</P>
<P>Seven of the trials sought biochemical verification of self reported six-month abstinence with salivary cotinine (<LINK REF="STD-Abroms-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abroms 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Free-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Free-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodgers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rodgers 2005</LINK>) or expired CO (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shelley-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Shelley 2015</LINK>). Those reporting response rates for verification varied from 39% in <LINK REF="STD-Rodgers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rodgers 2005</LINK> to 92% in <LINK REF="STD-Free-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2011</LINK>, with little difference between intervention and control groups within studies. Of those participants that were tested, 76% in <LINK REF="STD-Abroms-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abroms 2014</LINK> and 72% in <LINK REF="STD-Free-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2011</LINK> were verified as abstinent. The proportion was lower in <LINK REF="STD-Rodgers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rodgers 2005</LINK> (55% in the intervention group and 33.3% in the control group) and <LINK REF="STD-Free-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2009</LINK> (53% (8/15) in the intervention group and 40% (6/15) in the control group). <LINK REF="STD-Naughton-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Naughton 2014</LINK> also verified quitting but only at four-week and not at six-month follow-up.</P>
<P>All trials conducted ITT analyses, where participants with missing data were assumed to be smokers. Any differential loss to follow-up by group can create potential bias when all are inferred to be smokers. Sensitivity analyses were used to test the effects of other potential reasons for drop out. <LINK REF="STD-Free-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Haug-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2013</LINK> used multiple imputation, by using the observed predictors of outcomes and the predictors of loss to follow-up to impute missing outcome data.</P>
<P>A further potential source of bias could be any differential use of other cessation interventions. In <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2013</LINK>, where use of the studied interventions was low, it is possible that participants were motivated to try other cessation programmes.</P>

<P>Standard ITT analyses are presented here, with all participants lost to follow-up counted as continuing smokers. This may differ from how results were presented by the individual studies due to variations in primary outcomes and in analytic methods used. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Free-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2011</LINK> used multiple imputation by chained equations, and the <LINK REF="STD-Bock-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bock 2013</LINK> paper reported a significant main effect of a two (treatment groups) x three (time points) generalised estimating equations (GEE) repeated measures analysis with higher odds of point prevalence abstinence compared with a control group (odds ratio (OR) 4.52, 95% CI 1.24 to 16.53). However, individual time point comparisons did not show significant differences.</P>
<P>Although <LINK REF="STD-Naughton-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Naughton 2014</LINK> did not find a significant difference in their primary outcome (of two-week point prevalence) at eight weeks (45.2% with intervention programme versus 40.3% with control programme; OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.69), by six months there was an effect on self reported prolonged abstinence (15.1% with intervention programme versus 8.9% with control intervention; OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.01) and using a continuous abstinence measure that included outcomes at four weeks, eight weeks and six months (11.4% with intervention programme versus 6.3% with control programme; OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.45).</P>
<P>We undertook meta-analyses on the 12 included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Abroms-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abroms 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bock-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bock 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Free-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Free-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haug-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naughton-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Naughton 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodgers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rodgers 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shelley-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Shelley 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 2011</LINK>). First, we pooled all 12 studies using their most rigorous 26-week measures of abstinence, giving an RR of 1.67 (95% CI 1.46 to 1.90; 12 studies; 11,885 participants; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 59%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Both the <LINK REF="STD-Free-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2009</LINK> pilot study and the <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 2011</LINK> study were underpowered and individually did not find an effect. When we removed these two studies from the analysis, the results produced an RR of 1.81 (95% CI 1.57 to 2.09; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 32%; 10 studies; 11,459 participants). In addition, we carried out this main analysis, removing <LINK REF="STD-Haug-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2013</LINK>, to see if the result was sensitive to the inclusion of this cluster randomised controlled trial. However, this had very little impact on the result (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.47 to 1.94; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 62%; 11 studies; 11,130 participants). Due to the amount of heterogeneity detected, we also made a post-hoc decision to re-calculate the main analysis using a random-effects model. This resulted in an RR of 1.42 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.83; 12 studies; 11,885 participants), and therefore none of the adjustments had an impact on the interpretation of the results, and none of the sensitivity analyses accounted for the majority of the heterogeneity.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>We then grouped studies according to definition of abstinence used (continuous abstinence, point prevalence, biochemically verified or not) and by differences in intervention (text messaging alone, text messaging plus some form of personal contact and phone counselling).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Abstinence</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Continuous abstinence</HEADING>
<P>We pooled data from the eight studies reporting continuous abstinence, with those reporting repeated measures of point prevalence abstinence used as a proxy for continuous abstinence (<LINK REF="STD-Abroms-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Abroms 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Free-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Free-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Free 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naughton-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Naughton 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodgers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rodgers 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 2011</LINK>). This gave an RR of 1.72 (95% CI 1.50 to 1.98; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 68%; eight studies; 10,679 participants), with moderate heterogeneity.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Point prevalence</HEADING>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-07 11:16:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Robyn A Whittaker">
<P>We included seven further studies of mobile phone smoking cessation interventions meeting our inclusion criteria since the previous version of this review, giving a total of 12 included studies. The first systematic review in 2009 showed short-term benefits, but found no long-term effects, of mobile phone-only interventions. The second update, with five studies, showed an overall long-term benefit of mobile phone interventions for smoking cessation, though there was a high level of statistical heterogeneity in the pooled result. This update of 12 studies also suggested a positive effect of mobile phone interventions on smoking cessation at six months in comparison with 'usual care', although there was still significant unexplained heterogeneity. Our findings appeared to have been strengthened by the highest quality studies, that is, those studies using stricter outcome definitions, including biochemical verification. The benefits were large, and similar in size to those seen using of other effective treatments such as nicotine replacement therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2012</LINK>).<BR/>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-04-07 12:38:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review currently includes 12 studies with 11,885 participants. There has been a steady increase in the number of studies eligible for this review over time. All of the studies included were conducted in high-income countries with mature tobacco control policies; although two studies specifically recruited from low-income populations (<LINK REF="STD-Gritz-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gritz 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shelley-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Shelley 2015</LINK>). This means that it is possible that text messaging interventions may not be appropriate or effective in other contexts, or alternatively they may be even more effective in those settings where cessation information and support is relatively new. Clearly there is a major gap in the current evidence.</P>
<P>We also found 25 ongoing studies. As the body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of text messaging in high-income countries grows, it is hoped that some of these are being conducted in other contexts or with different populations. It is interesting to note that there were no trials of smartphone 'app'-based interventions that met our eligibility criteria despite the proliferation of available cessation apps. In 2011, one review of available smoking cessation apps found them to be lacking in adherence to cessation guidelines or theory (<LINK REF="REF-Abroms-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abroms 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is as yet little research into the different functional components, message content, mediators and moderators of mobile phone programmes, in order to learn what type of programmes work best for whom. <LINK REF="STD-Skov_x002d_Ettrup-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Skov-Ettrup 2014</LINK> conducted a study, based on an ongoing online programme, of untailored messages compared with tailored messages. Participants were randomised first and then offered text messages on top of the online programme. Overall, there was no significant difference between groups in long-term quit rates; however, when restricted to only those who chose to receive the text messages, there was an effect of tailored over untailored messages (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.08; 1,809 participants). As the tailored messages were also more frequent, it is not clear whether this effect was due to intensity, tailoring or both.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-04-07 11:19:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Robyn A Whittaker">
<P>The studies included varied in size from 60 to 5800 participants, but were generally all of a reasonable quality with a low risk of bias. They were all randomised controlled trials, with one cluster randomised trial (the result of analyses were not sensitive to removal if this study), and with similar outcomes measures. Substantial heterogeneity was detected across analyses; however, a post hoc decision to conduct the main analysis using a random-effects model resulted in no difference in the interpretation of findings. Half of the included studies attempted to biochemically verify self reported quitting outcomes. When we pooled these studies separately, the result was similar, if not more strongly in favour of the intervention.</P>
<P>Two studies reported that they were unable to recruit their target sample sizes, both of which were targeting a younger population (<LINK REF="STD-Haug-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Haug 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whittaker-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Whittaker 2011</LINK>). Both studies found no statistically significant effect of the intervention, but were reported to be slightly underpowered. More research is needed in young adults to determine the acceptability and effectiveness of mobile phone based interventions. Overall, we are moderately confident in the main effect estimate generated through our analysis (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-04-07 11:19:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Robyn A Whittaker">
<P>At least in high-income countries with existing tobacco control policies, media and education, text message-based smoking cessation interventions, either alone or in combination with face-to-face assessments or online programmes, appear to be a helpful option to offer to quitters. It is not yet clear whether this translates to other contexts, such as low- or middle-income countries, and younger people; however, many are proceeding to implement such programmes anyway. High-quality evaluations of these implemented programmes will be valuable.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-04-07 11:19:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Robyn A Whittaker">
<P>Research into the effectiveness of mobile phone-based cessation programmes for young people, in low- and middle-income countries and countries with little active tobacco control policy, is still required. There is also a lack of research into the effectiveness of individual components of programmes, in order to determine what works best for whom. There does not appear to be any rigorous trials of smartphone-based programmes published as yet. Due to their widespread availability, it would be useful to know if the broader functionality available in apps can be harnessed effectively to support cessation.</P>

<P>We have followed the change of policy of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group, and now report our findings using Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect risk ratios rather than as odds ratios. Previously, we had not pooled studies in the presence of substantial statistical heterogeneity as assessed by the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, but in this update of the review, we report pooled results due to the homogenous nature of the included studies in terms of design, intervention and outcome.</P>

<P>Text2Quit: a 6-month SMS programme with the first 3 months offering both outgoing messages about quitting smoking and on-demand help using keywords. Outgoing messages peaked in the period just prior to and following the quit date. Participants received 5 messages on their quit date and approximately 2/day in the week after the quit date. Frequency declined in the subsequent weeks to approximately 3/week for the next 2 months and then &lt; 1/week for the remaining portion of the outgoing phase. After the outgoing messages stopped, participants could still text at any time for help through keywords - to reset a quit date (DATE), get help with a craving through a tip or a trivia game (CRAVE); get a summary of their quitting statistics (STATS) and to indicate that they had smoked (SMOKED). The SMS were supplemented by a personalised Internet portal (text2quit.com) and e-mails</P>
<P>Control: sent an Internet link to Smokefree.gov, a leading website with quitting smoking information run by the National Cancer Institute. Later, once the website began to offer an SMS programme, a guidebook on quitting smoking was offered via an Internet link that led participants to a document containing similar advice and information as Smokefree.gov</P>

<P>6-month programme: delivered solely over mobile phone based on programme in <LINK REF="STD-Rodgers-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rodgers 2005</LINK>. Participants asked to set a QD within 2 weeks of randomisation. They received 5 text messages/day for the first 5 weeks and then 3/week for the next 26 weeks. Intervention included motivational messages and behaviour-change techniques. The programme was also personalised with an algorithm based on demographic and other information gathered at baseline, such as smoker's concerns about weight gain after quitting. The core programme consisted of 186 messages and the personalised messages were selected from a database of 713 messages. For instance, by texting the word "lapse", participants received a series of 3 text messages that encouraged them to continue with their quit attempt. Participants could also request the mobile phone number of another trial participant so that they could text each other for support. Participants in the intervention group using pay-as-you-go mobile phone schemes were given a 20 top-up voucher to provide sufficient credit to participate in the intervention</P>
<P>Control: fortnightly, simple, short, text messages related to the importance of trial participation</P>

<P>Participants in the mobile phone intervention group received the usual care components plus a mobile phone-delivered counselling intervention over 3 months and access to a supportive hotline. They were provided with a pre-paid mobile phone on which a series of 11 proactive counselling sessions were conducted. The phone calls spanned a 3-month period but were front loaded such that the frequency of the calls was highest near the time of scheduled quit attempt. Counselling session content was primarily drawn from a cognitive-behavioural foundation emphasising problem solving and skills training techniques</P>
<P>Control: participants completed an audio computer-assisted self interview, then received provider advice to quit smoking. Usual care was provided with targeted written smoking cessation materials (i.e. a "tip sheet" designed to address concerns of HIV-positive smokers) and instructions on how to obtain nicotine-replacement therapy in the form of nicotine patches at the clinic</P>

<P>The authors suggested that some participants in the control group may have thought their incentive at follow-up (month of free text messaging) depended on reporting quitting. This could account for an unexpected increase in control group participants reporting quitting from 6 weeks (109 participants) to 6 months (202 participants reporting no smoking in the past 7 days), which could have led to an underestimation of the effect of the intervention</P>
