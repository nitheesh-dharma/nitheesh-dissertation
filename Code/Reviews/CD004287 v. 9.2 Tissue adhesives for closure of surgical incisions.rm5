<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-10-29 16:08:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tissue adhesives or glues are increasingly used in place of stitches (sutures) or staples to close wounds. It has been suggested that tissue adhesives may be quicker and easier to use than sutures for closing surgical wounds. Tissue adhesives carry no risk of sharps injury - unlike needles that are used for sutures - and are thought to provide a barrier to infection. This may mean that they also promote healing, and the need for removal of sutures is avoided.</P>
<P>The researchers searched the medical literature up to March 2014, and identified 33 medical studies that investigated the use of tissue adhesives for closure of wounds. They compared tissue adhesive with another method of closure such as sutures, staples, tape, or another type of tissue adhesive. The main outcomes of interest were whether wounds stayed closed - and did not break down - and whether they became infected. The results of the review showed clearly that fewer wounds broke down when sutures were used. Studies also reported that some types of tissue adhesives might be slightly quicker to use than other types. There was no clear difference between tissue adhesives and the alternative closure methods for cosmetic results or costs. Results regarding surgeons' and patients' preferred skin closure method were mixed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-10-23 09:25:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sutures (stitches), staples and adhesive tapes have been used for many years as methods of wound closure, but tissue adhesives have entered clinical practice more recently. Closure of wounds with sutures enables the closure to be meticulous, but the sutures may show tissue reactivity and can require removal. Tissue adhesives offer the advantages of an absence of risk of needlestick injury and no requirement to remove sutures later. Initially, tissue adhesives were used primarily in emergency room settings, but this review looks at the use of tissue adhesives in the operating room/theatre where surgeons are using them increasingly for the closure of surgical skin incisions.</P>

<P>In March 2014 for this second update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library)</I>; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. We did not restrict the search and study selection with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-10-22 18:09:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We conducted screening of eligible studies, data extraction and risk of bias assessment independently and in duplicate. We expressed results as random-effects models using mean difference for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-11 15:53:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This second update of the review identified 19 additional eligible trials resulting in a total of 33 studies (2793 participants) that met the inclusion criteria. There was low quality evidence that sutures were significantly better than tissue adhesives for reducing the risk of wound breakdown (dehiscence; RR 3.35; 95% CI 1.53 to 7.33; 10 trials, 736 participants that contributed data to the meta-analysis). The number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome was calculated as 43. For all other outcomes - infection, patient and operator satisfaction and cost - there was no evidence of a difference for either sutures or tissue adhesives. No evidence of differences was found between tissue adhesives and tapes for minimising dehiscence, infection, patients' assessment of cosmetic appearance, patient satisfaction or surgeon satisfaction. However there was evidence in favour of using tape for surgeons' assessment of cosmetic appearance (mean difference (VAS 0 to 100) 9.56 (95% CI 4.74 to 14.37; 2 trials, 139 participants). One trial compared tissue adhesives with a variety of methods of wound closure and found both patients and clinicians were significantly more satisfied with the alternative closure methods than the adhesives. There appeared to be little difference in outcome for different types of tissue adhesives. One study that compared high viscosity with low viscosity adhesives found that high viscosity adhesives were less time-consuming to use than low viscosity tissue adhesives, but the time difference was small.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-11-07 12:21:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sutures are significantly better than tissue adhesives for minimising dehiscence. In some cases tissue adhesives may be quicker to apply than sutures. Although surgeons may consider the use of tissue adhesives as an alternative to other methods of surgical site closure in the operating theatre, they need to be aware that sutures minimise dehiscence. There is a need for more well designed randomised controlled trials comparing tissue adhesives with alternative methods of closure. These trials should include people whose health may interfere with wound healing and surgical sites of high tension.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2014-11-11 15:42:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-10-29 16:10:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-10-13 08:45:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Millions of surgical procedures are conducted around the world each year. The majority of procedures result in surgical wounds that will heal by primary intention - this is where wound edges are brought together (re-approximated) and held together, e.g. with sutures, to facilitate tissue healing.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-10-29 16:10:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the past the options for wound closure have been limited largely to sutures (needle and thread) with other alternatives such as staples, adhesive tapes and tissue adhesives entering clinical practice more recently. Closure of wounds with sutures enables meticulous closure, but skin may react to sutures and they usually require removal. Tissue adhesives (glues) offer the advantages that suture removal is not required at a later date and there is no risk of needlestick injury to the surgeon or assistant.</P>
<P>Tissue adhesives have been used in various forms for many years since the first cyanoacrylate adhesives were synthesised (<LINK REF="REF-Coover-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coover 1959</LINK>). The early adhesives were appropriate for small superficial lacerations and incisions, but their limited physical properties prevented use in the management of other wounds. There were also reports of acute and chronic inflammatory reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Houston-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Houston 1969</LINK>). Further development led to the introduction of the n-2-butylcyanoacrlyates that were purer and stronger, but did not receive widespread acceptance because their clinical performance was limited by their low tensile strength and brittleness (<LINK REF="REF-Bruns-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruns 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quinn-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinn 1993</LINK>). More recently stronger tissue adhesives have been developed by combining plasticisers and stabilisers to increase flexibility and reduce toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Quinn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinn 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tissue adhesives have been used primarily in emergency rooms and there is increasing support in the literature for their effectiveness in the closure of various traumatic lacerations (<LINK REF="REF-Farion-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farion 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osmond-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osmond 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perron-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perron 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quinn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinn 1997</LINK>). Surgeons now also use tissue adhesives in the operating room for the closure of surgical skin incisions.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-10-23 09:38:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The introduction of tissue adhesives was received enthusiastically as they may produce equivalent tensile strength, improved cosmetic appearance of the scar and a lower infection rate when compared with sutures, staples and adhesive tapes, while avoiding many of the risks and disadvantages of alternative methods (<LINK REF="REF-Osmond-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osmond 1999</LINK>). As with standard adhesives, tissue adhesives are applied to the wound in a liquid form - following application they undergo polymerisation and bonding and setting occurs.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-10-23 09:39:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is important that clinical decision-makers are able to make evidence-informed decisions regarding the use of tissue adhesives to close surgical incisions. This review was first published in 2004. As tissue adhesives become more widely used, more randomised controlled trials are conducted, and this update is required to incorporate this new evidence.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed each eligible study for risk of bias using the Cochrane &#8216;Risk of bias assessment tool&#8217;. The tool addresses six specific domains (see <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>), namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues that may potentially bias the study (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). They completed a &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; table for each eligible study, and a separate assessment of blinding and completeness of outcome data for each outcome. Discrepancies between review authors were resolved through discussion. Findings are presented using the &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; summary figure, which presents all of the judgements in a cross-tabulation of study by risk of bias domain.</P>

<P>This assessment of clinical and methodological heterogeneity will be supplemented by information regarding statistical heterogeneity - assessed using the Chi² test (a significance level of P less than 0.10 will be considered to indicate statistically significant heterogeneity in conjunction with I² measure; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). I² examines the percentage of total variation across RCTs that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. In general I² values of 25%, or less, may mean a low level of heterogeneity, and values of 75%, or more, indicate very high heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2014-10-29 16:19:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the reviewers used risk ratios (RR) to express estimates of effect of an intervention, together with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes, the reviewers used mean differences and standard deviations to summarize the data for each group. Where there were studies of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures, we attempted a meta-analysis. Risk ratios were combined for dichotomous data, and weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous data, using a random-effects model (indicated as RE in the results section) as some heterogeneity between studies was anticipated. We planned to analyse time taken to close wound (after surgery) as survival (time-to-event) data, using the appropriate analytical method (as per the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook guidance <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>), or as a continuous outcome, if data from all participants were available.</P>
<P>The reviewers intended to meta-analyse the results of trials with a split wound (different parts of the same wound randomised to alternate treatments), and split body designs (different wounds on the same participant randomised to alternative treatments) using the inverse variance method for paired data if appropriate data were available.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">'Summary of findings' tables</HEADING>
<P>In this second update we also present the main results of the review in 'Summary of findings' tables. These tables present key information concerning the quality of the evidence, the magnitude of the effects of the interventions examined, and the sum of the available data for the main outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2011a</LINK>). The 'Summary of findings' tables also include an overall grading of the evidence related to each of the main outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. The GRADE approach defines the quality of a body of evidence as the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association is close to the true quantity of specific interest. The quality of a body of evidence involves consideration of within-trial risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimates and risk of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2011b</LINK>). We present the following outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' tables:</P>

<P>In this second update of the review we conducted a post-hoc sensitivity analysis where we removed studies from key analyses where we had concerns about possible unit of analysis issues (i.e. where dehiscence and infection had been recorded over multiple time periods and it was not clear from the analyses whether some participants had more than one event).</P>

We excluded one study because no data were presented and none were received after we sent a written request to the authors (<LINK REF="STD-Alhopuro-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Alhopuro 1976</LINK>). Another study was excluded as we could not use the data for incision closure because they were combined with data for laceration closure (<LINK REF="STD-Singer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Singer 2002</LINK>); we wrote to the authors to request data separated by group, but received no reply. The third study was excluded because after full translation we discovered not to be a randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gorozpe_x002d_Calvillo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gorozpe-Calvillo 1999</LINK>). We excluded two papers because their methodology was flawed. The first of these was excluded because the intervention group had a subcuticular suture in place that was thought to bias the outcome in favour of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Jaibaji-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jaibaji 2000</LINK>). The second was excluded because all participants had a subcuticular suture placed and the review authors thought this adjunct method of closure would invalidate an independent assessment of the primary interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Kuo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kuo 2006</LINK>). Three further studies were excluded, as two were not randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Silvestri-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Silvestri 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steiner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Steiner 2000</LINK>), and the third did not appear to be randomised, and although we sought clarification from the trial authors, no reply was received (<LINK REF="STD-Orozco_x002d_Razon-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Orozco-Razon 2002</LINK>).

One study assessed patient satisfaction by using a questionnaire that included ratings for cosmetic appearance, overall comfort, ability to shower, dressing changes, tension at the wound, hygienic problems or allergic reaction and overall satisfaction (<LINK REF="STD-Blondeel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Blondeel 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Amin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2009</LINK> assessed patient satisfaction at three months using a self-completed 10 cm VAS line where 0 was poor and 10 was excellent. <LINK REF="STD-Avsar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Avsar 2009</LINK> assessed patient satisfaction at day 40 when participants were asked how satisfied they were with their skin closure and could choose from the following responses: very bad, poor, average, good, very good. <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2006</LINK> assessed participant/parent satisfaction using a VAS scale that ran from 0 to 100, where 100 represented maximal satisfaction. Data for <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2006</LINK> were presented as median values, and separately for different types of arthroplasty, and are not reported further in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Dowson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dowson 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Romero-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Romero 2011</LINK> reported patient satisfaction as a simple 'satisfied' or 'not satisfied', but gave little information about the criteria used. Likewise, <LINK REF="STD-Kent-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kent 2014</LINK> report participants' satisfaction with incisional wound closure - options were 'satisfied' or 'dissatisfied'. <LINK REF="STD-Pronio-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pronio 2011</LINK> assessed participants' satisfaction with wound management at a seven-day follow-up when participants were asked to rate their level of satisfaction with the early postoperative management of the wound (regarding the requirement of a return visit for medications, the possibility of washing oneself, and suture removal) using a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 10. Data were reported in merged categories (e.g. percentage of participants reporting a score of 10 to 9, 8 to 7 etc.), which limited further use of these data. One paper reported upon participant satisfaction as an outcome measure in the text (<LINK REF="STD-Sniezek--2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sniezek 2007</LINK>), but no results were reported in the analyses.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Surgeon satisfaction</HEADING>
<P>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Greene-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Greene 1999</LINK>), surgeon satisfaction included quality of wound closure by assessment of eversion, regularity, approximation and any difficulties in attaining approximation. This was reported at weeks one, two and four. Another study reported surgeon satisfaction at 10 days using a scale of satisfaction with the scar on a five-point score (where 1 was a 'perfect cosmetic result' to 5 'unsatisfactory result'; <LINK REF="STD-Shamiyeh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shamiyeh 2001</LINK>). A third study reported surgeon satisfaction immediately after closure, when the surgeon was asked to give his or her opinion on the time needed for wound closure and the practicality of the materials used by answering multiple choice questions (potential responses included: 'far too long', 'a little too long', 'not too long', 'not practical', 'not very practical' and 'very practical'; <LINK REF="STD-Maartense-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maartense 2002</LINK>). Due to differences in methods used to measure this outcome, these studies were not included in the meta-analysis. One study did report surgeon satisfaction via a questionnaire that included ratings for wound cosmetic appearance, safety, effectiveness, applicability for a wide range of incisions, perceived patient satisfaction and overall satisfaction (<LINK REF="STD-Blondeel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Blondeel 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kent-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kent 2014</LINK> assessed surgeons' satisfaction with wound (considering expression, application, delivery and ease of use for product); the options were 'satisfied' or 'dissatisfied'. <LINK REF="STD-Maloney-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Maloney 2013</LINK> assessed surgeon satisfaction (at time of wound closure) using 100 mm VAS scales for: ease of use (0 'impossible' to 10 'very easy to use') and satisfaction with device and the closure achieved (0 'completely dissatisfied' to 10 'completely satisfied').</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Random sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>Random sequence generation was performed adequately in twelve studies (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blondeel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Blondeel 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eggers-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Eggers 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Khan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krishnamoorthy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Krishnamoorthy 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maartense-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maartense 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mota-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mota 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romero-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Romero 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shamiyeh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shamiyeh 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sniezek--2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sniezek 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Switzer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Switzer 2003</LINK>). All studies used a random sequences generated by computerised randomisation programmes except for <LINK REF="STD-Sniezek--2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sniezek 2007</LINK>, which used coin tossing.</P>
<P>In the remaining 20 studies, the risk of bias in the random sequence generation was unclear. This was largely because, although there was mention of the participants being randomised into different intervention arms, there was no mention of the methods used to achieve this (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cheng-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chibbaro-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chibbaro 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dowson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dowson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greene-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Greene 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jallali-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jallali 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keng-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Keng 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kent-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kent 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kouba-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kouba 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Livesey-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Livesey 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maloney-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Maloney 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Millan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Millan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ozturan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ozturan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pronio-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pronio 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridgway-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ridgway 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sebesta-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sebesta 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tierny-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tierny 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toriumi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Toriumi 1998</LINK>). The partial translation of <LINK REF="STD-Avsar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Avsar 2009</LINK> was such that no conclusion could be derived about whether there was adequate evidence of random sequence generation, therefore the judgement remained unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Four studies were judged to be at low risk of bias for the domain of allocation concealment: <LINK REF="STD-Amin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dowson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dowson 2006</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2002</LINK> reported that they used sealed, sequential envelopes, that were opened shortly before the intervention was given. <LINK REF="STD-Livesey-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Livesey 2009</LINK> did not indicate that numbered envelopes were used, but stated that envelopes were opened by independent personnel. All remaining studies were deemed to be at unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment. Some studies gave evidence that they used envelopes that were sealed and opaque, but lacked sufficient evidence that they were sequentially numbered or that the process was undertaken by an independent person. Many other studies provided no information on allocation of the randomisation sequence at all.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding of participants and personnel</HEADING>
<P>The risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel was judged to be unclear in all studies. It was difficult to see how the operating surgeon could be completely blinded to an intervention he/she was supposed to undertake. Only <LINK REF="STD-Dowson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dowson 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mota-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mota 2009</LINK> suggest that participants remained blinded to the intervention they received. Given the difficulties faced in blinding participants (in most cases) and personnel to the intervention, we felt it reasonable to judge all of the included studies as being at unclear risk of bias, as it is uncertain how this influenced the performance of the personnel.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding of outcome assessment</HEADING>
<P>Risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessment was undertaken for each relevant outcome, and thus was often characterised as being at both unclear and high risk of bias within the same study. This was often because numbers of wounds breaking down and wound infection were assessed in a way that was not obviously blinded, but cosmesis was deemed to be blinded. Such examples of studies where blinding of dehiscence was unclear and blinding of cosmesis was adequate were: <LINK REF="STD-Blondeel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Blondeel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dowson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dowson 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kent-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kent 2014</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Livesey-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Livesey 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Maloney-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Maloney 2013</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ozturan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ozturan 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Romero-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Romero 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Shamiyeh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shamiyeh 2001</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Toriumi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Toriumi 1998</LINK>.</P>
<P>There were studies that did give enough evidence for us to infer a low risk of detection bias. These were <LINK REF="STD-Amin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2009</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Maartense-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maartense 2002</LINK>, all of which revealed adequate blinding of outcome assessment for all measures extracted for this review. In one study, there was evidence to suggest a high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Mota-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mota 2009</LINK>), as the study report indicated that those assessing the wounds were the authors of the paper.</P>
<P>The remaining studies did not provide evidence of adequate blinding of outcome assessments at any stage and were classed as being at unclear risk of bias for this domain.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>Four studies were classed as having a high risk of attrition bias (<LINK REF="STD-Dowson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dowson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kent-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kent 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinha-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sinha 2001</LINK>). This was often due to high proportional rates of drop out, or unclear reasons for large numbers of drop outs, or both.</P>
<P>Eleven studies were judged as being at unclear risk of bias for this domain, as reasons for drop out were not clear, or the extent to which the drop-out rates affected the results were unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Amin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Amin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Avsar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Avsar 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eggers-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Eggers 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kouba-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kouba 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krishnamoorthy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Krishnamoorthy 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Livesey-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Livesey 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Millan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Millan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mota-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Mota 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ridgway-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ridgway 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romero-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Romero 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toriumi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Toriumi 1998</LINK>)<I>. </I>

<P>Two studies were judged as unclear, either due to an unclear English translation (<LINK REF="STD-Avsar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Avsar 2009</LINK>), or because outcomes that were outlined as being assessed were not clearly reported (<LINK REF="STD-Sebesta-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sebesta 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>Four studies reported costs. <LINK REF="STD-Shamiyeh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shamiyeh 2001</LINK> reported that one tube of tissue adhesive at USD 11.00 could be used to close 3.5 incisions of 5 mm mean length, while one suture at USD 1.10 could be used to close five incisions, and one package of tape (six pieces) at USD 0.24 could be used to close three incisions - this calculation assumes multiple incisions on the same patient. A second study reported that for closure of laparoscopic trocar wounds the costs were EUR 13.90 for one ampoule of octylcyanoacrylate, EUR 2.47 for one package of poliglecaprone suture (used together with a dressing at EUR 0.42 each) and EUR 1.15 per package of adhesive paper tape (<LINK REF="STD-Maartense-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maartense 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Eggers-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Eggers 2011</LINK> reported that the total cost associated with surgery for each of the closure groups (including all aspects of surgery associated with materials, labour, and operating room expenses) was USD 993.20 for octylcyanoacrylate; USD 878.27 for butylcyanoacrylate and USD 1056.32 for staples. No measures of variation were presented. <LINK REF="STD-Sebesta-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sebesta 2004</LINK> reported that the mean tissue adhesive cost per patient was USD 65.10 (range USD 40.60 to USD 101.5; standard deviation (SD) USD 13.70) whilst the total cost for surgery in the octylcyanoacrylate group (i.e. cost for operating room time, cost and cost of suture material) was USD 193.32 (range USD 130 to USD 365; SD USD 49.40). For the suture group the mean suture cost per patient was USD 7.74 (range USD 3.60 to USD 10.80; SD USD 2.05) and the total mean cost was USD 497 (range USD 295 to USD 835; SD USD 139.70).</P>

Pooling these trials was not appropriate due to massive heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 100%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). Two of the trials suggested that adhesive took longer to apply than sutures, and in one of these trials the difference was statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Shamiyeh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shamiyeh 2001</LINK>), although the units for this were unclear - if measured in seconds then the difference, although significant, could be small in terms of total time saved with one method compared to the other. In remaining three trials, suturing took significantly more time than adhesive (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ozturan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ozturan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sebesta-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sebesta 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Sebesta-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sebesta 2004</LINK> reported that application of adhesive took on average 3.7 minutes compared with 14 minutes on average in the suture group. <LINK REF="STD-Ong-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ong 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ozturan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ozturan 2001</LINK> were both deemed to be at high risk of bias for one domain (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Summary: tissue adhesives compared with sutures</HEADING>
<P>There was an overall difference favouring sutures over tissue adhesives in that sutures led to a reduced risk of dehiscence, though several studies that contributed data to this analysis had at least one risk of bias domain that was classed as being at high risk. Removal of studies with a possible unit of analysis issue reduced the precision and the results then lay just outside the standard definition of statistical significance.There was no evidence of a difference in the risk of developing a wound infection in trial groups - although the comparison is underpowered and confidence intervals are wide. One study was at both low and unclear risk of bias across domains: its results were statistically significant and suggested that using sutures for closure was slightly faster than using tissue adhesives. However, a second study had opposite findings, which were also statistically significant, suggesting that closure with tissue adhesive was significantly faster than sutures by over 10 minutes on average.</P>

<P>When tissue adhesives were compared with sutures, pooled data from 17 studies (with 10 contributing data towards the analysis) showed a statistically significant difference favouring sutures, as they reduced the risk of dehiscence. It is possible this result may have been influenced by unit of analysis issues, as it was not clear whether more than one dehiscence event per participant had been recorded in studies with multiple follow-up points. No other comparison of tissue adhesives with other closure methods showed a statistically significant difference in the risk of wound dehiscence.</P>

<P>One study suggested that, on average, it took 10 minutes longer to close a wound with sutures than with tissue adhesives, but this was not borne out in all the studies and may depend on factors such as wound type. There was a statistically significant difference in time taken for closure between tissue adhesives and tape-closed wounds, that favoured the tape group. There was also a significant difference in time taken for closure between tissue adhesives compared with staples that favoured the staples group, however, the difference between groups was only just over 60 seconds, so whilst it was statistically significant it was not clinically significant. Another study that compared tissue adhesive with a mixed control group (i.e. staples, sutures and tape) found a statistically significant difference in time to closure that favoured tissue adhesive, although the mean difference between groups was again approximately one minute. Finally, one study reported that there was a small, but statistically significant difference in time to closure that favoured low viscosity adhesive over high viscosity adhesive, and favoured octylcyanoacrylate tissue adhesive over butylcyanoacrylate tissue adhesive.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-11 10:42:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Traditional methods of surgical incision closure have been used for many years. However, these techniques are not without some problems and it is therefore important to consider new developments - such as tissue adhesives - which may offer some advantages for patients. This review included a total of 33 studies: 23 studies compared tissue adhesives with sutures; three studies compared tissue adhesives with adhesive tape, which is often used for smaller incisions; six studies compared adhesives with staples; two studies compared tissue adhesives with mixed control groups; and two studies compared different types of tissue adhesives. A notable finding in this review was that, when data from ten studies that compared tissue adhesives with sutures were pooled, a significant difference in risk of wound dehiscence became apparent, with a higher risk of dehiscence associated with tissue adhesives. No other comparison showed evidence for a difference in risk of wound dehiscence for alternative treatments. It is important to note the often unclear and sometime high risk of bias of included studies. Many studies were also underpowered, and the primary outcome here - dehiscence - was not used as a basis for sample size calculation. The surgical procedures described by the studies were diverse and included blepharoplasty, circumcision, and excision of benign skin lesions. Incision in areas of high tension and in those patients whose medical health may have reduced their ability to heal were excluded and so tissue adhesives have not been evaluated in this population.</P>
<P>Postoperative site infection is a common problem and has a significant impact on patients and healthcare systems. More than 70% of surgical procedures are now performed on a outpatient basis, which poses major problems for surveillance of surgical site infections (<LINK REF="REF-Emori-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emori 1993</LINK>). In one study of 2345 patients undergoing surgery, the overall incidence of surgical site infection was 8.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Malone-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malone 2002</LINK>). One might anticipate that a tissue adhesive offers a barrier to micro-organisms at the site of the healing incision and may therefore contribute towards reducing wound infection. However, the studies identified for this review did not demonstrate any significant difference in the proportion of infections in incisions closed with tissue adhesives compared with other conventional techniques. No study reported an a priori calculation for the sample size, and this may be relevant. Even the largest of the studies would have been unlikely to have been adequately powered to show any significant difference given the relatively low incidence of wound infections following many types of surgery.</P>
<P>Cosmetic outcome is an important long-term outcome of wound repair for the patient and we considered appearance at or beyond three months after surgery to be meaningful. Some studies reported cosmetic outcome earlier than this three month time point (<LINK REF="STD-Blondeel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Blondeel 2004</LINK>). Whilst is has been reported that an individual patient's cosmetic outcome at three months is predictive of cosmetic appearance at one year (<LINK REF="STD-Quinn-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Quinn 1998</LINK>), the same investigation reported that early outcome, such as at five or 10 days, is poorly predictive of the three month appearance. This can present a problem for trials, as attrition bias may influence the results. The only difference identified in cosmetic appearance was for the comparison of tissue adhesive with adhesive tape - this was a blinded assessment by surgeons that favoured tape. Assessments for this comparison were limited, so there was a great deal of uncertainty regarding the comparative risk of wound dehiscence and infection when tape was compared with tissue adhesive.</P>
<P>Patient satisfaction is also important when comparing alternative incision closure devices providing that the primary efficacy variables of dehiscence, infection and cosmetic appearance are satisfactory. Patient satisfaction may include ratings for cosmesis, overall comfort, ability to shower, dressing changes, tension on wounds, hygiene problems, allergic reactions and overall satisfaction. Another important benefit of tissue adhesives is that they do not need to be removed. One small study suggested that patients had a preference for adhesive rather than sutures (<LINK REF="STD-Greene-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Greene 1999</LINK>), although it was not clear what dimensions it measured. A further small study also suggested that patients were had higher satisfaction with tissue adhesive than staples. Conversly, one study that compared traditional closure methods to tissue adhesives demonstrated a significant patient preference for the alternatives to tissue adhesives (<LINK REF="STD-Blondeel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Blondeel 2004</LINK>): this was the largest of the studies to assess patient satisfaction. It would be helpful if validated questionnaires were available to use in studies.</P>
<P>Surgeon satisfaction assessments typically sought ratings for wound cosmesis or ease of use for the technique. Certainly there is no risk of needle-stick injury to the surgeon whilst using adhesive rather than sutures, and this may be a factor in favour of adhesives, though none of the studies in this review considered this. In one study physicians completed a questionnaire that measured satisfaction with the ease of use of a device, wound cosmesis, safety, effectiveness, applicability to a wide range of incisions, perceived patient satisfaction and overall satisfaction (<LINK REF="STD-Blondeel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Blondeel 2004</LINK>). This study showed that clinicians significantly preferred the alternative to tissue adhesive, but when comparing high viscosity adhesives to other adhesives, operators showed no difference in preference.</P>
<P>We included time to closure as an outcome measure in the review post hoc, as the review authors believe this to be a contributory factor towards both cost-effectiveness and satisfaction. Studies suggested that tissue adhesives might be significantly quicker than suturing for some wounds, although there was heterogeneity around this that might be related to the type and size of wound being assessed, and suturing was reported to be the faster method in other studies. In other comparisons closure with tape and staples was found to be faster than with tissue adhesives - but the differences in time, whilst statistically significant, were generally only small periods of difference - for example 60 seconds.</P>
<P>Whilst time taken is an attractive aspect for surgeons, it should be noted that although there maybe a significant difference in time taken for closure, the overall time taken was still relatively small in both groups with even the longest closure times rarely exceeding two minutes. In clinical practice the reduction of wound closure time through using the quickest method may be insufficient to increase the number of operations in a given operating room schedule. However, a faster wound closure technique may increase surgeon satisfaction and may also be attractive to patients when surgery is undertaken using only local anaesthetic. Alternatively, patients may be happy with a lengthier closure time for a technique that achieves better outcomes.</P>
<P>Generally, tissue adhesives cost more than the alternatives. An ampoule of tissue adhesive may be three times or more the cost of the suture required to close the same length of incision. However, a dressing is not required over the tissue adhesive, but is routinely used with alternatives. Also, when taking into account the overall cost of the surgical procedure, this small difference may be of less significance. It may be considered important to use a specific closure device, even if the cost is greater, if significant superiority is demonstrated for wound healing, including cosmetic outcome and patient satisfaction. Thus the length of time for closure and cost may be important only after other outcomes such as dehiscence, cosmesis and infection have been considered.</P>
<P>In summary, there is some evidence that dehiscence rates may be higher in wounds closed with tissue adhesives than with sutures. This finding agrees with a review published in 2010 that includes similar wound dehiscence data to this review (<LINK REF="STD-Chow-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chow 2010</LINK>), although the authors did not perform a sensitivity analysis based on possible unit of analysis issues, as we have here.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of any difference between sutures and tissue adhesive for outcomes such as cosmetic appearance and satisfaction. The relative time taken using sutures for wound closure rather than tissue adhesives seems to vary, with one study showing use of adhesive to be significantly faster than sutures and another study showing suturing to be significantly faster than tissue adhesive. Other studies reported that tissue adhesive took longer to apply than staples and tape. Generally, there was limited comparative evidence to determine whether tissue adhesives led to lower or higher levels of dehiscence, infection, satisfaction with cosmetic outcome, or patient or surgeon general satisfaction. Surgeons and patients were significantly more satisfied with the alternatives to adhesives in one analysis, but this finding was not replicated in other studies. There was no evidence of a difference in outcomes between tissue adhesive types except that high viscosity adhesives took significantly more time for skin closure, adding a minute on average to the procedure.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-10-23 12:51:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty-three studies, including 2793 participants, compared tissue adhesives with alternative methods of surgical wound closure. These provided no evidence of a difference in rates of wound infection after surgical incision closure with tissues adhesives, sutures, tapes, staples or amongst different tissue adhesives. When adhesive was compared with suture there was evidence of a benefit for using sutures for minimising dehiscence.</P>
<P>Although there was some evidence that surgeons and patients may prefer alternative methods to tissue adhesives, there was also evidence that patient satisfaction with tissue adhesives was higher than for staples. Although some analyses demonstrated that alternatives to tissue adhesives were less time consuming to use, this does not contraindicate their use, and this conclusion was refuted by the results of other studies. However, these trials did not consider incisions in areas of high tension, such as the elbow and knee, which therefore have not been evaluated with tissue adhesives. Similarly, trials excluded patients whose general health may have had the potential to impair wound healing, so tissue adhesives have not been evaluated in these populations.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-10-21 12:40:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further adequately powered trials should be undertaken to investigate the effects of tissue adhesives in clinical situations commonly excluded in trials, specifically, wound closure in areas of high tension and in patients with general health that could potentially impair wound healing. Trials should be sufficiently powered to detect any differences in the rate of wound infection or dehiscence as statistically significant when comparing different incision closure devices. As any future trial would need to be large, it would probably be multicentred. It would require methodological rigour to address the outstanding uncertainties in this area appropriately. Development and validation of patient satisfaction and surgeon satisfaction questionnaires would be helpful.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Quote: <I>"Postoperative wound complications were similar for both groups. Five patients in the octylcyanoacrylate group had wound complications in 9 incisions. Two patients experienced skin separation in 5 incisions. One patient had a minor wound infection at one incision site treated with oral antibiotics. Two patients experienced small seromas at 2 incision sites, requiring incision opening and healing by secondary intention. We noted small seromas in 2 patients receiving suture closure. These healed by secondary intention after skin opening and drainage. Table 4 presents a summary of the results."</I>
</P>
<P>Comment: however the table shown does not compare rates of wound complication and the reporting of the outcomes is unclear, it is this author's judgement therefore that the risk of bias here is unclear</P>

<P>The Cochrane Wounds Group Trials Register has been compiled through searching of the major health databases including MEDLINE, Cinahl and EMBASE and is regularly updated through searching of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, handsearching of wound care journals and relevant conference proceedings. See: Collaborative review group search strategy (http:/www.cochranewounds.org).</P>

<P>Search strategies were developed for Medline and Embase and these search strategies combined a sensitive search strategy for RCTs revised from phases 1 and 2 of the Cochrane Sensitive Search Strategy for RCTs (as published in <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>c in the Cochrane Handbook). The subject search used a combination of controlled vocabulary and free text terms based on the search strategy for searching the Cochrane Wounds Group Trial Register.</P>
<P>LANGUAGE<BR/>There were no language restrictions.</P>
<P>UNPUBLISHED STUDIES<BR/>Authors of the identified RCTs were written to in order to obtain further information about the trial and to attempt to identify unpublished or ongoing studies. In addition, wound care product manufacturers were contacted.</P>
<P>HANDSEARCHING<BR/>Trials for Wounds Group Trials Register are identified by systematically handsearching specialised journals, relevant conference proceedings and abstracts. A list of journals currently being handsearched by the group may be found at http:/www.cochranewounds.org.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process provided to permit a judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information provided to permit a judgement of low or high risk of bias. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement, for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>
