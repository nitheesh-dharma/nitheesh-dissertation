<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-01 10:55:44 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Managed alcohol programmes (MAPs) are harm reduction initiatives that treat the alcohol abuse of vulnerable people by serving controlled amounts of alcohol on a daily schedule, with the goal of ensuring individuals consume safe alcoholic beverages in an environment that has been shown to retain vulnerable people in treatment programmes, decrease alcohol consumption and improve social functioning (decreasing criminal activity, seeking regular medical care and improving quality of life). As well as MAP, there are alternative interventions such as brief intervention, moderate drinking and abstinence oriented 12-step programmes. With the exception of 12-step programmes, which emphasise abstinence, these interventions are aimed at changing drinking patterns and reducing the associated behaviours. No experimental studies were available to demonstrate the effectiveness of MAPs in reducing alcohol use or antisocial behaviour compared with other treatments.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-10-01 11:00:44 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Managed alcohol programmes (MAP) are a harm reduction strategy used to minimise the personal harm and adverse societal effects that alcohol dependence can lead to by providing an alternative to zero-tolerance approaches that incorporate drinking goals (abstinence or moderation) that are compatible with the needs of the individual, and promoting access to services by offering low-threshold alternatives. This enables clients to gain access to services despite continued alcohol consumption and works to help the patient understand the risks involved in their behaviour and make decisions about their own treatment goals.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-10-01 10:55:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effectiveness of MAP treatment regimens (serving limited quantities of alcohol daily to alcoholics) on their own or as compared to moderate drinking (self-controlled drinking), screening and brief intervention using a harm reduction approach, traditional abstinence-based interventions (12 step programmes) and no intervention.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-10-01 10:55:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO up to March 2012. This search was expanded by handsearching of high-yield journals and conference proceedings that had not already been handsearched on behalf of The Cochrane Collaboration, searching reference lists of all papers and relevant reviews identified, references to ongoing and recently completed clinical trials in the National Research Register and IFPMA Clinical Trials Database (which contains ClinicalTrials.gov, Centerwatch, Current Controlled Trials and ClinicalStudyResults.gov, and Osservatorio Nazionale sulla Sperimentazione Clinica dei Medicinali). Trials registers, grey literature and reference lists were also searched. Individuals, organisations and experts in the field were contacted.</P>

<P>Randomised control trials (RCT), controlled clinical trials (CCT), interrupted time series (ITS) studies, and control before and after (CBA) studies involving vulnerable people aged 18 years or older who were at high risk for alcohol abuse attending MAP, defined as a structured programme that provided clients with controlled amounts of alcohol on a daily schedule, comparing no treatment, moderate drinking, brief intervention or 12-step variants.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-10-01 10:55:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All study citations were collated into a single database. Two review author independently screened titles and abstracts and selected references potentially relevant to the review. Differences between selection lists were resolved by discussion. Two review authors independently evaluated whether studies should be included or excluded according to the eligibility criteria. In the event of a disagreement, a third author was consulted.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-01 10:55:29 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No studies were included in the review. This systematic review was intended to assess the effectiveness of a brief MAP on the reduction of incidence of harmful behaviour; however, no evidence was available to make this comparison; 22 articles were considered possibly relevant and all were excluded. Most articles were excluded because they failed to compare or consider managed alcohol as the experimental or control intervention, as well as one study (<A HREF="Baker 2010">Baker 2010</A>), which was also excluded because study participants were under 18 years of age. No study reviewed offered an intervention that was compared with managed alcohol or considered it as the intervention of interest, providing insufficient evidence to address the objectives of the review. Four studies (<A HREF="Aalto 2001">Aalto 2001</A>; <A HREF="Baker 2010">Baker 2010</A>; <A HREF="Bertholet 2005">Bertholet 2005</A>; <A HREF="Tracy 2007">Tracy 2007</A>) considered alcohol reduction as an outcome of interest, while four engaged interventions in a shelter setting or targeted vulnerable people (<A HREF="Baker 2010">Baker 2010</A>; <A HREF="Bradford 2005">Bradford 2005</A>; <A HREF="Lapham 1993">Lapham 1993</A>; <A HREF="McGlynn 1993">McGlynn 1993</A>); only one study (<A HREF="Kidd 2011">Kidd 2011</A>) offered a qualitative assessment of a participant being admitted to MAP, but offered no analysis of the programme itself. These results accurately reflect the use of MAPs in current practice as existing programmes are ongoing only in a small number of sample pilot projects that target individuals with severe alcohol dependence or who consume non-beverage alcohol.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-10-01 10:55:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The lack of evidence does not allow for a conclusion regarding the efficacy of MAP on their own, or as compared to brief intervention, moderate drinking, no intervention or 12-step variants. It is the review authors' opinion that it is likely to be the objective of MAPs that reduce their reportability and use in current practice, rather than a failure to provide an intervention that reduces the effects of alcohol dependence. Aiming to reduce harmful or antisocial behaviour in vulnerable individuals through the regulation of daily alcohol intake, rather than reducing harmful alcohol intake over time, provides considerable difficulty in developing measures of success from self-reported data (low treatment thresholds), monitoring long-term efficacy or establishing causal links between programme admission and a reduction in targeted behaviours, owing to the fact that prolonged participation in the programme is likely to indicate a willingness in the individual to change their behaviour patterns. More effort is needed to develop reporting measures, as well as methodologies, which address these specific challenges.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-10-01 10:55:53 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Alcohol abuse is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition (<LINK REF="REF-DSM_x002d_IV-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM-IV 2001</LINK>) as a destructive pattern of alcohol use occurring within a 12-month period, resulting in repetitive maladaptive behaviour and leading to significant social, occupational or medical impairment. The alcohol abuser still has control over his/her use of alcohol and has not developed tolerance. Alcohol dependence (alcoholism) occurs when an individual has lost control over his/her use of alcohol and its consumption becomes the dominant focus in his/her life, causing deterioration of occupational, psychological, social functioning, or a combination. DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol dependence requires users to meet the criteria for alcohol abuse plus have three or more of the following: (1) tolerance - the need to increase amounts of alcohol consumed to achieve the desired effect; (2) withdrawal - the experience of physiological and psychological symptoms when alcohol consumption is stopped or use alcohol consumption to avoid or reduce specific symptoms, or both; (3) uncontrolled behaviour - alcohol is consumed in larger amounts or for longer than intended; (4) cravings - persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use; (5) a considerable amount of time is spent to procure, use or recover from the effects of alcohol consumption; (6) important social, occupational or recreational activities given up or reduced because of alcohol use; and (7) continues alcohol use despite knowledge of persistent physical or psychological problems worsened by alcohol.</P>
<P>Alcohol dependence is a fairly common disorder, with a prevalence of 2.6% in the general Canadian population (<LINK REF="REF-Tjepkema-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tjepkema 2004</LINK>). This prevalence increases in vulnerable populations to 5.1% in low-income households (annual income &lt; USD10,000), and 16.2% in people with mental illness (<LINK REF="REF-Kandel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandel 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tjepkema-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tjepkema 2004</LINK>). The World Health Organization (WHO) states that approximately 76.3 million people have alcohol-use disorders worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Alcoholic dependence is three to four times higher in individuals with a family history of alcohol abuse compared with the general population (<LINK REF="REF-DSM_x002d_IV-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM-IV 2001</LINK>). Furthermore, studies have found that alcohol abuse is as high as 53% to 73% in homeless adults (<LINK REF="REF-Cordray-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cordray 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farrell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gelberg--1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelberg 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>These figures are clinically and socially significant because alcohol misuse (abuse or dependence) influences not only the health and social outcomes of these individuals but also impacts their families, local communities and society at large. Alcohol dependence contributes to binge drinking, consumption of non-beverage alcohol (i.e. mouthwash, cleaning products, cough and cold remedies), violent behaviours, criminal behaviours, suicide, job instability, poor compliance with treatment, longer hospital stays, homelessness, public inebriation, increased emergency department visits and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Caton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caton 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amore-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amore 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egbert-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egbert 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hibbs-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hibbs 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kushel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kushel 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mandelberg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandelberg 2000</LINK>). WHO estimates that alcohol causes 3.2% of deaths worldwide, with a global cost to health above that of tobacco (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). Medical consequences of alcoholism include oesophageal cancer, liver cancer, chronic ulcers, cirrhosis of the liver, epilepsy, psychotic breakdown, increased rates of hospitalisation and shorter life expectancy (<LINK REF="REF-Hibbs-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hibbs 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kushel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kushel 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-10-01 10:56:04 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Managed alcohol programmes (MAP) are harm reduction initiatives that treat the alcohol abuse of vulnerable people by serving controlled amounts of alcohol on a daily schedule, with the primary goal of improving social functioning (decreasing criminal activity, seeking regular medical care and improving quality of life) in an environment that has been shown to retain vulnerable people in treatment programmes and decrease alcohol consumption. MAPs have gained attention as a treatment for alcohol dependence in vulnerable people as a result of more traditional interventions, such as 12-step variants, brief intervention and moderate drinking, having proved unsuccessful in effectively engaging that population (<LINK REF="REF-Ambrogne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ambrogne 2002</LINK>). MAPs target patients with severe alcohol dependence who are chronically homeless, unstably housed or chronically street involved, who have not been able to benefit from more traditional alcohol interventions and are considered refractory to treatment; there are four known MAPs that operate in a variety of settings, two which use a 'drop in' system whereby enrolled patients visit a homeless shelter to receive their alcohol, one where MAP patients are embedded within a larger residential facility and one residential unit that caters specifically to MAP patients.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-10-01 10:56:09 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The theory that underpins the provision of managed alcohol as an intervention is that severe alcohol dependence impairs the ability of the individual to control the amount of alcohol ingested and that the application of external controls (regular administration of a set amount of alcohol) will allow the person to avoid some of the harms associated with excessive alcohol intake; the intervention is specifically designed to address the criteria that constitute alcohol dependence. The issues of tolerance, craving, withdrawal and uncontrolled behaviour are addressed by matching the dose of alcohol provided to the individual needs of the patient avoiding withdrawal, cravings or inebriation. Establishing an alcohol administration schedule should then allow the patient to avoid spending time procuring alcohol, and hopefully restore their capacity to participate in social, family or occupational activities and acknowledge the propensity of an individual to continue to use alcohol despite knowledge of its harmful impact.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-10-01 10:56:15 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A review to evaluate the efficacy of managed alcohol against more conventional interventions for alcohol dependence is important for three reasons. First, MAP is a novel intervention and has, to the best of our knowledge, never been assessed in a systematic way by itself or against any conventional intervention. Second, vulnerable people are disproportionately affected by the social, economic and health burden that alcohol dependence impresses; the failure of more widespread abstinence or patient-led alcohol moderation initiatives to engage this population in treatment indicates that alternative methodologies are required and that they can only be applied effectively through rigorous assessment. Most importantly, MAP and other harm reduction approaches mark an important disjunction from past conceptions of substance abuse treatment as a public health issue. A practical paradigm shift is taking place for vulnerable patients exhibiting severe and persistent substance abuse behaviour; having failed to benefit from conventional forms of substance abuse treatment, expressed in an ongoing cycle of treatment and relapse, those most affected are being engaged instead in a manner which, recognising the inherent harm of the act, promotes the regulation of using behaviour in a safe environment as a means of raising the level of an individual's social functioning, rather than the prioritisation of ending the harmful using behaviour, as a means of improving an individual's quality of life.</P>

<P>Vulnerable people aged 18 years or older who were at high risk for alcohol abuse were included. Alcohol abuse was defined here according to the WHO International Classification of Diseases (<LINK REF="REF-ICD-10-R-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICD 10 R 2007</LINK>). In this, alcohol abuse or alcoholism includes craving, physiological signs such as tolerance and withdrawal, and behavioural indicators such as the use of alcohol to relieve withdrawal discomfort, as well as harmful use, implying alcohol use that causes either physical or mental damage in the absence of dependence. Vulnerable populations considered at high risk include those who are homeless, impoverished, mentally ill, those with a family history of alcohol addiction, family dysfunction or disruption, foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and past exposure to trauma. These include people with multiple drug addictions and co-morbidities including mental health problems.</P>

<P>Risk of bias assessment for RCTs and CCTs in this review would have been performed using the criteria recommended by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in a Cochrane review is a two-part tool, addressing seven specific domains, namely sequence generation andallocation concealment selection bias), blinding of participants and providers (performance bias), blinding of outcome assessor (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective outcome reporting (reporting bias) and other source of bias. The first part of the tool would have involved describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool would have involved assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry, in terms of low, high or unclear risk. To make these judgements we would have used the criteria indicated by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) adapted to the addiction field. See <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK> for details. The domains of sequence generation and allocation concealment (avoidance of selection bias) would have been addressed in the tool by a single entry for each study. Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessor (avoidance of performance bias and detection bias) would have been considered separately for objective outcomes (e.g. drop-out, use of substance of abuse measured by urine analysis, subjects relapsed at the end of follow-up, subjects engaged in further treatments) and subjective outcomes (e.g. duration and severity of signs and symptoms of withdrawal, patient self-reported use of substance, side effects, social functioning as integration at school or at work, family relationship). Incomplete outcome data (avoidance of attrition bias) would have been considered for all outcomes except for the drop-out from the treatment, which is very often the primary outcome measure in trials on addiction.</P>

<P>This systematic review was intended to assess the effectiveness of managed alcohol on the reduction of incidence of harmful behaviour such as binge drinking, substance abuse, violence/aggression, drinking non-beverage alcohol, failure to adhere to medication, incarceration, death, reduction in drinking - self reported or programme data and abstinence; as well as reduction in incidence of anti-social behaviour, begging, violence, aggression, sex trade work, criminal activity, disruption in the community, public inebriation and social functioning. However, no evidence from RCTs was available to make this comparison; 22 articles were considered possibly relevant and all were excluded. Twenty-one articles were excluded because they did not consider MAP as the experimental or control intervention or did not offer an intervention; one study (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2010</LINK>) was excluded because study participants were under 18 years of age, while another (<LINK REF="STD-Kidd-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kidd 2011</LINK>) was excluded because, while it offered a qualitative assessment of one participant being admitted to MAP, it offered no analysis of the programme itself. Only four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aalto-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Aalto 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bertholet-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bertholet 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tracy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tracy 2007</LINK>) considered alcohol reduction as an outcome of interest, while four deployed an intervention in a shelter setting, or targeted vulnerable people (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bradford-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bradford 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lapham-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lapham 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGlynn-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McGlynn 1993</LINK>). One article (<LINK REF="STD-Kidd-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kidd 2011</LINK>) evaluated a MAP; however, this was a qualitative case study of one person's experience in the transition from street life through admission into the programme, and did not meet the study design eligibility criteria. The lack of evidence may be appropriate given the divergent outcomes of interest of MAP against brief intervention, 12-step variants and moderate drinking; a comparison of a programme that aims to reduce harmful behaviour by mediating alcohol intake to one that aims solely to reduce or eliminate harmful alcohol intake may be incompatible given the difficulty in comparing the outcomes of interest, and that the level of alcohol intake where participants in MAP begin to see success would likely be considered as harmful drinking behaviour in a brief intervention, 12-step, or moderate drinking programme. The results of this review reflects the use of MAPs in current practice; MAPs are largely ongoing in small sample pilot projects that target individuals with severe alcohol dependence or who consume non-beverage alcohol.</P>

<P>A strength of this review is that it is likely that all relevant materials regarding managed alcohol were considered. An unlikely limitation of the review is the possibility that articles not translated into English were missed during the initial search for abstracts (owing to the small number of MAPs operating). Possibility of searching, study selection, data collection or data analysis bias is not possible given that no studies were included in the review. A weakness is the type of studies considered for comparison; RCTs, CCTs or CCT with control groups may be inappropriate evaluation designs for MAPs given that withholding services could constitute doing harm to the control group. Although it could be argued that there is, as yet, no basis for presuming harm owing to the withholding of services, given that the efficacy of MAP has not been evaluated, the review authors can attest anecdotally that the opinion of the staff of every MAP in operation is that they believe the intervention is effective and that withholding services would constitute harm.</P>

</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-10-01 11:00:26 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the widespread problem of antisocial behaviour as a consequence of alcohol abuse in vulnerable populations in major cities and the paucity of research, evaluation studies of MAPs are needed. It is the review authors' opinion that it is likely that the objective of MAPs that reduce their reportability and use in current practice rather than the programme's failure to produce results. Aiming to reduce antisocial behaviour in vulnerable individuals through the regulation of daily alcohol intake rather than reducing harmful alcohol intake over time provides considerable difficulty in developing measures of success from self-reported data (variable treatment thresholds), monitoring long-term efficacy or establishing causal links between programme admission and a reduction in targeted behaviours owing simply to the fact that prolonged participation in the programme is likely to indicate a willingness in the individual to change their behaviour patterns. More effort is needed to develop reporting measures, as well as methodologies, which address these specific challenges. As mentioned above, it may be problematic to compare MAP to interventions that seek to reduce harmful alcohol consumption over time, given the disparate outcomes of interest; equally, it may be inappropriate to use study designs that employ control groups given the possibility of doing harm to the control group by withholding treatment. As a suggestion to researchers interested in conducting studies involving MAP, the evaluation methodology should incorporate a longitudinal design; consider the daily measurement of alcohol dispensed as the exposure variable; adjust for known confounders such as other substance use, change in living environment and willingness to participate in other related services within the programme; and should consider carefully which dependent variables are evaluated given the small number of participants in MAPs and low statistical power that implies; to this last point, researchers may wish to consider the evaluation of variables that reflect improvements in health status as a distinct research project from metrics of antisocial behaviour, despite their inter-relation. An ITS design, given its use in other harm reduction settings, may be an appropriate study design for MAPs if comparable services (without daily alcohol distribution) are available to participants before programme admission; equally, a prospective nested case-control may be feasible in MAPs with a very small number of participants enrolled and a large number awaiting enrolment, or in an environment where the programme provided no other specialised services than the daily distribution of alcohol.</P>
