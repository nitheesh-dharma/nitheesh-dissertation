<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-11 02:08:15 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included eight studies with 11,164 participants but one study did not provide enough data to be useful. One study from Africa found a strong increase in uptake of Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) to 51% when delivered on-site which was 14 times more compared to a voucher for off-site testing. However, VCT did not change HIV incidence in one study among African factory workers. In another study among HongKong truck drivers, VCTdecreased self-reported sexually transmitted diseases (STD) but VCT did not decrease unprotected sex significantly. Education was studied among soldiers in Nigeria, Angola and the US, truck drivers in India and factory workers in Thailand.. Education that was modelled after a motivational theory reduced STDs with 32%, decreased unprotected sex with a small amount, reduced sex with a commercial sex worker with 12% but did not decrease the number of partners or the habit of using alcohol before sex.</P>
<P>We concluded that workplace interventions for preventing HIV are feasible and that it is possible to study them in a randomised controlled trial. Peer influence has a positive effect on VCT uptake and workplace interventions can change risky sexual behaviour to a moderate degree. More randomised trials are needed in high risk groups or in areas with high HIV prevalence to find more effective interventions.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-04-27 02:58:07 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found 8 RCTs with 11,164 participants but one study did not provide enough data. Studies compared VCT to no VCT and education to no intervention and to alternative education.</P>
<P>VCT uptake increased to 51% when provided at the workplace compared to a voucher for VCT (RR=14.0 (95% CI 11.8 to16.7)). After VCT, self-reported STD decreased (RR = 0.10 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.73)) but HIV incidence (RR=1.4 (95% CI 0.7 to 2.7)) and unprotected sex (RR=0.71 (0.48 to 1.06)) did not decrease significantly. .</P>
<P>Education reduced STDs (RR = 0.68 (95%CI 0.48 to 0.96)), unprotected sex (Standardised Mean Difference (SMD)= -0.17 (95% CI -0.29 to -0.05), sex with a commercial sex worker (RR = 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.96) but not multiple sexual partners (Mean Difference (MD) = -0.22 (95% CI -0.52 to 0.08) nor use of alcohol before sex (MD = -0.01 (95% CI of -0.11 to 0.08).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-04-12 06:52:25 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Jos H Verbeek">
<P>Workplace interventions to prevent HIV are feasible. There is moderate quality evidence that VCT offered at the work site increases the uptake of testing. Even though this did no lower HIV-incidence, there was a decrease in self-reported sexual transmitted diseases and a decrease in risky sexual behaviour. There is low quality evidence that educational interventions decrease sexually transmitted diseases, unprotected sex and sex with commercial sex workers but not sex with multiple partners and the use of alcohol before sex.</P>
<P>More and better randomised trials are needed directed at high risk groups such as truck drivers or workers in areas with a very high HIV prevalence such as Southern Africa. Risky sexual behaviour should be measured in a standardised way.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-09 00:26:21 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Jos H Verbeek">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-11-09 00:26:21 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Jos H Verbeek">
<P>Human Immunodefiency Virus (HIV) is a chronic infectious disease with a very high mortality, if untreated HIV infection constitutes a heavy burden on the health of the people. Infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus results eventually in AIDS in untreated infected patients. The virus is transmitted from one person to another through contact of mucous membranes or directly in the blood stream of an HIV infected body fluid such as semen, vaginal fluid, breast milk, blood or pre-seminal fluid. Exposure to these body fluids occurs through sexual intercourse, blood transfusion, contaminated needles or other sharp objects or through transmission from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding.</P>
<P>Even though there is considerable achievement in the fight against HIV/AIDS, in terms of reduction in number of new infections and deaths from AIDS-related illnesses, the impact of HIV in the community and the work environment is great. The number of people living with HIV continues to grow and in 2008 an estimated 33.4 million people worldwide are living with HIV, which is 20% more than it was in 2000 and roughly a threefold increase over the prevalence in 1990 (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2009</LINK>). The impact of the disease on the workforce is very serious for the affected countries. For example in Zambia in 1998, deaths of teachers equalled two-thirds of the number of graduates from teacher training colleges. In Thailand, a third of rural families affected by HIV/AIDS reported a 50% drop in their agricultural output (<LINK REF="REF-ILO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILO 2002</LINK>). According to ILO, between 1992 and 2004, the economy of 31 sub-Saharan countries heavily affected by HIV/AIDS shrunk by about 0.7% per year which was associated with a decreased labor supply due to HIV/AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-ILO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILO 2006</LINK>). Workers in occupational settings other than health workers and commercial sex-workers are equally exposed to the risk of contracting the disease like other groups in the community. However, some occupations may be at a higher risk than others, especially jobs with high mobility e.g. those in the military, truck drivers and those working in the transport sector or in the fishing and tourism industries (<LINK REF="REF-Pandley-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandley 2008</LINK> ). Various studies have classified long distance truck drivers and their assistants, bar/hotel workers as critical sources of HIV risk and transmission (<LINK REF="REF-Nzyuko-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nzyuko 1991 </LINK>
<LINK REF="REF-Plummer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plummer 1991</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Bwayo-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bwayo 1994</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Stratford-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stratford 2000</LINK>). Migrant workers who leave their spouses to work abroad are also vulnerable to contract the virus and transmit it to their sexual partners when they return home (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2001a</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Saggurti-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saggurti 2009</LINK>). Their vulnerability is compounded by poverty and low level of HIV awareness and its prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Islam-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Islam 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-04-22 04:33:23 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the improvement in treatment and survival of HIV infection, there is still no cure for the disease and pharmacological approaches to prevention such as used in post-exposure prophylaxis or prevention of mother to child transmission are still in its infancy or not feasible to be used on a large scale (<LINK REF="REF-Mayer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayer 2010</LINK>). Prevention of HIV transmission, thus, still relies on behavioral risk prevention interventions, which employs educational and modification of behavior approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Darbes-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darbes 2009</LINK>). Behavioral interventions for reducing HIV infection aim to produce changes in behaviour that increases the risk of contracting HIV. This is achieved by directly targeting the high risk sexual behaviour such as sex without the use of condoms or through the promotion of uptake of specific prevention or health-seeking behavior such as Voluntary Counseling and Testing for HIV (VCT) (Manhart 2005). This can be done at individual or at the group/community level (<LINK REF="REF-ILO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILO 2002</LINK>).The workplace creates the possibility to easily reach persons who have similar high risk behaviours because of the nature of their work. The occupational setting and occupational health services, thus, offer a good environment to provide HIV preventive services and interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Charalambous-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charalambous 2004</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-05-08 11:15:04 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is growing evidence that the reduction in HIV incidence in some countries can be linked to behavioral changes which are the result of behavioral intervention programs (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Darbes-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darbes 2009</LINK>).There are many theories and models about how behavioral change occurs. The most common models and theories on which behavioural interventions are built include the Information-Motivation-Behavioural skills (IMB) model (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2009</LINK>), the Social Cognitive Theory (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 2001</LINK>) and Theory of Reasoned action (<LINK REF="REF-Ajzen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ajzen 2007</LINK>). Even though the details of the theories are different, they have similar ideas. They aim to change factors believed to be predictors of behavior, such as health beliefs (the risk of contracting HIV is negligible), cognitions (HIV is not an important risk for me), attitudes (nothing wrong with multiple partners), social norms (no sex before marriage) or skills (negotiation for safe sex). This involves conveying information to the target groups through education, training and counselling which could be done at individual or at group level. In the same vein, behavioral interventions for preventing HIV aim at changing these factors in order to reduce risky sexual behavior. In addition, based on economic theory, incentives such as monetary or non-monetary stimuli can be used to influence behaviour such as free condoms.</P>
<P>In the context of this review, we are concerned only with risky sexual behaviour such as unprotected sex with a partner whose status is unknown, multiple sexual partnerships, drinking alcohol before having sex and sex with commercial sex workers (<LINK REF="REF-ILO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILO 2002</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-11-09 00:25:30 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review will focus on behavioral interventions to reduce risky sexual behaviour of workers to reduce the heterosexual transmission of HIV infection. There have been systematic reviews about the effectiveness of behavioral interventions to prevent HIV among health workers, sex workers and other population subgroups (<LINK REF="REF-Parantainen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parantainen 2008</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Kondagunta-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kondagunta 2009</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2008</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Naranbhai-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naranbhai 2011</LINK>). However, there has been no review of studies done for workers in general, who have an important role in the economy and well being of the society. Thus, this study sought to fill this gap in knowledge.</P>
<P>Also, despite the substantial funding and resources put into the workplace HIV prevention programmes, there is little evidence to show the impact of these interventions, this further justifies the reason for this review.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2011-04-22 04:33:23 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials regardless whether they were randomised at the individual or at the group level such as cluster randomised trials. We also intended to include cross-over trials but we found none. Even though it is more difficult to perform randomised trials in the occupational setting, we did not include non-randomised studies because behavioural interventions usually can be randomised at the individual level or the group level.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2011-04-15 18:19:41 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Workers who are either employees because they are hired to perform tasks for an employer or workers who do not have a regular employment contract but who are at higher risk of contracting HIV through their occupation. The following occupations are reported to be at higher risk: people working in transport, fishing and seafaring, tourism industries, migrant workers and military personnel (<LINK REF="REF-Pandley-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandley 2008</LINK>). Because it is possible that workers are at risk of HIV through other risky behaviours such as intravenous drug use or through men having sex with men, we assumed that this would not play a major role in workers if this would not be explicitly reported.</P>
<P>We excluded health care workers at risk through sharp object injuries and sex workers because interventions aiming at these groups have been reviewed already (<LINK REF="REF-Parantainen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parantainen 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kondagunta-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kondagunta 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-05-11 02:12:52 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included studies on behavioral interventions which are defined as interventions that are (1) tailored to reduce high risk sexual behaviours such as unprotected sex and multiple partners, sex with commercial sex workers, and (2) to improve uptake of voluntary counselling and testing (VCT). We included Voluntary testing and counselling because it is known to change behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2006</LINK>)</P>
<P>Behavioral interventions can be categorized into individual-level or group-level interventions based on the following characteristics.</P>
<P>Individual-level Interventions operate mainly on personal modifying factors such as knowledge, attitudes, intentions, skills and self esteem. This includes voluntary counselling and testing, counselling without HIV testing, individual cognitive behavioral therapy, couple counselling, telephone help-lines or interactive Internet based interventions.</P>
<P>Group level interventions not only utilize the personal modifying factors but also use the advantage of the characteristics of the cohort/group to influence peer perception, attitude and behavior about safe sex and condom use. Group level interventions focus on the community or group of people, with interventions delivered to small groups in the work place.</P>
<P>We also categorized interventions according to the stage of the epidemic when the study was done: early stage interventions done before the year 2000 and later stage interventions done after the year 2000. This is because the impact of employer interventions may vary according to the stage of the epidemic, and the level of knowledge in the general population.</P>
<P>Behavioural interventions are usually complex and contain various components. Thus, we extensively described the components of the interventions to be able to see if there are any components that could imply higher effectiveness. Such components of behavioural intervention include: skills training on correct condom use, negotiation for safer sex, condom distribution or promotion, counselling with or without HIV testing, couple counselling, small group discussion on promotion of safe sex, role play, cognitive behavioral therapy, workplace-based sex education, telephone help-lines, interactive Internet based interventions e.g. chat rooms. We also described the number of sessions, their length and intensity. This is shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>
</P>
<P>In addition, we intended to categorize interventions as economic incentives if they made use of monetary or non-monetary means to induce non-risky sexual behaviour but we did not find these interventions.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2011-11-09 00:19:31 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies which measured the effect of the intervention on the following were included:</P>
<P>1.<I> Indicators of high risk sexual behavior.</I> We used the following imitative number of categories of risky sexual behaviour:unprotected sex defined as the proportion of sex acts without male or female condoms, multiple partners defined as more than one sexual relationship at the same time, sex with commercial sex workers, unprotected sex with commercial sex workers and alcohol use before sex. The outcomes can be self-reported or based on an objective measure such as the number of condoms used. </P>
<P>Authors of the included studies asked many different questions about risky sexual behaviour and they used a widely varying terminology to describe similar outcomes and also measured the same outcomes with multiple questions. To avoid reporting similar outcomes more than once we mapped the outcomes reported in the included studies to one or more of the risky sexual behaviour categories mentioned above. We did so without knowledge of the effect of the intervention on the outcomes. For each study we used only one outcome from each category and we used the outcome that in our view best fitted the category. The various outcomes based on questions asked from the study participants and the corresponding categories in this review are described in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2011-05-11 04:23:03 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Jos H Verbeek">
<P>Different sources of published and unpublished research literature were searched to locate studies relevant to behavioral interventions for reducing HIV risk or infection in occupational settings. For constructing a relevant search strategy we sought for search terms for the following concepts. For HIV, we adopted the search strategy of the HIV-Review Group. For workers we adopted the search strategy developed by the OSH Review Group. For RCTs we used the most sensitive and precision maximizing search strategy as advocated by the CC (2008 revision,<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2011</LINK>) . To exclude health care workers at risk we used 'sharps OR needle stick'. To exclude sex workers we used 'sex workers'. </P>
<P>We searched all the databases listed below and adapted the PubMed strategy in the protocol to the other databases. The date of the last search was 19 November 2010. In March 2011, we realised that some authors did not use the words "occupation" or "work" which are the two main items to locate studies in occupational settings but that some of them only used the specific words for that occupation such as truck driver or marine. Therefore, we did an additional search for the following occupations with a known increased risk of contracting HIV: soldiers, seafarers, fishermen, long-distance truck drivers and bartenders in PubMed, CENTRAL, Embase, and PsycINFO and also updated the former searches in these main databases. The date of the last search was thus 18th March 2011. Details of the search strategies can be found in the Appendices (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-09" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 9</LINK>).</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-11-09 00:22:37 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Jos H Verbeek">
<P>Results of each trial were calculated as point estimates, risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with the 95% CI, and means and standard deviations (SD) for continuous outcomes. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were used for pooling outcome data from different instruments deemed similar enough for comparison.</P>
<P>We arranged all outcomes in such a way that a higher score indicated a more risky sexual behaviour and if necessary we recalculated the outcomes to achieve this. <LINK REF="STD-Lau-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2010</LINK> reported the consistent use of condoms for those who had sex with a non-regular partner and sex with commercial sex workers. We assumed that the rest of the group that reported to have sex with a non-regular partner or a commercial sex worker belonged to our category unprotected sex. We used these figures in the data-analysis for this study. <LINK REF="STD-Cornmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cornmann 2007</LINK> reported a mean of five point scale for frequency of condom use with a non-marital partner ranging from never (1) to always (5). We reversed the score for the intervention and the control group to get a measure for the amount of unprotected sex.</P>
<P>Risky sexual behaviour per category could be reported both as a continuous or a dichotomous outcome e.g. the number of unprotected sex acts or having had unprotected sex yes or no. We reported these separately and refrained from recalculating the dichotomous outcomes into effect sizes because we felt that this would make the results too difficult to interpret.</P>
<P>For studies that reported outcome data at more than one follow up time, we choose the last follow up time. Most of the studies had only two follow measurements apart from baseline, so the second follow up was used.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2011-05-08 11:17:47 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We checked if studies that employed a cluster-randomised design and reported sufficient data to be included in the meta-analysis made an allowance for the design effect. We included four cluster randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bing-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bing 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuchaisit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kuchaisit 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Bing-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bing 2008</LINK> used a hierarchical mixed linear model with random subject effects and we thus assumed that they adjusted for the cluster effect. <LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Boyer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boyer 2004</LINK> used robust standard errors that took the clustering into account. <LINK REF="STD-Kuchaisit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kuchaisit 1996</LINK> did not account for the clustering but the confidence intervals were already wide and therefore we decided not to further widen them.</P>

<P>We tried to contact <LINK REF="STD-Bassett-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bassett 1998</LINK> to obtain data missing in their reports which were needed for meta-analysis but without success. For Bassette study we did not get any tangible data from the abstract that was presented at a conference in which the only conclusion was that there was a significant difference and no other numbers. Due to the lack of data, the results of this study have not further been taken into account in this review. We also contacted <LINK REF="STD-Kuchaisit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kuchaisit 1996</LINK> and we received the master thesis on which the reports were based and we extracted data from the thesis. We used the data at three month follow-up as the outcome data. For <LINK REF="STD-Cornmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cornmann 2007</LINK>, we did not have the standard deviation (SD) from the result data and therefore we calculated the SD from the P-value and the ANCOVA F-value according to the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) in chapter 7.7.3.3.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-04-22 04:33:23 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>First, we assessed clinical homogeneity based on the similarity of the intervention, control condition, outcome, population and follow-up time. 'Similarity' of interventions was determined by review authors by assessing whether the interventions in question (e.g. educational programmes and counselling) could reasonably be supposed to yield similar effects across different populations. </P>
<P>We decided that VCT was different from other educational programmes. </P>
<P>Even though the control conditions for the VCT interventions were not the same we deemed the result of these control conditions sufficiently similar to be combined. In one study the control group received a voucher for VCT but hardly any of these used the voucher and thus this was similar to no VCT. In another study VCT was compared to brief information which lasted a couple of minutes only but without VCT. Therefore we considered only one comparison of VCT versus no VCT for the risky sexual behaviour outcomes. For the uptake of testing we could only use one study that compared two different ways of offering VCT and for this outcome this was a different comparison.</P>
<P>We considered all educational interventions that used a similar theory of IMB as similar. All studies used a control group which they provided with alternative information and therefore these studies were all combined in one comparison.</P>
<P>We also tested for statistical heterogeneity by means of the chi square test as implemented in the forest plots in RevMan 5. We set the significance level at P &lt; 0.10 to indicate if there is a problem with heterogeneity. In addition, we quantified the degree of heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> measure where an I<SUP>2 </SUP>value &gt; 50% indicates a moderate degree of heterogeneity and a value of &gt; 75% a high degree of heterogeneity.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-04-22 04:33:23 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In order to reduce the effects of reporting bias we included studies and not articles. For articles reporting on the same study, we extracted relevant data from the articles but reported them as being from the same study. This is the case in <LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2006</LINK>, we extracted uptake of VCT from Corbett 2006 and HIV incidence from Corbett 2007, and they have a single study identity as <LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2006</LINK>. To prevent location bias we searched multiple databases. Language bias was prevented by not excluding any article based on language restrictions. We checked for outcome reporting bias as part of the quality assessment.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-11-09 00:05:03 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Jos H Verbeek">
<P>We pooled data from studies judged to be clinically homogeneous with RevMan 5 software.</P>
<P>Where risky sexual behaviour was measured in the same category, we combined studies using mean differences. Where measurements of the same concept were different such as for unprotected sex, we used standardised mean differences (SMDs). To make the SMDs more readily interpretable we recalculated the pooled SMD into an MD by multiplying the SMD by the median SD taken from included studies using the question of number of unprotected sex acts with occasional partners. When I<SUP>2</SUP> was more than 50% we used a random-effects model in the meta-analysis.<BR/>We used the GRADE approach as described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) to present the quality of evidence. We listed all the comparisons and outcomes in an additional table and added our judgement of the five quality dimensions (limitations, heterogeneity, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias) for each particular comparison and outcome (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). We did so to make our rating of the quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, very low) more transparent.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">GRADE</HEADING>
<P>The quality of evidence for comparisons that were based on one study only was downgraded with one level because of imprecision and in case of a study with a high risk of bias with another level to low quality evidence. For other comparisons and outcomes that included more studies, we downgraded the evidence with two levels because of a high risk of bias in the included studies (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>)</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>There were two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lau-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2010</LINK>) with a low risk of bias that could be included in the sensitivity analysis. The two studies employed VCT as the intervention, this means that the results of the VCT intervention still hold when only studies with low risk of bias are included. It also means that for other interventions, no strong conclusions are possible.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Heterogeneity/ Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>The PICO elements of the included studies varied. The most prominent variation is that in baseline rates of risky sexual behaviour when it is measured. The average number of multiple partners varied with a factor 100 and unprotected sex with a factor 20. Even though this did not prevent us from combining studies, it is conceivable that this would influence the efficacy of the interventions. When risky behaviour is very frequent it will be easier to decrease it than when this is not the case. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Cornmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cornmann 2007</LINK> seems to confirm this with much higher effect sizes though the intervention was shorter than the studies among military. However, the number of studies was too small to perform a formal subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>Occupations included in this review varied also from more or less self-employed truck drivers to a very hierarchical military structure. Also here it is conceivable that the effects of interventions will be different. Due to the small number of studies this could not be tested in a subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>We planned to do a subgroup analysis comparing studies based on year of epidemiology. We have 2 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kuchaisit-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kuchaisit 1996</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Bassett-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bassett 1998</LINK>) done at the early stage of the HIV epidemic. We have data from the latter but it uses education without theoretical background, so it was difficult to compare with other studies that used education and training skills with theoretical background (based on IMB model).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-09 00:09:53 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Jos H Verbeek">
<P>There was moderate quality evidence that on site VCT leads to a higher test uptake through the effect of peer interaction. Even though VCT did not lead to a lower but possibly even to a higher HIV incidence in one RCT, there was moderate quality evidence in another trial that VCT lead to a decrease in the incidence of self-reported sexually transmitted diseases and risky sexual behaviour such as unprotected sex and alcohol use before sex but there was no decrease in sex with commercial sex workers.</P>
<P>There was low quality evidence that educational interventions, when based on the IMB model, reduced sexually transmitted diseases, unprotected sex and sex with commercial sex workers but there was no significant decrease in sex with multiple sexual partners nor in use of alcohol before sex . An educational intervention in one other trial not based on the IMB model did not result in changes, but the attrition was so large that we did not trust the result.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-05-11 02:05:15 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included eight RCTs, but one was not usable due to lack of data. Thus our review has shown that workplace behavioral interventions can be evaluated in RCTs. We had difficulty in locating all studies because we used general search terms for work and occupation while many authors used only the specific occupation such as truck drivers or military. Because of the additional searches for a number of important occupations at risk for HIV, we feel confident that we covered all the available studies. The trials that we found were pragmatic and conducted under real life conditions. Therefore, we conclude that behavioural interventions are feasible in work places. In one trial it was demonstrated that there was an effect of peers upon the uptake of testing and other trials all used small group discussions to increase the effectiveness of the intervention. Risky sexual behaviour was also similar for similar occupational groups and therefore easier to target. These trials show that the workplace as the arena for intervention certainly offers benefits over a more general population approach.</P>
<P>There were four studies from Africa and three from Asia and one from the United States. More studies were conducted in Africa but none of these other studies were randomised and thus not included in this review (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). There were no studies from South Africa even though this is a fairly industrialized African country with a very high HIV prevalence among workers and this would thus offer a good opportunity for workplace interventions. There is literature that these are conducted but apparently these are not evaluated in randomised trials. (<LINK REF="STD-William-2003" TYPE="STUDY">William 2003</LINK>
</P>
<P>Participants were both men and women and important occupations at higher risk of contracting HIV were covered such as truck drivers in two studies and military in three studies. Risky sexual behaviour varied greatly in these studies with 95% of truck drivers in India mentioning having sex with commercial sex workers against 50% of the truck drivers in HongKong. The mean number of sexual partners in the past three months was again largest in Indian truck drivers with 18, smallest in male Angolan soldiers with 0.2 and in between with 1.5 in female Nigerian soldiers.</P>
<P>The educational interventions varied from a single session (<LINK REF="STD-Cornmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cornmann 2007</LINK>) to five full day sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Essien-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Essien 2010</LINK>). Most educational interventions had multiple components and covered the various aspects considered important in influencing risky sexual behaviour such as negotiation skills or skills in using condoms. The interventions were also focused on the target groups and were sometimes preceded by extensive focus group studies to make the information as relevant as possible.</P>
<P>All important outcomes that we envisaged in our protocol were measured even though not in all studies at the same time. There were three studies that measured incidence of HIV or STI. The study that measured HIV incidence postulated that VCT could increase risky sexual behaviour but that study did not measure risky sexual behaviour. There was however no evidence in another study that used VCT as the intervention that there would have been an increase in risky sexual behaviour after VCT. In all but one study, risky sexual behavior was measured and we could map all risky sexual behaviours to one or more of the four categories that we considered the most important behavioural outcomes.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-11-09 00:06:50 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Jos H Verbeek">
<P>We found only 2 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lau-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2010</LINK>) with low risk of bias, while the remaining 6 studies had a high risk of bias. Judged overall, the quality of the evidence was low (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Problematic was that most studies used multiple questions to measure risky sexual behaviour without a priori concretely defining their primary outcome. We tried to avoid reporting bias by defining risky sexual behaviour in four categories and mapping the questions from the trials to these four categories. There was certainly selective reporting as <LINK REF="STD-Corbett-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Corbett 2006</LINK> intended to use absenteeism and TB as their primary outcome measures according to their registered protocol whereas they reported only VCT-uptake and HIV incidence. The authors did not reply to our various requests for more information. Also in other studies it was not always clear which outcomes were measured and reported. Standardisation of measurement of risky sexual behaviour is necessary to be better able to interpret the results of studies.</P>
<P>We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence for the pooled data, in view of risk of bias, heterogeneity, indirecteness, precision and publication bias (using funnel plots). See .</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-11-09 00:15:32 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We believe that we prevented language bias by not excluding any study based on language. Reporting bias was avoided by including studies and not articles.</P>
<P>We tried to avoid reporting multiple outcomes for the same study by mapping the outcomes to five categories of risky sexual behaviour. The category that we considered most important was unprotected sex with non-regular partners. This was however ill-defined in the included studies. In our view, this should be measured by the proportion of unprotected sex acts of all sex acts. It was however measured as the number of unprotected sex acts or the frequency of condom use which we all deemed similar as indicators of unprotected sex.</P>
<P>We combined studies with only male and only female participants and we also disregarded differences in occupations, because we believe that the intervention would work similarly in these groups and because there was no appreciable statistical heterogeneity in the meta-analysis. Because there were few studies only, we could not perform a subgroup analysis to elaborate potential differences in effect in these subgroups.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-05-11 02:40:03 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Uptake of VCT was higher at the workplace which compares favourably to the results of another Cochrane Review that studied home-based versus other VCT models. This review found that uptake at a local hospital was higher contrary to expectations (<LINK REF="REF-Bateganya-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bateganya 2010</LINK>). The uptake in the included study was 51.1% which is much higher than the 20% to 23% uptake reported in other workplace VCT programmes elsewhere in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Borght-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Borght 2010</LINK>). In this study, the author report that special campaigns or events immediately increase the uptake of VCT and this might explain the difference in uptake between the two studies. Another Cochrane review showed that media campaigns lead to an immediate increase in the uptake of testing (<LINK REF="REF-Vidanapathirana-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vidanapathirana 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the included studies reports a non-significant higher incidence of HIV among the intervention group having intensive on-site VCT. The authors speculate that this could be due to the fact that people are more likely to engage in high risk sexual behavior after a negative test result. This was not supported by another VCT study in our review that on the contrary showed a reduction for several behavioural indicators. Another study not included in this review showed that HIV seropositive individuals tend to show up earlier for workplace VCT than HIV negative colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Borght-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Borght 2010</LINK>). This finding does also not indicate that VCT leads to more risky sexual behaviour. Therefore we believe that our findings support the approach to VCT advocated by the ILO as one of the prevention methods to enable workers to know their HIV status (<LINK REF="REF-ILO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILO 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Behavioural interventions have been shown to change risky sexual behaviour in other target groups. A Cochrane review showed a reduction of 27% of unprotected anal sex in men who have sex with men after behavioural interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2008</LINK>). Peer education, not employed at the workplace but similar to the programmes used in the studies in our review, showed similar results as in our review. <LINK REF="STD-Morisky-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Morisky 2005</LINK> showed an increase in condom use following peer education and <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1997</LINK> showed a decrease in extra marital sex but there was no change in unprotected sex/condom use despite the educational programs.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-04-12 04:34:12 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Jos H Verbeek">
<P>Workplace interventions to prevent HIV are feasible. There is moderate quality evidence that VCT offered at the work site increases the uptake of testing. Even though this has not been shown to lead to a lower HIV-incidence, there was a decrease in self-reported sexual transmitted diseases and a decrease in unprotected sex after VCT but not a decrease in sex with commercial sex workers. </P>
<P>There is very low quality evidence that educational interventions decrease sexually transmitted diseases, unprotected sex and sex with commercial sex workers but not sex with multiple partners and the use of alcohol before sex.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-04-12 04:50:49 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Jos H Verbeek">
<P>Randomised control trials to prevent HIV at the work place are feasible both applied as a cluster-randomised design and as an individually randomised design. The available evidence is of low quality and there are few studies only and therefore more and better trials are needed preferably randomised at the individual level. Future trials should be directed at high risk groups such as truck drivers or workers in areas with a very high HIV prevalence such as Southern Africa. Interventions should be based on the IMB model and be tuned to the target population of which this review includes several good examples. Control groups should be offered non-HIV but equivalent education to be able to measure the impact of the intervention content. As outcomes, future studies should measure both change in sexual risk behaviours and HIV seroconversion or sexual transmitted disease infection over a longer follow up period. Risky sexual behaviour should be measured in a standardised way and be related to unprotected sex, sex with multiple partners, sex with commercial sex workers and alcohol use before sex.<BR/>
