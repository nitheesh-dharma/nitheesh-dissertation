<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-11-25 20:56:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is the application of negative pressure (a vacuum) across a wound with the aim of managing the wounds and promoting healing. Alternative names for NPWT include topical negative pressure (TNP) therapy, vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) and sealed surface wound suction. In the case of burns, NPWT is used to help the drainage of excess fluid and increase localised blood flow. It has been suggested that the action of NPWT may result in the burn being supplied with increased oxygen and nutrition which could promote healing.We could identify only one clinical trial that tried to address whether NPWT is effective in treating partial-thickness burns, and its results have not yet been published in full. Consequently, there is a lack of trial evidence available, and we could not determine whether NPWT is effective in treating partial-thickness burns. Much more research needs to be done in this area to find out whether NPWT is helpful.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-11-24 15:06:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-11-24 15:06:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Burn injuries are a considerable source of morbidity and mortality. Every year in the USA alone, approximately two million people are burned, up to 80,000 are hospitalised as a result of burns and more than 6500 people die from their injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Brigham-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brigham 1996</LINK>). A skin burn is defined as damage to the skin caused by heat or caustic chemicals. Heat causes the most immediate and obvious injury. Excessive heat causes rapid protein denaturation and cell damage, and thus initiates a complex and evolving injury, with both local and systemic (whole body) consequences - the latter manifesting once the burn area is greater than 20% of the body surface area (BSA) (<LINK REF="REF-Sheridan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheridan 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Locally, the burn wound tends to extend during the acute (first) phase of the injury as a result of microvascular changes, profound activation of white cells and platelets, and the development of oedema (build up of fluid). Many small vessels are coagulated by the application of heat, while others will thrombose (block) later and develop tissue dehydration (<LINK REF="REF-Boykin-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boykin 1980</LINK>). The systemic response to burning is characterised by interstitial oedema in distant organs, i.e. the swelling of any organ or tissue due to accumulation of excess lymph fluid (between cells), and is secondary to a combination of wound-released mediators and hypoproteinaemia (abnormally small amounts of protein in the circulating blood plasma) (<LINK REF="REF-Demling-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demling 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Youn-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Youn 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Burn wounds are often classified by depth: superficial (first-degree burn), partial-thickness (second-degree burn) or full-thickness (third-degree burn). Often, the depth of injury is diagnosed by the anatomic thickness of the skin involved (i.e. the epidermis (outermost thin layer), stratum corneum (outer layer) and the dermis (deepest layer)) and based on either clinical observation, or objective assessment, or both. Clinical evaluation often relies on features of the burn wound's appearance, such as blanching, capillary return, presence and degree of fixed capillary staining, and evaluation of retained light touch and pinprick sensation. Objective assessment tools such as laser doppler flowmetry, laser doppler imaging or indocyanine green video angiography, may be used to measure blood flow into the tissue and, therefore, depth of burn injury (<LINK REF="REF-Demling-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demling 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>First-degree, or superficial, burns are confined exclusively to the epidermis or outer surface of the skin, and generally are not significant injuries, as they heal rapidly and spontaneously. Second-degree, or partial-thickness, burns involve varying amounts of the dermis. These may become deeper, and heal with variable amounts of scarring, the degree of which depends partly on the depth of the burn.</P>
<P>The superficial partial-thickness burn is a sub-category of partial-thickness burns. This type of burn extends through the epidermis into the papillary (superficial) layer of the dermis. These wounds become erythematous, i.e. the skin reddens because the dermal tissue has become inflamed. One hallmark of the superficial partial-thickness burn is blanching followed by rapid capillary refill when pressure is applied to the reddened area and subsequently released (<LINK REF="REF-Demling-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demling 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>). Thin-walled, fluid-filled blisters develop within minutes of the injury. As these blisters break, the exposed nerve endings transmit superficial pain, light touch and temperature, making these wounds extremely painful. The wound is moist because the characteristic waterproofing of the epidermis has been lost, allowing body fluid to leak onto the wound surface. Also, moderate oedema is usually present, due to the involvement of the dermal blood vessels in this type of injury (<LINK REF="REF-Demling-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demling 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Deep partial-thickness burns extend downward into the reticular (deeper) layer of the dermis and present as mixed red or waxy white. Areas of redness will continue to blanch when pressure is applied, but capillary refill may be absent, or sluggish, when pressure is released. Blisters are usually absent; however, the exposed surface of the wound is wet or moist, in a similar way to superficial partial-thickness burns. Oedema is marked, and sensation is altered in areas of a deep partial-thickness burn (<LINK REF="REF-Demling-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demling 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-11-24 15:06:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the biology of wound healing has become better understood, many strategies have been developed to try to manipulate this wound healing process (<LINK REF="REF-Banwell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banwell 1999</LINK>), and to minimise the progression of burn wounds by involving deeper tissue in the acute phase. These strategies range from use of a variety of skin substitutes and dressings, such as polyurethane films and hydrocolloids (<LINK REF="REF-Wasiak-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasiak 2005</LINK>), to the use of more complex and experimental techniques, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Villanueva-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villanueva 2004</LINK>), application of growth factors and cytokine biology (<LINK REF="REF-Atiyeh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atiyeh 2005</LINK>). One way of manipulating the wound environment with a view to promoting healing is to apply negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) across the wound surface via a dressing (<LINK REF="REF-Ubbink-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ubbink 2008</LINK>). There are a number of terms to describe the treatment of a wound with NPWT including: subatmospheric pressure, vacuum-sealing technique, sealed surface wound suction, vacuum assisted closure (VAC), negative pressure therapy or dressing, foam suction dressing, vacuum compression, vacuum pack technique, negative pressure dressing and foam suction dressing (<LINK REF="REF-Banwell-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banwell 2004a</LINK>). For the purposes of this review, all variations of this intervention will be referred to as NPWT. In NPWT a dressing is applied to a burn and a negative pressure (vacuum) applied though it, with tissue fluid being collected into a canister. NPWT was developed in the 1990s, and its uptake by the healthcare systems of developed countries has been dramatic. A US Department of Health report estimated that Medicare payments for NPWT pumps and associated equipment increased between 2001 and 2007 from USD 24 million to USD 164 million (an increase of almost 600%) (<LINK REF="REF-Department-of-Health-and-Human-Services-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Department of Health and Human Services 2009</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-09-12 14:06:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Negative pressure is purported to induce an interstitial gradient shift which can cause a reduction in oedema, and a secondary increase in dermal perfusion, thus aiding in the removal of blood or serous fluid (<LINK REF="REF-Banwell-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banwell 2004a</LINK>). It is also postulated that the ability of NPWT to produce a mechanical stress or force that has a direct effect in cellular activity, and, in particular, the development of new blood vessels, may also contribute to a decrease in burn wound progression. The maintenance of a moist environment that provides optimal conditions for epithelialisation and the prevention of tissue desiccation is also potentially advantageous (<LINK REF="REF-Banwell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banwell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Banwell-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banwell 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pham-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pham 2003</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-09-12 11:08:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>NPWT is an expensive, yet widely used, health technology. The US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of at least one NPWT system for use on partial-thickness burns in 2003, and subsequently its use in burn wound management has been described by a number of clinicians (<LINK REF="STD-Kamolz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kamolz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moisidis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moisidis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schrank-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schrank 2004</LINK>). Yet it is unclear what evidence of the effectiveness of NPWT for treatment of partial-thickness burns is available to guide both clinical and policy decision making. We plan to summarise the evidence to determine whether NPWT is safe, effective and beneficial to those patients with partial-thickness burns.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-11-25 20:57:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We undertook a quality assessment considering the adequacy of the randomisation and allocation concealment process, whether intention to treat (ITT) analysis was performed, the level of blinding and whether the follow-up was complete. For this update the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias was applied to included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool addresses six specific domains; namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues (e.g. extreme baseline imbalance) (see <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK> for the criteria on which risk of bias judgements were made). A risk of bias table was completed for the eligible study. The review authors independently assessed the studies and any disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-09-12 14:32:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We planned to consider both clinical쟞nd statistical heterogeneity. Wherever appropriate, we planned to pool data using meta-analysis (conducted using RevMan 5.1 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>)), that is where studies appeared similar in terms of wound type, intervention type, duration and outcome type. We planned to assess statistical heterogeneity using the chi test (a significance level of P less than 0.1 was considered to indicate heterogeneity) and the I estimate (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The I estimate examines the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than to chance. Values of I over 50 per cent indicate a high level of heterogeneity. In the absence of clinical heterogeneity and in the presence of statistical heterogeneity (I over 50 per cent), we anticipated using a random-effects model, however, we would not pool studies when heterogeneity was very high (I over 75 per cent). Where there was no clinical or statistical heterogeneity we envisaged using a fixed-effect model.</P>

<P>Where possible, we planned to present the outcome results for each trial with 95% confidence intervals (CI).쟙e planned to report estimates for dichotomous outcomes (e.g. burns healed during a particular time period) as risk ratios (RR).쟙e decided to use the RR rather than odds ratio (OR), since ORs (when interpreted as RR) can give an inflated impression of the effect size when event rates are high, as is the case for many trials reporting healing (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2002</LINK>). We planned to report outcomes relating to continuous data (e.g. percentage change in ulcer area) as mean differences (MD) and overall effect size (with 95% CI).쟙here a study reported time-to-healing data (the probability of healing over a consecutive time period) we planned to report and plot these data (where possible) using hazard ratio estimates. If studies reported time-to-event data (e.g. time to healing), did not report hazard ratios, or reported these data incorrectly as a continuous variable, then, where feasible, we planned to estimate this using other reported outcomes, such as the numbers of events, through the application of available statistical methods (<LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>The searches for this fourth review retrieved seven references, none of which met the inclusion criteria for this review. We did not obtain any citations as full text. The searches for the third review update retrieved 27 references, none of which met the inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>The original searches for this review identified 60 references, of these 10 potentially relevant articles obtained as full text, with nine being excluded because they were either case reports, case series or narrative reviews (<LINK REF="STD-Adamkova-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Adamkova 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Banwell-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Banwell 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haslik-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Haslik 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moisidis-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Moisidis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molnar-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Molnar 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nugent-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nugent 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schintler-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Schintler 2005</LINK>), or did not address primary outcome measures (<LINK REF="STD-Kamolz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kamolz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schrank-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schrank 2004</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). We did not find additional studies when we examined citations of retrieved studies.</P>
<P>One study was included which formed the basis of this review (<LINK REF="STD-Molnar-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Molnar 2004a</LINK>) - this is a conference abstract reporting interim data. At the time of the original review we contacted the authors of this abstract, who stated that the abstract results were preliminary data that would be publishable in the foreseeable future (personal communication), as well as providing further details of the study population. In 2014, the author was contacted again, but, as yet, no further information has been received.</P>
<P>The included abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Molnar-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Molnar 2004a</LINK>) reported that participants with bilateral thermal hand burns (treated for less than 24 hours post injury) had one hand randomised to receive NPWT (125 mmHg pressure) applied for 48 hours, whilst the other hand was treated with silver sulphadiazine (SSD). The study used a commercially available device (VAC Pump, KCI Inc, Texas, United States) to apply the negative pressure. All participants served as their own control. The trial reported outcome data at day 30 of a 60-day study period. Outcome measures assessed were reported as: rate of burn healing by use of a Sigma Scan (Systat Software Inc, California, United States), volume of hand as determined by fluid displacement, range of motion, grip and pinch strength. The abstract did not clearly state how many people had been randomised, but reported that it presented results for the first 23 participants. Additional information supplied via personal communication with the author noted that the mean age of these 23 participants was 46 years and the total burn surface area (TBSA) ranged from five per cent to 40 per cent, with mean TBSA at 16 per cent.</P>

<P>A full study report has not been identified, therefore the risk of bias assessment for <LINK REF="STD-Molnar-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Molnar 2004a</LINK> was based on the conference abstract alone (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). The study is described as "prospective, randomised, controlled, blinded, multi-center and web-based", however, the exact method of sequence generation was not specified in the abstract, and allocation concealment was also not reported. Due to the nature of NPWT, it is unlikely that the patients or treatment provider could have been blinded to the intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Molnar-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Molnar 2004a</LINK> reported that, at strategic time points, a blinded principal investigator was used to determine the area of the burns to determine their rate of healing (personal communication with the author). Since the study was an interim report, judging risk of bias for 'incomplete outcome data' was not possible; no attrition was reported at this point in the trial. Burn wound progression and hand function were pre-specified as outcomes in the abstract, both of which were reported (see risk of bias <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-09-12 14:40:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review summarises the best available evidence relating to safety and effectiveness of NPWT in adults with partial-thickness burns. After an extensive search of the literature, only one RCT was found, which was an interim report judged to be at high risk of bias.</P>
<P>There is currently an absence of evidence regarding the use of NPWT for burn wounds, despite the theoretical considerations that may support the concept. Our results highlighted the need for high-level, good-quality research into the safety and effectiveness of NPWT in adults with partial-thickness burns. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Molnar-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Molnar 2004a</LINK> was methodologically weak and poorly reported. There was no description of the randomisation process, and no mention of the degree of comparability of burn injury to both hands at baseline. Other weaknesses included: the absence of reporting on clinically relevant outcomes, such as rate of healing, time to complete healing, rate of change in wound area, and proportion of the wound completely healed within the trial period; lack of clarity regarding the definition and reduction of oedema formation; and the ongoing use of SSD as a comparator, as it is not only known to be toxic to regenerating epithelial cells (<LINK REF="REF-Wasiak-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wasiak 2005</LINK>), but may place patients at increased risk of developing complications such as neutropenia (a lack of white blood cells), erythema multiforme (a rash usually resulting from a drug reaction), crystals in the urine and methaemoglobinaemia (oxidation of more than 1% of the haemoglobin in blood to the ferric state) (<LINK REF="REF-Subrahmanyam-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subrahmanyam 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The small sample size and preliminary analysis of only 23 patients precludes the drawing of any conclusions regarding the nature or frequency of adverse events.</P>

<P>For the third update we modified the previous search string and searched the following electronic databases:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 18 May 2012);</LI>
<LI>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2012, Issue 5);</LI>
<LI>Ovid MEDLINE (2010 to May Week 2 2012);</LI>

<LI>Ovid EMBASE (2010 to 2012 Week 19);</LI>
<LI>EBSCO CINAHL (2010 to 16 May 2012).</LI>
</UL>

<P>The search strategies for Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and Ovid CINAHL can be found in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK> respectively. The Ovid MEDLINE search was combined with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximizing version (2008 revision); Ovid format (Lefebvre 2009). The EMBASE and CINAHL searches were combined with the trial filters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) (SIGN 2010). We applied no language restrictions.<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. 쟙as the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process provided to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. 쟙as the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, when allocation based on use of: an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes unsealed, non-opaque, or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information provided to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. This is usually the case in instances where the method of concealment is not described, or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement to be made, for example when the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it is not clear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
