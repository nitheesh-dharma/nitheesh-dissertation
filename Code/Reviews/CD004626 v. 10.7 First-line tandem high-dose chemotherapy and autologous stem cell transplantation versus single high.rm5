<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-09 10:27:06 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Multiple myeloma is a cancer of antibody-producing cells in the bone marrow. It causes bone destruction and patients are usually at a higher risk for infections and renal damage. Autologous stem cell transplantation has been established as standard initial treatment for fit patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma. During autologous stem cell transplantation, blood-forming stem cells are removed from the patient prior to intense chemotherapy and later given back to the same patient. The chemotherapy is aimed at killing tumour cells (the higher the dose the more tumour cells are killed) but also affects normal blood-forming cells that are needed to fight infections, transport oxygen and control bleeding. By giving the patient back his or her own blood-forming cells, the recovery from the chemotherapy is notably faster and better. Since it is unclear whether autologous stem cell transplantation as initial treatment of multiple myeloma should be performed once or twice, we systematically searched for publications addressing the question whether the acute toxicity of autologous stem cell transplantation is counterbalanced by a long-term benefit for the patient. Several studies in which patients undergoing one treatment with autologous stem cell transplantation were compared to patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation twice were identified. Only five of 14 studies identified could be analysed in the present systematic review. We were interested in long-term benefit for patients with respect to overall survival or so called event-free survival, that is survival without disease progression. Quality of life and treatment-related mortality should also be analysed in clinical studies.</P>
<P>When the included studies were analysed with respect to treatment regimen and design characteristics, all turned out to have methodological problems which do not allow us to draw firm conclusion from the findings. Since the way to treat multiple myeloma has changed since the performance of the included trials, conclusions cannot be drawn with respect to contemporary treatment decisions. We also noted that reporting of completed trials needs to be improved.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-08-09 09:55:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several clinical studies have compared single with tandem (also called double) autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as first-line treatment in patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM), one of the leading indications for ASCT worldwide.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-08-09 21:07:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The present Cochrane Review compares tandem autologous stem cell transplantation (TASCT) with single autologous stem cell transplantation (SASCT) as first-line treatment in patients with symptomatic MM with respect to overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), quality of life (QoL) and treatment- or transplantation-related mortality. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-08-09 09:56:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We systematically identified controlled trials published between January 1995 and May 2011 in two bibliographic databases (MEDLINE and CENTRAL) and in clinical trial registries.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-08-09 09:58:15 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One researcher screened references for controlled trials to determine eligibility for the systematic review (SR) according to pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, reflecting characteristics of disease and the interventions. We required a minimal set of details to be reported for observational studies for the studies to be included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-08-09 09:58:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We critically evaluated eligible trials with respect to quality of design and actual performance. One researcher extracted individual trial results, which were checked by another researcher. We recapitulated the results of the individual trials in a standardised way for the SR in order to allow a systematic assessment of potential sources of bias.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-09 21:17:09 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, we identified 14 controlled studies. One registered randomised controlled trial (RCT) is still recruiting patients at the time of this review and no clinical results have been published. Two registered RCTs have remained unpublished despite their termination. Publications on one RCT had been retracted. We excluded five observational studies since neither patients nor treatment regimens were sufficiently characterised to allow an assessment of potential confounding by indication. We conducted a SR of study designs, definition of endpoints, treatment regimens and baseline characteristics of patients in the five included RCTs (two full-text publications, three conference presentations) enrolling1506 patients in total. Because we identified substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity, we refrained from conducting a formal meta-analysis.</P>
<P>While we included only previously untreated, symptomatic patients with MM the treatment regimens differed notably with respect to acute toxicity, between trials and also between study arms. Compared to state of the art treatment standards, the treatment regimens applied in all trials have to be considered as below standard from a contemporary perspective in at least one component.</P>
<P>Three trials were likely to have the potential of being highly biased while two RCTs had a moderate potential for bias. The observed treatment effects in the set of included trials may have been influenced by a steep decrease in compliance with the second ASCT and the concomitant selection of patients. In addition, OS data were confounded by the treatment subsequent to first-line therapy.</P>
<P>OS was statistically significantly improved in one trial only. While EFS was prolonged in four of the five trials, the median prolongation ranged between three to 12 months, with an uncertain direction of bias in the individual trials. QoL was not reported in any study. Results concerning treatment- or transplantation-related mortality could not be adequately assessed due to substantial differences in definitions between trials and low reporting quality.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-08-09 21:08:40 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not consider any study to be sufficiently informative for contemporary treatment decisions concerning the question single versus tandem ASCT in view of inherent biases. In addition, none of the trials integrated the so-called "novel agents" which are now considered standard treatment for MM. To improve the quality of future studies, sample size calculations should consider the potentially steep decrease in compliance with the second ASCT. Reporting of results of treatment- or transplantation-related mortality should clearly specify the type and number of events (the numerator) in a well-defined population (the denominator).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-08-09 21:08:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-08-09 21:08:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Multiple myeloma (MM) is a haematological malignancy that contributes to approximately 15% of haematological malignancies and close to 27% of all haematopoietic cell cancer-related deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Munshi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munshi 2008</LINK>). The incidence increases steadily with age and 75% of patients are older than 60 years (<LINK REF="REF-Durie-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durie 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alexander-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Myeloma cells derive from antibody-producing B-cells, therefore MM is characterised by the presence of often non-functional monoclonal immunoglobulins in the serum or urine, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Laubach-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laubach 2011</LINK>). Patients frequently present with bone pain or increased susceptibility to infections, or both. Among other factors, the release of calcium from bone into the blood stream leads to hypercalcaemia; and the generally high protein concentration in serum may result in renal failure. End-organ damage is the decisive factor that indicates the necessity of starting aggressive treatment and it has a major impact on the quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Over decades, MM has been classified according to the Durie-Salmon (DS) staging system which aims at correlating clinical features with an estimate of myeloma cell mass (<LINK REF="REF-Durie-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durie 1975</LINK>). Recently, a new international staging system (ISS) based solely on two readily available laboratory tests (&#946;2-microglobulin and albumin) has been developed (<LINK REF="REF-Greipp-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greipp 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite progress in the understanding of MM, especially regarding pathophysiology, its main causes remain unknown (<LINK REF="REF-Durie-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durie 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alexander-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 2007</LINK>). There seems to be more than one genetic pathway to MM and in addition to translocations, karyotypic instabilities are often observed. Hyperdiploid or non-hyperdiploid tumours carry different numbers of chromosomes and the two classes differ with respect to chromosomal content, stromal dependency and aggressiveness of the tumours (<LINK REF="REF-Fonseca-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonseca 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The clinical course of MM is very heterogeneous with overall survival (OS) ranging from months to decades depending on the stage of disease or the presence of prognostic factors for example (<LINK REF="REF-Gertz-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gertz 2007</LINK>). Of unfavourable prognosis are an especially bad performance status, older age, high plasma cell labelling index, and high &#946;2-microglobulin or lactate dehydrogenase levels (<LINK REF="REF-Fonseca-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonseca 2007</LINK>). More recently, cytogenetic changes such as chromosome 13 and chromosome 11 abnormalities are also proposed to have a strong correlation with a worse outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Fonseca-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonseca 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nahi-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nahi 2011</LINK>). The high frequency of patients who either are or become refractory to treatment, a feature also markedly impacting on treatment outcome, is thought to be related to the strong interactions between tumour cells and the surrounding stroma (<LINK REF="REF-Podar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Podar 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients with stage I, II, and III disease according to the ISS have a median OS of 62, 44 and 29 months, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Greipp-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greipp 2005</LINK>). An improvement of OS was demonstrated in the last decade, both in the relapsed setting as well as from diagnosis, with a doubling in OS for patients who were treated with one or more of the novel agents (thalidomide, lenalidomide or bortezomib) (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnsen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnsen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turesson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turesson 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Therapeutic strategies in MM not only focus on prolonging OS but also to induce tumour response, inhibit tumour progression and delay disease-related complications (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Durie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durie 2010</LINK>). The surrogacy of tumour response with survival is still under discussion, however (<LINK REF="REF-Durie-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durie 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harousseau-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harousseau 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Durie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durie 2010</LINK>). Validation of response as a patient-relevant outcome is mainly hampered by the dynamic changes in treatment from the high-dose combination chemotherapy approaches of the 1990s to integration of novel agents (<LINK REF="REF-Durie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durie 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>One treatment approach for symptomatic MM was to intensify chemotherapy, either by increasing doses or by using combinations of multiple drugs (reviewed in <LINK REF="REF-Hahn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 2003</LINK>). The first high-dose chemotherapy schemes resulted in high toxicity and extensive myelosuppression without substantial prolongation of survival (<LINK REF="REF-Barlogie-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlogie 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myeloma-Trialists-98" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myeloma Trialists 98</LINK>). Outcomes after intensive treatment were improved only by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-08-09 10:32:51 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eligibility for transplantation remains one of the main determinants of the treatment strategy until today (for example <LINK REF="REF-Kort_x00fc_m-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kortüm 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCCN-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCN 2011</LINK>). A number of randomised trials have been performed comparing high-dose chemotherapy supported by ASCT with conventional chemotherapy as first-line treatment (cited in <LINK REF="REF-Levy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koreth-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koreth 2007</LINK>). The subsequent meta-analyses did not provide evidence for an extended OS after ASCT, but progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly improved ( <LINK REF="REF-Levy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koreth-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koreth 2007</LINK>). Importantly, the size and treatment effects with respect to both OS and PFS of single autologous stem cell transplantation (SASCT) over combination chemotherapy were quite variable in the individual trials (indeterminate, favourable and even unfavourable in one trial). Accordingly, the meta-analytical result indicated statistically significant heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koreth-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koreth 2007</LINK>). Although transplantation-related mortality could be reduced to less than 5% in the majority of ASCT trials, it remained consistently higher after a transplantation regimen compared to chemotherapy alone, both in RCTs as well as in daily practice (<LINK REF="REF-Jantunen-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jantunen 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gertz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gertz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2008</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-08-09 10:33:15 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Assuming a favourable outcome of SASCT compared to chemotherapy, in the early 1990s some investigators concentrated on tandem autologous stem cell transplantation (TASCT) (<LINK REF="REF-Harousseau-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harousseau 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barlogie-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlogie 1997</LINK>). TASCT corresponds to a second prospectively planned ASCT within a few months after the first ASCT. TASCT was introduced to further improve or consolidate disease control as achieved after SASCT in view of a documented dose-response relationship of melphalan with improved outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Awedan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Awedan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Giralt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giralt 2010</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-08-09 11:35:07 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>MM is among the leading indications for ASCT in Europe and the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Copelan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Copelan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gratwohl-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gratwohl 2007</LINK>). Two randomised studies comparing TASCT with SASCT as initial treatment in patients with symptomatic MM have been published as full text publications (<LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bologna96" TYPE="STUDY">Bologna96</LINK>). Further results from RCTs were presented at conferences (<LINK REF="STD-DSMM_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">DSMM-I</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GMMG_x002d_HD2" TYPE="STUDY">GMMG-HD2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK>). As with RCTs comparing SASCT with combination chemotherapy (see <LINK REF="REF-Levy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koreth-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koreth 2007</LINK>), a statistically significant improvement of either survival endpoint was not consistently replicated in the other trials addressing the same question. This is a classical starting point for a meta-analysis aiming at determining clinical or methodical reasons for the observed heterogeneity, either with respect to statistical significance or with respect to the size of the treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pignon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pignon 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although TASCT has been used as first-line treatment of MM for more than 16 years now, there is continued controversy about its value. There is concern that the increased short-term risks associated with double intensified treatment might call into question the benefit of long-term disease control, in all or specific subgroups of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Fermand-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fermand 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barlogie-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlogie 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tricot-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tricot 2008</LINK>). Thus, an 'acceptable level of toxicity' for the primary MM treatment is still unclear. Usually, higher toxicity is accepted for a curative treatment compared to a palliative treatment (<LINK REF="REF-EMA_x002f_CHMP_x002f_EWP_x002f_520088_x002f_2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMA/CHMP/EWP/520088/2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>On the one hand, TASCT is an integral component of a "Total Therapy" programme (TT), which currently includes novel agents in both the induction and maintenance treatment regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Barlogie-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlogie 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Total-therapy" TYPE="STUDY">Total therapy</LINK>). Barlogie and colleagues support TT as a key to the cure of MM (<LINK REF="REF-Barlogie-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlogie 2009</LINK>). Some investigators, however, have started to regard MM as a chronic disease and principally question the value of an intensive (and thereby toxic) treatment approach (<LINK REF="REF-Rajkumar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajkumar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Attal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attal 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gertz-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gertz 2009</LINK>).</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-08-09 11:35:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We systematically reviewed the evidence on the effects of TASCT compared to SASCT as first-line treatment in MM on overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and treatment- or transplantation-related mortality. By systematically reviewing both prospectively planned features of the included trials and actual experiences recorded during their performance, we aimed to contribute to a discussion on clinical and methodological issues critical for the interpretation of the available evidence.</P>

<P>Both randomised and non-randomised trials comparing first-line TASCT with SASCT in patients with symptomatic MM were included into the systematic review according to pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). All of the inclusion criteria had to be fulfilled and none of the exclusion criteria for including a study. Duration of follow-up was not a criterion for selecting trials.</P>
<P>The reason for including comparative observational studies in the search for the systematic review was to prepare for customary reproaches against RCTs, that is their alleged artificiality or distance from clinical practice. In order for observational studies to be included, however, they had to report on a contemporary control group and both groups needed to be described with sufficient detail to allow assessment of potential 'confounding by indication' (<LINK REF="REF-Kunz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klungel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klungel 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein_x002d_Geltink-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein-Geltink 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenbroucke-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenbroucke 2008</LINK>). At least baseline characteristics, the treatment regimen and outcome data for the two groups had to be reported separately for both groups.</P>
<P>In view of a potentially critical publication bias if only full-text articles were accepted, conference presentations of RCTs were eligible (<LINK REF="REF-Krzyzanowska-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krzyzanowska 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Curt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsey-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsey 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tam-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tam 2008</LINK>) while full-text publications only were acceptable for observational studies.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2012-08-09 11:42:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Michaela Rancea">
<P>Ideally, both prolongation of the objective endpoint OS and improved quality of life should be used for demonstrating patient benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Durie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durie 2010</LINK>). Quality of life measures were, however, only to be included if they were assessed by validated instruments. Considerable confounding of OS was expected in all included RCTs as all were performed in the years during which the so-called 'novel agents', with considerable efficacy in MM (thalidomide, lenalidomide or bortezomib), were developed for MM (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2008</LINK>). Therefore, EFS can be considered as an indicator of efficacy as long as a deleterious effect on OS could be excluded, in an analogy to drug development (<LINK REF="REF-CPMP_x002f_EWP_x002f_205_x002f_95-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPMP/EWP/205/95 2005</LINK>). It is important to note that EFS also includes laboratory parameters which signal progression but need not immediately affect the patients' health status. Since the criteria for progression became more sophisticated over the time period during which the included trials were performed, for example by increasing sensitivity with respect to progression using immunofixation, there is some heterogeneity of definitions used in all included trials (<LINK REF="REF-Attal-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attal 1996,</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blad_x00e9_-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bladé 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Durie-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durie 2006</LINK>). The outcome in clinical trials in oncology is often also assessed by measuring response to therapy. In view of the different definitions for response in the relevant time period of TASCT studies, and the ongoing discussion on whether a (best) response analysis allows a demonstratration of (durable) benefit for all patients, response was not assessed for the present review (<LINK REF="REF-Harousseau-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harousseau 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moreau-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moreau 2011</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>). Treatment- or transplant-related mortality, sometimes indiscriminately abbreviated as TRM in the original reports, was to be analysed as a measure of safety (see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>Evidence on the efficacy and safety of TASCT compared to SASCT in the first-line treatment of MM was identified by systematic electronic searching for literature in two bibliographic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE) according to the recommendation by The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We had to exclude the database EMBASE due to budgetary restrictions and considered only publications in English, French and German. Since CENTRAL is updated with randomised controlled trials from EMBASE through retrospective searches conducted by the UK Cochrane Centre, up to 2008, EMBASE was at least partially covered through CENTRAL in our review.</P>
<P>Since observational studies, for example registry reports, were to be included in addition to RCTs, the search filter was adapted accordingly (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). Overall, the sensitivity of the presented search was lower for observational studies compared to RCTs due to the choice of bibliographic databases (CENTRAL is enriched for RCTs only).</P>
<P>The systematic search was restricted in the years of publication with the starting point of 1995 in order to approximate the establishment of TASCT as first-line treatment of MM (<LINK REF="REF-Barlogie-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlogie 1997</LINK>). A pilot search was performed in 2007. The systematic search of the two bibliographic databases MEDLINE and CENTRAL was performed on 30th of April 2010. The search was updated on the 23rd of May 2011.</P>

<P>Information on allocation was limited for the majority of studies. All authors documented the similarity of study groups however, either by referring to P values or by presenting similar values for selected prognostic factors. The only prognostic factors described for all studies were age, &#946;2-microglobulin and stage (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). For <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK>, baseline characteristics of treatment arms were not reported separately. While MAG95 included the youngest patient population of the set of included trials, the Bologna96 trial included the highest proportion of patients with symptomatic stage I disease. In DSMM-I and GMMG-HD2, only patients responding to induction treatment were included. No obvious hierarchy concerning baseline risk between studies could be determined in view of the heterogeneity of eligible age range, stage or prognostic factors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Treatment plan and compliance</HEADING>
<P>None of the included trials assessed exactly the same treatment strategy. All trials deviated from what would be considered standard today in at least one component of the ASCT regimen (SASCT or TASCT). Different combinations or sequences of induction, mobilisation, conditioning or maintenance regimen were used. Rather than repeating one ASCT regimen, the TASCT regimens used in <LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK> could be described as dose-escalating since the intensity of the preparative regimen used for the initial ASCT was lower than for the second ASCT. Compliance was usually high with the first or only transplantation in all trials but was highly variable for the second transplantation (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Causes of non-compliance were either myeloma-, toxicity- or procedural-related, or were based on patients' preferences: patients developed contra-indications for second transplantation while on the trial, or an insufficient number of stem cells precluded further ASCT. A notable number of patients refused further treatment or were denied coverage. Among the reported reasons for non-compliance, refusal by patients was the most common reason for not performing the second transplantation. The lowest compliance with second transplantation was observed in <LINK REF="STD-Bologna96" TYPE="STUDY">Bologna96</LINK> (65%) and <LINK REF="STD-GMMG_x002d_HD2" TYPE="STUDY">GMMG-HD2</LINK> (52% of evaluable patients).</P>
<P>Information on maintenance or salvage treatment (treatment after relapse) was limited for the majority of trials.

Patients crossing-over to the other treatment arm were only reported for <LINK REF="STD-DSMM_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">DSMM-I</LINK>, where 18% of patients from the SASCT crossed over to the TASCT arm without information on their status at the time of cross-over.</P>

<P>Comparative observational studies were to be included in the trials if both the population and treatment regimen were described in sufficient detail. None of the observational studies identified allowed us to adequately assess or rule out 'confounding by indication', the most critical issue for interpretation of treatment effects from observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Kunz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vandenbroucke-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenbroucke 2008</LINK>).

<P>TASCT is an integral part of 'Total therapy' (TT), developed by Barlogie and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Total-therapy" TYPE="STUDY">Total therapy</LINK>). TT publications were not included in the systematic review for the following reason: TT was supported by an historical comparison of a single-armed study in a single specialised centre, both initially (TT1; <LINK REF="REF-Barlogie-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlogie 1997</LINK>) and upon development of further TT generations (<LINK REF="REF-Barlogie-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlogie 2009</LINK>). With this design, selection bias at enrolment and potentially informative censoring during study conduct can neither be assessed nor excluded. Of note, all generations of the total therapy program, except TT1, integrate the so-called novel-agents either before or after TASCT, or both, which is regarded as a critically different treatment approach compared to that in the set of included RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Barlogie-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlogie 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>Assessment of the potential of bias was based on several methodical aspects and actual experience during (for example compliance) or after the performance of the trial (for example publication type) (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most information was available for classification of risk of bias for <LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bologna96" TYPE="STUDY">Bologna96</LINK>, which were published as full-text publications, compared to the trials available as conference presentation only (<LINK REF="STD-DSMM_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">DSMM-I</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GMMG_x002d_HD2" TYPE="STUDY">GMMG-HD2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK>). The quality of the trials was rated both according to prospective elements such as the availability of an ITT analysis, the reported basis for sample size calculation or whether a detailed description of the baseline would allow the reader to rule out clinically relevant if not statistically relevant differences in baseline characteristicss (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bias was also assessed based on the time point of analysis, that is the extent of follow-up or data maturity. There is consensus that minimal median follow-up in MM should be more than four years (<LINK REF="REF-Harousseau-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harousseau 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tricot-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tricot 2009</LINK>). RCTs with follow-up of more than four years were marked in green, while trials with less or insufficient information were coded in red or yellow (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Since neither conference presentations nor abstracts contained sufficient data to ascertain the validity of the results, the lack of a full-text publication was also rated as a negative feature (<LINK REF="REF-Tam-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tam 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overall potential for bias (direction of bias unclear) was rated per study (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) based on the most important factors involved (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). With respect to individual endpoints, OS was considered to be more biased compared to EFS and so-called TRM since, in addition to transplantation regimen and compliance (see <LINK TAG="OTHER_BIAS_SOURCES" TYPE="SECTION">Other potential sources of bias</LINK>), follow-on treatment could have impacted on the effect on OS.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-DSMM_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">DSMM-I</LINK> were considered as having the potential to be highly biased, with an unclear direction of bias (conservative or anti-conservative). Most relevant issues for the classification of <LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK> were the dose-escalating TASCT regimen (<LINK TAG="OTHER_BIAS_SOURCES" TYPE="SECTION">Other potential sources of bias</LINK>), low compliance with the second ASCT and unclear type and effect of follow-on treatment (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). The critically limited amount of information due to its publication type (<LINK TAG="SELECTIVE_REPORTING" TYPE="SECTION">Selective reporting</LINK>), together with TASCT and SASCT regimens which would be regarded as non-standard today (<LINK TAG="OTHER_BIAS_SOURCES" TYPE="SECTION">Other potential sources of bias</LINK>), were decisive for classifying <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK> as potentially highly biased. In view of its relatively short follow-up, apparently unstable results with multiple crossings at the right end of the Kaplan-Meier curves and high cross-over rate, <LINK REF="STD-DSMM_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">DSMM-I</LINK> was also rated as having the potential to be highly biased, with an unclear direction of bias.</P>
<P>Since <LINK REF="STD-Bologna96" TYPE="STUDY">Bologna96</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-GMMG_x002d_HD2" TYPE="STUDY">GMMG-HD2</LINK> (at least) evaluated a standard-dose TASCT conditioning regimen from a contemporary perspective, they were (rather subjectively) rated as moderately biased despite the steep decrease in compliance with the second ASCT (see also <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>).</P>

<P>The steep decrease in compliance with the second ASCT most likely results in a null bias, that is a conservative shift of the treatment effect in an ITT analysis.

<P>ASCT as first-line treatment of MM was followed by further lines of therapy as salvage treatment in case of relapse or progression (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Since all included RCTs coincided with the clinical development of several so-called 'novel agents' with considerable activity in myeloma, the type and outcome of follow-on treatment is critically important for the interpretation of OS.

<P>Both the reported items and printing quality differed widely between full-text publications, abstracts and conference presentations.

<P>Both definitions of the relevant period of observation and causes of death to be listed as so-called TRM remained unclear in the majority of trials (indicated by depicting the latter as 'so-called TRM') (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Impact of treatment plan and compliance</HEADING>
<P>While the cumulative dose was higher in the TASCT arm for all studies, dose density differed notably between TASCT and SASCT in <LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-DSMM_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">DSMM-I</LINK>. When assessing the comparability of treatment toxicity between the SASCT and TASCT regimens within studies, some SASCT regimens were considerably more toxic, either overall (<LINK REF="STD-DSMM_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">DSMM-I</LINK>) or at an earlier time point (with higher dose density), compared to a sort of dose-escalating scheme in the TASCT arm with 'softer' conditioning for the first ASCT (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> ). Total body irradiation (TBI) was omitted for conditioning before the first ASCT in the TASCT arm of <LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK>, while the second ASCT was identical to the only ASCT in the SASCT arm. The first ASCT for the TASCT arm in <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK> involved an overall lower dose of chemotherapy without TBI and CD34-selection in contrast to the only transplantation in the SASCT arm. Twice as many patients died early in the group receiving CD34-selected grafts in <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK> (N = 14 versus n = 7). In view of the treatment plan for <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK>, with differences in the timing and intensity of treatment regimens (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>), a clinically relevant interaction between CD34-selection and randomisation to the TASCT or SASCT arm was likely.</P>
<P>On the one hand, delayed onset of intense chemo(radio)therapy may initially favour the TASCT arm in the trials with respect to sparing patients' acute toxicity (potential lead time bias). On the other hand, insufficient dose intensity up to and including the first ASCT may leave patients who discontinue prior to second transplantation undertreated. This is especially important for <LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK>, in which the compliance with the second transplantation was only 78%.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2012-08-09 12:11:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Initially, we planned to perform a meta-analysis of the five included studies: all trials were comparing TASCT with SASCT as first-line treatment of symptomatic MM in patients who were either untreated or had received conventional treatment, that is non-high-dose chemotherapy, for a maximum of six months. Features of the treatment regimen and obvious biases introduced during study performance (compliance, interaction, course of events in control group) stopped us from conducting a formal meta-analysis however (<LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>). In order to summarise the results of the individual studies, the number of events and survival proportions are both listed in <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK> and recapitulated in a standardised way in the section below. The time course observed in the Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves (not available for OS in <LINK REF="STD-Bologna96" TYPE="STUDY">Bologna96</LINK>, EFS in <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK>) was added in order to transmit the maximum amount of information from the individual trials into the systematic review.</P>
<P>Quality of life was not reported for any included study, which is deplorable in view of the known adverse effect of ASCT on quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Campagnaro-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campagnaro 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2008</LINK>). Furthermore, late toxic effects of ASCT, such as secondary malignancies or infections, were not specifically reported in any trial (<LINK REF="REF-Jantunen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jantunen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Majhail-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majhail 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK> a statistically significant benefit for the tandem arm on both OS and EFS was observed after a median 75 months of follow-up: Median EFS and OS were prolonged by TASCT from 25 to 30 months and from 48 to 58 months (P = 0.03 and P = 0.01, respectively). Seven-year OS (21% versus 42%) and EFS (10% versus 20%) proportions also significantly favoured the tandem-transplantation group (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>). A trend for improved survival was observed in the long-term follow-up analysis, with a median 11.6 years of follow-up (OS P = 0.08; EFS P = 0.06). No difference between the second randomisation option (bone marrow versus peripheral blood stem cells) was observed. Exploratory subgroup analysis suggested that patients who benefited most from the TASCT were those who did not achieve at least a very good partial response after their first transplantation. It is important to note that the first ASCT in the TASCT arm was performed with a lower dose (140 mg/m² melphalan) compared to the only ASCT in the SASCT arm (140 mg melphalan and TBI) (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) and may therefore be classified as underdosed from a contemporary perspective. This is of relevance in view of only 78% of patients in the TASCT arm actually undergoing the second transplantation. Treatment-related mortality was observed in 6% of the TASCT and 4% of the SASCT arm (N = 12 versus N = 8), of which N = 5 (TASCT) and N = 3 were related to the transplantation-related complication sepsis. Overall, seven different causes of death were specified (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). Similar two-year survival proportions were observed for patients after relapse in SASCT and TASCT, although imbalances in salvage treatment limit the interpretability of the results (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>; <LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK>, after a median follow-up of 73 months OS appeared superior in both the TASCT group compared to the SASCT group (randomisation option A) and in the group receiving unselected grafts compared to those receiving selected grafts (randomisation option B) (P = 0.09 and P = 0.33, respectively) (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>). The prolongation of the median OS from 57 to 75 months in the TASCT arm might be misleading due to the position of the median at the right end of the Kaplan-Meier graph with very few patients at risk. Only a slight prolongation of median EFS was reported for the TASCT arm (34 versus 31 mo). In the subgroup of patients who had received unselected grafts, OS was statistically significantly improved in the TASCT arm compared to patients in the SASCT arm (P = 0.04), highlighting the potential interaction of CD34-selection and mortality (<LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Awedan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Awedan 2002</LINK>). Only interim data were available for <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK> concerning toxic deaths, based on 85% of the final study population. For the final analysis, early deaths which included myeloma-related deaths (TASCT 7% versus SASCT 12%) were reported.</P>
<P>The time-course of mortality as seen in the Kaplan-Meier graph for <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK> revealed two clusters of events in the control group which appeared to drive the overall difference between the SASCT and TASCT arms. The first of the two clusters of events in the control arm (two to four months post-randomisation) coincided with the treatment phase of the trial with an almost doubled early mortality in the SASCT arm (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK> trial, patients in the TASCT group received the selected graft only at the second ASCT, while the graft used for the first ASCT was unselected (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>; <LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bologna96" TYPE="STUDY">Bologna96</LINK> did not confirm the significant OS benefit as observed in the <LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK> trial for TASCT in an ITT analysis (P = 0.9). While the median OS was extended from 65 (SASCT) to 71 (TASCT) months, seven-year survival proportions were similar (43% after TASCT versus 46% after SASCT). No Kaplan-Meier graph was available for OS. Five-year EFS was significantly better in the TASCT arm (29% versus 17%) (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>). The improvement in median EFS from 23 to 35 months in the TASCT group was statistically significant (P = 0.001) with a rather steep decrease in EFS in the control arm approximately 18 months after randomisation. The duration of relapse-free survival was prolonged from 24 months in the control group to 42 months in the tandem-transplantation arm. Post-relapse survival (PRS), however, favoured the SASCT arm with a median PRS of 32 months compared to 25 months in the TASCT arm. In view of the low compliance with the second transplantation in the TASCT group (65%) (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>), the interpretation of results was hampered due to potential null and selection biases (<LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK>). Subgroup analysis of patients not reaching complete remission after induction confirmed the observation of the <LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK> trial suggesting that patients who do not respond well to initial therapy benefited most from the double intensified protocol. Transplantation-related mortality (definition see <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>) was reported as 4% in the TASCT and 3% in the SASCT arm.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-GMMG_x002d_HD2" TYPE="STUDY">GMMG-HD2</LINK>, the final analysis did not demonstrate a significant prolongation of the median EFS (29 versus 25 mo; no P value provided) (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>). The Kaplan-Meier curves for EFS in GMMG-HD2 in the ITT population separated only transiently between 18 months and 38 months (TASCT superior) but the final proportions of patients surviving event-free were similar (if more than 10 patients still at risk). Kaplan-Meier curves for OS, for the ITT population were superimposable. In view of a very low compliance with the second ASCT (52 % of evaluable patients) (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>), per protocol (PP) analyses were performed in addition to the ITT analyses (see also <LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK>). While the per protocol (PP) analysis of EFS was similar to the ITT analysis, the PP analysis of OS indicated numerically inferior survival for the TASCT arm over the majority of the follow-up period (<LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>). So-called TRM (definition see <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>) was reported as 2% during the first and 3% during the second transplantation compared to 2% in the SASCT group (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-DSMM_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">DSMM-I</LINK>, with a follow-up of approximately 48 months (corresponding to the entire time axis in the Kaplan-Meier graph) the Kaplan-Meier curves appeared unstable with multiple crossings for OS and EFS and a flattening of the curves at the right end (<LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK>). While OS, EFS and PFS all appeared superior for the TASCT group, final survival proportions were favourable for the SASCT arm (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>). Kaplan-Meier graphs presented later (<LINK REF="REF-Einsele-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Einsele 2007</LINK>), indicated that PFS was consistently higher for the SASCT arm. No information was reported with respect to the type of analysis (ITT, PP, subgroup analysis?). So-called TRM (definition see <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>) was reported as 4% for the TASCT and 3% for the SASCT arm. The definition of so-called TRM remained unclear. Notably, OS in the TASCT arm remained at 100% for 400 days (including treatment phase?) in the TASCT arm (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>).</P>

<P>Empirical research should always take into account previous experience, either to build on it, refute it, or at least to learn from it (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 2009</LINK>). Systematic reviews or meta-analysis are formalised tools to review available evidence on a clearly defined question. They are also an occasion to systematically and rigorously assess the quality of the available evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The findings of a comparison of two treatments, that is the treatment effect, may result from a) improvement of an outcome by the test treatment, b) an inferior outcome of the control treatment, c) a chance finding, or even in the setting of a RCT d) be driven by confounding factors within a small and heterogeneous patient population (<LINK REF="REF-Blair-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blair 2004</LINK>). All four options should be addressed in the course of an exploratory systematic review. Both patient characteristics and study design (including the treatment plan) should be scrutinised for their propensity to favour one or more of the four possibilities. While a systematic review as a retrospective observational study cannot settle a controversy, the examination may help to contribute to the design of future studies addressing (an emerging) one.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-09 12:14:25 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the set of publicly available RCTs performed between 1994 and 2002 (five of seven completed RCTs), TASCT was accompanied by a statistically significant improvement in OS compared to SASCT for the first-line treatment of patients with MM in one study only (<LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK>; statistical significance not confirmed in long-term follow-up). In the other four trials it appeared to have no effect on survival (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>). None of the studies were adequately powered for the analysis of OS and considerable confounding due to varying access to salvage treatment is likely. Of note, OS appeared numerically inferior for the per protocol population of the <LINK REF="STD-GMMG_x002d_HD2" TYPE="STUDY">GMMG-HD2</LINK> trial, which may be due to the selection of patients who proceeded to second transplantation. An observational study with matched pair design also reported on numerically inferior OS (<LINK REF="STD-NMSG" TYPE="STUDY">NMSG</LINK>), as well as a reported case series from a single centre experience (<LINK REF="STD-Koren-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Koren 2010</LINK>), highlighting the necessity to further study the impact of the second transplantation on long-term outcomes.</P>
<P>TASCT improved EFS compared to SASCT in four of the five trials (not in <LINK REF="STD-DSMM_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">DSMM-I</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>), but the effect was statistically significant only in the two trials published as full-text articles (<LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bologna96" TYPE="STUDY">Bologna96</LINK>). The beneficial effect on EFS appeared to be transient in <LINK REF="STD-GMMG_x002d_HD2" TYPE="STUDY">GMMG-HD2</LINK>. The results of <LINK REF="STD-DSMM_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">DSMM-I</LINK> appeared to be too immature to allow firm conclusions.</P>
<P>Treatment- or transplant-related mortality, sometimes indiscriminately summarised as so-called TRM, was higher for the TASCT arm in four of five studies without reference to statistical significance (all except <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK>). For <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK>, both the time course of events in the Kaplan-Meier graph and interim data indicate that here the SASCT regimen claimed more early and toxic deaths compared to the TASCT regimen.</P>
<P>Quality of life was not reported in any of the included studies. Response to treatment had not been assessed for the present review.</P>
<P>In view of the observed heterogeneity of treatment concepts and the extent of potential bias in the individual studies, we refrained from performing a formal meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Feinstein-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feinstein 1995</LINK>). Critical features in the set of included trials concern major differences in the treatment plans, not only between but also within individual RCTs. Variable compliance with the planned treatment during performance of the trials and the potential confounding of OS data by subsequent treatment may also impact on the observed treatment effect. Overall, the direction of bias was considered as unpredictable (<LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>; <LINK TAG="QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE" TYPE="SECTION">Quality of the evidence</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>Two completed or terminated RCTs were identified in clinical trials registries, however they remained unpublished. For the only American trial (<LINK REF="STD-DM00_x002d_196" TYPE="STUDY">DM00-196</LINK>), an interim analysis in abstract form reported on a critical lack of compliance with the second ASCT, without follow-up data (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2003</LINK>). The UK-based study (<LINK REF="STD-N0265041749" TYPE="STUDY">N0265041749</LINK>) reported on similar problems with accrual, which resulted in early closure of the trial (Mahendra personal communication). Three of the five included RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-DSMM_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">DSMM-I</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GMMG_x002d_HD2" TYPE="STUDY">GMMG-HD2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK>) were available as conference presentations only, emphasising both the necessity to include non-full text information when systematically evaluating a treatment concept in oncology and the difficulty of accepting conference presentations in view of low reporting quality (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsey-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsey 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tam-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tam 2008</LINK>). Of note, only the two journal articles report statistically significant improvements in survival endpoints (<LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bologna96" TYPE="STUDY">Bologna96</LINK>), while the conference abstracts refer to non-significant results or to difficulty in actually performing the second transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Hopewell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopewell 2009</LINK>). Overall, it appears as if only positive results of TASCT are published in widely accessible medical journals while the scientific community is not equally informed on disappointing results, concerning either practicability or clinical outcome.</P>
<P>On the one hand, lack of reporting of clinical outcome data is an obvious sign of publication bias, a well-known phenomenon in clinical research (<LINK REF="REF-Curt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsey-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsey 2008</LINK>). On the other hand, the problems with either accrual of patients or low compliance with the protocol illustrates the strenuous nature of a TASCT regimen. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Baseline characteristics</HEADING>
<P>Even in RCTs, relevant imbalances at baseline may help to explain the relative outcome of the study arms (<LINK REF="REF-Blair-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blair 2004</LINK>). MM is a very heterogeneous disease and the evaluable set of of participants of some of the trials was only around 100 (compliant) patients per arm (<LINK REF="STD-DSMM_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">DSMM-I</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GMMG_x002d_HD2" TYPE="STUDY">GMMG-HD2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bologna96" TYPE="STUDY">Bologna96</LINK>), which may be insufficient to balance out chance findings (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>). In addition, no information on cytogenetic characteristics was collected in the included trials. The cytogenetic information is regarded as critical for extrapolation of results, since cytogenetic analysis belongs to the basic workup for contemporary patients with MM (<LINK REF="REF-Munshi-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munshi 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment regimen </HEADING>
<P>When reviewing literature, it is important to take into consideration recent improvements in individual steps of the rather complex intervention of autologous stem cell transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Awedan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Awedan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Attal-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attal 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harousseau-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harousseau 2009a</LINK>). Preparation of patients for ASCT has changed substantially during the last two decades, including induction treatment, mobilisation or handling of stem cells and a conditioning regimen for ASCT. While induction treatment used to be a combination chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (VAD), or high-dose steroids, nowadays the so-called 'novel agents' have replaced the classical induction regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Lane-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCCN-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCN 2011</LINK>). Furthermore, for contemporary ASCT, only peripheral blood stem cells without graft manipulation (for example purging of tumour cells) are used for ASCT in view of better engraftment characteristics when compared to bone marrow (<LINK REF="REF-Gratwohl-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gratwohl 2007</LINK>). TBI has been largely abandoned as a conditioning regimen in view of increased toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Moreau-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moreau 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tricot-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tricot 2009</LINK>). In addition, the conditioning regimen for the second ASCT in the TASCT arm included busulfan, which has recently been associated with a high treatment-related morbidity, possibly impacting on further access to salvage treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Lahuerta-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lahuerta 2010</LINK>). Today, 200 mg melphalan is considered to be the standard conditioning regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Giralt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giralt 2010</LINK>). It is important to note that the regimen used for both TASCT and SASCT followed the learning curve of the development of the standard regimens in use today, that is all regimens would be considered substandard from a contemporary perspective in at least one or even several components (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, treatment regimens were diverse in the included trials, with notable differences in toxicity between trials but also between study arms, thereby potentially biasing the overall results (lead-time bias). The low compliance with the second transplantation in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bologna96" TYPE="STUDY">Bologna96</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-GMMG_x002d_HD2" TYPE="STUDY">GMMG-HD2</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) makes the interpretation of treatment effect difficult in view of unassessable attrition bias, even more so as the TASCT regimen in <LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK> followed a sort of dose-escalating scheme. Both <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-DSMM_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">DSMM-I</LINK> applied non-standard SASCT regimens to the control group, which also needs to be considered for the interpretation of data since treatment effects may stem from a superior test regimen or from an inferior control arm. Overall, the possibility of extrapolating the available evidence to treatment decisions for contemporary patients is questioned.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-08-09 12:26:33 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For interpretation of the effect on OS, the following issues were regarded as critical in the course of the present systematic review: confounding by subsequent treatment (all studies), compliance with the second transplantation (<LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bologna96" TYPE="STUDY">Bologna96</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GMMG_x002d_HD2" TYPE="STUDY">GMMG-HD2</LINK>), acute toxicity of control treatment (<LINK REF="STD-DSMM_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">DSMM-I</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK>), extent of cross-over (<LINK REF="STD-DSMM_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">DSMM-I</LINK>), and time course of mortality (<LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK>). The observed cluster of events in the control arm during the treatment phase of the only transplantation in the SASCT arm of <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK> is indicative of an increased toxicity in the SASCT arm, that is an inferior outcome for the control arm.</P>
<P>For interpretation of the effects on EFS, the following issues were regarded as critical: extent of cross-over (<LINK REF="STD-DSMM_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">DSMM-I</LINK>), low compliance with the second transplantation (<LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bologna96" TYPE="STUDY">Bologna96</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GMMG_x002d_HD2" TYPE="STUDY">GMMG-HD2</LINK>). Furthermore, it remained unclear whether any of the studies made provisions to address relevant biases introduced by irregular or asymmetric assessments for events in the course of the EFS assessments (<LINK REF="REF-CHMP_x002f_EWP_x002f_27994_x002f_08-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">CHMP/EWP/27994/08 2008</LINK>). In addition, events for EFS were defined differently between trials (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>)</P>
<P>In the included trials both definitions of the relevant period of observation and causes of death to be listed as so-called TRM remained unclear, and were not comparable between trials (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). Another uncertainty concerning the comparability of study-specific results stemmed from the different level of sophistication of ascribed causes of death (for example <LINK REF="STD-IFM94" TYPE="STUDY">IFM94</LINK>). In addition, the definition of the population in which so-called TRM was reported as a percentage was missing for most trials. This is of relevance in view of the low compliance with second transplantation, since there may be large deviance between different populations in the analysis (for example ITT or 'as treated').</P>
<P>The short-term risk would need to be counterbalanced by a convincing prolongation of long-term survival accompanied by an improved quality of life. The per protocol population of GMMG-HD2, a matched-pair analysis and a single-centre experience (<LINK REF="STD-GMMG_x002d_HD2" TYPE="STUDY">GMMG-HD2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NMSG" TYPE="STUDY">NMSG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koren-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Koren 2010</LINK>), although all methodically contestable pinpoint to a potentially inferior survival outcome for patients actually undergoing second transplantation compared to a SASCT regimen. More information is required on the long-term benefit for patients in view of the overall strenuous treatment approach of TASCT.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-08-09 12:29:55 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one other meta-analysis on the same topic has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2009</LINK>). In their conclusion, Kumar et al advised against the routine use of TASCT in view of statistically significantly increased treatment-related mortality without significant prolongation of OS (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The discouragement of first-line TASCT triggered substantial criticism among US experts in MM, accompanied by a controversial discussion on the methods and interpretation of data in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Giralt-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giralt 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tricot-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tricot 2009</LINK>). On the one hand, the clinicians commenting on the meta-analysis were disappointed that important clinical aspects had not been discussed in the course of the meta-analysis, for example the impact of salvage treatment, the use of TBI in the older trials or the different definitions of TRM in the set of included trials. On the other hand, the authors of the meta-analysis objected to methodically problematic proposals for analyses or interpretations of available evidence by the clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2009b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The present systematic review differs from <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2009</LINK> in several aspects. First, with respect to the set of included trials, Kumar included <LINK REF="STD-Sonneveld-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Sonneveld 2007</LINK> which in our view is not assessing TASCT but rather a non-myeloablative double-intensified protocol (<LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-DSMM_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">DSMM-I</LINK>, included in our analysis, was not mentioned by Kumar et al. While DSMM-I yielded indefinite results for all outcomes, Sonneveld reported statistically significant results for EFS (TASCT better) and TRM (TASCT worse). </P>
<P>Second, the focus of our qualitative assessment of included studies exceeded the prospectively planned elements (such as reporting of sample size calculations or definitions of endpoints) of trial design considered by Kumar et al. Here, we integrated both additional design elements of the trial into the assessment (for example acute toxicity of treatment regimen) as well as actually observed effects during trial performance (such as time course of mortality, compliance with treatment) (<LINK TAG="OTHER_BIAS_SOURCES" TYPE="SECTION">Other potential sources of bias</LINK>).</P>
<P>While Kumar presented meta-analytical results, we considered the observed clinical and methodological heterogeneity as being too pronounced to gain further insights from a combined analysis.</P>
<P>We agree with Kumar's conclusion that a short-term risk needs to be counterbalanced by a long-term benefit in order to justify routine use of a medical intervention. We also consider it likely that there is only a marginal, if any, beneficial effect of TASCT on OS. Thus, we agree in questioning the value of tandem autologous stem cell transplantation as a first-line treatment in MM. We hestitate to follow Kumar et al, however, with respect to the informative value of the increased TRM observed after TASCT. We raise the question that if an inevitably life-threatening procedure (ASCT) was performed twice instead of once, would we not even expect an at least doubled risk of transplantation-related mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2008</LINK>)? In addition to the diversity of the defintions of TRM used (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>), the low compliance with the second transplantation (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) may further complicate a definite analysis of treatment- or transplantation-related mortality.</P>
<P>We also deplore the low precision of reporting on this important outcome of patients' safety (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). It remained unclear whether treatment- or transplant-related mortality was reported when the ambiguous abbreviation was used (<LINK REF="STD-GMMG_x002d_HD2" TYPE="STUDY">GMMG-HD2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DSMM_x002d_I" TYPE="STUDY">DSMM-I</LINK>). Finally, we do not agree with Kumar that TRM in <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK> might have been so high that the authors refrained from reporting it. As described above, we even consider an exceptionally high mortality in the SASCT arm of <LINK REF="STD-MAG95" TYPE="STUDY">MAG95</LINK> as plausible in view of the Kaplan-Meier graph of the final analysis, interim data on toxic death and the expected toxicity of the treatment regimen based on dose density (<LINK TAG="OTHER_BIAS_SOURCES" TYPE="SECTION">Other potential sources of bias</LINK>; <LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, we aimed at contributing to improvements of future trial designs on tandem transplantation rather than settling the conflicting evidence on TASCT, also considering the evolution of treatment approaches of MM in the last decade. We therefore elaborate in some detail on the difference of the treatment approaches to TASCT, then and now, and discuss further methodological issues that prevent clear-cut interpretation of data, especially for contemporary patients (<LINK TAG="OTHER_BIAS_SOURCES" TYPE="SECTION">Other potential sources of bias</LINK>; <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for practice</LINK>; <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for research</LINK>). We doubt that these potentially confounding issues could be adequately addressed and recompensed in an individual patient data (IPD) analysis.</P>
<P>We regret to conclude that the set of available RCTs do not yield sufficient evidence for contemporary treatment decisions.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-08-09 12:31:38 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The present systematic review critically questions the validity of the included set of trials to provide a basis for contemporary treatment recommendations, especially for patients who have already achieved a good response after the first transplantation. Treatment of MM has changed dramatically in the past 15 years and there are considerable uncertainties and potential sources of bias in this rather old set of trials. In addition, the quality of reporting of trial methods and results, especially in those trials available as conference presentation only, do not allow us to draw firm conclusions.</P>
<P>The uncertainty in the medical community as to whether the acute toxicity of a second ASCT is counterbalanced by long-term benefit is also reflected in the design of a number of recent and ongoing trials, and current treatment guidelines. In view of the increase in the proportion of complete responses after a second transplantation in the set of included trials, the option of a second transplantation is sometimes limited to patients who have not responded optimally to the first transplantation (for example <LINK REF="REF-Kort_x00fc_m-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kortüm 2010</LINK>). The dependency of a second transplantation on a suboptimal response to first ASCT was already integrated into the unpublished <LINK REF="STD-DM00_x002d_196" TYPE="STUDY">DM00-196</LINK> trial, and into the current generation of studies performed by the IFM and GMMG study groups (for example <LINK REF="REF-GMMG_x002d_HD5" TYPE="REFERENCE">GMMG-HD5</LINK> or <LINK REF="REF-Moreau-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moreau 2011</LINK> studies). Also, Cavo highlights the necessity of evaluating the additional benefit of a second transplantation in view of the high complete response rates already obtained with the novel induction regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Cavo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cavo 2010</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-08-09 20:42:22 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The observation that, for various unavoidable reasons, compliance with a second transplantation decreased sharply needs to be taken into account for future trial designs. This finding is also supported with data described for 2655 patients in a TASCT program in the European Bone Marrow Transplantation Registry (EBMTR), for whom a compliance of only 55.3% was observed with the second ASCT (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2004</LINK>). Therefore, sample size calculations for studies assessing TASCT upfront (that is independent from response to treatment, such as the ongoing study (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01109004" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01109004</LINK>)) should take into account that patients may progress prior to or develop contraindications against a second ASCT, or simply refuse to undergo a second transplantation. This decrease in compliance cannot be considered at random thus strategies need to be developed which aim at addressing the expected selection of patients both fit enough and willing to continue to second transplantation (see also <LINK REF="REF-Wheatley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wheatley 2006</LINK>). Alternatively, patients who successfully underwent first transplantation (and for whom sufficient stem cells were collected before) could be randomised between different consolidation treatment options. While the latter option bears the risk of introducing selection bias in the absence of objective criteria to describe the relevant population, it may ultimately avoid the other biases described at length above.</P>
<P>In view of the difficulty in ascribing specific causes of death in a multimorbid patient population, we propose reconsideration of the definition of the important endpoint of treatment- or transplantation-related mortality in order to optimise its clinical utility. Rather than defining the numerator, that is the type of events which qualify as treatment-related (a challenging and potentially subjective process (<LINK REF="REF-Keirns-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keirns 2008</LINK>)), the reporting of all-cause mortality in a relevant period of time (such as 'from randomisation until three months after completion of intensive treatment') is proposed. Specific causes of deaths, such as fatal infection during aplasia, could additionally be reported for didactic purposes. Early mortality reflects either too toxic or ineffective treatment, both of which are undesirable for symptomatic patients in the need of treatment.</P>
<P>The publication bias, as determined for the RCTs comparing TASCT with SASCT, emphasises both the necessity and the difficulties in including non-full text information when systematically evaluating a treatment concept in oncology (<LINK REF="REF-Curt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsey-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsey 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tam-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tam 2008</LINK>). Reporting of trials still needs to be improved in order to allow at least an informed discussion on the potential direction of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Hopewell-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopewell 2010</LINK>).</P>

Furthermore, response and time-to-progression were not analysed.

<P>Overview of Risk of bias in the set of included trials: Green colour indicates sufficient information available to verify adequate methods or similar features in both study arms. Red colour is used to highlight characteristics which were systematically different between study arms and therefore may result in a biased comparison (both conservative or anti-conservative). Yellow colour indicates lack of (sufficiently detailed) information.</P>
