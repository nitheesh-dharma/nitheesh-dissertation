<P>Testing women's hormone levels during high-risk pregnancy has not been shown to benefit women or their babies.</P>
<P>The placenta provides nourishment for the baby in the womb (uterus) during pregnancy. It has been thought that testing women's hormone levels during pregnancy, might show how well the placenta is functioning and whether the baby is growing as would be expected. (Hormones are natural chemicals produced in the body.) The review of one trial (622 women) found some evidence that measuring (o)estriol levels in high-risk pregnancies did not affect the outcome of the pregnancy.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2012-05-10 22:56:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Biochemical tests of placental or feto-placental function were widely used in the 1960s and 1970s in high-risk pregnancies to try to predict, and thus try to avoid, adverse fetal outcome.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of performing biochemical tests of placental function in high-risk, low-risk, or unselected pregnancies.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-05-10 22:56:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (10 May 2012).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Controlled trials (randomized or 'quasi-randomized') that compare the use of biochemical tests of placental function in pregnancy with non-use.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-11-08 15:34:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trial quality was assessed and data were extracted by the review author.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>A single eligible trial of poor quality was identified. It involved 622 women with high-risk pregnancies who had had plasma (o)estriol estimations. Women were allocated to have their (o)estriol results revealed or concealed on the basis of hospital record number (with attendant risk of selection bias). There were no obvious differences in perinatal mortality (relative risk (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 2.13) or planned delivery (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.15) between the two groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-11-08 15:36:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available trial data do not support the use of (o)estriol estimation in high-risk pregnancies. The single small trial available does not have the power to exclude a beneficial effect but this is probably of historical interest since biochemical testing has been superseded by biophysical testing in antepartum fetal assessment.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-05-10 23:00:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-10-28 10:27:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>A wide range of biochemical tests of fetal well-being were introduced during the 1950s and 1960s, but there was little agreement on their usefulness (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1989</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Greene-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greene 1965</LINK> listed more than 20 biochemical tests of placental function, but only two found an established role in antepartum assessment: urinary or plasma (o)estriols, and human placental lactogen (<LINK REF="REF-Chard-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chard 1982</LINK>). Human placental lactogen is produced by the placenta while oestriol is produced by a biochemical pathway that involves both the placenta and the endocrine system of the fetus. Both hormones tend to demonstrate low (and sometime falling) levels in association with utero-placental dysfunction manifesting as fetal growth restriction. Although there was little strong evidence to either commend or reject the use of these tests, they fell rapidly out of favour during the 1970s and became superceded by biophysical fetal testing, notably by antepartum cardiotocography and the ultrasound-based fetal biophysical profile. Ironically, the evidence base for the use of these tests is similarly thin (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pattison-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pattison 2002</LINK>). It was not until 1995 that a systematic review of randomized controlled trials of use of any method of antepartum fetal assessment demonstrated any tangible evidence of benefit - in this case, Doppler assessment of umbilical artery waveforms in high-risk pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is possible that trials of the effects of using other biochemical tests may take place in the future. Both alpha-fetoprotein (a fetal product) and human chorionic gonadotropin (a placental hormone) are biochemical tests used to screen for fetal chromosomal disorders in early to mid pregnancy. Both tests have a loose capability of predicting subsequent pregnancy complications including fetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Luckas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luckas 1998</LINK>) and could, theoretically, provide the basis for future screening trials.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine if knowledge of the results of placental or feto-placental hormone levels are of benefit in improving fetal outcome or obstetric care in high-risk, low-risk, or unselected pregnancies.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-10-26 15:07:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>Reports of identified trials that appeared relevant to the objectives of the review were evaluated for inclusion. Both published and unpublished reports could be included. Attempts would be made to translate identified, non-English language reports. Primary authors would be contacted for additional details when necessary. Reasons for excluding apparently relevant trials are made explicit.</P>
<P>Included trials were assessed according to the following criteria:<BR/>(1) adequate concealment of treatment allocation (e.g. sealed, opaque, numbered envelopes);<BR/>(2) method of allocation to treatment (e.g. by computer randomisation, random number tables);<BR/>(3) adequate documentation of how exclusions were handled after treatment allocation - to facilitate 'intention to treat' analyses;<BR/>(4) adequate blinding of outcome assessment, where appropriate;<BR/>(5) losses to follow up (trials with losses of greater than 25% will be excluded).</P>
<P>Data were entered directly from reports into Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2000</LINK>) and statistical analysis performed. For dichotomous data, relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% CIs were calculated for continuous data (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Heterogeneity between trials is tested using a standard chi squared test. In the presence of significant heterogeneity, a sensitivity analysis is used to explore the influence of high quality trials (fulfilling the criteria above) compared with those of lesser quality.</P>

<P>Group A (reported group), plasma oestrogen levels measured and reported promptly.</P>
<P>Group B (concealed group), plasma oestrogen levels measured but values were neither computed nor reported; they were computed and evaluated retrospectively.<BR/>A total of 4,678 plasma samples were assayed in the 622 women, an average of 7.5 samples per woman.</P>
