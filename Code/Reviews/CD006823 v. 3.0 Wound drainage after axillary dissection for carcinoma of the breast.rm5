<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-11 11:12:39 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies in women, accounting for a large number of deaths worldwide each year. Sometimes, an essential part of breast cancer management includes an operation to remove the lymph nodes in the armpit, called an 'axillary dissection', sometimes also known as 'axillary lymphadenectomy'. This operation may be needed if the cancer has spread (metastasised) to the armpit. One consequence of removing some, or all, of these lymph nodes is that a collection of fluid called a <I>seroma</I> can develop in the armpit. This can be uncomfortable and may require drainage (also known as <I>aspiration</I>). Other complications include risks of infection, bleeding and arm lymphoedema. One strategy that is widely used to try to minimise these complications is the insertion of a plastic drainage tube into the armpit during surgery that allows any fluid collecting in the armpit to drain away. However, debate is ongoing amongst surgeons regarding the value of such drains because they can cause pain and discomfort and may delay discharge from hospital.</P>
<P>This Cochrane review aims to determine whether drain tube insertion reduces complication rates or is associated with any risks or harms. We analysed seven randomised controlled trials including 960 participants that compared drain insertion with no drainage after axillary lymphadenectomy for the treatment of breast cancer. We found that the chance of getting a seroma if a drain was inserted was less than if no drain was inserted (0.46 times less likely), and that the number of aspirations required (using a needle to drain seroma fluid in the outpatient clinic) was lower (on average, 0.79 fewer per participant). These benefits must be balanced against a longer average hospital stay of 1.47 days in the drained population, although increasingly patients can be discharged with their drain in place, to be removed at a later date. Risk of infection, volume of fluid aspirated and rates of lymphoedema (arm swelling) or haematoma (bruising) did not differ between drained and undrained participants.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-10-16 09:20:00 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Wound and Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Registers (22 February 2013), MEDLINE (1950 to 22 February 2013), EMBASE (1966 to 22 February 2013), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov (22 February 2013) for all prospectively registered and ongoing trials (22 February 2013). Reference lists of included studies were handsearched by two independent review authors to look for additional eligible trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-10-01 10:49:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing wound drainage versus no wound drainage in individuals after axillary dissection for the treatment of breast carcinoma were included. All disease stages were considered. Breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy were considered. Patients undergoing sentinel node biopsy without axillary dissection were not included. No limits were applied to language or study location. Two review authors independently determined the eligibility of each study.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-10-14 10:50:49 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data for each included study using a predesigned data extraction proforma and assessed risk of bias using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus discussion with a third review author. Dichotomous variables were analysed using a Mantel-Haenszel model to produce odds ratios (ORs). Continuous variables were analysed using an inverse variance model to produce a mean difference (MD).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-16 09:32:59 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seven RCTs including 960 participants were identified. The quality of trials was generally low, with several studies at risk of selection bias, and no studies used blinding during treatment or outcome assessment. There was a high level of statistical variation between the studies, which therefore reduces the reliability of the evidence. The OR for seroma formation was 0.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.91, P = 0.03) in favour of a reduced incidence of seroma in participants with drains inserted. There was no significant difference in infection rates between drainage and no drainage groups (OR = 0.70; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.12, P = 0.14). The mean difference in length of hospital stay, reported in four trials consisting of 600 participants, was 1.47 days greater in the drained population (95% CI 0.67 to 2.28, P = 0.0003). A mean difference of 0.79 fewer postoperative seroma aspirations was found in the drained population (95% CI 1.23 to 0.35 fewer, P = 0.0004) in two trials including 212 participants. No significant difference in volume of seroma aspirations was reported (MD -19.44, 95% CI -59.45 to 20.57, P = 0.34) in three trials including 519 participants. No significant difference in the incidence of lymphoedema was noted (OR 2.31 favouring no drainage, 95% CI 0.47 to 11.37, P = 0.30), with only six instances reported in three trials of 360 participants, nor was any significant difference in the incidence of haematoma observed (OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.33 to 8.51, P = 0.53), with only five instances reported in two trials of 314 participants.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-10-10 14:00:39 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is limited quality evidence that insertion of a drain following axillary lymphadenectomy reduced the odds of developing a seroma and reduced the number of post-operative seroma aspirations. These benefits should be balanced against an increased length of hospital stay in the drained population.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-10-14 10:54:53 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-10-14 10:53:57 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Breast cancer is one of the most frequent malignant neoplasms in women, with an estimated 230,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer per annum in the United States, causing 40,000 deaths (<LINK REF="REF-American-Cancer-Society-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">American Cancer Society 2012</LINK>). Surgical treatment is the most effective option for loco-regional control of this disease (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2006</LINK>). Axillary dissection (or lymphadenectomy)<B> </B>is frequently performed on individuals with carcinoma of the breast (<LINK REF="REF-Axelsson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Axelsson 2007</LINK>). Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a less invasive alternative procedure to axillary dissection that is used to stage breast cancer in clinically node-negative patients; this procedure may be associated with reduced postoperative morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Mansel-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansel 2007</LINK>). Axillary dissection is associated with the development of postoperative morbidity such as seroma (a pocket of clear serous fluid after surgery), haematoma, infection, lymphoedema and numbness (mainly in the upper and inner aspect of the affected arm) (<LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2002</LINK>). The development of a seroma has been reported in 15% to 85% of cases (<LINK REF="STD-Soon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soon 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of factors influence the formation of seromas. These include the presence of tumour-infiltrated axillary lymphatics, the size of the lymphatic interruption after surgery, a history of previous biopsies, the size of the breast and the residual cavity, the surgical technique used (mastectomy or lumpectomy), the use of electrocautery with a diathermy device and the duration of suction drainage and cicatrisation (the process of wound healing that occurs when scar tissue is produced) (<LINK REF="REF-Agrawal-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agrawal 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuroi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuroi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pogson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pogson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stehbens-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stehbens 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Bemmel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Bemmel 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-10-14 10:54:53 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>The presence of seromas can impact patient satisfaction in the postoperative period and may lead to the need for medical interventions. In some cases, repeated aspirations and even surgical drainage of the seroma may be required, thus increasing the risks of infection, skin flap necrosis, prolonged hospital stay and delayed commencement of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both (<LINK REF="REF-Hashemi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hashemi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Bemmel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Bemmel 2011</LINK>)</P>
<P>Therapeutic approaches used to prevent the formation of seromas include external compression, use of fibrin glue, use of harmonic scalpels during tissue dissection, immobilisation of the ipsilateral arm and wound drainage through a tube (multiple hole type versus multiple channel type) and a device that acts with closed suction or gravity drainage&#8212;all of which have had less than satisfying results (<LINK REF="REF-Bohm-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohm 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pogson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pogson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Bemmel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Bemmel 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Closed suction drains have been used traditionally in the postoperative period after surgery for carcinoma of the breast to reduce the frequency of the formation of seromas. Recently, this concept has been challenged by several authors, who have proposed that the clinical course of the formation of seroma is not modified by the use of drainage (<LINK REF="STD-Classe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Classe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talbot-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Talbot 2002</LINK>), and that prolonged drainage may have a negative impact on wound healing (<LINK REF="STD-Jain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2004</LINK>). However, other studies show that individuals who do not use drainage have seromas of greater volume that last longer and require additional procedures for drainage (<LINK REF="STD-Soon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soon 2005</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-10-01 11:44:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>The value of drain insertion after axillary lymphadenectomy remains a controversial topic, given that several papers have disputed the value of drains. This review will help clinicians to make evidence-based decisions regarding the care provided to the large number of patients undergoing axillary lymphadenectomy each year. Previous systematic reviews have considered this question. This meta-analysis includes greater numbers of participants and randomised controlled trials than were examined in previous reviews.</P>

<ALLOCATION MODIFIED="2013-10-01 12:15:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>In two studies, high risk of selection bias was due to inadequate methods of randomisation: Somers et al<I> </I>used a pseudorandomisation method based on the last digit of the participant's admission number, and Soon et al<I> </I>used pseudorandomisation based on the day of the month (<LINK REF="STD-Somers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Somers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soon 2005</LINK>). Furthermore, in four studies, the risk of bias during randomisation was unclear: Cameron et al used &#8220;sequentially numbered sealed envelopes&#8221;. However, it is unclear whether these envelopes were opaque, and whether the sequence was truly random. Classe et al stated that &#8220;randomisation was done in blocks of six&#8221;, yet it is unclear whether these blocks were generated randomly. Purushotham et al<I> </I>used "consecutively numbered opaque envelopes". Therefore, in all of these studies, it is unclear whether the sequences were generated randomly. Zavotsky et al<I> </I>state that "patients...were intra-operatively randomised to drain or no-drain groups&#8221; with no mention of the method of randomisation used. Only one study was assessed as low risk: Jain et al,<I> </I>who used "sealed, opaque envelopes containing computer generated random numbers" (<LINK REF="STD-Cameron-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Classe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Classe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Purushotham-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Purushotham 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zavotksy-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zavotksy 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Allocation concealment was at a generally lower risk of bias than randomisation. The two studies that used pseudorandomisation methods were rated as high risk because a surgeon who knew the randomisation method would know perioperatively whether the participant was receiving a drain (<LINK REF="STD-Somers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Somers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soon 2005</LINK>). Two studies were rated as unclear because they did not state when the allocation was revealed (<LINK REF="STD-Classe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Classe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Purushotham-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Purushotham 2002</LINK>). Three studies revealed the allocation at the end of the operation, so were rated as low risk (<LINK REF="STD-Cameron-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zavotksy-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zavotksy 1998</LINK>).</P>

<BLINDING MODIFIED="2013-10-01 12:19:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>When blinding of participants and personnel is attempted, it is clearly not possible to blind surgeons or participants to the presence or absence of a drain inserted into the axilla; therefore all studies were rated as unclear bias because we cannot be certain what, if any, impact this inability to blind would have.</P>
<P>Despite these obvious difficulties in blinding to the presence or absence of a drain in the axilla, none of the trials mentioned any attempt to blind assessors during postoperative follow-up after drain removal. Therefore when detection bias was assessed, an important consideration was whether study methodologies objectively defined key outcome measures of seroma and infection and the criteria for aspiration of seroma so as to allow objective assessment of these clinical outcomes. Three studies adequately defined seroma (<LINK REF="STD-Classe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Classe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Somers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Somers 1992</LINK>), and four studies adequately defined infection (<LINK REF="STD-Classe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Classe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Purushotham-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Purushotham 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Somers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Somers 1992</LINK>). Among studies that reported the number of aspirations, three of four adequately defined criteria for seroma aspiration (<LINK REF="STD-Jain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Somers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Somers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soon 2005</LINK>). Volume of aspiration was judged to be at low risk of bias because it is an objectively measured quantity of fluid.</P>
<P>Only one study included aspects of participant-reported outcome measures, including pain scores and measures of psychological distress. The inability to blind to the presence of a drain introduces a high risk of bias for participant self-assessment of pain and other considerations of morbidity.</P>

<P>In five studies, no concerns regarding attrition bias were described, and complete outcome data were reported for all participants. Somers et al<I> </I>did not perform an intention-to-treat analysis, and 4/103 participants in the drain group were excluded from subsequent analysis because they had drains remaining in situ at &gt; 24 hours, in breach of study protocol. However, reasons for prolonged drain retention are not discussed. Cameron et al was judged to be at high risk because, despite reporting on all 40 participants, no data on the follow-up period were provided because &#8220;follow-up and treatment were not uniform&#8221;.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incidence of seroma formation</HEADING>
<P>All seven trials included seroma as an outcome, reporting on 960 participants. Significant statistical heterogeneity between trials was noted (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 68%, P = 0.005). Analysis using a random-effects model demonstrated a statistically significant odds ratio of 0.46 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.91, P = 0.03) in favour of a reduced incidence of seroma in participants with drains inserted (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>To identify a potential source for this heterogeneity, a subgroup analysis was performed to analyse the differential effects of breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy or wide local excision) and mastectomy. For breast-conserving surgery, five trials reported results from 595 participants. Significant heterogeneity remained between trials (I² = 78%, P = 0.001). The odds ratio was 0.64 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.76, P = 0.39) (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). For mastectomy, two trials reported results from 238 participants. Again, there remained significant heterogeneity between the two trials (I<SUP>2</SUP>= 86%, P = 0.007). The OR was 0.26 (95% CI 0.02 to 2.82, P = 0.27) (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6;</LINK> <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). One trial did not stratify results by breast-conserving surgery versus mastectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Soon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soon 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>We attempted to probe this heterogeneity by conducting a sensitivity analysis that excluded Soon and Somers because of the high risk of selection bias (i.e. random sequence generation and allocation concealment bias) due to the use of pseudorandomisation methods in these studies. Significant heterogeneity remained (I<SUP>2</SUP>= 73%, P = 0.006). The OR was 0.44 (95% CI 0.18 to 1.11, P = 0.08) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another potential source for the heterogeneity is significant methodological differences regarding definitions of seroma. As discussed previously, only three trials mentioned the criteria used to define seroma.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incidence of wound infection</HEADING>
<P>All seven trials reported infection rates in 960 participants. A low level of heterogeneity was observed (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 26%, P = 0.25). Analysis using a fixed-effect model revealed no significant difference in the number of infections with or without drain insertion (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.12, P =0.14; <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Lymphoedema</HEADING>
<P>Only three trials recorded rates of arm lymphoedema, with a total of just six reported incidences in 360 participants. No significant difference in the incidence of lymphoedema using drains versus no drainage was reported, despite an OR of 2.31 favouring no drainage but with a very wide 95% CI of 0.47 to 11.37 (P = 0.30) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Length of hospital stay</HEADING>
<P>Four trials reported length of hospital stay for 600 participants. Analysis using a random-effects model showed a significant mean difference of 1.47 days longer in the drained population (95% CI 0.67 to 2.28, P = 0.0003; <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). However, heterogeneity was significant (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 89%, P &lt; 0.0001). One explanation for this significant heterogeneity may be the variability in trial protocols regarding dates of discharge<I>.</I> Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cameron-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Classe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Classe 2006</LINK>) did not detail the criteria used by clinicians in deciding when to discharge participants. Both of the remaining studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Purushotham-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Purushotham 2002</LINK>) used different criteria to determine discharge dates for drained and undrained participants. A subgroup analysis of 138 participants after the two clearly biased studies were excluded showed a non-significant mean difference of 1.62 days longer in the drained population with a wide 95% CI of -0.54 to 3.77 (P = 0.14) and significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 94%, P &lt; 0.0001; <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Number of seroma aspirations</HEADING>
<P>Three trials reported data on the number of aspirations of postoperative seroma from 240 participants who developed seroma (<LINK REF="STD-Jain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Somers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Somers 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zavotksy-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zavotksy 1998</LINK>). The number of aspirations may be considered as a sign of the severity of a seroma and its burden to both participant and clinician. Analysis could be performed only for the former two studies (Jain and Somers, n = 212), as Zavotsky's group reported zero aspirations in the drain group (n = 24), producing a mean of 0. This could not be compared with the 14 participants who required at least one aspiration. The forest plot therefore is based on two studies; a fixed-effect model showed a mean difference of 0.79 fewer aspirations per participant in the drained group (95% CI 0.35 to 1.23, P = 0.0004; <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>).</P>

For the two trials that could not be used in the meta-analysis for this outcome, Soon et al reported total volumes of 538.8 mL in the drained group versus 856.7 mL in the undrained group, but they did not report standard deviations or the results of any statistical tests (<LINK REF="STD-Soon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soon 2005</LINK>); Jain et al reported median volumes of 140 mL (interquartile range (IQR) 125 to 205) in the drained group versus 300 mL (IQR 245 to 660) in the undrained group (<LINK REF="STD-Jain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2004</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-11 11:13:38 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Insertion of a drain after axillary lymphadenectomy reduces the risk of seroma formation (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.91, P = 0.03). Subanalysis by type of breast operation demonstrated an odds ratio of 0.64 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.76, P = 0.39) after breast-conserving surgery and 0.26 (95% CI 0.02 to 2.82, P = 0.27) after mastectomy; both showed a non-significant reduction in seroma formation after drain insertion, with wider confidence intervals due to smaller subgroup sample sizes.</P>
<P>No difference in infection rates was reported between drained versus undrained populations with an OR 0.70 (95% CI 0.44 to 1.12, P = 0.14). No difference was noted in the OR for lymphoedema in the drained versus undrained groups (OR 2.31, 95% CI 0.47 to 11.37, P = 0.30) or for haematoma (OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.33 to 8.51, P = 0.53).</P>
<P>A mean difference of 1.47 days longer hospital stay was noted in the drained population (95% CI 0.67 to 2.28, P = 0.0003), and a mean difference of 0.79 fewer aspirations per drained participant was observed (95% CI 0.35 to 1.23, P = 0.0004). However, no difference in the volume of aspirations was reported (MD -19.44, 95% CI -59.45 to 20.57, P = 0.34).</P>
<P>In summary, we have identified limited quality evidence to support a clinically significant reduction in the odds of developing a seroma if a drain is inserted, and in the number of postoperative seroma aspirations required. However, evidence supports a clinically significant increase in the duration of hospital stay for drained versus undrained participants.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-10-11 11:14:27 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>The seven studies identified for inclusion in this review include a heterogeneous population of breast cancer patients. It is important to note that the studies include participants undergoing a range of different breast operations, including lumpectomy, wide local excision and mastectomy; as well as a variable extent of axillary clearance procedures. All studies conducted axillary dissection up to level II lymph nodes, and three studies extended this dissection to level III nodes/nodes inferior to the axillary vein (<LINK REF="STD-Cameron-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zavotksy-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zavotksy 1998</LINK>). The average age of participants in these studies ranged from 50.0 to 62.3 years. The heterogeneity of breast carcinoma pathology included in this review lends validity to our conclusions across a wide range of patients.</P>
<P>However, more complicated cases of breast carcinoma may not have been included in the study populations. The inclusion/exclusion criteria for participants are not detailed in some earlier studies; however, Jain, Soon and Classe all excluded patients who had undergone previous breast or axillary surgery (excluding sentinel lymph node biopsy), Classe et al excluded those who received neoadjuvant therapy, and Soon et al excluded patients with prior axillary or chest wall irradiation (<LINK REF="STD-Classe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Classe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soon 2005</LINK>). Therefore our findings may have reduced validity in more complicated or advanced breast cancer patients.</P>
<P>It is important to note that none of the seven studies included male participants. Although men account for less than 1% of cases of breast cancer, the disease is often more advanced at presentation (<LINK REF="REF-Miao-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miao 2011</LINK>), and the effects of axillary drainage in men remain unclear.</P>
<P>A substantial debate continues between surgeons regarding the value of drain insertion, with some authors questioning the use of drains at all (<LINK REF="REF-Jeffrey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeffrey 1995</LINK>). An important evolution in surgical practice has been an increasing trend towards discharging patients with drains in situ. Some surgeons have argued that inserting a drain unnecessarily delays discharge and results in longer hospital stays (<LINK REF="REF-Jeffrey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeffrey 1995</LINK>)&#8212;a finding supported by this review. However, the increasing empowerment of patients and the presence of community support have led surgeons to discharge patients with drains in situ; this will reduce the validity of this finding for future practice.</P>
<P>Another important issue concerns the timing of axillary drain removal. Within the seven studies included in this meta-analysis, fixed-time removal ranged from 24 hours to 5 days postoperatively, and fixed-volume removal ranged from &lt; 50 mL to &lt; 25 mL over 24 hours postoperatively. A systematic review<I> </I>has evaluated this issue, attempting to develop guidelines for timing of drain removal (<LINK REF="REF-Kelley-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelley 2012</LINK>). Whilst addressing this issue is beyond the scope of this review, the range of drain removal protocols used in this review adds validity to our findings by encompassing the variety of drainage choices made by surgeons.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-10-11 11:14:34 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>This review analyses data from seven randomised controlled trials of 960 participants, published between 1988 and 2006. A total of 487 participants were randomly assigned to drain insertion, and 473 participants were randomly assigned to no drain. All trials were single-centre studies. Sample size across studies ranged from 40 to 375 participants.</P>
<P>Outcomes were generally consistent between studies. Six of seven trials demonstrated some reduction in seroma incidence among drained participants. Four of five trials showed some reduction in infection rates among drained participants; two trials reported no infection in either group, and one did not report infection rates. Two trials reported lower numbers of seroma aspirations in drained participants. All five trials reporting length of hospital stay showed longer stay lengths in the drained participant groups. Rates of lymphoedema were very low in these studies, as would be expected with short follow-up times, meaning that firm conclusions cannot be drawn on this issue.</P>
<P>There was significant evidence of heterogeneity for seroma incidence, which remained despite efforts to explain it using sub-group analyses. One explanation may be the wide range of seroma incidence reported: 0% to 94% in drained participants and 17% to 96% in undrained participants. This variation is due primarily to differences in clinical definitions of seroma and variations in local surgical practice. The key issue for surgical practice is whether axillary drainage reduces clinically relevant seroma; however, information derived from the studies concerning this important distinction is limited. It may be argued that aspiration of a seroma is a surrogate marker of clinical relevance, and when this secondary outcome measure was included, use of a drain reduced the number of aspirations.</P>
<P>The key methodological limitation of all seven studies is the inability to blind participants or outcome assessors to the presence or absence of a drain in the axilla. However, it is unclear whether this will have a substantial effect on study results because most key outcome assessments were likely to be made after drain removal. As was discussed earlier, studies with robust, objective outcome definitions of outcomes were assessed as low risk of bias. However, studies that did not detail criteria for outcome assessment were assessed as having high risk of bias because the judgement of surgeons could have been affected by personal bias in favour of or against drain insertion.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-10-14 10:57:23 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>The potential for bias in the review process is low. The main potential for bias lies in the statistical heterogeneity of the included studies, in particular with regard to length of hospital stay, for which the magnitude of effect varies substantially. We think this is likely secondary to the different protocols used in the studies to determine the day of discharge. Despite this, the direction of effect in all studies favoured non-drainage to allow earlier discharge from hospital. Our literature search was conducted by the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group according to accepted standards; thus we are confident that no risk of bias was detected in the included studies. Study selection was undertaken by two independent review authors (DRT and HS), working according to agreed upon inclusion/exclusion criteria. Although no language limits were applied to our search, all three review authors are English language speakers, thus there is a potential risk that non&#8211;English language material could have been missed, although our literature search should have identified any such studies. No non&#8211;English language studies were identified. We think the risk of publication bias is low, owing to the fact that researchers are unlikely to have a commercial interest in the results of trials. However, it is difficult to rule out publication bias secondary to non-publication of studies for other reasons, for example, because the results were not significant, or because the trials were not accepted for publication by journal editors.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-10-01 13:08:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Melina Willson">
<P>Two previous systematic reviews have addressed the question of drain insertion after axillary lymphadenectomy. He et al<I> </I>reviewed drainage after axillary lymphadenectomy; they analysed results from six trials including 585 participants. The review of He et al includes six of the trials included in this Cochrane review, but the review authors did not include Purushotham et al, a large trial that studied 385 participants. They concluded that drain insertion reduced the rate of seroma formation and the number of aspirations yet resulted in increased length of hospital stay, with no effect on infection rates (<LINK REF="REF-He-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 2011</LINK>). Droeser et al conducted a meta-analysis of six trials comparing volume-controlled versus no or short-term drainage and including 561 participants, in which short-term drainage was defined as &#8804; 3 days (<LINK REF="REF-Droeser-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Droeser 2009</LINK>). This Cochrane review includes the three trials in Droeser's review that had a no drainage arm (<LINK REF="STD-Cameron-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zavotksy-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zavotksy 1998</LINK>). Droeser et al<I> </I>concluded that drain insertion reduced seroma incidence yet increased length of hospital stay, with no effect on infection rates, although it is important to note that this analysis excludes studies that used a fixed-time removal protocol.</P>
<P>This Cochrane review is larger than either of the previously published systematic reviews, increasing the study population by more than 60%, with 960 included participants. The results of this study concur with previous evidence, chiefly that axillary drainage reduces seroma rates at the expense of longer hospital stay, with no effect on infection rates.</P>

<P>We have found evidence of limited quality that drain insertion after axillary lymphadenectomy reduces seroma formation and the requirement for postoperative aspiration. Key limitations of the evidence summarised in this review include risk of bias and high levels of statistical variation between study results. The use of a drain does not by any means eliminate the risk of developing seroma and the need for subsequent aspiration. Use of a drain has been shown to increase duration of hospital stay; however, the implications of this finding will be influenced by local practice regarding discharge of patients with drains in situ<I>.</I>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-10-14 10:57:35 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whilst this review offers good evidence for some conclusions, the limited number of trials reporting certain outcomes means that some analyses lack statistical power, particularly concerning rates of infection, lymphoedema and haematoma and subanalysis of breast-conserving therapy versus mastectomy. Several methodological concerns and flaws were highlighted earlier. Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies in women; consequently a large number of axillary lymphadenectomies are performed every year. It is therefore vital that we have good quality evidence regarding best practice management of these patients. Future research should include adequately powered randomised controlled trials, reported in accordance with CONSORT guidelines. </P>
<P>The most important improvement needed to existing trials should be the use of blinded outcome assessment. To add further validity, outcome measures must be objectively defined and ideally objectively measured. A distinction should be made between all seromas and "clinically significant" seromas. These definitions must be objectively measurable, ideally through a system of independent ultrasound-aided diagnosis, although this may prove unfeasible in the clinical setting. Similarly, criteria for seroma aspiration should be objectively defined. The definition of wound infection could be improved through the use of validated scoring scales, such as those used by Purushotham et al<I> </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Purushotham-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Purushotham 2002</LINK>)<I>.</I>
</P>
<P>Finally, further studies should also include participant-reported outcome measures, as relatively few trials have investigated these.</P>

<P>The protocol of this review was originally published by V Pineda, C Manterola, M Vial and P Astudillo.</P>
<P>The original protocol proposed that the type of drain used (with or without aspiration) should be considered for subanalysis. However, all seven papers used closed suction drains, so this subanalysis was not possible.</P>
<P>Originally, microbiologically confirmed wound infection was listed; we changed this to infection, because microbiological results were rarely reported.</P>
<P>A number of changes were made to the list of secondary outcomes listed in the published protocol. These include the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>'Type of breast surgery (mastectomy or lumpectomy)' was removed from the outcome list and instead was integrated as part of the subgroup analysis, when possible.</LI>
<LI>Arm lymphoedema rate was added to the secondary outcomes.</LI>
<LI>'Quantity of fluid aspirated' is now referred to as 'Volume of seroma aspirated'.</LI>
<LI>'Frequency of seroma aspirations' is now referred to as 'Number of seroma aspirations'.</LI>
