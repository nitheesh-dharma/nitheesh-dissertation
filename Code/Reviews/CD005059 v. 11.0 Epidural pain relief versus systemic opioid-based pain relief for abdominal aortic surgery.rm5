<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-03-27 12:59:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Open surgery on the abdominal aorta (the main artery to the legs) requires aggressive postoperative pain management. The most commonly used pain management is epidural analgesia. This involves injecting pain-relieving medicines through a catheter (narrow tube) that is placed in the epidural space (the outermost part of the spinal space). The alternative is systemic opioids (morphine-like medicines injected into the bloodstream).</P>
<P>
<B>Objectives</B>
</P>
<P>This review evaluated the effect of these two methods of pain relief and the risks of postoperative complications and deaths after open abdominal aortic surgery. The review was originally published in 2006, updated in 2012, and again in 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Methods</B>
</P>
<P>We searched scientific databases for clinical trials comparing epidural analgesia with systemic opioids in adults. Two authors independently assessed the quality of the trials and collected the data. We reran the search in March 2017. We will deal with the new study of interest when we update the review. </P>
<P>
<B>Main results</B>
</P>
<P>We included 15 trials published from 1987 to 2009 with 1498 participants in this updated review. The evidence is current to November 2014. The trials received financial support from a charitable organization (one study), a governmental organization (four studies) or the pharmaceutical industry (one study). The source of funding was unspecified for nine studies. We found that epidural analgesia reduced heart attacks, postoperative duration of tracheal intubation (a flexible breathing tube that is placed directly into the windpipe), risk of postoperative respiratory failure (requirement of a machine to assist the respiration after the surgery), gastrointestinal bleeding, decreased postoperative pain, and length of stay in the intensive care unit (equivalent to six hours). For death after the surgery, we did not found a difference in the death rate (in hospital or up to 30 days). The quality of evidence was low for mortality and time before tracheal extubation; meaning that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. The quality of evidence was moderate for heart attacks, respiratory failure, and intensive care unit length of stay; meaning that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. The quality of evidence was high for gastrointestinal bleeding and pain scores; meaning that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.</P>
<P>
<B>Authors' conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Epidural analgesia provides better pain management than systemic opioids. It significantly reduces the number of people who will suffer heart damage, time to return of unassisted respiration, gastrointestinal bleeding, and intensive care unit length of stay. We did not find a difference in death rates at 30 days.</P>

<P>We included 15 trials published from 1987 to 2009 with 1498 participants in this updated review. Participants had a mean age between 60.5 and 71.3 years. The percentage of women in the included studies varied from 0% to 28.1%.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-01-04 20:19:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Abdominal aortic aneurysm can be defined as a focal dilation of the abdominal aorta of at least 1.5 times the normal diameter or an absolute value of 3.0 cm or greater (<LINK REF="REF-Sampson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 2014</LINK>). Known risk factors include age, male sex, atherosclerosis, smoking, hypertension, and history in a first-degree relative. In 2010, the incidence varied from 7.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.5 to 9.6) in the 40 to 44 years age group to 2274.8 (95% CI 2149.8 to 2410.2) per 100,000 in the 75 to 79 years age group. These numbers represent a small decrease compared to 1990 figures (8.4 (95% CI 7.0 to 10.1) in the 40 to 44 years age group and 2422.5 (95% CI 2298.6 to 2562.3) per 100,000 in the 75 to 79 years age group (<LINK REF="REF-Sampson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 2014</LINK>). Prevalence was higher in high-income versus low-income nations. The highest prevalence in 1990 was in the high-income regions of Australasia and North America. Australasia still had the highest prevalence in 2010 with high-income North American regions coming third with a prevalence of 256.1 (95% CI 238.6 to 275.0) (<LINK REF="REF-Sampson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 2014</LINK>). Contemporary one-time screening of men for abdominal aortic aneurism appears highly cost-effective, and seems to remain an effective preventive health-measure (<LINK REF="REF-Svensjo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svensjo 2014</LINK>). There actually is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of cardiovascular prophylaxis in reducing mortality and cardiovascular events in people with abdominal aortic aneurisms (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2014</LINK>). Traditionally, abdominal aortic aneurisms were treated by open abdominal surgical repair consisting in excision or not of the lesion and interposition of a synthetic graft. Since the early-1990s, endovascular aneurysm repair has become available. In people considered fit for conventional surgery, endovascular aortic replacement was associated with lower short-term mortality than open abdominal aortic repair. However, this benefit from endovascular aortic repair did not persist at the intermediate- and long-term follow-ups. People undergoing endovascular aortic repair had a higher re-intervention rate than people undergoing open aortic repair (<LINK REF="REF-Paravastu-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paravastu 2014</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-01-04 20:20:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epidural anaesthesia or analgesia consists of an injection of either local anaesthetic or opioids, or a mixture of both, into the epidural space as a modality to complement general anaesthesia for open abdominal aortic repair (epidural anaesthesia) or to treat postoperative pain (epidural analgesia). Epidural anaesthesia or analgesia is usually achieved through the insertion of an epidural catheter either at the thoracic or lumbar level.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-01-04 20:23:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epidural analgesia provides better analgesia than parenteral opioids regardless of the analgesic agent, location of catheter placement, and type and time of pain assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Block-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Block 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guay-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2006</LINK>). The superior analgesia offers improved postoperative coughing and breathing, and improved pulmonary mechanics thus potentially reducing pulmonary complications (<LINK REF="REF-Guay-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2014a</LINK>). The sympathetic blockade provided by epidural anaesthesia and analgesia and the sparing of the total opioid doses required improve bowel motility (<LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 2000</LINK>). These favourable effects of epidural analgesia may considerably reduce non-life-threatening morbidity and may have an important role in a multimodal approach to achieve prompt and expeditious recovery after surgery.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-01-05 12:29:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The original review was conducted because of a lack of consensus regarding the value of epidural anaesthesia and analgesia for this patient population (<LINK REF="REF-Nishimori-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishimori 2006</LINK>). People undergoing open abdominal aortic surgery typically have vasculopathy, often with a history of diabetes or smoking. They may well be either benefited or harmed by epidural analgesia (<LINK REF="REF-Hebl-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hebl 2006</LINK>). The most recent version of this review concluded that epidural analgesia provided better pain relief (especially during movement) in the period up to three postoperative days, and reduced the duration of postoperative tracheal intubation, the occurrence of prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation, myocardial infarction, gastric complications and renal complications (<LINK REF="REF-Nishimori-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishimori 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the present version of the review, we looked for new studies and updated the methodology.</P>

<P>We evaluated trial quality using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed risk of bias for the following domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting. We did not use blinding of participants and personnel as a risk of bias domain since it may be considered unethical to use sham epidurals. Instead, we evaluated if care programmes were identical for the intervention and control groups.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-01-05 12:29:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We reported results as risk ratio (RR) and their 95% CI for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous data as much as was feasible. If some of the continuous data were given on different scales or if results were not available as mean and standard deviation (SD) or events and total number of participants (P value extraction), we produced the results as standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI. For SMD, we considered 0.2 a small effect, 0.5 a medium effect, and 0.8 a large effect (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=928503092312461885&amp;versionPK1=z1506171902470261761770610344979&amp;versionPK2=z1506251339399253797028119620617#REF-Pace-2011">Pace 2011</A>). For clinical correspondence, we multiplied the SD of the control group of a study at low risk of bias by the SMD. When there was an effect, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) from the odds ratio (OR). We gave results for dichotomous data as RR because OR is not easily understood by clinicians (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=928503092312461885&amp;versionPK1=z1506171902470261761770610344979&amp;versionPK2=z1506251339399253797028119620617#REF-Deeks-2002">Deeks 2002</A>; <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=928503092312461885&amp;versionPK1=z1506171902470261761770610344979&amp;versionPK2=z1506251339399253797028119620617#REF-McColl-1998">McColl 1998</A>), but used OR for calculation of NNTB and NNTH (<A HREF="http://www.nntonline.net/visualrx/">www.nntonline.net/visualrx/</A>) (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=928503092312461885&amp;versionPK1=z1506171902470261761770610344979&amp;versionPK2=z1506251339399253797028119620617#REF-Cates-2002">Cates 2002</A>; <A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=928503092312461885&amp;versionPK1=z1506171902470261761770610344979&amp;versionPK2=z1506251339399253797028119620617#REF-Deeks-2002">Deeks 2002</A>).

<P>The unit of analysis was a participant who was individually randomized to the treatment group (intervention or control) of the RCTs selected for this review.</P>
<P>Three trials had more than two treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Broekema-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Broekema 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norris-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reinhart-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Reinhart 1989</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Broekema-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Broekema 1998</LINK> allocated participants to three groups: epidural-sufentanil group, epidural-morphine group, and intramuscular morphine (IM) group. Both the epidural-sufentanil and epidural-morphine groups received postoperative epidural analgesia; and the IM group received IM for postoperative analgesia. The only difference between the epidural-sufentanil group and the epidural-morphine group was the type of opioid they received epidurally (sufentanil or morphine). Otherwise they were similar. We were able to combine these two groups because the author provided raw data.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Reinhart-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Reinhart 1989</LINK>, participants were allocated into three groups: thoracic epidural anaesthesia group; neurolept anaesthesia group; and halothane group. The thoracic epidural anaesthesia group received postoperative epidural analgesia. The neurolept anaesthesia and halothane groups received postoperative systemic opioid (piritramide analgesia). However, during surgery these two groups received different types of general anaesthesia. The neurolept anaesthesia group received neurolept anaesthesia with fentanyl and droperidol, and the halothane group received halothane with nitrous oxide and oxygen. Data were entered as subgroups, dividing the intervention group (thoracic epidural anaesthesia) by two, allowing us to analyse the data as subgroups or combining them.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Norris-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 2001</LINK>, participants were allocated into four possible combinations of anaesthesia: general anaesthesia (GA) followed by IV morphine patient-controlled analgesia (IVPCA) (GA-IVPCA), general anaesthesia followed by epidural patient-controlled analgesia (EPCA) (GA-EPCA), general anaesthesia combined with epidural anaesthesia (RSGA) followed by IVPCA (RSGA-IVPCA) and RSGA followed by EPCA (RSGA-EPCA). We divided the data from GA-IVPCA by three to allow us to analyse the data as subgroups compared to the three regimens that included an epidural (GA-EPCA, RSGA-IVPCA, and RSGA-EPCA) or combining them.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of findings</HEADING>
<P>The quality of the body of evidence was judged according to the system developed by the GRADE working group (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011a</LINK>) and presented in a 'Summary of findings' table (<A HREF="http://ims.cochrane.org/revman/gradepro">ims.cochrane.org/revman/gradepro</A>) for the following outcomes: mortality in hospital or up to 30 days, myocardial infarction, tracheal intubation duration, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, visual or verbal analogue scale (VAS) score on movement at postoperative day one and ICU length of stay. For risk of bias, we judged the quality of evidence as low risk of bias when most information came from studies at low risk of bias, and downgraded it by one level when most information came from studies at low or unclear risk of bias or by two levels when the proportion of information from studies at high risk of bias was sufficient to affect the interpretation of results. For inconsistency, we downgraded the quality of evidence by one when the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was 50% or higher without satisfactory explanation and by two levels when the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was 75% or higher without an explanation. We did not downgrade the quality of evidence for indirectness as all outcomes were based on direct comparisons, were performed on the population at interest, and were not surrogate markers (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011b</LINK>). For imprecision (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011c</LINK>), we downgraded the quality of evidence by one when the CI around the effect size was large or overlapped an absence of effect and failed to exclude an important benefit or harm; the number of participants was lower than the optimal information size (unless the sample size was at least of 2000 participants or the number of events included was at least 400); and we downgraded the quality by two levels when the CI was very wide and included both appreciable benefit and harm. For publication bias, we downgraded the quality of evidence by one when correcting for the possibility of publication as assessed by the Duval and Tweedie's fill and trim analysis changed the conclusion. We upgraded the quality of evidence by one when the effect size was large (less than 0.5 or greater than 2.0) and by two when the effect size was very large (RR less than 0.2 or greater than 5) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011d</LINK>). We applied the same rules for OR when the basal risk was lower than 20%. For SMD, we used 0.8 as the cutoff point for a large effect (<LINK REF="REF-Pace-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pace 2011</LINK>). We also upgraded the quality by one when there was evidence of a dose-related response. The quality was upgraded by one when possible effect of confounding factors would reduce a demonstrated effect or suggest a spurious effect when results show no effect. When the quality of the body of evidence is high, further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. When the quality is moderate, further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. When the quality is low, further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. When the quality is very low, any estimate of effect is very uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>).</P>

Using an epidural for postoperative analgesia produced a slight decrease in VAS scores at rest on postoperative day one (MD -0.85 (95% CI -1.46 to -0.25); I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic = 61%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-01-05 16:03:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adding an epidural to general anaesthesia does not change the mortality rate at 30 days for people undergoing open abdominal aortic repair (level of evidence low). This is consistent with the results of our overview (<LINK REF="REF-Guay-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2014a</LINK>), and with the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Nishimori-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishimori 2012</LINK>). However, adding an epidural reduced the rate of myocardial infarction (NNTB 28 (95% CI 19 to 1423); level of evidence moderate). For other interventions (e.g. systematic perioperative administration of beta-blocking agents or statins), where the intervention reduced myocardial infarction at 30 days, the mortality rate reduction was seen only after a longer period (up to one year) (<LINK REF="REF-Guay-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guay-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2014b</LINK>). Here data at one year were very limited. Only one trial gave results for mortality at one year (RR 0.60 (95% CI 0.19 to 1.90)) and the number of participants included in this trial was clearly insufficient to allow us to draw any valid conclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Norris-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 2001</LINK>). Therefore, studies with a longer follow-up and a sufficient number of participants are required before a firm conclusion on the effects of adding an epidural to general anaesthesia of people undergoing open abdominal aortic surgery can be drawn.</P>
<P>Adding an epidural to general anaesthesia reduced the time to tracheal extubation (level of evidence low) and postoperative respiratory failure (level of evidence moderate). Therefore it follows that adding an epidural reduced the time spent in the ICU (level of evidence moderate).</P>
<P>We also found a reduction in postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding (level of evidence high). This is consistent with one study showing that people receiving epidural anaesthesia during abdominal aortic reconstruction appeared to have less severe disturbances of sigmoid perfusion compared with people not receiving epidural anaesthesia (<LINK REF="STD-Panaretou-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Panaretou 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>As already clearly demonstrated, epidural analgesia decreased postoperative pain scores and this was particularly evident on pain score on movement. The level of evidence for pain reduction on movement at postoperative day one was high quality.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-01-04 21:51:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adding an epidural to general anaesthesia for people undergoing abdominal aortic repair reduces VAS scores, time to tracheal extubation, myocardial infarction, postoperative respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and time spent in the ICU. We did not find a reduction of mortality (in-hospital or up to 30 days). The level of evidence was low for mortality and time before tracheal extubation; moderate for myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, and ICU length of stay; and high for gastrointestinal bleeding and VAS scores.</P>

<P>We could not demonstrate a reduction in mortality rate, but the number of participants with an adequate period of follow-up was clearly insufficient for this outcome. For all other outcomes, we consider that the quality of the studies included in the present review was sufficient to allow us to make conclusions on the effect of adding an epidural to general anaesthesia for people undergoing open abdominal aortic surgery. This is supported by the level of evidence that was rated as moderate quality for a reduction in myocardial infarction, respiratory failure and length of stay in the ICU and high for pain scores and gastrointestinal bleeding . For length of tracheal intubation, there was some inconsistency between the studies and the level of evidence was low. This might be due, in part to a change in practice over the years. Studies included in the present review were published between 1987 and 2009. A change in the clinical practice towards earlier tracheal extubation has clearly taken place during these years.</P>

<P>We are confident that our search was extensive enough to allow us to include all relevant studies. Additional information provided by some authors also allowed us to include high-quality unpublished data. Although some of the studies had some item at risk of bias, we think that the quality of included studies is sufficient enough to allow us to draw valid conclusion on our outcomes of interest except for mortality, where studies with a longer period of follow-up are required, and time to tracheal extubation.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-01-05 16:03:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our results on the absence of effect on the mortality rate at 30 days are consistent with the results of our overview (<LINK REF="REF-Guay-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2014a</LINK>), and with the latest previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Nishimori-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishimori 2012</LINK>). However, as mentioned earlier, for other interventions, such as routine perioperative use of beta-blocking agents (<LINK REF="REF-Guay-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2013</LINK>) or statins (<LINK REF="REF-Guay-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2014b</LINK>), a reduction in the rate of myocardial infarction such as seen here may translate into a reduction in the mortality rate only after several months. Therefore, without an appropriate time of follow-up (up to 30 days only), we cannot conclude on the effect of adding epidural analgesia to general anaesthesia for people undergoing open abdominal aortic surgery for mortality.</P>

<P>Compared with systemic opioids, epidural analgesia provided better pain management up to postoperative day three, and reduced time to tracheal extubation, myocardial infarction, postoperative respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding and intensive care unit length of stay.

<P>We included postoperative epidural analgesia, either lumbar or thoracic. Systemic opioid-based pain relief included opioid drugs given by the following routes: intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous.

<P>We included intraoperative or postoperative (or both) epidural anaesthesia/analgesia added to general anaesthesia (either lumbar or thoracic) compared to general anaesthesia alone. We included all combinations of drugs and all start times (pre- or postoperatively). We imposed no restriction regarding the mode of analgesia used in the control group and included systemic opioid-based pain relief with opioid drugs given by the following routes: intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous. For both groups, bolus dosing, infusion, or patient-controlled analgesia devices were eligible for inclusion.</P>

<P>We did not pre-define these outcomes because definitions for similar outcomes may differ between studies. For example, some studies defined myocardial ischaemia as significant ST change confirmed by electrocardiogram, while others defined it as chest pain requiring nitroglycerin. Rather than defining outcomes strictly and omitting similar outcomes that did not strictly fit the definitions, we noted the definitions used by contributing investigators. Similarly for postoperative pain and mobilization, we noted the chosen measurement tool and whether it was validated or not.</P>

<P>"randomized open design" probably means that both study participants and anaesthesiologists were not blinded. For outcome assessors, it is unclear. They state that patients' S-T segment recording was assessed by an investigator who was blinded to the anaesthetic technique. But they did not mention whether outcome assessors who evaluated pain, sedation, and respiratory function were blinded. Decisions regarding extubation were made by ICU staff uninvolved in the study, guided by the unit protocol</P>

<P>Flow diagram of study selection. We excluded one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lombardo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lombardo 2009</LINK>; quasi-randomized trial; information obtained from the authors by the previous review authors), which was previously included in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Nishimori-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishimori 2012</LINK>). We added one new trial (<LINK REF="STD-Muehling-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Muehling 2009</LINK>). Therefore, the number of studies included in this review remains unchanged.</P>
<P>The search was reran in March 2017. Seven trials were excluded, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Owczuk-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Owczuk 2016</LINK>) awaits classification and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2015</LINK>) is ongoing.</P>
<P>RCT: randomized controlled trial.</P>

Comparison 1 Epidural versus systemic opioid (overall comparison), Outcome 12 Renal insufficiency) the numbers of the publication <LINK REF="STD-Park-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Park 2001</LINK> are incorrectly stated as "epidural 26/184 - systemic opioid 53/190".<BR/>Correct would be "epidural 5/184 - systemic opioid 4/190". Following the correction, subtotal and total risk ratio will change. It might also change one of the conclusions, i.e. epidural analgesia would reduce renal complications.<BR/>Alexander Koch</P>
