<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-11-17 11:05:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>
<B>What is pouchitis?</B>
</P>
<P>Some patients with ulcerative colitis have their colon and rectum removed with construction of a pouch (made from a loop of small intestine) to serve in place of the rectum. This is known as ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) surgery. Pouchitis is inflammation of the surgically constructed pouch. Symptoms of active pouchitis include diarrhea, increased stool frequency, abdominal cramping, fecal urgency, tenesmus (feeling of constantly needing to pass stools), and incontinence. Periods when symptoms stop are called 'remission'.</P>
<P>
<B>What therapies are used for pouchitis?</B>
</P>
<P>Therapies used for pouchitis include antibiotics (drugs that fight bacteria infections), budesonide enemas (a steroid drug), probiotics (good or helpful bacteria), glutamine suppositories (an amino acid), butyrate suppositories (short chain fatty acid), bismuth enemas (diarrhea medication), allopurinol (a purine analogue drug), and tinidazole (an anti-parasitic drug).</P>
<P>
<B>What did the researchers investigate?</B>
</P>
<P>The researchers investigated whether these medications produce remission in people with active pouchitis, maintain remission in people with inactive pouchitis or prevent pouchitis in people who've had IPAA surgery and whether these medications cause any side-effects. The researchers searched the medical literature up to October 31, 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>What did the researchers find?</B>
</P>
<P>We found 13 studies that included a total of 517 participants. Four studies assessed treatment of acute pouchitis. One study (16 participants) compared the antibiotics ciprofloxacin and metronidazole; another (26 participants) compared metronidazole to budesonide enemas; another (18 participants) compared the antibiotic rifaximin to placebo (sugar pill); and the fourth study (20 participants) compared the probiotic <I>Lactobacillus GG</I> to placebo. Four studies assessed treatment of chronic pouchitis. One study (19 participants) compared glutamine to butyrate suppositories; another (40 participants) compared bismuth enemas to placebo; and two studies (76 participants) compared the probiotic VSL#3 to placebo. Five studies assessed prevention of pouchitis. One study (40 participants) compared the probiotic VSL#3 to placebo; another (28 participants) compared VLS#3 to no treatment; one study (184 participants) compared allopurinol to placebo; another (12 participants) compared the probiotic <I>Bifidobacterium longum</I> to placebo; and one study (38 participants) compared tinidazole to placebo. Three studies were judged to be of high quality. Two studies were judged to be of low quality and the quality of the other studies was unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>Treatment of acute pouchitis:</B> Very low quality evidence suggests that ciprofloxacin may be more effective than metronidazole for the treatment of acute pouchitis. Side effects included vomiting, dysgeusia (metallic taste in mouth) or transient peripheral neuropathy (damage to nerves). There were no differences between metronidazole and budesonide enemas in terms of clinical remission, symptom improvement or side effects. Side effects included anorexia (an eating disorder), nausea, headache, asthenia (lack of energy and strength), metallic taste, vomiting, paraesthesia (pins and needles), and depression. There were no differences between rifaximin and placebo in terms of clinical remission, symptom improvement, or side effects. Side effects included diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, proctalgia (rectal pain), vomiting, thirst, candida (yeast infection), upper respiratory tract infection (cold or flu), increased hepatic enzyme (measure of liver function), and cluster headache. There was no difference between <I>Lactobacillus GG</I> and placebo in symptom improvement. The results of these studies are uncertain due to very low quality evidence.</P>
<P>
<B>Treatment of chronic pouchitis: </B>Low quality evidence suggests that VSL#3 may be more effective than placebo for maintaining remission in people with inactive disease. Side effects included abdominal cramps, vomiting and diarrhea. There was no difference in effectiveness between glutamine and butyrate suppositories for maintenance of remission. There was no difference in symptom improvement or side effects between bismuth carbomer foam enemas and placebo. Side effects included diarrhea, worsening symptoms, cramping, sinusitis (sinus infection), and abdominal pain. The results of these studies are uncertain due to very low quality evidence.</P>
<P>
<B>Prevention of pouchitis: </B>Low quality evidence suggests that VSL#3 may be more effective than placebo for prevention of pouchitis. However, one study found that VLS#3 was not more effective than no treatment for prevention of pouchitis. <I>Bifidobacterium longum,</I> allopurinol and tinidazole were not more effective than placebo for prevention of pouchitis. However, the results of these studies are uncertain due to very low quality evidence.</P>
<P>More research is needed to determine which of these different medications are best for treatment of pouchitis.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-11-16 13:22:06 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Two authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed study quality. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with clinical improvement or remission of pouchitis in patients with acute or chronic pouchitis, or the proportion of patients with no episodes of pouchitis after IPAA. The proportion of patients who developed at least one adverse event was a secondary outcome. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for each dichotomous outcome. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-11-17 09:21:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Thirteen studies (517 participants) were included in the review. Four studies assessed treatment of acute pouchitis. One study (16 participants) compared ciprofloxacin and metronidazole; another (26 participants) compared metronidazole to budesonide enemas; another (18 participants) compared rifaximin to placebo; and the fourth study (20 participants) compared <I>Lactobacillus GG</I> to placebo.

Three studies were judged to be of high quality. Two studies were judged to be low quality and the quality of the other studies was unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>Treatment of acute pouchitis:</B> The results of one small study (16 participants) suggest that ciprofloxacin may be more effective than metronidazole for the treatment of acute pouchitis. One hundred per cent (7/7) of ciprofloxacin patients achieved remission at two weeks compared to 33% (3/9) of metronidazole patients. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to high risk of bias (no blinding) and very sparse data (10 events). There was no difference in the proportion of patients who had at least one adverse event (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.98). Adverse events included vomiting, dysgeusia or transient peripheral neuropathy. There were no differences between metronidazole and budesonide enemas in terms of clinical remission, clinical improvement or adverse events. Adverse events included anorexia, nausea, headache, asthenia, metallic taste, vomiting, paraesthesia, and depression. There were no differences between rifaximin and placebo in terms of clinical remission, clinical improvement, or adverse events. Adverse events included diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, proctalgia, vomiting, thirst, candida, upper respiratory tract infection, increased hepatic enzyme, and cluster headache. There was no difference in clinical improvement between <I>Lactobacillus GG</I> and placebo. The results of these studies are uncertain due to very low quality evidence.</P>
<P>
<B>Treatment of chronic pouchitis: </B>A pooled analysis of two studies (76 participants) suggests that VSL#3 may be more effective than placebo for maintenance of remission. Eighty-five per cent (34/40) of VLS#3 patients maintained remission at 9 to 12 months compared to 3% (1/36) of placebo patients (RR 20.24, 95% CI 4.28 to 95.81). A GRADE analysis indicated that the quality of evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (35 events). Adverse events included abdominal cramps, vomiting and diarrhea. There was no difference in effectiveness between glutamine and butyrate suppositories for maintenance of remission. There was no difference in clinical improvement or adverse event rates between bismuth carbomer foam enemas and placebo. Adverse events included diarrhea, worsening symptoms, cramping, sinusitis, and abdominal pain. The results of these studies are uncertain due to very low quality evidence.</P>
<P>
<B>Prevention of pouchitis: </B>The results of one small study (40 participants) suggest that VSL#3 may be more effective than placebo for prevention of pouchitis. Ninety per cent (18/20) of VSL#3 patients had no episodes of acute pouchitis during the 12 month study compared to 60% (12/20) of placebo patients (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.21). A GRADE analysis indicated that the quality of evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (30 events). Another small study (28 participants) found that VLS#3 was not more effective than no treatment for prevention of pouchitis. <I>Bifidobacterium longum,</I> allopurinol and tinidazole were not more effective than placebo for prevention of pouchitis. The results of these studies are uncertain due to very low quality evidence.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-11-16 13:03:28 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>For acute pouchitis, very low quality evidence suggests that ciprofloxacin may be more effective than metronidazole. For chronic pouchitis, low quality evidence suggests that VSL#3 may be more effective than placebo for maintenance of remission. For the prevention of pouchitis, low quality evidence suggests that VSL#3 may be more effective than placebo. Well designed, adequately powered studies are needed to determine the optimal therapy for the treatment and prevention of pouchitis.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-11-18 08:43:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Pouchitis is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory disease that may occur in the ileal pouch after restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) (<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 1994a</LINK>). Although pouchitis can occur after construction of pouches for either chronic ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis, pouchitis occurs much less frequently in the latter, providing evidence that pouchitis is less related to the structure of the pouch, but is a function of the patients' underlying immune dysregulation interacting with the pouch. The diagnosis of pouchitis is suggested by variable clinical symptoms including increased stool frequency, abdominal cramping, fecal urgency and tenesmus, incontinence, and occasionally rectal bleeding and fever. A clinical diagnosis should ideally be confirmed by endoscopy and mucosal biopsy of the pouch. Endoscopic examination shows inflammatory changes that may include mucosal edema, granularity, contact bleeding, loss of vascular pattern, hemorrhage, and ulceration (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Febo-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Febo 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moskowitz-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moskowitz 1986</LINK>). Histologic examination shows acute inflammation, including neutrophil infiltration and mucosal ulceration superimposed on a background of chronic inflammation including villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration (<LINK REF="REF-Moskowitz-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moskowitz 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 1987</LINK>). Patients with pouchitis can be classified according to disease activity and symptom duration (<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pardi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pardi 2009</LINK>). Disease activity can be classified as: remission (no active pouchitis); mild-to-moderately active (increased stool frequency, urgency, infrequent incontinence); or severely active (hospitalization for dehydration, frequent incontinence). Symptom duration can be classified as: acute (&#8804; 4 weeks); or chronic (&gt; 4 weeks). The Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) is a 19 point index of pouchitis activity based on both clinical symptoms and endoscopic and histologic findings (<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 1994b</LINK>). Active pouchitis is defined as a PDAI &#8805; 7 and remission is defined as a PDAI &lt; 7. Clinical response to treatment can also be quantified by reduction in the PDAI (e.g. a reduction in the PDAI score &#8805; 3 from baseline).</P>
<P>At the time of the previous Cochrane review of this topic (<LINK REF="REF-Holubar-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holubar 2010</LINK>), there were 11 randomized trials on treatment and prevention of pouchitis. This updated Cochrane review examines the results from a total of 13 randomized controlled trials to determine which of the currently utilized empiric medical therapies for pouchitis can be substantiated with valid data from controlled trials.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-11-17 08:42:15 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The primary objective was to determine the efficacy and safety of various oral and topical (per rectum) medical therapies (including antibiotics, probiotics, and modulators of inflammation) for the treatment of acute pouchitis, chronic pouchitis, and the prevention of pouchitis in patients undergoing IPAA for ulcerative colitis.</P>

<P>Adult patients (age &#8805; 18 years) who had undergone IPAA for chronic ulcerative colitis and were at risk of, or had developed acute or chronic pouchitis were considered for inclusion. Pouchitis was variably defined by 1) solely clinical criteria; 2) clinical criteria in combination with endoscopic and histologic criteria; or 3) PDAI. Pouchitis was categorized by disease activity, as active (defined clinically as the presence of mild-to-severe symptoms or by a PDAI &#8805; 7) or in remission (absence of symptoms or by a PDAI &lt; 7), or by disease duration as acute (symptom duration &#8804; 4 weeks) or chronic (symptom duration &gt; 4 weeks).</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2015-11-17 08:42:26 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The primary outcome was (a) the proportion of patients with clinical improvement or remission of pouchitis in patients with acute or chronic pouchitis (treatment of pouchitis), or (b) the proportion of patients with no episodes of pouchitis after IPAA (prevention of pouchitis). The exact definition of improvement and remission varied from study to study limiting the ability to make comparisons across studies. However, the definition of improvement or remission used in each study was used for extraction of data from the individual studies for the purposes of this systematic review. The proportion of patients who developed at least one adverse event was a secondary outcome. </P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2015-11-06 11:58:36 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane IBD/FBD group specialized trials register from inception to October 31, 2014 to identify relevant publications. The search strategies are reported in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>. Review papers on pouchitis and references from identified papers were also searched in an effort to identify additional studies. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research published in abstract form only. </P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-11-17 11:24:46 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Study selection:<BR/>Potentially relevant articles were reviewed in an independent unblinded fashion by two authors (SS, AMS) to determine if they met the criteria specified above. The studies were then rated as being eligible, ineligible, or as having insufficient information to make a judgment as to eligibility.</P>
<P>Data collection:<BR/>Eligible articles were reviewed in duplicate (SS, AMS) and the results of the primary research trials were abstracted into specially designed data extraction forms. The proportion of patients who had clinical improvement in the active treatment and control groups of each study was derived from life tables, survival curves, or where possible, by calculating life tables from the data provided.</P>
<P>Risk of bias:<BR/>Two authors (SS, AMS) independently assessed methodological quality, using the Cochrane risk of bias tool as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Briefly, an assessment was made of the method of allocation generation (i.e. was the allocation sequence adequately generated?), allocation concealment (i.e. was allocation adequately concealed?), blinding (i.e. was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?), incomplete outcome data (i.e. were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?); and selective outcome reporting (i.e. are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?). A judgment of 'Yes' indicates low risk of bias, 'No' indicates high risk of bias, and 'Unclear' indicates unclear or unknown risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary and secondary outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>). Outcome data were rated as being of high, moderate, low or very low quality evidence. Data from randomized controlled trials begin as high quality but can be downgraded based on the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Risk of bias in the included trials;</LI>
<LI>Indirect evidence;</LI>
<LI>Inconsistency (including unexplained heterogeneity);</LI>
<LI>Imprecision (i.e. sparse data or wide confidence interval or both); and</LI>
<LI>Reporting bias.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The different quality ratings are interpreted as the likelihood that future research would affect the estimate of effect. An estimate of effect based on high quality evidence is unlikely to change with further research. If the overall evidence is of moderate quality further research may have an impact on our confidence in the estimate and may change the estimate. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate when the evidence is rated as low quality. Very low quality research means that we are very uncertain about the finding (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Statistical analysis:<BR/>Data extracted from the original research articles were converted into individual 2X2 tables (response versus no response, medical therapy versus placebo, or medical therapy versus medical therapy). All results were tabulated on an intention-to-treat basis if available; otherwise modified-intention-to-treat or per-protocol results are reported. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes. Data from individual studies were pooled when interventions, patient groups and outcomes were sufficiently similar (determined by consensus). A fixed-effect model was used for the pooling of data.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Joelsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Joelsson 2001</LINK> was a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study assessing the efficacy of allopurinol for the prevention of pouchitis. All patients were randomized one week after IPAA surgery. A total of 184 patients were enrolled for 24 months; 94 patients received allopurinol and 90 placebo. Of these patients, 116 (36%) completed the study. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who had no episodes of acute pouchitis at one year. Forty-six per cent (43/94) of allopurinol patients had no episodes of pouchitis compared to 43% (39/90) of placebo patients (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.11; See <LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK>). A GRADE analysis indicated that the quality of evidence supporting this outcome was low due to unclear risk of bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment) and sparse data (82 events, See <LINK REF="SOF-10" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 10</LINK>). Eight adverse events that were suspected to be drug-related were reported in the allopurinol group. These events included pruritus (n = 3), headache (n = 1), mild allergic reaction (n = 1), gynecomastia (n = 1), malaise (n = 1) and abnormal liver test (n = 1).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Ha-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ha 2010</LINK> reported a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which assessed the efficacy of 12-month treatment with tinidazole 500 mg daily started within 1 month of ileostomy closure after IPAA, compared with placebo, for the prevention of pouchitis (published only in abstract form). A total of 38 patients were randomized 2:1 to tinidazole or placebo. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who had no episodes of acute pouchitis at 12 months. Eighty-one per cent (21/26) of tinidazole patients had no episodes of pouchitis over the 12 month treatment period compared to 58% (7/12) of placebo-treated patients (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.31; See <LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK>). A GRADE analysis indicated that the quality of evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to unclear risk of bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and other potential sources of bias) and very sparse data (28 events, See <LINK REF="SOF-11" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 11</LINK>). There was no difference in the number of adverse events between the two groups (P = 0.64).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-11-18 14:16:09 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The results presented in this review must be interpreted with extreme caution given the small numbers of trials and patients evaluated for any one comparison. For each comparison, the confidence intervals about the risk ratio were wide. This indicates a moderate amount of uncertainty in the effect estimate. For example, for the comparison of oral ciprofloxacin versus metronidazole, we are 95% confident that the true estimate of effect falls between 1.13 and 6.35. The estimate of the therapeutic advantage of oral ciprofloxacin over metronidazole is uncertain.</P>
<P>Additionally for each comparison, with the exception of VSL#3 versus placebo for chronic pouchitis, only one trial was eligible. Therefore, the generalizability and external validity of these results must be questioned. GRADE analyses indicate that the overall quality of evidence derived from this systematic review ranges from low for the comparisons VLS#3 versus placebo (for both maintenance of remission and prevention of acute pouchitis) and allopurinol versus placebo (for prevention of acute pouchitis) to very low for all other comparisons. These ratings were due to high or unclear risk of bias in the included studies and very serious imprecision. The reader must exercise clinical judgment, and ensure the patient populations (those being generalized to, and those in the trials) are similar before these findings can be implemented into clinical practice.</P>
<P>Two cross-over studies which were excluded (because of lack of data prior to cross-over) merit further discussion. <LINK REF="STD-Madden-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Madden 1994</LINK> was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial of metronidazole for induction of clinical response in active chronic pouchitis. All patients had active pouchitis (defined as chronic, recurrent clinical symptoms, &gt; 6 stools/24 hours, and endoscopic inflammation) at entry. In total 13 patients were enrolled, and 11 patients completed both arms of the cross-over trial. The overall response, as measured by a reduction in stool frequency of at least 3 stools/24 hours, was 8/11 (73%) for metronidazole compared to 1/11 (9%) for placebo (P = 0.003). <LINK REF="STD-Welters-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Welters 2002</LINK> was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study assessing the efficacy of inulin for the prevention of pouchitis. Patients with IPAA for chronic ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis were included. Patients with a history of pouchitis were not excluded, none of the included patients had overt clinical pouchitis at the time of the study, and none were taking pouchitis-related medications. A total of 20 patients were enrolled to receive inulin followed by placebo, or placebo followed by insulin, for three weeks each. One patient who started in the placebo group dropped out due to lactose intolerance. Overall, there was no difference in pouchitis prevention, as measured by the final mean PDAI score, which was 1.42 for inulin and 1.66 for the placebo. However, the modified intention-to-treat
 
mean difference in PDAI for the prevention of pouchitis by inulin compared to placebo was 1.34 (P &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.83). Although this was statistically significant, this difference was not clinically significant.</P>
<P>Some patients with chronic pouchitis become refractory to standard medical treatment and may require a permanent ileostomy. Although few treatment options exist for these patients several retrospective cohort studies and case series suggest that TNF-alpha antagonists (infliximab and adalimumab) may provide benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Zippi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zippi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herfarth-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herfarth 2015</LINK>). Adequately powered randomized controlled trials are required to establish the efficacy and safety of TNF-alpha antagonists in these patients. </P>
<P>Based on the results of this systematic review the following conclusions may be drawn. Very low quality evidence suggests that ciprofloxacin may be more effective than metronidazole for the treatment of acute pouchitis. There was no difference in adverse events rates between the two antibiotics. These results are uncertain and need to be confirmed by further research. For treatment of acute pouchitis, there were no differences between metronidazole and budesonide enemas in terms of clinical remission, clinical improvement or adverse event rates. However, these results are uncertain due to very low quality evidence. There were no differences between rifaximin and placebo in terms of clinical remission, clinical improvement or adverse event rates. However, these results are uncertain due to very low quality evidence. There was no difference in clinical improvement rates between <I>Lactobacillus GG</I> and placebo. However, this result is uncertain due to very low quality evidence. For the treatment of chronic pouchitis, low quality evidence suggests that VSL#3 may be more effective than placebo for maintaining remission. There was no difference in efficacy between glutamine suppositories and butyrate suppositories for maintenance of remission. However, this result is uncertain due to very low quality evidence. There was no difference in clinical improvement or adverse event rates between bismuth carbomer foam enemas and placebo enemas. However, these results are uncertain due to very low quality evidence. For the prevention of pouchitis, low quality evidence suggests that VSL#3 may be more effective than placebo. However, very low quality evidence suggests that VLS#3 is not more effective than no treatment for prevention of pouchitis. Hence the efficacy of VSL#3 for prevention of pouchitis is questionable. More research is needed to determine the efficacy of VLS#3 in preventing pouchitis. Allopurinol and tinidazole were not more effective than placebo for prevention of pouchitis. However, these results are uncertain due to very low quality evidence.</P>

<P>For acute pouchitis, very low quality evidence suggests that ciprofloxacin may be more effective than metronidazole. For chronic pouchitis, low quality evidence suggests that VSL#3 may be more effective than placebo for maintenance of remission. For the prevention of pouchitis, low quality evidence suggests that VSL#3 may be more effective than placebo.</P>
<P>After IPAA, the primary function of the terminal ileum changes from absorption to storage, and bacterial overgrowth occurs with bacterial concentrations increasing to levels which are intermediate between an end ileostomy and the colon (<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 1989</LINK>). However, there is no correlation between fecal bacterial concentrations and histologic changes of acute inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 1989</LINK>), demonstrating that pouchitis is not directly related to the quantity of bacterial overgrowth. However, anaerobic bacterial overgrowth of the pouch is associated with transformation of the ileal mucosa to a 'colon-like' morphology (villous atrophy, chronic inflammatory cell infiltration) (<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Natori-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Natori 1992</LINK>). Thus, pouch bacterial overgrowth may indirectly set the stage for pouchitis to the extent that 'colon-like' ileal mucosa may be more susceptible to a recurrence of UC-like inflammation. Strategies directed towards reducing fecal concentrations of anaerobic bacteria through the use of antibiotics, or altering the relative balance of anaerobes and other bacteria using probiotic bacteria therapy, may be useful in treating pouchitis.</P>
<P>Using this rationale, clinicians have empirically treated patients with antibiotics and have observed that most patients with pouchitis experience clinical improvement. In the absence of adequately powered, well conducted randomized trials to guide therapy, antibiotics have become the de facto 'standard' medical therapy for pouchitis. In the past, the most commonly used antibiotic for pouchitis was metronidazole (<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moskowitz-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moskowitz 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zuccaro-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zuccaro 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lohmuller--1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lohmuller 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Svaninger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svaninger 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kelly-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boerr-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boerr 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boerr-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boerr 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kmiot-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kmiot 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hurst-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurst 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tytgat-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tytgat 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bonello-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonello 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knobler-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knobler 1986</LINK>). More recently, ciprofloxacin has become the more commonly used antibiotic (<LINK REF="REF-Pardi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pardi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pardi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pardi 2009</LINK>). Amoxicillin or clavulanic acid, erythromycin, and tetracycline have also been reported to be of benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1989</LINK>). Most patients with pouchitis initially respond to ciprofloxacin at a dose of 500 to 1000 mg/day or metronidazole at doses of 750 to 1500 mg/day. Symptomatic improvement usually occurs within 1 to 2 days. Patients with relapsing or continuous pouchitis may require chronic maintenance ciprofloxacin therapy with doses ranging from 250 mg every third day up to 1000 mg/day. Based on the <LINK REF="STD-Sambuelli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sambuelli 2002</LINK> study, budesonide enemas and metronidazole appear to have similar efficacy (58% and 50%). Although the authors of that study suggested that the enema preparation may be more tolerable than oral metronidazole, which is known to produce a metallic taste when it comes in contact with the tongue, many patients prefer oral administration to administration per anus. Nonetheless, the results of that study suggest that additional study of budesonide, whether administered orally or as a suppository, is warranted. There are two uncontrolled reports supporting this conclusion (<LINK REF="REF-Chopra-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chopra 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gionchetti-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gionchetti 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>To a limited extent, this empiric approach to the manipulation of pouch bacterial flora has been validated by controlled trials of metronidazole and the oral probiotic formulation VSL#3 in patients with chronic pouchitis. <LINK REF="STD-Madden-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Madden 1994</LINK> reported that the odds ratio for a decrease in stool frequency following metronidazole therapy compared with placebo in patients with active chronic pouchitis was 12.34 (95% CI 2.34 to 64.94). The single patient 'n-of-1' study of metronidazole for active chronic pouchitis also suggested benefit (<LINK REF="STD-McLeod-1986" TYPE="STUDY">McLeod 1986</LINK>). However, despite the significant decrease in stool frequency, there was no difference between metronidazole and placebo for changes of endoscopic inflammation, general well-being, stool blood, and histologic inflammation (<LINK REF="STD-Madden-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Madden 1994</LINK>). The pooled risk ratio for maintenance of remission in patients with chronic pouchitis during administration of the oral probiotic bacteria formulation VSL#3 was 20.24 (95% CI 4.28 to 95.81) (<LINK REF="STD-Gionchetti-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gionchetti 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mimura-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mimura 2004</LINK>). However, when examining the efficacy of VSL#3 for prevention of pouchitis, conflicting results were obtained, with VSL#3 being more efficacious than placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Gionchetti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gionchetti 2003</LINK>) but not more efficacious than no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Pronio-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pronio 2008</LINK>). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. Thus, while antibiotic and probiotic bacterial therapies appear to be efficacious, antibiotic selection, dose, and duration of therapy remain empiric. Ingestion of other <I>Lactobacillus</I>-based formulations such as <I>Lactobacillus GG</I> do not appear to be as effective as VSL#3 probiotic therapy. At the present time, based on the limited controlled clinical trial data available, it is reasonable to treat pouchitis with antibiotics and perhaps probiotic bacterial therapy (at least for chronic pouchitis), but additional controlled trials are needed to optimize therapy.</P>
<P>In the well-functioning ileal pouch, the bacterial flora produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including acetate, propionate, and butyrate at concentrations similar to those in the colon of healthy controls, and increased compared to stomal SCFA concentrations in ileostomy patients (<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nasmyth-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nasmyth 1989</LINK>). In the colon, SCFAs are the preferred fuel for colonic epithelial cell metabolism, whereas in the small bowel, glutamine is the preferred fuel for enterocyte metabolism. Some (<LINK REF="REF-Clausen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clausen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wischmeyer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wischmeyer 1993</LINK>), but not all studies (<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 1995</LINK>), have reported that patients with pouchitis have significantly lower fecal concentrations of SCFAs than patients with well-functioning IPAAs, perhaps as a result of dilution (<LINK REF="REF-Clausen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clausen 1992</LINK>). Strategies directed at replacing 'nutritional deficits' of SCFAs or glutamine in the ileal pouch by administering SCFA or glutamine enemas or suppositories may be useful in treating pouchitis. However, small uncontrolled studies of SCFA enemas have, for the most part, shown low overall clinical response rates, suggesting that SCFA enemas are not beneficial for pouchitis (<LINK REF="REF-De-Silva-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Silva 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tremaine-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tremaine 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-den-Hoed-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">den Hoed 1996</LINK>). This lack of efficacy of SCFA-based therapies is supported by the <LINK REF="STD-Welters-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Welters 2002</LINK> study, which examined the use of inulin, a sugar which is fermented to SCFA, which was not clinically effective for the prevention of pouchitis; although it did produce a statistically significant reduction in the mean PDAI scores. <LINK REF="STD-Wischmeyer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wischmeyer 1993</LINK> found no difference in the proportion of patients who maintained remission between glutamine suppositories and butyrate suppositories. It is not clear from this single controlled trial whether glutamine and butyrate suppositories are equally effective or equally ineffective, but considering the low overall response rates observed during open therapy with SCFA enemas, it appears that 'nutritional replacement' with SCFA, butyrate, or glutamine is probably not beneficial for pouchitis.<BR/>
<BR/>Bismuth has both anti-microbial and anti-diarrheal properties, and has been useful for the treatment of travellers' diarrhea and collagenous colitis. A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial suggested that bismuth citrate may have efficacy comparable to mesalamine for the treatment of left-sided ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Pullan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pullan 1993</LINK>). Given the proven benefit of bismuth in travellers' diarrhea, and its potential benefit in ulcerative colitis and collagenous colitis, therapeutic trials of bismuth in patients with acute pouchitis seemed reasonable. An uncontrolled study of bismuth complexed to carbomer suggested beneficial effects for both inducing and maintaining remission in patients with chronic pouchitis (<LINK REF="REF-Gionchetti-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gionchetti 1997</LINK>), while another uncontrolled study suggested that bismuth subsalicylate may also be of benefit in chronic pouchitis (<LINK REF="REF-Tremaine-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tremaine 1998</LINK>). In contrast, a placebo-controlled trial with the bismuth carbomer formulation in patients with active chronic pouchitis showed no benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Tremaine-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Tremaine 1997</LINK>). It is possible that the xanthan gum placebo in this study was actually a positive control (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 1997</LINK>), and another uncontrolled study suggested that bismuth subsalicylate may be of benefit in chronic pouchitis (<LINK REF="REF-Tremaine-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tremaine 1998</LINK>). Additional controlled trials using an inactive placebo are needed to determine with certainty whether or not bismuth is effective for pouchitis. Allopurinol did not appear to be clinically effective for the prevention of pouchitis (<LINK REF="STD-Joelsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Joelsson 2001</LINK>). An initial uncontrolled prospective trial indicated that allopurinol, a oxygen-related free radical scavenger, may be efficacious in decreasing inflammation hypothesized to be related to chronic ischemia and subsequent free radical damage (<LINK REF="REF-Levin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levin 1992</LINK>). However the results of the <LINK REF="STD-Joelsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Joelsson 2001</LINK> trial, the largest randomized trial of any treatment for any form of pouchitis (184 patients randomized) have refuted this hypothesis.</P>

<P>The medical therapy of pouchitis remains largely empiric, and well designed, adequately powered multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trials of antibiotics, probiotic bacteria, and other therapies known to be beneficial in ulcerative colitis such as mesalamine and corticosteroids are needed. Trials of VSL#3 compared to ciprofloxacin or metronidazole for the treatment and maintenance of remission of chronic pouchitis are warranted, and perhaps additional trials of rifaximin and inulin. In addition, trials of biologic therapies including TNF-alpha antagonists (e.g. infliximab or adalimumab), need to be performed in order to establish the true efficacy of these agents prior to widespread clinical application. In future trials, treatment indications such as active acute or chronic pouchitis and maintenance of remission for acute or chronic pouchitis should be clearly defined using the gold standard PDAI definitions.</P>
