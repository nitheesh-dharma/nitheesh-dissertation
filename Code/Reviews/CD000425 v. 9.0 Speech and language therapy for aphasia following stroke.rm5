<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-05-25 10:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence of the effect of speech and language therapy (SLT) on language problems experienced by people after a stroke (known as aphasia).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>About a third of people who suffer a stroke develop aphasia. One or more areas of communication can be affected: speaking, oral comprehension, reading, and writing. Speech and language therapists assess, diagnose, and treat aphasia at all stages of recovery after stroke. They work closely with the person with aphasia, families, and other healthcare professionals. We wanted to see whether SLT for aphasia was effective and whether it was better or worse than non-specialist social support. We also wanted to see which approaches to therapy offered the best recovery.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to September 2015. We found and included 57 studies involving 3002 people with aphasia in our review. We reviewed all SLT types, regimens, and methods of delivery.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Based on 27 studies (and 1620 people with aphasia), speech and language therapy benefits functional use of language, language comprehension (for example listening or reading), and language production (speaking or writing), when compared with no access to therapy, but it was unclear how long these benefits may last.<BR/>
</P>
<P>There was little information available to compare SLT with social support. Information from nine trials (447 people with aphasia) suggests there may be little difference in measures of language ability. However, more people stopped taking part in social support compared with those that attended SLT.</P>
<P>Thirty-eight studies compared two different types of SLT (involving 1242 people with aphasia). Studies compared SLT that differed in therapy regimen (intensity, dosage and duration), delivery models (group, one-to-one, volunteer, computer-facilitated), and approach. We need more information on these comparisons. Many hours of therapy over a short period of time (high intensity) appeared to help participants' language use in daily life and reduced the severity of their aphasia problems. However, more people stopped attending these highly intensive treatments (up to 15 hours a week) than those that had a less intensive therapy schedule.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Generally, the quality of the studies conducted and reported could be improved. Key quality features were only reported by half of the latest trials. Thus, it is unclear whether this was the result of poorly conducted studies or poorly reported studies. Most comparisons we made would benefit from the availability of more studies involving more people with aphasia.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-05-28 08:37:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 9 September 2015), CENTRAL (2015, Issue 5) and other Cochrane Library Databases (CDSR, DARE, HTA, to 22 September 2015), MEDLINE (1946 to September 2015), EMBASE (1980 to September 2015), CINAHL (1982 to September 2015), AMED (1985 to September 2015), LLBA (1973 to September 2015), and SpeechBITE (2008 to September 2015). We also searched major trials registers for ongoing trials including ClinicalTrials.gov (to 21 September 2015), the Stroke Trials Registry (to 21 September 2015), Current Controlled Trials (to 22 September 2015), and WHO ICTRP (to 22 September 2015). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials we also handsearched the <I>International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders</I> (1969 to 2005) and reference lists of relevant articles, and we contacted academic institutions and other researchers. There were no language restrictions.<BR/>

<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SLT (a formal intervention that aims to improve language and communication abilities, activity and participation) versus no SLT; social support or stimulation (an intervention that provides social support and communication stimulation but does not include targeted therapeutic interventions); or another SLT intervention (differing in duration, intensity, frequency, intervention methodology or theoretical approach).</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-05-25 10:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included 57 RCTs (74 randomised comparisons) involving 3002 participants in this review (some appearing in more than one comparison). Twenty-seven randomised comparisons (1620 participants) assessed SLT versus no SLT; SLT resulted in clinically and statistically significant benefits to patients' functional communication (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.49, P = 0.01), reading, writing, and expressive language, but (based on smaller numbers) benefits were not evident at follow-up. Nine randomised comparisons (447 participants) assessed SLT with social support and stimulation; meta-analyses found no evidence of a difference in functional communication, but more participants withdrew from social support interventions than SLT. Thirty-eight randomised comparisons (1242 participants) assessed two approaches to SLT. Functional communication was significantly better in people with aphasia that received therapy at a high intensity, high dose, or over a long duration compared to those that received therapy at a lower intensity, lower dose, or over a shorter period of time. The benefits of a high intensity or a high dose of SLT were confounded by a significantly higher dropout rate in these intervention groups. Generally, trials randomised small numbers of participants across a range of characteristics (age, time since stroke, and severity profiles), interventions, and outcomes.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-05-25 10:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Our review provides evidence of the effectiveness of SLT for people with aphasia following stroke in terms of improved functional communication, reading, writing, and expressive language compared with no therapy. There is some indication that therapy at high intensity, high dose or over a longer period may be beneficial. HIgh-intensity and high dose interventions may not be acceptable to all.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-05-25 10:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-05-25 10:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The term aphasia (less commonly referred to as dysphasia) is used to describe an acquired loss or impairment of the language system following brain damage (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 1996</LINK>). Usually associated specifically with language problems arising after a stroke, it excludes other communication difficulties attributed to sensory loss, confusion, dementia or speech difficulties due to muscular weakness or dysfunction, such as dysarthria. The most common cause of aphasia is a stroke (or cerebrovascular accident), mainly to the left hemisphere, where the language function of the brain is usually situated for right-handed people. About a third of all people who experience a stroke develop aphasia (<LINK REF="REF-Engelter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engelter 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laska-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laska 2001</LINK>). The aphasic population is heterogeneous, with individual profiles of language impairment varying in terms of severity and degree of involvement across the modalities of language processing, including the expression and comprehension of speech, reading, writing, and gesture (<LINK REF="REF-Code-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Code 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parr-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parr 1997</LINK>). Variation in the severity of expressive impairments, for example, may range from the individual experiencing occasional word-finding difficulties to having no effective means of verbal communication. The severity of aphasia can also change over time as one aspect of language difficulty may improve while others remain impaired. The impact and the consequential implications of having aphasia for the individuals themselves, their families, and society highlight the importance of the effective management and rehabilitation of language difficulties caused by aphasia.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-05-25 10:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The primary aim of speech and language therapy (SLT)* in aphasia management and rehabilitation is to maximise individuals' language and communication abilities, activity, and participation. Speech and language therapists are typically responsible for the assessment, diagnosis, and, where appropriate, rehabilitation of aphasia arising as a result of stroke. The ability to successfully communicate a message via spoken, written, or non-verbal modalities (or a combination of these) within day-to-day interactions is known as functional communication. Recent developments have seen speech and language therapists working closely with the person with aphasia, and in partnership with their families and caregivers, to maximise the individual's functional communication and participation.</P>
<P>* For the purposes of clarity within this review we have reserved SLT as an abbreviation for speech and language therapy alone.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-05-25 10:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There is no universally accepted treatment that can be applied to every person with aphasia, and typically therapists select from a variety of theoretical approaches, delivery models, and intervention regimens to manage and facilitate rehabilitation. We undertook this 2016 review update to incorporate new evidence and systematic review methodologies and to reflect recent developments in clinical practice. A summary of the differences between the 2016 version and the original 1999 review is presented in <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>.</P>

<P>In a change from the 1999 version of the review, all subsequent updates compressed the intervention into three broad groups. We included trials that reported a comparison between a group that received an SLT intervention designed to have an impact on communication and a group that received:</P>
<UL>
<LI>no SLT intervention;</LI>
<LI>social support and stimulation; or</LI>
<LI>an alternative SLT intervention.</LI>
</UL>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">SLT</HEADING>
<P>We considered SLT interventions to be any form of targeted practice tasks or methodologies with the aim of improving language or communication abilities, activities, or participation. These are typically delivered by speech and language therapists. In the UK, 'speech and language therapist' is a protected professional title and refers to individuals holding a professional qualification recognised by the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists and registered with the Health and Care Professions Council, UK. For the purposes of this review, we extended this definition to include therapists belonging to a body of similar professional standing elsewhere in the world.</P>
<P>We are aware that the SLT profession does not exist in many countries. In trials conducted in such settings, where other clinical staff (e.g. medical or nursing staff) led targeted interventions that aimed to improve participants' communicative functioning, we included these interventions within this review as SLT interventions. We planned a sensitivity analysis of the impact of professional SLT training on the provision of an intervention where data allowed.</P>
<P>We also recognise that current rehabilitation practice may include SLT interventions that aim to improve communicative functioning but are delivered by non-therapists (family members, SLT assistants, SLT students, voluntary support groups). Where those delivering the intervention received training from a speech and language therapist and delivered an intervention designed by a speech and language therapist, we described these as volunteer-facilitated SLT interventions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Social support and stimulation</HEADING>
<P>Social support and stimulation refers to an intervention that provides social support or stimulation but does not include targeted therapeutic interventions that aim to resolve participants' expressive or receptive speech and language impairments. Interventions in this category might include, for example, emotional, psychological, or creative interventions (such as art, dance, or music) as delivered by other healthcare professionals (e.g. art, physical, or music therapists). Other social stimulation interventions, such as conversation or other informal, unstructured communicative interactions, are also included in this category.</P>
<P>We did not include pharmacological interventions for aphasia as they are addressed within a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Greener-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greener 2001</LINK>). We also excluded magnetic or electrical stimulation interventions (e.g. transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial magnetic stimulation, or epidural cortical stimulation) or auditory temporal processing training procedures, as we considered these to be adjuncts to SLT rather than an SLT approach. The effectiveness of tDCS interventions for aphasia is addressed within a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Elsner-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elsner 2012</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2016-05-25 10:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The primary outcome chosen to indicate the effectiveness of an intervention that aims to improve communicative ability must reflect communication activity in real world settings, that is, functional communication. Providing a definition for the concept of functional communication is problematic and makes evaluation difficult. The ability to functionally communicate relates to language or communicational skills sufficient to permit the transmission of a message via spoken, written, or non-verbal modalities, or through a combination of these channels. Success is typically and naturalistically demonstrated through successful communication of the message - the speaker communicates their message, and the listener understands the message communicated. Attempts to measure this communication success formally vary from analysis of discourse interaction in real life or sampling of discourse during specific tasks (known as discourse analysis). Other more formal tools might include the Communicative Abilities of Daily Living (CADL) or the Communicative Effectiveness Index (CETI) (<LINK REF="REF-Holland-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holland 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lomas-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lomas 1989</LINK>).</P>

<P>Given the lack of a comprehensive, reliable, valid, and globally accepted functional communication evaluation tool, surrogate outcome measures of communication impairment (or ability) include formal measures of receptive language (oral, written and gestural), expressive language (oral, written and gestural) or overall level of severity of aphasia where receptive and expressive language are measured using language batteries. Such tools might include, for example, the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) or the Porch Index of Communicative Abilities (PICA) (<LINK REF="REF-Kertesz-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kertesz 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Porch-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porch 1967</LINK>). Other secondary outcomes of relevance to this review include psychosocial impact (i.e. impact on psychological or social well-being including mood, depression, anxiety, and distress), satisfaction with intervention, number of dropouts (i.e. the number of participants dropping out at treatment or follow-up phases for any reason), adherence to allocated intervention (i.e. the number of participants voluntarily withdrawing from their allocated intervention), economic outcomes (such as costs to the patient, caregivers, families, health service, and society) and caregiver and family quality of life. We extracted measures of overall functional status (e.g. Barthel) in the original review as one of a number of primary outcomes. We also extracted these data, where available, as an indicator of overall severity of stroke, but this information is now presented as a patient descriptor within the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.

<P>We created and piloted an electronic data extraction tool for use in this 2016 review update. Two review authors (MB and PC) independently confirmed the data for the trials included and extracted the data for the additional trials included in this update. We resolved any disagreements through discussion. We extracted many data elements, including: number and location of sites, methods of randomisation, blinding, attrition from intervention, co-interventions, confounder details, number of participants, age, education, handedness, sex, native language, severity of aphasia, time post onset, inclusion and exclusion criteria, details of intervention in accordance with the template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR) checklist (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffmann-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffmann 2014</LINK>), outcome measures and time points used, evidence of an a priori sample size calculation, intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, and summary data. We attempted to contact investigators for any missing data (or data in a suitable format) for inclusion in the review.</P>
<P>Where we identified a cross-over trial, we based decisions relating to the suitability of the data (either up to or beyond the cross-over phase) on careful consideration of a range of factors including the intervention(s) used, the timing of the intervention(s), the impact of any treatment carryover, and whether data from relevant paired comparisons within the trial were available.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-05-25 10:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We assessed the trials for methodological quality, paying attention to whether there was protection from the following types of bias: selection bias (i.e. true random sequencing and true concealment up to the time of allocation), performance bias (i.e. differences in co-interventions between the groups), attrition bias (i.e. withdrawal after trial entry), and detection bias (i.e. 'unmasked' assessment of outcome). We coded concealed allocation as 'low risk', 'unclear' or 'high risk' according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). In addition, we extracted information on whether trialists employed power calculations and ITT analyses. In some cases, for example where all participants were accounted for in the final results, this was not applicable.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-05-25 10:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We conducted the review using Review Manager 5 (RevMan) for statistical analysis (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We recorded descriptive information for each trial (characteristics of participants, interventions, and outcomes) in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table and issues relating to the methodological quality of the trial in the 'Risk of bias' tables. Where trials made a similar comparison and appeared to be sufficiently similar with respect to their descriptive information, we pooled the summary data (where available) using meta-analysis. We expressed continuous data as differences in means or standardised difference in means and dichotomised data as odds ratios (OR). We used 95% confidence intervals (CI) throughout the review.</P>
<P>The results of the trials in this review reported measures based on differences in final value scores (scores taken at the end of the intervention) and change-from-baseline scores (also known as change scores). Although the mean differences (MD) based on change-from-baseline scores in randomised trials can generally be assumed to address the same intervention effects as MD analysis based on final value scores, change-from-baseline scores are given higher weights in analysis than final value scores (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). For this reason, we have used final value scores within the meta-analyses wherever possible. We do not report change-from-baseline scores unless they were the only available values (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-05-25 10:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We assessed heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, where any heterogeneity observed may be considered moderate (an I<SUP>2</SUP> value of 30% to 60%), substantial (50% to 90%) or considerable (75% to 100%) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Where we observed important heterogeneity (based of the I<SUP>2</SUP> value together with significant evidence of heterogeneity as per the Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>test P value), we used a random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).  </P>
</HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-05-25 10:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Where a single outcome measure was assessed and reported across trials using different measurement tools, we presented these data in a meta-analysis using a standardised mean difference (SMD) summary statistic. In cases where the direction of measurement differed, it was necessary to adjust the direction of some measures to ensure that all the scales operated in the same direction. For example, measures of comprehension ability generally increase with increasing ability, but in some cases (e.g. the Token Test) improving comprehension skills might be reflected by decreasing scores, so it was necessary to multiply the mean values by &#8722;1 to ensure that all the scales operated in the same direction. This method did not affect standard deviation (SD) values, and we have presented these within the meta-analyses without the need for a directional change.</P>
<P>In cases where trials only reported partial summary data, for example mean final value scores but not SDs (for example <LINK REF="STD-Wertz-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Wertz 1981</LINK>), we attempted to calculate these values from available information. When this was not possible, we imputed the SD to facilitate inclusion of the trial within the review by using a SD value from a similar participant group (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We have reported details of the source of any imputed SD values within the text. Where there was a choice of possible SD values, we imputed the highest and lowest values to ensure that both methods provided a similar overall conclusion and then used the highest value in the presentation of the trial within the forest plot.</P>
<P>Where results in a particular comparison were only available in a mixture of final value and change-from-baseline scores, we presented these data graphically using SMDs, but we were unable to pool these results in a meta-analysis.</P>

In the 'duplicate' trials, there was a risk of including the same group of participants (usually the control group) twice in a single meta-analysis, so we split the number of participants in the control group across the two 'trials' that shared that comparison group (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). In the case of continuous data, the mean and SD values remained the same.

In keeping with previous reviews where this method has been used and for ease of reading, these paired randomised comparisons will be referred to as trials from this point onwards.</P>
<P>Thirteen trials employed a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-B.A.Bar-2011i" TYPE="STUDY">B.A.Bar 2011i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-B.A.Bar-2011ii" TYPE="STUDY">B.A.Bar 2011ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crerar-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Crerar 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Elman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-1982i" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 1982i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-1982ii" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 1982ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-1982iii" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 1982iii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-1984b" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 1984b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varley-2016i" TYPE="STUDY">Varley 2016i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varley-2016ii" TYPE="STUDY">Varley 2016ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wertz-1986i" TYPE="STUDY">Wertz 1986i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wertz-1986ii" TYPE="STUDY">Wertz 1986ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wertz-1986iii" TYPE="STUDY">Wertz 1986iii</LINK>). We carefully considered the suitability of each cross-over trial for inclusion within the review. We considered factors including the suitability of the design, the intervention(s) used, the timing of the intervention(s), the impact of any treatment carry-over and finally whether data from relevant paired comparisons from the cross-over data were available. For eight trials we extracted data up to the point of cross-over (<LINK REF="STD-B.A.Bar-2011i" TYPE="STUDY">B.A.Bar 2011i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crerar-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Crerar 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Elman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-1982iii" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 1982iii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-1984b" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 1984b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varley-2016i" TYPE="STUDY">Varley 2016i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wertz-1986i" TYPE="STUDY">Wertz 1986i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wertz-1986ii" TYPE="STUDY">Wertz 1986ii</LINK>). In some cases though, the treatment that participants were allocated to receive following cross-over was 'no SLT' or similar. In these cases, the 'no SLT' input after cross-over could be used as a follow-up period or deferred delivery of therapy (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-B.A.Bar-2011ii" TYPE="STUDY">B.A.Bar 2011ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varley-2016ii" TYPE="STUDY">Varley 2016ii</LINK>).</P>
<P>In contrast, <LINK REF="REF-Lincoln-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lincoln 1982</LINK> was also a cross-over trial in design, with participants randomly allocated to one of four groups with a sequence of interventions that included one active treatment or placebo, either preceded by or followed by conventional SLT. We were able to access the unpublished individual patient trial data for this review. This access to the data, the design, nature and manner of SLT delivery within the trial and the clinical relevance of the comparisons made it possible to include two paired comparisons of those groups within the review.</P>

<P>Taking the individual data at the point of measurement prior to the cross-over, it was also possible to extract and compare the data from those that had received conventional SLT and compare it to those participants that received a social support and stimulation intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-1982iii" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 1982iii</LINK>).</P>
<P>We present data from 73 randomised comparisons as they relate to the effectiveness of SLT for aphasia following stroke, which compare: SLT versus no SLT, SLT versus social support and stimulation, and SLT A versus SLT B. We have presented details of data within each comparison below with further details on each trial available in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. Details of participants (age, sex, time since stroke, and aphasia severity by trial (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>)), SLT interventions (<LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>), and assessment tools (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>) by randomised group are also available.

<P>Most participants randomised to the 'no SLT' groups received no alternative treatment or support (<LINK REF="STD-Doesborgh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Doesborgh 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katz-1997i" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 1997i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laska-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Laska 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-1984a" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 1984a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lyon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lyon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacKay-1988" TYPE="STUDY">MacKay 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wertz-1986i" TYPE="STUDY">Wertz 1986i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wertz-1986ii" TYPE="STUDY">Wertz 1986ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yao-2005i" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2005i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yao-2005ii" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2005ii</LINK>). Only seven trials described an intervention within these 'no SLT' groups. In <LINK REF="STD-CACTUS-2013" TYPE="STUDY">CACTUS 2013</LINK>, we considered the control interventions to be similar to standard poststroke care in the local region at that time; in <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1981i" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1981i</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1981ii" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1981ii</LINK>, a health visitor went to participants' homes; in <LINK REF="STD-Smania-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Smania 2006</LINK>, participants received limb apraxia therapy; and in <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2007i" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2007i</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2007ii" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2007ii</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2000</LINK>, they received medication. The control groups in <LINK REF="STD-Katz-1997ii" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 1997ii</LINK> received computer-based cognitive tasks ('arcade-style games') and in <LINK REF="STD-B.A.Bar-2011i" TYPE="STUDY">B.A.Bar 2011i</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Varley-2016i" TYPE="STUDY">Varley 2016i</LINK>, they received visual-cognitive computer games, all interventions designed not to target language rehabilitation.</P>
<P>The timing of SLT interventions after the onset of aphasia varied widely and is difficult to summarise because of a lack of detailed reporting.

<P>There was a wide range of variation in the descriptions of the SLT interventions. Most reported the use of a conventional SLT approach or described an intervention, which reflects clinical practice where the therapist was responsible for design and content of the treatment delivered. Other trials evaluated more prescriptive SLT interventions (including volunteer-facilitated therapy, intensive therapy, constraint-induced asphasia therapy for example); we will describe these in later sections. We systematically extracted intervention details according to the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffmann-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffmann 2014</LINK>), communicating directly with the trialists to supplement published information where possible.

<P>Due to the nature of SLT, it is difficult to blind either the patient or the person carrying out the intervention. However, blinding of the outcome assessor is possible and should be in place to avert detection bias. More than half of the included trials (43/74) reported blinding of outcome assessors (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). In other cases, blinding was partially in place.

In addition, 46 participants were lost during the follow-up assessment phase (21 withdrawing from the SLT groups and 25 from the 'no SLT' groups). The trials that compared SLT with social support and stimulation randomised a total of 447 participants, but 105 participants (23%) were lost during the treatment phase (40 from the SLT group and 65 from the social support groups).

<P>Similarly, 11 trials that compared two different approaches with SLT provision reported that not all participants received the planned number of treatment sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-1982i" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 1982i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-1982ii" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 1982ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meikle-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Meikle 1979;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-MIT-2014i" TYPE="STUDY">MIT 2014i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MIT-2014ii" TYPE="STUDY">MIT 2014ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RATS_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">RATS-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1981iii" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1981iii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SP_x002d_I_x002d_RiT" TYPE="STUDY">SP-I-RiT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VERSE-I" TYPE="STUDY">VERSE I</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VERSE-II" TYPE="STUDY">VERSE II</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Meikle-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Meikle 1979</LINK> reported that 5 of the 16 participants receiving conventional SLT missed up to half of their possible treatment. Six trials comparing a high-intensity SLT with a low-intensity SLT also reported difficulties providing intensive SLT interventions as planned. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Bakheit-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bakheit 2007</LINK> reported that only 13 of the 51 participants received 80% or more of the planned intensive intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1981iii" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1981iii</LINK> reported that participants allocated to intensive therapy only received an average of 21 hours of therapy compared to the planned minimum of 50 hours during the first three months. Such difficulties in maintaining a clear distinction between the two treatment groups has significant implications when evaluating the results and considering the clinical implications of such treatment regimens. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-VERSE-I" TYPE="STUDY">VERSE I</LINK> found that six individuals did not reach the intensive SLT intervention target of 2.5 hours, but they also reported that resource limitations in the conventional acute care service meant that 23 individuals in the usual care group failed to receive the maximum once weekly therapy as allocated. <LINK REF="STD-ORLA-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ORLA 2010</LINK> reported difficulty maintaining a consistent intensity of treatment across two treatment arms, with some participants choosing to have more of the allocated 24 treatment sessions per week than others.</P>
<P>Though all the speech and language therapists in <LINK REF="STD-Hinckley-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hinckley 2001</LINK> received training in the characteristics of the two treatment approaches being compared, treatment review processes were in place to minimise any possible risk of overlap in therapy approach. <LINK REF="STD-ACTNoW-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ACTNoW 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Woolf-2015i" TYPE="STUDY">Woolf 2015i</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Woolf-2015ii" TYPE="STUDY">Woolf 2015ii</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Woolf-2015iii" TYPE="STUDY">Woolf 2015iii</LINK> employed a similar monitoring approach to ensure fidelity to the planned interventions.

Descriptions of participant groups within trials were variable, so it is difficult to give a precise overview of the participants included in this comparison. Most trials described the participants' age range, which spanned from 18 to 97 years (<LINK REF="STD-ACTNoW-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ACTNoW 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Elman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-1982iii" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 1982iii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rochon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rochon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shewan-1984ii" TYPE="STUDY">Shewan 1984ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shewan-1984iii" TYPE="STUDY">Shewan 1984iii</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-David-1982" TYPE="STUDY">David 1982</LINK> reported that participants in the SLT and social support and stimulation groups had a mean age of 70 (SD 8.7) years and 65 (SD 10.6) years, respectively, indicating a significant difference between the groups (P = 0.003). Details can be found in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. All nine trials detailed the length of time since aphasia onset. <LINK REF="STD-ACTNoW-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ACTNoW 2011</LINK> randomised participants with the most acute aphasia (interquartile range (IQR) 9 to 16 days duration). Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Shewan-1984ii" TYPE="STUDY">Shewan 1984ii</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Shewan-1984iii" TYPE="STUDY">Shewan 1984iii</LINK> recruited people at two to four weeks post onset of aphasia.

All nine trials reported on severity of aphasia to varying degrees of detail. <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-1982iii" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 1982iii</LINK> recruited participants with moderate degrees of aphasia. Six trials described the recruitment of participants with a range of mild to severe aphasia (<LINK REF="STD-ACTNoW-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ACTNoW 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-David-1982" TYPE="STUDY">David 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Elman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rochon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rochon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shewan-1984ii" TYPE="STUDY">Shewan 1984ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shewan-1984iii" TYPE="STUDY">Shewan 1984iii</LINK>), and two trials reported scores on a naming measure (<LINK REF="STD-Woolf-2015ii" TYPE="STUDY">Woolf 2015ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woolf-2015iii" TYPE="STUDY">Woolf 2015iii</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were a number of approaches to the provision of SLT interventions in the trials: five provided conventional SLT (<LINK REF="STD-ACTNoW-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ACTNoW 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-David-1982" TYPE="STUDY">David 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-1982iii" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 1982iii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shewan-1984iii" TYPE="STUDY">Shewan 1984iii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woolf-2015iii" TYPE="STUDY">Woolf 2015iii</LINK>), and the others provided group SLT (<LINK REF="STD-Elman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Elman 1999</LINK>), sentence-mapping SLT (<LINK REF="STD-Rochon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rochon 2005</LINK>), language-orientated SLT (<LINK REF="STD-Shewan-1984ii" TYPE="STUDY">Shewan 1984ii</LINK>), or telerehabilitation SLT (<LINK REF="STD-Woolf-2015ii" TYPE="STUDY">Woolf 2015ii</LINK>). These SLT interventions were then compared with the provision of social support and stimulation, which also took a variety of formats. Unstructured support and communicative stimulation were provided by nurses (<LINK REF="STD-Shewan-1984ii" TYPE="STUDY">Shewan 1984ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shewan-1984iii" TYPE="STUDY">Shewan 1984iii</LINK>), a trained research assistant (<LINK REF="STD-Rochon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rochon 2005</LINK>), a clinical psychologist (<LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-1982iii" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 1982iii</LINK>), speech and language therapy students (<LINK REF="STD-Woolf-2015ii" TYPE="STUDY">Woolf 2015ii</LINK> ; <LINK REF="STD-Woolf-2015iii" TYPE="STUDY">Woolf 2015iii</LINK>), paid visitors (<LINK REF="STD-ACTNoW-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ACTNoW 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-David-1982" TYPE="STUDY">David 1982</LINK>), or through attendance at an externally organised support group or class, for example dance classes or church groups (<LINK REF="STD-Elman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Elman 1999</LINK>). Most were face-to-face social support. Two used an Internet-supported videoconferencing tool. Some volunteers had been given detailed information about their own participant's particular presentation of aphasia (<LINK REF="STD-David-1982" TYPE="STUDY">David 1982</LINK>), but they were not given any training in SLT techniques (<LINK REF="STD-ACTNoW-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ACTNoW 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-David-1982" TYPE="STUDY">David 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-1982iii" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 1982iii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shewan-1984ii" TYPE="STUDY">Shewan 1984ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shewan-1984iii" TYPE="STUDY">Shewan 1984iii</LINK>).

It is unclear which intervention arms these participants were randomised to, so we could not include these dropouts in meta-analysis. The remaining trials lost a total of 40 participants from the groups allocated to SLT while 65 were lost to the social support and stimulation interventions.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Functional communication</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-David-1982" TYPE="STUDY">David 1982</LINK> used the FCP to compare a group who received conventional SLT with a group that received communication treatment by volunteers. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups at three and six months' follow-up.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-05-29 22:26:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We updated this complex review of the effectiveness of SLT interventions for people with aphasia following stroke to reflect new evidence and developments in clinical practice. We assessed whether SLT is more effective than no SLT, whether SLT is more effective than social support and stimulation, and whether one SLT intervention is more effective than another. We identified, synthesised and presented data from 57 trials (and 3002 participants) in this review.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-05-29 22:26:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review includes information on a total of 3002 participants randomised across 74 comparisons. We synthesise the data into three broad comparisons, and we consider these findings below as they relate to SLT versus no SLT, SLT versus social support, and one type of SLT versus a different SLT approach.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">SLT versus no SLT</HEADING>
<P>Based on 27 trials involving 1620 participants, we found significant differences between the scores of participants who received SLT and those that did not. Specifically, these differences were evidenced in measures of functional communication, receptive language (including reading), and expressive language (including writing), all of which favoured the provision of SLT (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). However, significant differences were not evident across all measures. Sample sizes remain small, and there is some indication of one or two trials' highly significant findings impacting upon the meta-analyses. We have profiled the available evidence relating to therapy follow-up data from these trials which is (as yet) limited in the number of trials and contributing participants (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>We observed notable statistical heterogeneity among some of the SLT versus no SLT comparisons (e.g. expressive language: general, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 76% and the severity of impairment comparison, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 93%). In addition, we also noted measures based on either the Aphasia Battery of Chinese or the Chinese Aphasia Measurement tools fell outside of the 95% CIs of the associated funnel plots. While we might expect that a proportion (5%) of the results would be observed in this manner by chance, the frequency of the observation is above what we might expect to occur by chance alone. There are a number of possible explanations for these observations. The <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> suggests consideration of several possible sources of heterogeneity and asymmetry in funnel plots. Selection bias, poor methodological quality, true heterogeneity, artefact, or chance may have contributed (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2007i" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2007i</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2007ii" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2007ii</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2000</LINK> took place in China, where doctors and nurses deliver SLT interventions rather than professional therapists, as may be the case for the other trials in this meta-analysis. Other aspects of stroke care may also have differed. We also have limited information on the study populations included within these trials, particularly from the <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2000</LINK> trial, which does not report time post onset, patient demographics or aphasia severity. Information on the methodological design is also very limited, particularly in relation to the randomisation, concealment of allocation, and blinding of outcome assessors.</P>
<P>Abstracts of these Chinese trials were published in English, thus the contribution of professional translators unfamiliar with some of the technical specifications or methodological terms used in health services research may have had an impact. Within these articles, authors report that the participants within the trials were randomised to the different interventions. Thus, they were eligible for inclusion within this review. Our attempts to access trial details similarly required translation of the trial reports, which may also have introduced some discrepancies between the original meaning of the trialists and our translations. The exact nature of the randomisation processes is unclear, and if we look at the sample sizes of the groups (within <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2000</LINK> for example), there is considerable imbalance between the numbers that received SLT (98 participants) and those that did not (40 participants) raising further questions regarding the randomisation processes employed within some studies. Information about some of the tools (and subtests of these tools) used within these trials (such as the Aphasia Battery of Chinese or the Chinese Aphasia Measurement) were unavailable to us. Our pooling of data relating to 'verbal presentation' may not exactly capture the same aspects of verbal expression as other tools within our meta-analysis. Similarly, issues relating to the tools' validity and reliability were unavailable. Despite our best efforts, we failed to communicate with the <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2007i" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2007i</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2007ii" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2007ii</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2000</LINK> trialists to confirm or obtain clarification on any of these issues. In the meantime, the reader should be mindful of the inconsistencies observed within our meta-analyses when interpreting the findings from this section of the review. We look forward to the availability of the currently ongoing trials in the future, which will further inform this comparison.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">SLT versus social support</HEADING>
<P>A total of 447 people were randomised across nine trials to receive either SLT or a social support and stimulation intervention. While we observed some significant differences in the performance of the groups on various measures of language performance (favouring those that received social support), most findings were derived from one small trial of 18 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-1982iii" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 1982iii</LINK>). The more recent, large, rigorously conducted <LINK REF="STD-ACTNoW-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ACTNoW 2011</LINK> trial found no evidence of a significant difference between the functional language skills of the two groups. Additional data are required to confirm whether social support and stimulation provides benefits to some aspects of participants' language skills and on measures of severity of aphasia impairment. In contrast, other significant differences observed (informed by five trials in this comparison) showed that significantly more participants allocated to social support and stimulation interventions dropped out or did not adhere to the intervention when compared with the participants allocated to SLT. While social support and stimulation may be beneficial to some aspects of participants' language performance, we need additional evidence to support this. Where social support and stimulation interventions are being delivered, practitioners should provide clear explanation of the nature and purpose of the support to individuals to reduce any dissatisfaction that might be experienced and which may have resulted in the significantly higher dropout rates observed.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">SLT A versus SLT B</HEADING>
<P>Thirty-eight trials, involving 1242 participants, compared two different types of SLT. This section of the review has grown considerably since our 2012 review, and thus we were able to compare different therapy regimens (differing in intensity, dosage and duration), different therapy delivery models (group, one-to-one, volunteer, computer facilitated) and different theoretical approaches (e.g. constraint-induced therapy, semantic therapy). In general, comparisons continue to be based on a small number of trials involving few participants (typically less than 20). Additional data are still required to further inform these comparisons. The effectiveness of popular SLT approaches such as functional SLT or constraint-induced aphasia therapy were informed by a small number of trials and did not demonstrate evidence of the effectiveness of these approaches over conventional SLT approaches. Some of the data from these trials were unavailable to this review, so we could not include them in the meta-analyses. While we hope that these data may become available in the future, we are also looking forward to the availability of data from ongoing trials, which will further inform these comparisons.  </P>
<P>There was little evidence of any difference between group SLT and one-to-one SLT, computer-facilitated, or volunteer-facilitated SLT versus professional SLT, although these comparisons were based on limited numbers of trials involving small numbers of participants. The available evidence, however, indicates there is no evidence of a difference in the provision of SLT interventions facilitated by volunteers or computers (under the direction of professional therapists and with appropriate access to relevant therapy materials and therapeutic intervention plans) compared with direct therapy provision by a professional therapist.</P>
<P>We identified eight trials that compared high-intensity to low-intensity SLT. There was some indication of benefits to participants' functional language skills based on the synthesis of data from two trials. Based on pooled data from five different trials, we also observed improvements in severity of aphasia following high-intensity SLT. However, the number of participants dropping out from the high-intensity SLT groups was significantly higher than in the low-intensity SLT groups, confounding the results and suggesting that high-intensity approaches to therapy (4 to 15 hours per week) may not be suited to all patients. Following Cochrane editorial review, we considered the timing of participant recruitment to the contributing trials as a possible factor to the tolerance of high-intensity interventions. The trials contributing to this analyses recruited with two weeks (two RCTs), one to three months (four RCTs), and between two to eight years (two RCTs) after onset of aphasia. Effects were no longer observed in a post hoc comparison of trials recruiting participants several years after stroke (nor did those trials report any dropouts). The beneficial effect remained for trials that recruited within three months of aphasia onset, although the significantly higher dropouts from the high-intensity groups came only from those trials. Similarly, we observed some indication of a benefit of a high dose of therapy (between 60 and 208 hours of therapy) compared with a lower dose of SLT (ranging from 5 to 78 hours), but significant differences were based on findings from a single trial with small numbers of participants. However, where trial data overlapped, as in the number of trial dropouts reported by three trials, the participants who received the lower dose of therapy were less likely to drop out than those that received the higher dose.</P>
<P>It is possible that the timing of an intervention after stroke may be an important factor in both the effectiveness of and tolerance to specific intervention approaches. There are possible interactions between specific individual, aphasia and stroke profiles and the characteristics of complex SLT interventions that vary by intervention regimen, delivery model, and theoretical approach. Exploration of these issues is not suited to Cochrane review methodologies. Instead a large, international, multidisciplinary collaboration of aphasia researchers is aiming to examine such aspects through the <A HREF="http://www.aphasiatrials.org/index.php/prognosis-and-predictors-research/2-uncategorised/137-rehabilitation-and-recovery-of-people-with-aphasia-after-stroke-release">RELEASE project</A>.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-05-25 11:03:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We identified a substantial number of trials of relevance to our review; most were eligible for inclusion. Across the included trials there was a lack of comprehensive data collection, a wide range of outcome tools employed, and disappointingly inadequate reporting of outcome measures. Many of the trialists generously shared unpublished data and supplementary information to enable accurate representation of their trial in this review. We are very grateful for their time and efforts to provide this information.</P>
<P>Within the review, just over half of the trials described measuring receptive (N = 45) and expressive language skills (N = 56), but not all reported suitable data in a published format that permitted inclusion within this review. We were able to include most trials that described measures of receptive language (67%; N = 30/45) and most expressive language measures (66%; N = 37/56). Forty-seven trials evaluated the severity of participants' aphasia impairment, and we included suitable data from 29 trials. Similarly, while five trials reported measuring economic outcomes, only data from two were available. Many trials measured participants' functional and psychosocial outcomes, measures that are probably most closely aligned to the patients' sense of recovery and return to 'normal'. From the total of 74 randomised comparisons, more than half (N = 44) described measuring changes in functional communication and of these, most (N = 33/44) reported data that could be included within the meta-analyses. Few trials measured psychosocial outcomes (N = 8) with five reporting (or providing) data suitable for inclusion within the review.</P>
<P>The degree to which the models of conventional SLT employed within the trials are reflective of therapists' current practice should be carefully considered across individual treatments in terms of the frequency, duration, and the extent of therapeutic intervention. To this end, we employed the TIDieR Checklist to support full data extraction of the SLT interventions within the trials (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffmann-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffmann 2014</LINK>). In this way, the reader has access to a more comprehensive overview of the interventions being compared in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. Participants came from across a wide age range and were experiencing a range of aphasia impairments. However, the length of time since participants' stroke raises questions of how clinically relevant some recruitment parameters were to an SLT clinical population.</P>
<P>Less than a fifth (N = 13; 18%) of the included trials recruited participants within the first month following their stroke (a participant group of high clinical relevance) and only four of these recruited participants within the first week after their stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Laska-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Laska 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattioli-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mattioli 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VERSE-I" TYPE="STUDY">VERSE I</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VERSE-II" TYPE="STUDY">VERSE II</LINK>). Most recruited participants more than one month, and in some cases many years following their stroke (N = 49), or they did not report the time post onset (N = 12; <LINK REF="STD-FUATAC" TYPE="STUDY">FUATAC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SEMaFORE" TYPE="STUDY">SEMaFORE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1981i" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1981i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1981ii" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1981ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1981iii" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1981iii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szaflarski-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Szaflarski 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Xie 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yao-2005i" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2005i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yao-2005ii" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2005ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yao-2005iii" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2005iii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2000</LINK>). Recruitment procedures involving participants up to 29 years after the onset of their aphasia are of limited application to either a clinical or treatment evaluation setting and raise the question of whether such inclusion criteria are apt to demonstrate effectiveness of an SLT intervention.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-05-25 10:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Our 2016 update adds a significant amount of data and so, together with continually improving systematic review and reporting methodologies, we are in a better position to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of SLT for aphasia following stroke. This review included a total of 74 randomised comparisons involving data from 3002 individual patients.</P>
<P>Methods of random sequence generation and concealment of allocation were considered adequate in 35 and 25 trials, respectively (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). The randomisation methodology for the remaining trials had been inadequately described, so it was not possible to judge the quality. Similarly, only seven trials reported information on allocation concealment. The lack of description and detail does not necessarily mean inadequate procedures were in place but rather a lack of reporting of this detail (<LINK REF="REF-Soares-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soares 2004</LINK>). The prevalence of good methodology in relation to blinding of outcome assessors supports this interpretation, as more than half of the trials within the review (N = 43) described adequate blinding procedures. We only considered 11 to have inadequately blinded assessors, while 20 provided too little detail to make a judgement.</P>
<P>Half of the trials in this review (N = 36, 49%) were published before the CONSORT statement (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). Disappointingly, of the 38 trials published from 2005 (and after the implementation of the CONSORT statement) only 25 (66%) reported adequate methods of generating the randomisation sequence, and only 19 (50%) reported adequate methods of concealing allocation. Of the 20 that failed to adhere to the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="STD-B.A.Bar-2011i" TYPE="STUDY">B.A.Bar 2011i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-B.A.Bar-2011ii" TYPE="STUDY">B.A.Bar 2011ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Conklyn-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Conklyn 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crosson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Crosson 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FUATAC" TYPE="STUDY">FUATAC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laska-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Laska 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattioli-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mattioli 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meinzer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Meinzer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ORLA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ORLA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ORLA-2010" TYPE="STUDY">ORLA 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rochon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rochon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smania-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Smania 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szaflarski-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Szaflarski 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yao-2005i" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2005i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yao-2005ii" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2005ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yao-2005iii" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2005iii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2007i" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2007i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2007ii" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2007ii</LINK>), seven were published in Chinese medicine or nursing journals, and three were based on an abstract or short report of a full trial (<LINK REF="STD-FUATAC" TYPE="STUDY">FUATAC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ORLA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">ORLA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Szaflarski-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Szaflarski 2014</LINK>). It is essential that future trial reports adhere to these internationally accepted standards of trial reporting.</P>
<P>Twelve trials reported an a priori power size calculation, which is reflected in the small numbers of randomised participants across the trials included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-ACTNoW-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ACTNoW 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-B.A.Bar-2011i" TYPE="STUDY">B.A.Bar 2011i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Doesborgh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Doesborgh 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laska-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Laska 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MIT-2014i" TYPE="STUDY">MIT 2014i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MIT-2014ii" TYPE="STUDY">MIT 2014ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NARNIA-2013" TYPE="STUDY">NARNIA 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RATS" TYPE="STUDY">RATS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RATS_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">RATS-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SP_x002d_I_x002d_RiT" TYPE="STUDY">SP-I-RiT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varley-2016i" TYPE="STUDY">Varley 2016i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varley-2016ii" TYPE="STUDY">Varley 2016ii</LINK>). Nine randomised 10 or fewer participants; 43 randomised up to 50 participants; 16 randomised between 51 and 100 participants; two randomised over 100 participants and only four involved 150 individuals or more. The randomisation of such relatively small numbers of participants reduces the power of the statistical analyses, raises questions of the reliability of findings and (given the complexity of various aphasia impairments) causes difficulties in ensuring the comparability of the groups at baseline. Fifteen of the included trials had groups that significantly differed at baseline, and group comparability was unclear in another 10 randomised comparisons.</P>
<P>Despite these reporting and methodological limitations, we have synthesised a large number of trials that address the effectiveness of SLT for aphasia following stroke across a number of outcome measures. Across these measures, there is evidence of the effectiveness of SLT for people with aphasia when compared with no therapy provision. While the consistency in the direction of results observed in the previous version of this review remains following the inclusion of additional trial data, many of the significant differences between pooled data from patients that received SLT and those that did not include data from a single three-armed trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2007i" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2007i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2007ii" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2007ii</LINK>). Caution is required in interpreting this trial evidence, as the randomisation procedure, concealment of allocation, blinding, and even details of the SLT intervention evaluated (contents, duration, frequency, intensity) are unclear.</P>
<P>With at least 18 additional trials of relevance to this review currently ongoing or about to report, the picture based on the current evidence for SLT for aphasia following stroke will develop further over time. We can be confident that with the availability of well-conducted and reported trials, the evidence will continue to strengthen, providing more indications of the effectiveness of specific approaches to SLT.</P>
<P>Thirty-one of the 74 trials in this review included all randomised participants in their final analyses. The remaining 43 trials lost participants during the treatment or follow-up phases, but only eleven employed an ITT analysis. In some cases large proportions of participants withdrew from some interventions, and at times this appeared to be linked to the intervention itself, with significantly more participants withdrawing from both intensive SLT and social support interventions than from comparator SLT interventions. Similarly, there was evidence of significantly fewer people adhering to their allocated intervention when that intervention was a social support intervention and a trend towards this when the intervention was a high-intensity SLT.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-05-25 10:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Within this review, we expanded the 2012 search strategy and conducted a comprehensive search for high quality trials that evaluated the effectiveness of SLT for aphasia following stroke. While we are confident we have identified most published trials of relevance to the review, it is still possible that despite our efforts, we may be unaware of additional unpublished work. Our search strategy and study selection criteria were agreed in advance and applied to all identified trials. Our data extraction processes were completed independently and then compared. Whenever possible, we extracted all relevant data and sought missing data directly from the trialists for inclusion within the review. We considered it appropriate to include cross-over data within our review given the nature of the comparisons, the points at which the data were extracted and, in some cases, the availability of individual patient data.</P>
<P>This review has been informed by the availability of individual patient data (N = 323). In three trials the individual data were presented within the associated publications, while for the remaining 10 trials we are very grateful to the trialists for access to their unpublished data, facilitating inclusion of their trial data within the review. In addition, other trialists generously contributed the relevant summary values thus permitting the full inclusion of important trials from this field within the meta-analyses (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Wertz-1986i" TYPE="STUDY">Wertz 1986i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wertz-1986ii" TYPE="STUDY">Wertz 1986ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wertz-1986iii" TYPE="STUDY">Wertz 1986iii</LINK>). However, there still remain a number of other relevant trials that could not be fully included.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-05-25 10:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>One of the first reviews in this area was <LINK REF="REF-Robey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robey 1994</LINK>, which included 21 published studies (restricted to English language but not to RCTs). The reviewers identified at least 19 more studies that they were unable to include because of the manner in which the data had been reported. They concluded that the provision of SLT in the acute stages of aphasia following stroke was twice as effective as natural recovery patterns. Delayed therapy had a smaller, though still evident, impact. The authors called for better reporting of data and the use of large sample sizes. This team later updated their review, employing the same methodologies and including 55 studies that focused specifically on the amount and type of SLT intervention and its impact on the severity and type of aphasia (<LINK REF="REF-Robey-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robey 1998a</LINK>). Again, they concluded that SLT was effective, particularly SLT in the acute stages following stroke and if two or more hours of therapy were provided each week. However, they again did not have access to all the relevant data, and they excluded some key trials, such as <LINK REF="REF-Wertz-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wertz 1986</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Bhogal-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhogal 2003</LINK> reviewed 10 English language publications of controlled trials from a MEDLINE search (1975 to 2002) and associated references. They found that intensive SLT delivered significant treatment effects (when at least nine hours per week were delivered) and that studies that failed to demonstrate a treatment effect had only provided about two hours of SLT per week. The total duration of SLT provision was also negatively correlated with language outcomes. <LINK REF="REF-Cherney-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherney 2008</LINK> also reviewed 10 English language publications (1990 to 2006; 15 electronic databases; not all RCTs) and found modest evidence for intensive SLT and benefits of constraint-induced aphasia therapy.</P>
<P>In contrast, <LINK REF="REF-Moss-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moss 2006</LINK> reviewed 23 single patient reports involving the provision by a therapist on a one-to-one basis of SLT that targeted spoken output or auditory comprehension in 57 participants identified following a systematic search (1985 to 2003) of published or indexed work. They concluded that time since stroke (and aphasia onset) is not linked to the response to SLT though they indicate (based on their data) that response to SLT may decline eight years after stroke. However, the highly selective nature of participants in published single cases studies means that reviews based on such a population group are of questionable applicability to a general clinical population. Individuals (and their caregivers) within such reports are likely to be highly motivated, educated, dedicated, and reliable therapy participants (<LINK REF="REF-Moss-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moss 2006</LINK>).    </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-05-25 10:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Our review presents evidence of the benefits of SLT for people with aphasia following stroke as measured by their functional communication, reading, comprehension, expressive language, and writing. While there is an overall consistency in the findings across all trials included in these analyses, some of our significant findings were dependent on data from a single trial with limited information on the nature of the SLT intervention and the quality of the trial. Thus, we must exercise some caution in interpreting these results. It is also of note that the SLT provided in the included trials could be considered to be at a high level of intensity over variable periods of time.</P>
<P>Based on a smaller number of trials, we also observed some indication of the benefits of high-intensity approaches to SLT in relation to functional communication and severity of impairment. The intensity of the interventions varied, as did the duration of therapy input, but such high-intensity approaches to SLT may not have suited all participants. Significantly more participants in the intensive groups dropped out from these trials than from the non-intensive groups.</P>
<P>Similarly, one small trial indicated that social support and stimulation may be beneficial to some aspects of patients' language skills, but the findings were confounded by a significantly higher participant dropout from social support interventions than from SLT interventions.</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence within this review to establish the effectiveness of one SLT theoretical approach over another, with little indication of a difference between group SLT versus one-to-one SLT, and computer-mediated SLT versus therapist-delivered SLT. Similarly, there was little indication of a difference in the effectiveness of SLT facilitated by a trained volunteer versus SLT delivered by a therapist. This is unsurprising, as the volunteers in these trials received specialist training, had access to therapy materials and in many cases were delivering therapy interventions designed and overseen by a professional therapist. This model of SLT treatment delivery is often used in the UK.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-05-25 10:56:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In the course of updating this review, we identified many ongoing trials and trials that are about to report findings. In this context of a rapidly developing evidence base, there will be a need to update the findings of this review once the results of these ongoing trials become available. As aphasia researchers, we need to continue to improve the quality of SLT trials conducted. It is in pursuit of this goal that the <A HREF="http://www.aphasiatrials.org/">Collaboration of Aphasia Trialists</A> has been established. Funded by the European <A HREF="http://www.cost.eu/">COST Association</A>, this international collaboration of multidisciplinary aphasia researchers seek to enhance the development, conduct, and reporting of aphasia research. Aphasia researchers, funders, reviewers, and editors should be encouraged to publish all findings from completed trials. Investigators should adhere to the recommendations of the CONSORT statement, thus ensuring that the quality of the trial is fully demonstrated in the published report (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). In addition, the recent TIDieR guidelines seek to support better reporting of complex interventions such as SLT for aphasia and to ensure the transparency and transferability of research approaches into clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffmann-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffmann 2014</LINK>). These guidelines have also enhanced the description and profiling of included trial SLT interventions within our <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. Trialists should also provide full descriptions of the relevant statistical summary data (means and SDs of final value scores) thus allowing inclusion of their data within any subsequent relevant meta-analyses. A priori sample size calculations should be employed, ensuring SLT trials are adequately powered to demonstrate differences. The challenge for SLT researchers and clinicians will be to design, develop, conduct, and support larger trials. It is essential for the success of these trials that the work is undertaken in a collaborative manner between patients, clinicians, and researchers. Standardised outcome measures should be employed to evaluate the impact of SLT on participants' functional communication, expressive and receptive language skills, and the severity of their aphasia. We welcome the work currently ongoing in the <A HREF="http://www.cometinitiative.org/studies/details/287">ROMA</A> study to achieve international consensus on a minimum core data set for aphasia research.</P>
<P>Supported by <A HREF="http://www.nets.nihr.ac.uk/programmes/hsdr">UK NIHR funding</A>, the <A HREF="http://www.aphasiatrials.org/index.php/prognosis-and-predictors-research/2-uncategorised/137-rehabilitation-and-recovery-of-people-with-aphasia-after-stroke-release">RELEASE project</A> is conducting a more detailed examination of the effectiveness of SLT and the interaction between specific individuals, aphasia and stroke profiles, therapy regimens, theoretical approaches, and delivery models. The internationally collaborative group of aphasia researchers is gathering individual patient data from across more than 50 pre-existing aphasia research studies for the purposes of secondary data analyses, which will specifically examine many of the issues raised in this review. Additional expressions of interest in contribution of aphasia research data sets are welcome.</P>
<P>Our overall aim for future research should be to establish what is the optimum approach, frequency, duration of allocation, and format of SLT provision for specific patient groups.</P>

<P>Following close inspection of the original review and detailed discussion among this review team (<LINK REF="REF-Greener-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greener 1999</LINK>), we made adjustments to the review, many of which reflect changes in Cochrane procedures, review methodologies, and style and structure in the time since the publication of the original review. These amendments were ratified by the Cochrane Stroke Group Editorial Board on 23 November 2006.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Background</HEADING>
<P>We updated the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK> section to include a definition of SLT and aphasia, and to reflect current approaches and rationale to SLT interventions and outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Objectives</HEADING>
<P>We amended the <LINK TAG="OBJECTIVES" TYPE="SECTION">Objectives</LINK> to a single statement according to the standard format of Cochrane reviews; that is, to assess the effects of SLT interventions for aphasia following stroke.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Types of studies</HEADING>
<P>It was unclear whether or not quasi-randomised controlled trials were included in the original review. We have excluded quasi-randomised trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Types of interventions</HEADING>
<P>We compressed the <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK> into three broad categories: SLT versus no SLT intervention, SLT versus social support or stimulation, and SLT intervention A versus SLT intervention B (where A and B refer to two different types of therapeutic interventions or approaches).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Types of outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>We refined the <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK> to a single primary outcome measure of functional communication. Secondary outcomes include other measures of communication (receptive or expressive language, or both), psychosocial outcomes, patient satisfaction with the intervention, number of participant dropouts for any reason, adherence to the allocated intervention, economic outcomes (such as cost to the patient, caregivers, families, health service, and society) and caregiver or family satisfaction. We extracted data relating to death, morbidity and cognitive skills in the original review, but on reflection, we did not consider these to be relevant indicators of the effectiveness of an SLT intervention, and we therefore excluded them from this update. The original review reported overall functional status (e.g. Barthel Index) as one of a number of primary outcomes. As described above, we focused on a single primary outcome (in line with the current review methodology).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Data extraction tool</HEADING>
<P>For this 2016 version of the review, PC and MB created and piloted a new electronically based data extraction tool. MB and HK or PE had extracted data from trials included the 2012 review using a paper-based tool.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Search methods for identification of studies</HEADING>
<P>Re-running the original search strategy for the MEDLINE and CINAHL databases raised over 12.6 million references. Therefore, Brenda Thomas, the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Search Co-ordinator, devised up-to-date search strategies. We handsearched the <I>International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders</I> (previously named the <I>British Journal of Disorders of Communication</I>, the<I> European Journal of Disorders of Communication</I> and the <I>International Journal of Disorders of Communication)</I> from 1969 to 2005. This journal has been indexed by MEDLINE since 2006 and was thus included in our electronic searches from this date.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of studies</HEADING>
<P>The original 1999 review listed studies other than identified RCTs in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table, including single case or case series studies. As there are a vast number of such studies, the updated table now only presents potentially relevant studies that appear to be randomised but which we excluded for other reasons (e.g. quasi-randomised or where we could not extract aphasia-specific data).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparisons</HEADING>
<P>Mid-trial outcome scores were included in the 1999 review. We have focused our reporting on postintervention and follow-up scores. We have not included analyses of the number of participants who deteriorated on particular outcome measures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other amendments</HEADING>
<P>As we were unable to obtain the extraction sheets for the trials included in the review (published in 1999), we cross-checked the data extracted for the original review with the available published and unpublished data. We made some amendments regarding the exclusion of some studies and the categorisation of the methods of allocation concealment used in the included trials.</P>
<P>In the 2012 review update, we excluded quasi-randomised studies, so we excluded one study that had contributed to the 1999 review (<LINK REF="STD-Hartman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hartman 1987</LINK>). In addition, on reviewing the data from another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kinsey-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kinsey 1986</LINK>), we decided that the reported comparison was not a therapy intervention as such, but rather a comparison of task performance (computer-based or with a therapist). We thus excluded this trial from subsequent reviews. The review team considered allocation concealment for one study to be 'inadequate' in the 1999 review (<LINK REF="STD-MacKay-1988" TYPE="STUDY">MacKay 1988</LINK>). We failed to get confirmation of the method of allocation from the authors, and therefore we amended the allocation for this trial to 'unclear'. The 1999 review included a matched control group of no SLT intervention for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Prins-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Prins 1989</LINK>). However, unlike the other groups in this trial, this group was not randomised, therefore we have excluded it from this update. Another study had been excluded from the original review on the grounds that it was not an RCT (<LINK REF="REF-Shewan-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shewan 1984</LINK>). Discussion with the trialists has since revealed that it was, and we have now included it in the 2012 and 2016 reviews.The original 1999 review included outcomes relating to the impact of SLT on the emotional well-being of family members (<LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-1984a" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 1984a</LINK>). Such outcomes do not directly relate to the aims of this review, so we have not included these measures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Information added to the 1999 review</HEADING>
<P>Following an extensive search up to April 2009, we identified an additional 20 trials as suitable for inclusion in the review. The 2010 review included data from 30 trials involving 1840 randomised participants (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Information added to the 2012 review</HEADING>
<P>Following an extensive search from inception of the electronic databases up to July 2011, we identified an additional nine trials eligible for inclusion in the review. This 2012 review update now includes data from 39 trials involving 2518 randomised participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Information added to the 2016 review</HEADING>
<P>Following a revised and extended search (incorporating additional electronic databases) from inception of the databases up to 22 September 2015, we identified an additional 18 trials (22 randomised comparisons) eligible for inclusion in the review. This 2016 review update now includes data from 57 completed trials (74 randomised comparisons) involving 3002 randomised participants.</P>

<B>1. Supervised intensive language self training </B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>: computer SLT. Designed to facilitate dialogue skills in everyday life, use of adjacency pairs (<LINK REF="REF-Schegloff-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schegloff 2007</LINK>). The turns are functionally related to each other (e.g. greeting&#8211;greeting: "Hello"&#8211;"Hi"; leave-taking&#8210;leave-taking: "Goodbye"&#8211;"Bye!") or information acts (e.g. question&#8211;answer: "When is the doctor's office open?"&#8211;"From 2 until 5 p.m."). The guiding principle is "talk-in-interaction" (<LINK REF="REF-Schegloff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schegloff 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Materials</B>: B.A.Bar equipment. Simple electronic device makes use of barcodes that carry linguistic information suited to language learning. Speech of various levels of complexity (words, phrases, sentences, texts) can be recorded, stored, and replayed as often as needed during learning. When a barcode is scanned, the recorded language is replayed to facilitate reproduction. The learning material consisted of short dialogues composed of 3 adjacency pairs: a conventional beginning (e.g. greeting&#8211;greeting), a main information part (e.g. question&#8211;answer, offer&#8211;affirmation), and a conventional ending (e.g. leave-taking&#8210;leave-taking). Each half-day training of dialogues had to be complemented by corresponding vocabulary drill exercises that required auditory word comprehension (word&#8211;picture matching) and oral naming.The items were always related to the topics conveyed by the dialogues. The 2 tasks were again carried out by means of barcode scanning. Moreover, the drill exercises contained 6 to 8 items for oral naming and 6 items for comprehension. <B>Procedures</B>: weekly supervision of the home training. B.A.Bar dialogue training. Exercise sheets with dialogues were given to the participants so that learners with aphasia could placethemselves in the role of the responding partner. The home training material consisted of 48 dialogues that represented characteristic scenes from 2 different thematic fields of daily living. Half of the dialogues were related to shopping, food, and drinking, the other half to health and illness. For each thematic field, a separate booklet with practice material containing 24 dialogues was prepared. Booklets were separated into 4 chapters with 2 subchapters each. The participants were instructed to practice the 8 subchapters in sequence, 1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon, 4 d a week. Thus, every half day, 3 dialogues had to be practiced. During the 4-week training, the total material was practiced twice: the first thematic field during the 1st and 3rd week and the second thematic field during the 2nd and 4th week. <B>Provided by</B>: B.A.Bar Equipment, which reads barcodes provided to therapists in private practice for use with randomised patients. Each therapist received 1 h of training before participant began to use B.A.Barr. <B>Delivery</B>: computer-facilitated, 1 participant using 1 computer at home plus 1 h in clinic with therapist (and no computer). <B>Regimen</B>: practice twice a day for 1 h per session, 4 d per week (for 4 weeks) plus 1 h private session with speech and language therapist. <B>Tailoring</B>: yes. <B>Modification</B>: SLT focused on items described as difficult by patient and selected dialogues practiced. <B>Adherence</B>: monitored through supervision once a week by speech and language therapist in private practice and supported through dialogue, roleplay, review of difficult items, planning of future sessions, self evaluation forms from therapists.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Visual-cognitive tasks </B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>: no SLT. Attention control. <B>Materials</B> non-linguistic cognitive training focused on basic functions of visual exploration and attention. It involved visual&#8211;cognitive exercises such as visual matching of a part to the whole, maze games, comparing 2 pictures to find differences, or searching for target objects in complex pictures. A separate booklet of worksheets was developed for each week of training, again&#8212;like the language training&#8212;separated into 4 chapters and 8 subchapters. During the 4-week treatment, the total visual&#8211;cognitive material was also practiced twice, the first booklet during the 1st and 3rd week and the second booklet during the 2nd and 4th week. Similar to the language training, the participants recorded the practice time after each session on protocol sheets. Each individual training session was based on a subchapter of the booklet containing 15 exercises: 5 pictures with visual differences, 4 maze games, 3 matching exercises, and 3 searching exercises. The time required to complete 1 session of cognitive training was calculated to be equal to the time needed for 1 session of B.A.Bar language training (approximately 30 min each). It should be noted that the B.A.Bar technology was not used during cognitive training, and feedback on correct solutions was given only during supervision but not during the home training. <B>Procedures</B>: visual&#8211;cognitive exercises. <B>Provided by</B>: speech and language therapist supervision, professional. <B>Delivery</B>: 1-to-1 and self management; face-to-face and self management, at home plus 1 h in clinic. <B>Regimen</B>: practice twice a day for 1 h per session, 4 d per week (for 4 weeks) plus 1 h private clinic session with speech and language therapist. Total dose = 36 h. <B>Tailoring</B>: yes. <B>Modification</B>: cognitive problem-solving strategies were checked, and alternative strategies were shown to the participants. <B>Adherence</B>: monitored through supervision once a week by speech and language therapist in private practice and supported through diaglogue, roleplay, review of difficult items, planning of future sessions, self evaluation forms from therapists.</P>

<B>1. Computer-mediated word finding therapy </B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>: StepbyStep. Computer programmes developed for the treatment of aphasia provide exercises that can be carried out on a regular basis, targeting personal vocabulary and focusing on the patient's conversational needs. Such software has been reported to be useful in the provision of intensive independent language practice, giving rise to new opportunities to provide self management of continued aphasia treatment. There is growing evidence to suggest that the use of aphasia software can help to improve outcomes in language domains including reading, spelling, and expressive language. <B>Materials</B>: usual language activities (as described in no SLT arm). In addition, they received speech and language therapy intervention delivered through independent use of a computer therapy programme (StepbyStep) configured by a speech and language therapist and supported by a volunteer. A library of more than 13,000 language exercises. Photographic images can be added to enable practice of personally relevant words such as names of people and pets. The intervention group practiced Object and Action Naming battery words during the treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Druks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Druks 2000</LINK>). In addition, participants in the intervention group practiced 48 words of personal relevance. <B>Procedures</B>: each exercise follows steps progressing from listening to target words, producing words with visual, semantic, phonemic, or written letter/word cues through to saying the words in sentences. Speech and language therapist also provided initial instruction to the participant and caregiver on how to use the computer exercises and progress through the therapy steps. Volunteers provided assistance in using the software and hardware, encouragement to practice, and activities to promote use of the new words in daily life. <B>Provided by</B>: speech and language therapist tailored the steps in the therapy process. Volunteers provided assistance in using the software and hardware, encouragement to practice, and activities to promote use of the new words in daily life. Volunteers contacted the participants once a week in the first month and at least once a month thereafter by telephone or home visit. Speech and language therapists trained. Volunteers included SLT students and existing volunteers from communication support groups. Volunteers were given a 3 h training session on how to use the StepbyStep programme and their role in supporting the intervention. <B>Delivery</B>: 1-to-1, computer facilitated. Speech and language therapist supported face-to-face, at home. <B>Regimen</B>: per protocol: 20 minutes 3 d a week for 5 months (approximately 1500 minutes of practice time in total).

<B>1. Naming therapy with gesture </B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>: gesture SLT. Literature suggests the advantages of recruitment of right-hemisphere mechanisms during language recovery in aphasia. <LINK REF="REF-Crosson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crosson 2007</LINK> devised an intention-based treatment technique that engaged the right hemisphere by shifting intention and language production mechanisms to homologous right-hemisphere regions. <LINK REF="REF-Crosson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crosson 2007</LINK> defined intention as the ability to select and initiate an action from many possible competing actions. Because the intentional circuits for volitional hand movement overlap, those for word generation in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) preceding a naming attempt with a volitional complex left-hand movement could facilitate picture naming. <B>Materials</B>: prior to treatment, all subjects named a set of more than 400 black-and-white line drawings of objects and generated members of 120 categories twice. Items missed consistently were selected for treatment, beginning with the highest frequency items and progressing to lower frequency items until enough items were identified to construct the counterbalanced treatment lists and probe stimuli. Specifically, from the set of 400 pictures and 120 categories, 120 pictures and 60 categories were individually selected for each subject, with the selected picture and category sets each containing 25% consistently correct and 75% consistently incorrect at pretreatment testing. <B>Procedures</B>: trained on both picture naming and category generation. Phase 1 consisted of treatment sessions 1&#8211;10 and focused on the naming of 50 pictures. Phase 2 consisted of treatment sessions 11&#8211;20 and trained subjects on the naming of 50 different pictures. Phase 3 consisted of treatment sessions 21&#8211;30 and required the generation of an exemplar of each of 40 different categories. Naming trials in Phases 1 and 2 consisted of the presentation of a picture on a computer monitor for naming. In Phase 3, trials consisted of auditory and orthographic presentations of a category name for which the subject generated 1 category member. For all trials in all phases, a therapist verified response accuracy. If treatment trials were completed correctly (i.e., a picture was named correctly or a correct category exemplar was generated), subjects began the next trial. If an item was not named correctly, the therapist would provide the correct name, and subjects would then practice saying the correct response. Similarly, if a subject was unable to generate a member of a category, the therapist would provide an example, and the subject would practice saying this correct response. This correction procedure was repeated up to 3 times maximum or until the subject named the item correctly. The number of times a subject repeated the correct response was not regulated. Each member of the gesture group initiated each treatment trial with his or her left hand by opening and reaching into a box and pushing a red button. Second, during each correction procedure, each member of the gesture group also made a non-meaningful circular gesture with his or her left hand. <B>Provided by</B>: speech and language therapists. The same therapists administered both the gesture and the no gesture treatments. Training not reported. <B>Delivery</B>: 1-to-1, face-to-face and computer, location not reported. <B>Regimen</B>: treatment was delivered in 3 phases (10 sessions per phase), with two 1 h treatment sessions per day, 5 d a week, for a total of 30 treatment sessions. The 2 sessions each day were at least half an hour apart. Total dose = 30 h therapy. <B>Tailoring</B>: yes, naming targets by successful/unsuccessful attempts on baseline measure. During therapy correction and prompt and advancement through levels based on patient ability. <B>Modification</B>: not reported.<B> Adherence</B>: therapist monitored patient's protocol adherence. For treatment sessions a research assistant&#8212;who was trained in both treatments and who was not administering treatment at any of the sites&#8212;evaluated 1 session per treatment phase (i.e., once a week) per subject for correct delivery of the assigned treatment and subsequent correction procedures.</P>

In the case of failure, all the facilitations were given. Single word as well as sentence comprehension was also treated with the help of available common objects and objects pictures. A semi-structured rehabilitation setting was used, instead of a rigidly predetermined set of tasks identical for all the subjects, due to the clinical condition of the acute phase and the location (the stroke unit) where the rehabilitation was conducted. Generally, a stimulation of the impaired linguistic functions was conducted by the therapist, according to the deficits shown by the AAT. <B>Provided by</B>: speech and language therapists. Training not reported. <B>Delivery</B>: 1-to-1, face-to-face; location not reported. <B>Regimen</B>: 1 h session per day, for 5 d per week for 2 weeks.

<B>1. MIT</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>: MIT. Critical role of rhythm and formulaic language in MIT contribution of the right hemisphere is still not reported: some report increased right hemisphere activation related to MIT success. Others suggest that MIT-induced language recovery is related to reactivation of left perilesional regions. <B>Materials</B>: set of utterances of increasing complexity to be trained. The first utterances in frequent use in daily life communication (e.g. "coffee please"). Later the utterances became longer, more complex, and less frequent in daily life. In addition, the patient composed a set of self chosen utterances that were functionally relevant to them (e.g. relating to hobbies). Home practice included - iPod application containing short videos of a mouth singing the target utterances; patients could sing along with the video or repeat the utterance afterwards. <B>Procedures</B>: MIT following the American manual. The patient and the therapist sang short utterances together, while handtapping the rhythm. Gradually, the support from the therapist decreased and singing was replaced by speaking. A minimum of 50% of the therapy time was spent on the utterances provided. <B>Provided by</B>: speech and language therapists experienced in language rehabilitation. All trained to deliver MIT according to protocol. <B>Delivery</B>: 1-to-1, face-to-face, delivered in the rehabilitation centre or nursing home with rehabilitation facilities. <B>Regimen</B>: 6 weeks; 5 h/week (minimum face-to-face time 3 h/week).

<P>
<B>2. Control SLT </B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>: control SLT. Not aiming at language production. Used linguistic tasks often trained in severe nonfluent aphasia (e.g. written language production, language comprehension, and nonverbal communication strategies). <B>Materials</B>: home assignments included paper-and-pencil tasks (e.g. written sentence completion, word&#8211;picture matching, and word categorising tasks). <B>Procedures</B>: did not emphasise spoken output. Focused on other linguistic modalities usually trained in severe nonfluent aphasia (writing, language comprehension, nonverbal communication strategies). Spoken output was not discouraged but the therapists did not provide feedback regarding patients' verbal production and offered no structural training of language production. <B>Provided by</B>: speech and language therapists. Therapists delivering the control SLT received a protocol of what was permitted and what was not, as well as a manual containing practice materials and references that could be used. PI also helped create tailor-made tasks for a specific patient. <B>Delivery</B>: 1-to-1, face-to-face, delivered in the rehabilitation centre or nursing home with rehabilitation facilities. <B>Regimen</B>: 6 weeks; 5 h/week (minimum face-to-face time 3 h/week).

<B>1. Narrative</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>: NARNIA. Therapy directly targets discourse organisation to support earlier levels of language production and improve discourse production. <B>Materials</B>: narrative production using published picture sequences (Toomey's 'Sequence Plus', 1992) focusing initially on identifying the main event(s), production of relevant verb and nouns and creating a complete argument structure. Functionally relevant materials were chosen e.g. planning a holiday, shaving. A framework for narrative discourse, based on story grammar, was introduced, and the sentences organised around "setting the scene" (the beginning), "the events taking place" (the middle), and "concluding the story" (the end). Following sucess in use of the narrative framework, other discourse genre frameworks (recount, procedure and exposition) were used. Mind-mapping was used to populate discourse frameworks and link ideas, events and words which in turn supported discourse structre and organisation. Use of visual prompts was gradually decreased as therapy progressed. Some pictorial resources were used to stimulate opinions (e.g. Skills for Daily Living: Social Behaviour, Speechmark, 2002), most topics were prompted from personal experiences. <B>Procedures</B>: metalinguistic approach to increase awareness of both sentence and discourse structure, at all times focusing attention on the word, sentence and discourse levels. Drew on developmental frameworks for discourse production used in the pedagogy of oral and written language. Word, sentence and discourse levels were integrated to increase metalinguistic awareness of specific microstructure elements of language, followed by frameworks for macrostructure that were used to scaffold the production of discourse across a range of everyday discourse genres. Once the principles of coherence were in place, cohesive devices were targeted. Self evaluation of performance was employed after each attempt using a visual scale that required self-monitoring of performance on 7 different indices including success at finding nouns and verbs, to completing sentences, to structural components of the discourse sample, and overall clarity of the sample. <B>Provided by</B>: 2 speech and language therapists. Speech and language therapist professional and trial training. <B>Delivery</B>: 1-to-1, face-to-face, delivered predominantly within a clinical setting as most participants were inpatients at a rehabilitation hospital or attended outpatient services. In some instances, sessions were delivered in the participant's home. <B>Regimen</B>: 20 individual treatment sessions delivered, with few exceptions, 4 times weekly, over 5 weeks. Total dose = 20 h of therapy. In a small number of cases, participants could not commit to 4 x weekly sessions (over 5 weeks). Sessions were then spread over a longer period of time, e.g. 20 sessions delivered 3 times weekly over a (nearly) 7 week period. <B>Tailoring</B>: yes. <B>Modification</B>: the protocol was adhered to for each participant. Minor variations were permitted in delivery according to individual differences, e.g. more prompts could be provided in the presence of comprehension difficulties, greater elaboration of topics could be encouraged when participants were less severe to maintain motivation, visual templates could be faded out more quickly if participants showed a disinclination to them, but all core elements of the protocol were included. <B>Adherence</B>: regular discussion and recording a proportion of sessions on video to monitor adherence to the treatment protocol. Actual adherence: no instances of non-adherence were noted in the sessions reviewed. The clinicians engaged in regular and informal reflection of delivery of the intervention. Client rating forms on their performance on all core elements of the protocol from each session that demonstrated that all components of the protocol had been focused on.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Conventional SLT </B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>: conventional SLT. Therapy focusing on training specific deficits. <B>Materials</B>: any SLT routinely used in clinical practice. Access to all assessment data with the exception of the Curtin University Discourse Protocol (CUDP) data. <B>Procedures</B>: based on usual practice procedures around goal setting - exercises including sentence completion, improving patients' retrieval of words, learning sentence patterns, conversation on current topics, listening, to words, and repeating and following instructions. The therapist initiated the communicative activities. The aimed to target several modes of communication. Participants were permitted to use any communication mode, including non-verbal communication. aimed to improve word or sentence production, reading, writing or more functional activities that frequently drew on several domains. Discourse could be included in usual care as a context for generalisation of therapy targets. <B>Provided by</B>: speech and language therapists. Training not reported. <B>Delivery</B>: 1-to-1, face-to-face, delivered predominantly within a clinical setting as most participants were inpatients at a rehabilitation hospital or attended outpatient services.

<B>1. Sentence mapping </B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>: SLT. Mapping therapy to address "mapping deficit" targets comprehension impairment but anticipating gains in production. This intervention aimed to target production in nonfluent aphasia based on mapping therapy approach. Cueing approach. Level 1 - agent cue to produce sentence. Level 2 - 1 agent cue to produce theme cue. Level 3 - identification of both roles in fixed order. Level 4 - role identification varied and randomised. 4 sentence structures trained - active, subject, cleft, passive and object cleft sentences. Canonical and non-canonical sentences were also closely matched. (Sample of treatment protocol provided Rochon 2005). <B>Materials</B>: stimuli came from large sentence bank of &gt; 500 semantically reversible sentences. 144 sentences in treatment phase. Stimuli to elicit sentences were colour photos of actors clearly depicting action taken against a plain backdrop. 2 small black/white icons used to reinforce difference between agent/theme in target sentence. 6 sets of 24 sentences. Random order of presentation. <B>Procedures</B>: each session 12 sentences levels 1-2 and 24 at levels 3-4. <B>Provided by</B>: trained RA. <B>Delivery</B>: face-to-face; 1-to-1; location not reported. <B>Regimen</B>: 1-h session twice weekly for approximately 2.5 months.

Written language tasks (<LINK REF="REF-Meinzer-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meinzer 2005b</LINK>). Visual barrier also used. <B>Procedures</B>: therapeutic language games. Massed practice, shaping and constraint of non-verbal strategies. Where verbal skills good, writing to single word dictation used. Progressive degrees of difficulty built in. Also included 2 non-aphasic patients from rehab centre in the group as groups members and 'able communicators'. Groups established of 4&#8211;6 patients plus speech therapist and 2 patients without aphasia (from the medical professional rehabilitation team).

<B>1. Task Specific Naming SLT</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>: task-specific SLT. <B>Materials</B>: therapy equipment for the practice of naming was formed by half the number of items of the naming test. The 40 images were distributed as follows: 10 animals, 10 objects from the house, 10 objects without any relation to each other and 10 action verbs. The therapy material for practicing the sentence making also contained half of the number of items that was used for the test for 'making sentences'. The 15 training sentences had the following structure: 3 sentences NP-V, NP-5 sentences V-NP, and NP-7 sentences V-PP. <B>Procedures</B>: systematic tracking of a number of steps. The steps that must be carried out by the practitioner are dependent on the response of the patient. This response consists of a description (B), a semantic (C) or a phonological paraphasia (D), the therapist responds with cues as respectively: "Yes, it is to sleep in, so .." (bed) , "It's not a table, but a ...?" (chair), or "It's not unicorn, but ..?" (squirrel). If the patient after these cues did not give the right response, or no response (A), then the patient will be prompted for the initial sound of the target word. If the patient does not know the initial sound, then this is offered by the therapist. In the next step, the patient is invited to designate the target word on a map, where there are 4 words in large letters (the target word, a semantically related word, a phonetic-cognate and non-cognate) are presented. The final step in the practice consists of the repetition of the intended word. For the naming task: for each picture, the patient is first given the opportunity to produce the appropriate sentence. When the patient fails, the patient is helped depending on the response. The patient is helped with questions like, "Who is this? '(e.g. a girl), "What is she doing? "(e.g. letter) and "What do they write?" (e.g. letter). After the lack of proper response to any of these questions, the answer is always offered by the therapist. When the patient, despite these cues, is not able to produce the correct sense, the whole sentence is offered, which the patient has to repeat. In each therapy session, the 15 items were offered once. <B>Provided by</B>: phase 1: research speech and language therapists, phase 2: participant's own speech and language therapist <B>Delivery</B>: 1-to-1, face-to-face, location not reported. <B>Regimen</B>: phase 1: 1 h twice weekly for 6 weeks.

<B>1. CIAT</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>: CIAT. Based on principles of constraint induced movement therapy and neuroplasticity, provision of intensive therapy and massed practice. CIAT also provides pragmatically communicative therapeutic context thus communicative effectiveness is maximised and learned non-use of expressive language minimised. <B>Materials</B>: target materials designed to shape individuals' language production with rules and reinforcement contingencies used to extend expressive output. The picture stimuli within each set of cards accommodated a verbal response ranging from single words to sentences. Increased target description, extended phrasal and clausal structures and politeness markers were encouraged to achieve increased utterance complexity and appropriateness according to each player's ability. The therapist provided language support as required to each player according to their individual needs. This was established at initial assessment and monitored and adjusted in response to the individual's performance within the treatment sessions. Full treatment protocol is available. <B>Procedures</B>: on CIAT as outlined by <LINK REF="STD-Pulvermuller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pulvermuller 2001</LINK>. Due to the early nature of the intervention, therapy was modified from the original 3 h per day to 1 h per day. Therapy was conducted by 1 speech pathologist with groups of 2-4 people with aphasia playing CIAT. The therapy task of CIAT was a request and response language game in which participants aimed to collect the highest number of pairs of picture cards. Participants were constrained to interact through verbal production only. Sitting around a table, each participant had a visual barrier preventing them from seeing the cards of other group members, while allowing them to see and hear each other. Shielded by the screen, participants could use self cued gesture to facilitate their verbal production. Participants took turns to try to obtain a card from another player by verbally requesting a card. Each request prompted a verbal response such as confirmation, clarification or negation. <B>Provided by</B>: 8 speech and language therapists. Range of experience (1-23 years), All had 3 h of therapy training prior to delivery of therapy in trial. <B>Delivery</B>: group, face-to-face, acute or rehab hospitals. <B>Regimen</B>: 45-60 minutes, 5 d a week for 20 sessions over 5 weeks. Total dose = 15-20 h therapy. <B>Tailoring</B>: increased target description, extended phrasal and clausal structures and politeness markers were encouraged to achieve increased utterance complexity and appropriateness according to each player's ability. The therapist provided language support as required to each player according to their individual needs. This was established at initial assessment and monitored and adjusted in response to the individual's performance within the treatment sessions. <B>Modification</B>: (as described in Tailoring). <B>Adherence</B>: not reported</P>

<B>2. Conventional SLT</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>: conventional SLT.

The therapies were administered following the respective published instructions. Participants received either 1 therapy or a combination of therapy types as appropriate. <B>Procedures</B>: participants in this therapy arm received an individualised programme tailored to meet their needs. Using the individual's initial assessment results to inform their decision making, the treating therapist selected the appropriate therapy from a range of approaches. <B>Provided by</B>: 8 speech and language therapists. Range of experience (1-23 years), All had 3 h of therapy training prior to delivery of therapy in trial. <B>Delivery</B>: 1-to-1, face-to-face.

<B>1. Constraint Induced Aphasia Therapy</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>: CIAT. Intensive constraint-based intervention thought to be effective. <B>Materials</B>: CIAT treatment is a communication-based group interaction by means of communicative card games. The picture cards contain objects of high as well as low frequent words, black-and-white line drawings as well as colored pictures, pictures of objects as well as action cards, and pictures with minimal pairs (e.g. sock and rock) based on <LINK REF="REF-Maher-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Meinzer-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meinzer 2005b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Meinzer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Meinzer 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pulvermuller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pulvermuller 2001</LINK>. Patients were allowed to produce gestures in order to facilitate verbal output, but their gestures were hidden from the other participants by a 40 cm high screen between the patient and the other participants. <B>Procedures</B>: dual card game was used (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Maher-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2006</LINK>). Participants dealt cards from a set of 32-42 coloured cards (i.e., 16-21 pairs of identical cards) per 45 min treatments. They take turns either requesting an identical card from the other participant (4 to 6 cards per participant) or responding to that request. Constraints were along 3 dimensions: difficulty of the material; the rules of the game, as indicated by verbal instruction and shaping; and reinforcement contingencies (<LINK REF="STD-Pulvermuller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pulvermuller 2001</LINK>). <B>Provided by</B>: 7 trained speech language therapy students (3rd year professional bachelor level). Students under supervision of 6 experienced and professionally trained speech and language therapists. Students were trained according to the training protocol of lay people designed by <LINK REF="STD-Meinzer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Meinzer 2007</LINK>. The speech and language therapists had been given detailed instructions by means of a 2 h presentation in which the study was presented. The basic principles of BOX and CIAT were introduced, and the materials, procedures, and approaches of both types of intervention were carefully explained. In addition, students were given a 1 h practical training session. Instruction sessions contained illustrative video materials. The students and therapists were given a detailed manual with explicit guidelines about CIAT and BOX. <B>Delivery</B>: group, face-to-face, 1 of 4 hospital settings in the Netherlands. <B>Regimen</B>: 2-3 h sessions per day on 9 or 10 consecutive working days (total mean duration ± SD = 1195 ± 59, pauses not included). Each session was interrupted by 2 breaks of 10 to 15 min. <B>Tailoring</B>: daily records were used for a daily evaluation and critical assessment of each session in order to adjust individual or group task difficulty for the next session. <B>Modification</B>: yes, adjusted to individual or group task difficulty for the next session. <B>Adherence</B>: students and therapists kept a detailed daily record of each intervention, specifying the presence of participants and therapists, the duration of the training in minutes, and the training materials used. Actual adherence or fidelity to treatment not reported.</P>
<P>
<B>2. BOX</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>: Semantic SLT. A Dutch drill-based lexical-semantic treatment therapy programme (<LINK REF="REF-Visch_x002d_Brink-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Visch-Brink 2001</LINK>). <B>Materials</B>: focuses on the interpretation of written words, sentences, and texts (also with an auditory presentation by the speech and language therapist if required). <B>Procedures</B>: BOX contains a variety of semantic decision tasks aimed at enhancing semantic processing. 8 different types of exercises within each task, and the patient is required to deny or confirm the semantic relationship between (written and auditorily presented) content words, either presented separately or within the context of a sentence or text. Word choice, number of distractors, semantic relatedness, and ambiguity were taken into account in creating the different levels of difficulty (<LINK REF="REF-Visch_x002d_Brink-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Visch-Brink 1997</LINK>). The patients in the BOX group worked alternatively by themselves on worksheets and with the therapist according to a therapy schedule (see Table 2), which allowed 1 therapist to supervise 2 patients. For example, on the first day, patient 1 started with 30 min of therapy (Therapy Schedule BOX 1) whereas patient 2 began with a 30 min individual working session (Therapy Schedule BOX 2). The next day, participants swapped therapy schedules. Patients were able to adjust their personal level of difficulty.<BR/>In order to apply the shaping principle, therapists monitored performance and solicited patient feedback to ensure that patients were challenged but not overly frustrated. <B>Provided by</B>: 7 trained speech language therapy students (3rd year professional bachelor level). Students under supervision of 6 experienced and professionally trained speech and language therapists. Students were trained according to the training protocol of laypeople designed by <LINK REF="STD-Meinzer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Meinzer 2007</LINK>. The speech and language therapists had been given detailed instructions by means of a 2 h presentation in which the study was presented. The basic principles of BOX and CIAT were introduced, and the materials, procedures, and approaches of both types of intervention were carefully explained. In addition, students were given a 1 h practical training session. Instruction sessions contained illustrative video materials. The students and therapists were given a detailed manual with explicit guidelines about CIAT and BOX. <B>Delivery</B>: independent practice and 1-to-1, face-to-face, 1 of 4 hospital settings in the Netherlands. <B>Regimen</B>: 2-3 h sessions per day on 9 or 10 consecutive working days (total mean duration ± SD = 1150 ± 69 min, pauses not included). Each session was interrupted by 2 breaks of 10 to 15 min. <B>Tailoring</B>: daily records were used for a daily evaluation and critical assessment of each session in order to adjust individual or group task difficulty for the next session. <B>Modification</B>: yes, adjusted to individual or group task difficulty for the next session. <B>Adherence</B>: students and therapists kept a detailed daily record of each intervention, specifying the presence of participants and therapists, the duration of the training in minutes, and the training materials used.

<B>1. Remote telerehab </B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention</B>: telerehab SLT. Telerehabilitation enables patients to "access remote rehabilitation services in their own homes, typically by using internet video conferencing technologies.

<P>1. The Aphasia ASK intervention consists of a face-to-face intervention and follow-up phone calls provided by a speech pathologist up until 12 months poststroke. The intervention is for 6-8 weeks for an hour each week. The topics in the intervention include a number of modules and cover a range of areas including: caregiver training (e.g. communication partner training), education (on aphasia, successful coping strategies and support services) stress management, positive adaptive strategies, sharing of personal stories and developing peer-based support. The participants will be able to prioritise the order of modules based on their personal interest and needs. The prioritisation occurs during the module 'Before we begin'. The first session establishes the goals for the programme using collaborative goal setting techniques. The goals form the basis for prioritising the modules that are covered in future weeks. For example, if the participant's goal is to stay positive, there is a module on positive thinking that includes information about and practice on exercises for strategies which were drawn from the counselling literature. At the end of each module, further resources are recommended including community based options/programmes/resources. Goals are revisited each session. The modules are designed as a guide and should be incorporated with clinical skill and knowledge to ensure the programme is person-centred. Aphasia ASK is to be delivered as individual sessions with only 1 participant with aphasia and their family member(s) involved at any time. Follow-up monthly phone calls or visits (whichever method is suitable for the participants) will be made until 12 months poststroke. The follow-up calls with revisit the participant goals set during the programme and provide additional information and resources where necessary. An Aphasia ASK programme manual has been written for the provider therapist and a separate aphasia friendly workbook has been written for the recipients. Recipients will receive the written materials prior to each session</P>
<P>2. A secondary stroke prevention programme forms the content of the attention control package. It will be provided in a similar dosage (1 h session per week for 6-8 weeks and follow-up monthly phone calls until 12 months poststroke) and similar format (written support materials, delivered to both patients and their family) to the Aphasia ASK intervention The information that will inform the modules will include: What is stroke? Recovery from stroke Understanding risk factors for stroke; Lifestyle interventions; Barriers to implementing lifestyle changes; Understanding your medication</P>

<P>1. Intervention: comprehensive neuropsychological rehabilitation with aphasia therapy would be given along with normal clinical course of treatment by the treating doctor(neurologist). The rehabilitation would be patient specific and would likely be 4-8 weeks for each patient. The next session would only be introduced if the patient is able to reach the ceiling effect for the tasks of the current week. The patient would be called once a week. Each session would last for 45 minutes to an hour</P>
<P>2. Control group: no comprehensive neuropsychological rehabilitation with aphasia therapy would be given, however, the normal clinical course of treatment would continue by the treating doctor. The control group patients would be called the same number of times as the patients of the intervention group by maintaining a follow-up with the treating doctor (neurologist) and not the clinical neuropsychologist</P>
