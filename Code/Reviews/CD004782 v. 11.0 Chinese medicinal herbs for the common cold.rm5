<P>The common cold is the most widespread acute respiratory tract illness affecting all age groups. Many Chinese herbal medicines are used to treat this illness in China. Although we included 17 trials, involving 3212 patients, in this review, the risk of bias was so high that the evidence did not support using any Chinese herbal preparation(s) for the common cold. Well-designed clinical trials are required.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-02-03 22:08:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2008, issue 2), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (1966 to May 2008); EMBASE (1980 to May 2008); AMED (1985 to May 2008); the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBMdisc) (1978 to May 2008); and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1994 to May 2008).</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-01-08 09:40:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying the efficacy of Chinese medicinal herb(s) for the treatment of the common cold.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-02-04 20:35:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four review authors telephoned the original trial authors of the RCTs identified by our searches to verify the randomisation procedure. Two review authors extracted and analysed data from trials which met the inclusion criteria.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-05 17:04:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We found17 studies involving 3212 patients. The methods of 15 studies were at high risk of bias. In only two studies was the risk of bias low. Trials used "positive drugs", of which the efficacy was not known, as controls. Different Chinese herbal preparations were tested in nearly all trials. In only one trial was a Chinese herbal preparation tested twice. In seven trials, six herbal preparations were found to be more effective at enhancing recovery than the control preparations. In the other 10 studies, seven herbal preparations were not shown to be significantly different from the control. One study did not describe the difference between the intervention and control groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-02-04 20:42:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chinese herbal medicines may shorten the symptomatic phase in patients with the common cold. However, the lack of trials of low enough risk of bias, or using a placebo or a drug clearly identified as a control, means that we are uncertain enough to be unable to recommend any kind of Chinese medicinal herbs for the common cold.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-04 05:42:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-02-03 22:09:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>The common cold is the most widespread acute respiratory tract illness across all age groups. Young children suffer an average of six to eight colds per year, and adults an average of two to four colds per year (<LINK REF="REF-ALA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ALA 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kotton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotton 2003</LINK>). Colds are defined by the presence of a typical set of symptoms, but can be caused by more than 200 different viruses (<LINK REF="REF-Kotton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotton 2003</LINK>). Although the common cold is a mild and self-limiting illness, it can lead to complications if effective treatment is not commenced early enough. Some cases can lead to serious ear or sinus infections or may develop into pneumonia. Complications such as myocarditis or other connective tissue disorders can also occur.</P>
<P>Symptoms of the common cold typically include a runny nose, congestion, sneezing, weakened sense of taste and smell, scratchy throat and cough. These start developing in the first three days following infection. Infants and young children are more likely than adults and teens to also develop fever. Symptoms usually abate within seven to 10 days but some colds last longer, especially in children, the elderly and those with generally poor health (<LINK REF="REF-ALA-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ALA 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kotton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotton 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-02-04 05:42:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Treatment by a health care provider is not necessary. Symptoms may be treated in a variety of ways, including combination decongestant/antihistamines, warm salt gargles, lozenges and cough suppressants with dextromethorphan or codeine, or sipping hot chicken soup to increase the clearance of nasal mucous (<LINK REF="REF-Kotton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotton 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other Cochrane Reviews have published important findings in relation to treatment options for the common cold. The available evidence does not support the use of high doses of vitamin C for treating the common cold (<LINK REF="REF-Douglas-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Douglas 2004</LINK>). Likewise, there is insufficient evidence to support the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections with antibiotics, and an increased risk of adverse effects associated with antibiotic use in adult patients (<LINK REF="REF-Arroll-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arroll 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1999</LINK> found that treatment with zinc lozenges did not reduce the duration of cold symptoms. Antihistamines alone do not alleviate nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and sneezing, or subjective improvement of the common cold in either children or adults (<LINK REF="REF-De-Sutter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Sutter 2003</LINK>). Antihistamines cause adverse effects, especially sedation. Combinations of antihistamines with decongestants have been found to be ineffective in young children. It is unclear whether the effects on general recovery or nasal symptoms are clinically significant in older children and adults (<LINK REF="REF-De-Sutter-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Sutter 2003</LINK>). There are no effective licensed antiviral drugs for the common cold (<LINK REF="REF-Jefferson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jefferson 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many Chinese physicians believe that herbal medicines are effective in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of the common cold. Chinese herbal medicines are routinely used for most respiratory diseases in hospitals and by many Chinese people at home.</P>
<P>Chinese traditional medicine follows a particular theoretical and methodological pathway which assesses the cause, leading to diagnosis and treatment. Colds are categorised according to the different causes and symptoms, for example 'chills cold' and 'fever cold'. A 'chills cold' is so classified because the patients themselves feel cold and chilly; they also experience nasal obstruction, do not sweat, generally have a high temperature, develop a thin, white fur on the tongue, and experience a productive cough. 'Fever cold', on the other hand, is defined by the fact that patients do not feel chilly, have an elevated temperature, develop a thin and slightly yellow fur on the tongue, and experience a productive cough.</P>
<P>Herbs are indicated and dispensed in accordance with the symptoms or causes of the cold. For example Shi Gao (Gypsum Fibrosum) compounds can markedly abate fever (<LINK REF="REF-Deng-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deng 1998a</LINK>), and Chai Hu (Bupleurum chinesenes DC) and Jing Jie (Herba Schizonepetae) act as analgesics (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu 1998</LINK>). Ma Huang (Herba Ephedrae) can be used to induce perspiration and as an analgesic (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 1998</LINK>); while Ban Xia (Rhizoma Pinelliae) is dispensed to loosen sputum and suppress coughs (<LINK REF="REF-Xue-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xue 1998</LINK>). Fang Feng (Radix Saposhnikiviae) and Zhi Shu Ye (Folium Perillae) are given for what is commonly termed 'chill cough'; Jin Ying Hua (Flos Lonicerae) and Bo He (Herba Menthae) for 'fever cough'; and Fructus Gardeniae for fever and convulsions.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-02-03 22:11:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Modern pharmacological experiments demonstrate that some herbs, such as Jin Ying Hua (Flos Lonicerae) (<LINK REF="REF-Deng-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deng 1998b</LINK>), Yu Xin Chao (Herba Houttuyniae) (<LINK REF="REF-Deng-1998c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deng 1998c</LINK>), and Ban Lan Gen (Radix Isatidis) (<LINK REF="REF-Deng-1998d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deng 1998d</LINK>) do have antiviral or antibacterial functions. The principles of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) state that the ideal effect will result from using Chinese medicinal herbs according to its guidelines. Using the herbs incorrectly may cause harm rather than benefit; for example, the herbs for 'fever cold' should never be used for a 'chills cold'.</P>
<P>In China, more than 100 varieties of herbal preparation are used in the prevention and treatment of the common cold. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on treating colds each year (<LINK REF="REF-Zuo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zuo 2006</LINK>). Hundreds of clinical studies have been carried out on Chinese medicinal herbs for the common cold. These include five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 880 participants conducted on "Huang Zhi Hua oral preparation" (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-He-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yi-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Yi 1999a</LINK>). Almost all of these studies have reported a positive effect.</P>
<P>In high-income countries there is increasing public interest in, and use of, a wide range of therapies which lie outside the 'mainstream' or traditional Western medical practice. The recent House of Lords Select Committee report on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) heard that "we are now experiencing a rapid increase in the use of CAM across the Western World" (<LINK REF="REF-HLSC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">HLSC 2000</LINK>). Whether we support or criticise their effectiveness, herbal medicines are widely used.</P>
<P>There is evidence to indicate that not all herbs are risk-free. There are concerns about adverse events, including allergic reactions and Chinese herbal nephropathy (CHN) (<LINK REF="REF-Lampert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lampert 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lord-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lord 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nortier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nortier 2000</LINK>). Scientific evidence which indicates that Chinese herbal medicines are more effective than antibiotics in the treatment of acute respiratory infections is insufficient (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1998</LINK>).</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-02-03 22:11:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>To assess the efficacy and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs for the treatment of the common cold in children and adults.</P>
<P>Secondary objectives were to compare the efficacy of different Chinese medicinal herbs and record any related adverse events.</P>
<P>When making comparisons between groups intended for treatment with Chinese medicinal herbs and groups allocated to the placebo or other current treatment regimes, or various Chinese medicinal herbs, we tested the following hypotheses:</P>
<OL>
<LI>that there is no difference in the number of people cured by the end of the third day; and</LI>

<P>Children (17 years or younger) and adults (18 years or older) with the common cold.</P>
<P>The common cold is defined as acute inflammation of the nasal cavity, pharynx or larynx, caused by viral infection(s). Typical symptoms include runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, sore or scratchy throat, cough, fatigue and fever. Ideally, the diagnostic criteria for the common cold should be described in the trial. To allow for changes in classification and diagnostic criteria of the disease, the diagnosis should be established using the standard criteria valid at the time of conducting the trial. Changes in diagnostic criteria may have produced variability in the clinical characteristics of the patients included and the results obtained. We considered, documented and explored these changes in a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>We excluded colds caused by influenza in this review - symptoms always included headache, muscle ache and fatigue, high fever, usually a cough, sometimes a runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and itching eyes, nose, or throat. We also excluded acute bronchitis developing from a case of common cold. These illnesses are assessed in other Cochrane Reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wei-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wei 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>We excluded patients concurrently suffering from other infectious or febrile diseases, or both.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-02-04 16:23:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We assessed the risk of bias of each trial in terms of generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, uncompleted data and selective reporting; and classified them as 'low risk', 'moderate risk', or 'high risk' according to the guidelines of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 5.0.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) and as described in <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2007a</LINK>. There was no disagreement in this process.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>An adequate approach for generating allocation sequence with a low risk of selection bias should be by using a random numbers table or computer software, or other simple randomisation methods, for example, coin tossing or card shuffling. We considered a trial which only mentions 'random' but does not include a description of the approach used as a moderate risk of selection bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation sequence concealment</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of selection bias: adequate measures to conceal allocation sequence is defined as the person who generates an allocation sequence not recruiting the participants, for example, by central randomisation. Examples of concealing allocation sequences are using sealed opaque envelopes or storing allocation sequences in a locked computer.</P>
<P>Moderate risk of selection bias: where concealment of the allocation sequence is mentioned but the approach used is not reported.</P>
<P>High risk of selection bias: allocation concealment is reported inadequately, or is not performed at all.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Level of blinding</HEADING>
<P>Masking of both the participants and results assessor was considered as a low risk of performance or/and detection bias.</P>
<P>Single blinding of the results assessor was considered as a moderate risk of performance or/and detection bias. If single blinding was performed on the participants but not the results assessor, it was considered as a high risk of detection bias.</P>
<P>Non-blinding for detection of outcomes includes quality of life (QoL); adverse events were considered as a high risk of detection bias. Blinding was not considered necessary for reporting mortality.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incomplete outcome data: assessment for potential bias of exclusions and attrition</HEADING>
<P>Low risk of bias: trials where few exclusions and attrition are noted and an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis is possible.</P>
<P>Moderate risk of bias: trials which report the rate of exclusions or/and attrition to be about 10%, whatever ITT analysis is used.</P>
<P>High risk of bias: the rate of exclusion or/and attrition is higher than 15%, or there are wide differences in exclusions between groups, whatever ITT analysis is used.</P>

<P>We assessed heterogeneity by using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test with a 10% level of statistical significance and by using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to estimate the total variation across studies that was due to heterogeneity rather than chance.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-04 05:57:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Studies of Chinese herbal medicines for the common cold lack sufficient power to provide reliable estimates of their efficacy, due to poor study design and methodological quality.</P>
<P>Although Chinese herbal medicines as a treatment for the common cold and the methods of manufacturing these medicines are widely accepted in China, most of the constituents of the pharmacologically prepared drugs used in trials cannot be specified. This is in marked contrast to the pharmacological agents used in Western medicine, for which the chemical constituents, their quantities and the percentage of any impurities or contaminants are precisely known. In addition, the variation between different production batches of Western medicines is kept within specified limits. In contrast, variation between formulations and batches of pharmacological agents are inevitable in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), although the Chinese Government specifies the acceptable limits of variation. This variation is a factor that may contribute to any heterogeneity between different study results.</P>
<P>A large number of the trials initially identified claimed to be randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, after contacting the trial authors to request information regarding the method of randomisation used, we found that more than 95% of the authors misunderstood the concept of randomisation. In addition to this, some of the studies were conducted several years ago, and the trial authors may have forgotten the details of the methodology they employed. This could lead to a memory bias and undermine the veracity of information.</P>
<P>Some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ma-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ma 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1997</LINK>) used unequal arms in their design. Of these studies, <LINK REF="STD-Yu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1997</LINK> used a proportion of 3:1, and only 15 patients were included in the control group (43:15). However, consideration of the sample sizes was not reported in these trials, which makes it difficult to detect the differences between the two groups accurately. This may lead to a low test power.</P>
<P>Finally, we considered it pertinent to attempt to compare selected TCM signs in different groups of participants. TCM signs are difficult to quantify because they use subjective outcomes. For example, 'wu han' means that the participant feels cold whilst also having a fever, and this can be divided into low, medium and high categories, depending on the participants' subjective view. 'Mai xiang' measures the pulse; in TCM it is a complex and difficult technique to judge this accurately and often dependent upon on the physician's experience. TCM researchers and physicians should decide upon an accurate and consistent method of measuring TCM signs.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-02-04 16:48:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>None of the trials included in this review used a placebo as a control: instead "positive effect drugs" were selected. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2007</LINK>) mentioned that the rule of selecting the control drug was that "the effect was generally acknowledged". This may result in false positive findings, as a number of interventions are considered effective for the common cold, particularly if trial conductors know that a "positive" drug was used in the trial and the purpose of the study was to demonstrate the same effect as the control (so called "equal effect test"). For example, <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2005</LINK> compared two different forms of the same ingredient. In this case, "double blinding" would not be a valid term. This may result in false positive findings: if the trialist knows that a "positive" drug was used and the study was an "equal effect test" study, there is a potential risk that the outcome detectors will give same results for the two groups. For example, the purpose of <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2005</LINK> was to compare two different forms of the same drug; one was in a granule form and the other was in a capsule form and the trialists were aware of this. Therefore, there was a possibility that the results were not scrutinised carefully - particularly the subjective outcomes. In this case "double blinding" does not have any value.</P>
<P>We found that three trials claimed to have used 'double blinding' (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2000</LINK>) and one used 'single blinding' (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2004</LINK>). These studies found a similar recovery rate as the "positive" control. Two of the 'double blinding' studies (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2008a</LINK>) found the recovery rate in the intervention group to be higher than the control group by almost 50% (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK> RR 1.43; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2008a" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2008a</LINK> RR 1.59 and RR 1.67). However, <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK> lacked a description of how to verify the success of the blinding. Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 2000</LINK>) found the marked improvement rate in the intervention group to be higher than the control group (RR 1.69). For a disease like the common cold, which can go into spontaneous remission within one week, it is very difficult to find that the effect of a new drug is better than the "positive effect" of the control drugs. We have to point out that the possible reason that the relative risk is so high is that a high risk of selection bias, detection bias or both may have existed in the studies where the effects were similar or higher than "positive effect" controls.</P>
<P>Many trials incorrectly used drugs whose effects have not been demonstrated as a control. Thus it is difficult to determine the efficacy of the intervention by comparison. Where the intervention is equal in efficacy to the control, no conclusion can be made. For example, the average rate of recovery from the common cold was the same for those participants taking Jinlian Qinre capsules (intervention) and Jinlian Qinre granules (control) (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2005</LINK>). Since there is no evidence assessing the efficacy of Jinlian Qinre granules, we therefore cannot determine the efficacy of Jinlian Qinre capsules.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-02-04 01:05:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>We found the formulations of interventions in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ma-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ma 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2005</LINK>) were prepared by either the trial authors or colleagues in their hospital. Furthermore, in these five studies, the trial authors designed the interventions used and trial methods, making them open to bias towards the intervention. For example, the same intervention and control drugs were assessed in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2005</LINK>). The former demonstrated a similar efficacy of the two drugs, however the latter demonstrated that Shanhan Jiere Koufuye was more effective than Biaoshi Ganmao Chongji. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the formulation of Shanhan Jiere Koufuye was designed by the trial author's hospital and the reported number of full recovery of symptoms may have been underestimated in <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2005</LINK>. That is, <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2005</LINK> reported six recoveries from 30 cases, whilst <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2002</LINK> reported 17 recoveries from 30 participants. Selection bias, detection bias or both in the <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2005</LINK> trial could be an acceptable explanation for this discrepancy.</P>
<P>It is important that high quality trials should use a valid control group and a small number of preparations or interventions with known compositions, subgrouped by TCM criteria and standardised by Chinese or Western specialists in this field. Study designs and reporting should be improved in future research.</P>

<P>We could not find a well-designed trial to provide strong evidence to support the use of any Chinese traditional herbal medicines for the treatment of the common cold.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-02-04 01:06:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Further randomised clinical trials of herbal medicine for treating the common cold are required. It is essential that such trials have adequate methods of randomisation and allocation sequencing, and use a placebo or no treatment as a control. If a herbal medicine is a control, only those medicines which have a demonstrated effect on the common cold should be used. Blinding of participants, trial authors and outcome detectors is necessary. The design for calculating the sample size should be reported. The information on trial conduction should be reported in detail according to CONSORT (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) and CONSORT for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2007c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2007c</LINK>).</P>
