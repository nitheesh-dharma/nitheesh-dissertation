<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of using either a scalpel (knife) or electrosurgery in surgical operations on the abdomen.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>During abdominal surgery, surgeons need to cut through several layers of abdominal wall tissue before reaching the target operation site. To do this, surgeons can use either a sharp-bladed scalpel or an electrosurgical device that burns through tissue using a precise high-frequency current (known as electrosurgery). It is thought that, compared to using a scalpel, electrosurgery may result in less blood loss, more rapid tissue separation, and a lower risk of surgeons cutting themselves. We wanted to find out about the benefits and risks of these two techniques, and to compare them in terms of safety and other measures such as risk of infection and pain.</P>
<P>
<B>S</B>t<B>udy characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>In October 2016, we searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing scalpel-based surgery with electrosurgery for abdominal incisions (cuts). We found seven new trials for this update, allowing us to include a total of 16 RCTs involving 2769 participants. The majority of participants were adults, although one trial included children over the age of 15 years. There were slightly more female participants than male as some trials looked exclusively at caesarean sections (an operation to deliver a baby through a cut made in the abdomen and womb) and gynaecological (female reproductive system) surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There was no clear difference between scalpel and electrosurgery in the number of people whose wounds became infected. It is uncertain whether electrosurgery prevents wound breakdown (a complication that involves the breaking open of the surgical incision along the stitches/staples) following surgery, while the difference in blood loss and time required for incision between electrosurgery and scalpel was not clinically important. There was not enough information available to determine how electrosurgery compared with scalpel-based surgery in relation to time required for wounds to heal, amount of pain during healing, and appearance of scars. More studies need to be conducted before conclusions can be drawn as to whether one method is better for pain after an operation and time to wound healing following abdominal surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We judged the certainty of evidence to be moderate to very low for all outcomes. This is because the studies were often small with a low number of events and, in many cases, were not reported in a way that meant we could be sure they had been conducted robustly. The certainty of the evidence means that we cannot make conclusive statements and better quality research is needed to form stronger conclusions.</P>
<P>This plain language summary is up to date as of October 2016.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-05-03 11:03:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The first version of this review included studies published up to February 2012. In October 2016, for this first update, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase, EBSCO CINAHL Plus, and the registry for ongoing trials (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>). We did not apply date or language restrictions.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-05-03 11:03:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies considered in this analysis were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared electrosurgery to scalpel for creating abdominal incisions during major open abdominal surgery. Incisions could be any orientation (vertical, oblique, or transverse) and surgical setting (elective or emergency). Electrosurgical incisions were made through major layers of the abdominal wall, including subcutaneous tissue and the musculoaponeurosis (a sheet of connective tissue that attaches muscles), regardless of the technique used to incise the skin and peritoneum. Scalpel incisions were made through major layers of abdominal wall including skin, subcutaneous tissue, and musculoaponeurosis, regardless of the technique used to incise the abdominal peritoneum. Primary outcomes analysed were wound infection, time to wound healing, and wound dehiscence. Secondary outcomes were postoperative pain, wound incision time, wound-related blood loss, and adhesion or scar formation.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-05-03 11:03:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. When necessary, we contacted trial authors for missing data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data, and mean differences (MD) and 95% CI for continuous data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-06-06 10:52:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>The updated search found seven additional RCTs making a total of 16 included studies (2769 participants). All studies compared electrosurgery to scalpel and were considered in one comparison. Eleven studies, analysing 2178 participants, reported on wound infection. There was no clear difference in wound infections between electrosurgery and scalpel (7.7% for electrosurgery versus 7.4% for scalpel; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.54; low-certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and serious imprecision). None of the included studies reported time to wound healing.</P>
<P>It is uncertain whether electrosurgery decreases wound dehiscence compared to scalpel (2.7% for electrosurgery versus 2.4% for scalpel; RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.50; 1064 participants; 6 studies; very low-certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and very serious imprecision).</P>
<P>There was no clinically important difference in incision time between electrosurgery and scalpel (MD -45.74 seconds, 95% CI -88.41 to -3.07; 325 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded for serious imprecision). There was no clear difference in incision time per wound area between electrosurgery and scalpel (MD -0.58 seconds/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, 95% CI -1.26 to 0.09; 282 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence downgraded for very serious imprecision). </P>
<P>There was no clinically important difference in mean blood loss between electrosurgery and scalpel (MD -20.10 mL, 95% CI -28.16 to -12.05; 241 participants; 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded for serious imprecision). Two studies reported on mean wound-related blood loss per wound area; however, we were unable to pool the studies due to considerable heterogeneity. It was uncertain whether electrosurgery decreased wound-related blood loss per wound area. We could not reach a conclusion on the effects of the two interventions on pain and appearance of scars for various reasons such as small number of studies, insufficient data, the presence of conflicting data, and different measurement methods.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-06-06 10:52:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>The certainty of evidence was moderate to very low due to risk of bias and imprecise results. Low-certainty evidence shows no clear difference in wound infection between the scalpel and electrosurgery. There is a need for more research to determine the relative effectiveness of scalpel compared with electrosurgery for major abdominal incisions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-06-13 14:51:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published version in the Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 6) on 'Scalpel versus electrosurgery for abdominal incisions'.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-06-13 14:51:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>Millions of surgical procedures on the abdomen are conducted around the world each year. Most of these are considered 'major abdominal surgery', which require an incision to be made through abdominal wall layers including the skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia (aponeurosis), muscle, and peritoneum to reach the abdominal cavity. Conventionally, scalpels have been used to make such surgical incisions by manually cutting through tissue using a sharp blade. However, since its introduction in the early part of the 20th century, electrosurgery has been used as an alternative tool for creating incisions (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2015</LINK>). When creating a wound, key aims are to have a precise incision while minimising blood loss and the risk of surgical site infection (SSI). Based on the nature of the underlying conditions requiring surgery and degree of contamination, operative wounds are classified, with a progressive increase in risk of wound infection, into clean (class I), clean-contaminated (class II), contaminated (class III), and dirty or infected (class IV).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-05-03 11:18:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Electrosurgery involves manipulation of electrons through living tissue using an alternating current density sufficient to create heat within tissue cells to destroy them (<LINK REF="REF-Soderstrom-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soderstrom 2003</LINK>).
 
Two different surgical effects can be achieved with electrosurgery, namely cutting (of tissue) and coagulating. In the cutting mode, a continuous current rapidly produces extreme heat causing intracellular water to boil and cells to explode into steam (vaporisation). By moving the electrode quickly, more cells vaporise and the tissue is divided with minimal devitalised or charred tissue left along the margin of the cut surface. Thermal damage is minimal since heat evaporates as steam and is not conducted through the cut tissues, which would dry out the adjacent cells. In the coagulating mode, short bursts of electrical current are applied with a pause between each burst. As a result, the heat produced in the cells dries up the tissue but is not intense enough to evaporate intracellular water. The coagulating mode results in a greater degree of thermal damage and necrosis of adjacent tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Soderstrom-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soderstrom 2003</LINK>). Generally, if a surgeon chooses to make an incision using electrosurgery, it is recommended that the cutting mode is selected with a small tip or needle electrode that is activated just prior to making contact with the target tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Soderstrom-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soderstrom 2003</LINK>). However, many surgeons avoid using electrosurgery to divide the skin because of the concern of excessive scarring. More recently, a newer type of electrosurgery has been introduced which uses pulsed radiofrequency to produce a plasma-mediated discharge along the exposed rim of an insulated blade. This mechanism results in effective cutting with a blade, which remains near body temperature. Studies comparing the radiofrequency approach with conventional electrosurgery and scalpels for creating incisions in animal models have reported favourably for the radiofrequency approach in terms of wound tensile strength, scar formation, and minimising blood loss and tissue damage (<LINK REF="REF-Loh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2011</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-05-03 11:18:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The potential benefits of electrosurgery have been suggested to include reduced blood loss, dry and rapid separation of the tissue, and a possible decrease in the risk of accidental injury caused by the scalpel blade to operative personnel (<LINK REF="REF-Soderstrom-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soderstrom 2003</LINK>). However, there are concerns about the impact of electrosurgery on wound infection, wound healing, scarring, and adhesion formation, which have limited the use of electrosurgery for surgical wound creation. Data from animal studies have consistently shown that wounds created by electrosurgery (especially using the coagulation current) have more extensive tissue necrosis and inflammatory response, and a significant reduction in tensile strength during healing (<LINK REF="REF-Rappaport-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rappaport 1990</LINK>). In addition, the use of electrosurgery may be associated with increased adhesion formation (i.e. scar formation between two smooth gliding surfaces) between the incision and abdominal viscera due to an out-flowing of blood and formation of fibrin clots in the more traumatised animal tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Kumagai-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumagai 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Madden-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madden 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rappaport-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rappaport 1990</LINK>). In rat and guinea pig models, necrotic tissue is an important contributory factor to the increased susceptibility of electrosurgical incisions to infection, particularly in contaminated wounds (<LINK REF="REF-Keenan-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keenan 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kumagai-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumagai 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Madden-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madden 1970</LINK>). Additionally, the use of electrosurgery has been related to an increase in the incidence of bacteraemia and death (<LINK REF="REF-Kumagai-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumagai 1991</LINK>). However, more recently, these concerns have been lowered with new-generation electrosurgical instruments.</P>
<P>However, unlike animal studies which are executed under controlled conditions, there are many biological and environmental contributing factors that could affect outcomes from the use of electrosurgery in the clinical setting, although data are limited. One 10-year prospective observational study of 62,939 surgical wounds suggested that the risk of infection for wounds resulting from clean surgery (i.e. non-infective operative wounds with no inflammation, and none of the respiratory, alimentary, genitourinary tract, or the oropharyngeal cavity is entered) was similar for people with electrosurgery- and scalpel-generated surgical incisions (<LINK REF="REF-Cruse-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cruse 1980</LINK>), although the results to support this conclusion were not presented.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-05-03 11:18:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several prospective randomised trials have examined the effects of scalpel versus electrosurgery for wound creation on the abdomen, which have necessitated an update of the original version of this Cochrane Review which was published in 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-Charoenkwan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charoenkwan 2012</LINK>). We aimed to identify and assess relevant studies systematically to present a comprehensive summary of current evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of electrosurgery for making surgical incisions compared with scalpels. Importantly, this synthesis also involves assessment of evidence quality using the GRADE process (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2013</LINK>). Such an evidence synthesis is important in contributing to informed decision-making around the use of electrosurgery in practice. Current National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for the prevention of SSI do not recommend the use of electrosurgery; however, the recommendation was based on data available approximately 10 years ago (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>Methodological quality of the included trials was assessed using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The tool addresses six specific domains of potential bias: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and 'other issues'. Studies were judged to be at high, low, or unclear risk of bias for each of the domains. The methodological quality assessment is presented in the 'Risk of bias' section of the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table and summarised graphically.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2017-06-06 11:20:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>We displayed dichotomous data for each study as a risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, we expressed results from each study as a mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI. We planned to express time-to-event data (e.g. time-to-complete wound healing) as hazard ratios (HR) (with their 95% CI), in accordance with the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>). In future updates, if such studies do not report an HR, we plan to estimate this using other reported data, such as the numbers of events, with application of available statistical methods (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2013</LINK>). In the absence of these measures, if there are any studies in which all wounds healed, we will consider the mean or median time to healing without survival analysis as a valid outcome (i.e. if the trial authors regarded time to healing as a continuous measure because there was no censoring). In this review, we were unable to report time to wound healing as none of the studies met these criteria. </P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-05-22 10:37:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Assessment of heterogeneity comprised the initial assessment of clinical and methodological heterogeneity and the appropriateness of combining study results: that is, the degree to which the included studies varied in terms of participant, intervention, outcome, and characteristics such as length of follow-up. This assessment of clinical and methodological heterogeneity was supplemented by information regarding statistical heterogeneity of the results. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by visual inspection of the overlap of CIs on the forest plots alongside Chi<SUP>2</SUP> tests and quantified using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic thresholds were interpreted according to <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK> as follows: 0% to 40% (may not be important), 30% to 60% (moderate heterogeneity), 50% to 90% (substantial heterogeneity), and 75% to 100% (considerable heterogeneity).</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-09-12 16:01:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">

</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2017-06-07 13:05:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed statistical analyses in accordance with Cochrane guidelines using Review Manager 5 software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). For dichotomous data (e.g. proportion of wounds developing infection), we expressed results for each study as RR with a 95% CI. For continuous data, we expressed results from each study as MD with 95% CI, and combined for meta-analysis where appropriate. Since meta-analytic methods for continuous data assume that the underlying distribution of the measurements is normal, in instances where data were clearly skewed, and the results were reported in the publication as 'median' and 'range' with non-parametric tests of significance, we reported the results in narrative form. For a study which included participants undergoing thoracic surgery as well as those undergoing abdominal surgery, all participants were included in the analysis. For a study which included two clinically different abdominal procedures, the dichotomous data were included in meta-analyses as a single study, while continuous data were treated and included in meta-analyses as data from two separate studies. In terms of meta-analytical approach, when meta-analysis was considered viable in the presence of clinical heterogeneity (review author judgement) or there was evidence of statistical heterogeneity, or both, we used a random-effects model. We considered a fixed-effect approach only when clinical heterogeneity was thought to be minimal and statistical heterogeneity was estimated as non-statistically significant for the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> value and 0% for the I<SUP>2</SUP> assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Kontopantelis-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kontopantelis 2013</LINK>). This approach recognises that statistical assessments can miss potentially important between-study heterogeneity in small samples hence the preference for the more conservative random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-Kontopantelis-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kontopantelis 2013</LINK>). We decided against pooling studies with considerable heterogeneity (75% or more).<BR/>

<P>Two review authors (ZIE and KC) assessed the certainty of the evidence generated from the review according to GRADE methodology (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2013</LINK>). We presented the main results in a 'Summary of findings' table produced using <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro</LINK> software. The certainty of the evidence was initially considered to be high because of the study design (RCT). We subsequently downgraded this depending on whether there were study limitations (which we judged based on the risk of bias in studies which contributed at least 50% of the weight in the analysis), whether the results were inconsistent, imprecise, the evidence was indirect or there was publication bias.

There was no clinically important difference in mean incision time between electrosurgery and scalpel (MD -45.74 seconds, 95% CI -88.41 to -3.07; 325 participants; 4 studies; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 36%; random-effects model; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>), given the usual duration of the entire procedure that range from close to one hour in herniorrhaphy cases to several hours in others. The quality of the evidence was moderate. It was downgraded once for serious imprecision. In <LINK REF="STD-Dixon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dixon 1990</LINK> where incision time was considered separately for the two types of procedures, the MD was -36.00 seconds (95% CI -101.30 to 29.30) for herniorrhaphy cases and -152.00 seconds (95% CI -282.59 to -21.41) for cholecystectomy cases. </P>

The wound incision time was seven minutes in the electrosurgery group versus 10 minutes in the scalpel group (P value presented, however, no further information) (<LINK REF="STD-Elbohoty-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Elbohoty 2015</LINK>); 3.3 minutes for the electrosurgery group compared with 3.5 minutes for the scalpel group (no further information) (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK>); and six minutes for the electrosurgery group compared with five minutes for the scalpel group (P value presented, however, no further information) (<LINK REF="STD-Telfer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Telfer 1993</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Wound-related blood loss</HEADING>
<P>Six studies reported wound-related blood loss as mean, median, and mean per wound area.

Two studies reported on mean wound-related blood loss per wound area; however, we were unable to pool the studies due to considerable heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 95%). Therefore, it is uncertain whether electrosurgery decreases wound-related blood loss per wound area.

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-06-06 11:42:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>Sixteen RCTs met the inclusion criteria of this review. The studies recruited 2769 participants aged between 18 and 100 years with different surgical indications. There was no evident exclusion of particular patient groups from the included studies, therefore, the results of this study would apply to a wide range of people undergoing surgery requiring abdominal incision. However, due to the significant discrepancies in surgical indication, underlying pathology, surgical approach, surgical technique, surgeon type, and wound biology, the overall effects demonstrated in this review should be interpreted with caution. We encourage the reader to also examine specific included studies with surgical characteristics consistent with their particular interest. In addition, there was notable variation among studies with regard to the detailed application of the main (electrosurgery) and the comparison (scalpel) intervention for dividing specific layers of abdominal wall. Frequently, the assigned intervention was not the sole tool used for dividing all layers of the abdominal wall and both electrosurgery and scalpel were employed to divide different layers of the abdominal wall in cases assigned to one intervention. Most outcomes prespecified in the protocol were reported though we were unable to meta-analyse data on postoperative pain and scar formation. Time to wound healing was not reported. Note that post-hoc subgroup analysis comparing wound infection between the study groups in all strata of wound classification based on degree of contamination were carried out in an attempt to evaluate the effect of wound contamination on infection. However, wound classification was not consistently reported in most of the included studies. Other clinical factors that could affect wound outcomes such as body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, performance status, methods of wound closure, and surgeon's experience were not adequately addressed in the included studies and should be considered in the future studies.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-06-06 11:42:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>Following a GRADE assessment, the certainty of evidence was moderate to very low across the outcomes assessed. All the included studies were at high risk of bias mostly due to performance bias and 12 of these studies were at risk of bias for additional reasons. While participant blinding was achieved in a few studies, it would not have been feasible to blind the surgeons due to the nature of intervention. Nine of the 16 included studies reported blind outcome assessment while seven studies were at unclear risk of detection bias. As stated earlier, detection bias took precedence over performance bias when we downgraded evidence for risk of bias (see: <LINK TAG="BLINDING" TYPE="SECTION">Blinding (performance bias and detection bias)</LINK>). Almost all the studies (13/16: 81%) were at high or unclear risk of selection bias. Furthermore, there were many cases of selective reporting where study authors failed to report measures of variance and when contacted failed to provide details. We rarely downgraded for inconsistency as the meta-analyses had I<SUP>2 </SUP>values which suggested heterogeneity that was interpreted as either moderate or not important. However, we did not pool data for the wound-related blood loss per wound area outcome due to considerable heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 95%). All outcome results were imprecise due to small sample size or limited number of outcome events, or both.</P>
<P>There was no downgrading for indirectness as the included studies were in agreement with the review question. The only outcome assessed for publication bias was the wound infection outcome. A visual inspection of the funnel plot revealed no evidence of publication bias, therefore, the evidence was not downgraded for publication bias.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-06-13 15:03:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>We made a concerted effort to prevent biases during the review process by ensuring an extensive literature search and strict adherence to the published protocol. However, following the upgrade Review Manager 5 in recent years, new methods which were not previously considered were subsequently included in the review. These changes have been highlighted under the <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK> section. These additions only serve to ensure a more robust process and methodology, we do not therefore consider them to be of concern. <LINK REF="STD-Husnain-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Husnain 2006</LINK> met our inclusion criteria; however, this was one of a few studies which were not available on the journal website (<A HREF="http://www.jsp.org.pk">www.jsp.org.pk</A>). We contacted the journal editor several times and were assured that efforts would be made to retrieve and send the article; however, we did not receive it. Fifty percent of the included studies reported on postoperative pain yet we were unable to pool studies in a meta-analysis. Efforts to contact study authors to request missing data on measures of variance were unsuccessful (<LINK REF="STD-Kearns-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kearns 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siraj-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Siraj 2011</LINK>). The protocol was not specific with regards to which measure of postoperative pain and scar formation was preferred. We avoided selective reporting by extracting all available information for outcomes specified in the review protocol.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-06-13 15:05:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>The results of this review are in agreement with the NICE guidance published in 2008, which found no difference in SSI between electrosurgery and scalpel and does not recommend the use of electrosurgery for surgical incision (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Chrysos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chrysos 2005</LINK>, electrosurgery (65 participants) and scalpel (68 participants) incisions in tension-free inguinal herniorrhaphy were compared for wound complications (wound strength, wound infection), the requirement for postoperative analgesia, and wound blood loss. The two groups were comparable in terms of wound strength, infectious complications (totally absent), and wound blood loss. Participants in the electrosurgery group required less parenteral analgesia on the first postoperative day. A higher proportion of participants in the scalpel group continued to need oral analgesics on the second postoperative day compared with participants in the electrosurgery group. The findings concerning wound complications and postoperative pain (need for analgesics) were in line with our review results. This was a prospective study comparing electrosurgery and scalpel incisions in tension-free inguinal hernioplasty. Participants were allocated alternately to the intervention, so this was not true randomisation.</P>
<P>One cross-sectional study compared electrosurgery in coagulation mode (433 participants) with cold scalpel (531 participants) for severe wound complications in participants undergoing midline abdominal incision for uterine malignancies (<LINK REF="STD-Franchi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Franchi 2001</LINK>). There was a higher incidence of severe wound complications in the scalpel group (8/531 versus 1/433; P &lt; 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between groups after adjustment for confounding variables. These results support the safety of electrosurgery for making midline abdominal incisions.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-06-06 11:48:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gill Rizzello">
<P>There is currently insufficient evidence on the relative effectiveness of electrosurgery compared with scalpel in abdominal surgery. While current data suggest there may be no clear difference in wound infections between the treatments, the evidence is low certainty as estimates are imprecise and span estimates consistent with both benefits and harms. Given this, decision makers are likely to follow current local and national guidelines until further evidence is available.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-05-22 12:34:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a lack of high-quality evidence on the effect of scalpel compared to electrosurgery on abdominal incisions. If this is deemed an important question to decision makers, further randomised controlled trials in the area may be warranted. Such trials should assess outcomes such as time to complete wound healing. Since incomplete outcome reporting was an important limitation in this review, future trials should follow the CONSORT statement. The reporting of outcomes such as pain should be more standardised and reported at the same time points across studies (with measures of variance) to enable data pooling. Future studies should report on wound healing as time-to-event data, assess clinical factors potentially affecting wound outcomes, include adequate sample sizes, and ensure complete reporting of continuous outcomes with measures of variance. Furthermore, a study designed to address the effect of coagulating-mode electrosurgery would be worthwhile. </P>

<P>The title has been changed from 'Scalpel versus electrosurgery for abdominal incisions' to 'Scalpel versus electrosurgery for major abdominal incisions' in response to peer review feedback.</P>
<P>We have populated sections of the 'Methods' and 'Discussion' which were previously not available in the older version of Review Manager as follows: <LINK TAG="UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Unit of analysis issues</LINK>; <LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK>; <LINK TAG="BIAS_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of reporting biases</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK TAG="APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS" TYPE="SECTION">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</LINK>; <LINK TAG="POTENTIAL_BIASES" TYPE="SECTION">Potential biases in the review process</LINK>.</P>
<P>We intended to use 'length of hospital stay' to reflect 'time to wound healing'. However, 'time-to-complete wound healing' is usually expressed as hazard ratios (HR) (with their 95% confidence interval), in accordance with the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2011</LINK>). In future updates, if studies reporting time-to-event data (e.g. time to wound healing) do not report a HR, we plan to estimate this using other reported data, such as the numbers of events, with application of available statistical methods (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2013</LINK>). In the absence of these measures, if there are any studies in which all wounds healed, we will consider the mean or median time to healing without survival analysis as a valid outcome (i.e. if the trial authors regarded time to healing as a continuous measure because there was no censoring).</P>
<P>Following peer review feedback, we carried out a post hoc subgroup analysis on wound contamination.</P>
