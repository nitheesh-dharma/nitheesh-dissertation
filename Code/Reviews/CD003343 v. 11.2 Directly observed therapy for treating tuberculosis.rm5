<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-05-15 13:44:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This Cochrane Review summarises trials evaluating the effects of directly observed therapy (DOT) for treating people with tuberculosis (TB) or people on prophylaxis to prevent active disease compared to self-administered treatment. After searching for relevant trials up to 13 January 2015, we included 11 randomized controlled trials, enrolling 5662 people with TB, and conducted between 1995 and 2008.</P>
<P>
<B>What is DOT and how might it improve treatment outcomes for people with TB</B>
</P>
<P>DOT is one strategy to ensure that patients with TB take all their medication. An 'observer' acceptable to the patient and the health system observes the patient taking every dose of their medication, and records this for the health system to monitor.</P>
<P>The World Health Organization currently recommends that people with TB are treated for at least six months to achieve cure. These long durations of treatment can be difficult for patients to complete, especially once they are well and need to return to work. Failure to complete treatment can lead to relapse and even death in individuals, and also has important public health consequences, such as increased TB transmission and the development of drug resistance.</P>
<P>
<B>What the research says</B>
</P>
<P>Overall, cure and treatment completion in both self-treatment and DOT groups was low, and DOT did not substantially improve this. Small effects were seen in a subgroup of studies where the self-treatment group were monitored less frequently than the DOT group.</P>
<P>There is probably no difference in TB cure or treatment completion when the direct observation was conducted at home or at the clinic (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>). There is probably little or no difference in TB cure direct observation is conducted by a community health worker or family member (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>) and there may be little or no difference in treatment completion either (<I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Direct observation may have little or no effect on treatment completion in injection drug users (<I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>The authors conclude that DOT on its own may not offer the solution to poor adherence in people taking TB medication.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-13 15:43:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tuberculosis (TB) requires at least six months of treatment. If treatment is incomplete, patients may not be cured and drug resistance may develop. Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) is a specific strategy, endorsed by the World Health Organization, to improve adherence by requiring health workers, community volunteers or family members to observe and record patients taking each dose.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-05-13 15:43:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias of each included trial and extracted data. We compared interventions using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used a random-effects model if meta-analysis was appropriate but heterogeneity present (I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic &gt; 50%). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-28 14:03:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eleven trials including 5662 participants met the inclusion criteria. DOT was performed by a range of people (nurses, community health workers, family members or former TB patients) in a variety of settings (clinic, the patient's home or the home of a community volunteer).</P>
<P>
<B>DOT versus self-administered </B>
</P>
<P>Six trials from South Africa, Thailand, Taiwan, Pakistan and Australia compared DOT with self-administered therapy for treatment. Trials included DOT at home by family members, community health workers (who were usually supervised); DOT at home by health staff; and DOT at health facilities. TB cure was low with self-administration across all studies (range 41% to 67%), and direct observation did not substantially improve this (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27; five trials, 1645 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). In a subgroup analysis stratified by the frequency of contact between health services in the self-treatment arm, daily DOT may improve TB cure when compared to self-administered treatment where patients in the self-administered group only visited the clinic every month (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.25; two trials, 900 participants); but with contact in the control becoming more frequent, this small effect was not apparent (every two weeks: RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.12; one trial, 497 participants; every week: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.21; two trials, 248 participants).</P>
<P>Treatment completion showed a similar pattern, ranging from 59% to 78% in the self-treatment groups, and direct observation did not improve this (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.19; six trials, 1839 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<B>DOT at home versus DOT at health facility </B>
</P>
<P>In four trials that compared DOT at home by family members, or community health workers, with DOT by health workers at a health facility there was little or no difference in cure or treatment completion (cure: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.18, four trials, 1556 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>; treatment completion: RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.17, three trials, 1029 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<B>DOT by family member versus DOT by community health worker</B>
</P>
<P>Two trials compared DOT at home by family members with DOT at home by community health workers. There was also little or no difference in cure or treatment completion (cure: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21; two trials, 1493 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>; completion: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22; two trials, 1493 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<B>Specific patient categories</B>
</P>
<P>A trial of 300 intravenous drug users in the USA evaluated direct observation with no observation in TB prophylaxis to prevent active disease and showed little difference in treatment completion (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13; one trial, 300 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-15 13:47:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>From the existing trials, DOT did not provide a solution to poor adherence in TB treatment. Given the large resource and cost implications of DOT, policy makers might want to reconsider strategies that depend on direct observation. Other options might take into account financial and logistical barriers to care; approaches that motivate patients and staff; and defaulter follow-up.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-05-05 06:20:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of death in low- and middle-income countries despite the availability of effective treatments. In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there were 8.6 million people infected with TB, of whom 1.3 million died (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013</LINK>). Most people infected with <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</I> develop 'latent TB', where the bacteria are contained by the person's immune system and they do not develop symptoms. The risk of progression to active TB and development of symptoms is about 10% over the course of a lifetime (<LINK REF="REF-Frieden-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frieden 2003</LINK>), but co-infection with human immune deficiency virus (HIV) increases this risk to about 10% per year (<LINK REF="REF-Sepkowitz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sepkowitz 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The WHO currently recommends at least six months of treatment for active disease, and 12 months for latent TB (<LINK REF="REF-Smieja-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smieja 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). These long durations of treatment can be difficult for patients to adhere to, especially once they are well and need to return to work. Poor adherence can lead to relapse and even death in individuals, and also has important public health consequences, such as increased transmission and the development of drug resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Hirpa-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirpa 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moonan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moonan 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Munro-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munro 2007</LINK> synthesized evidence from qualitative studies among patients and health workers and identified eight factors that influence adherence:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Organization of treatment and care for TB patients.</LI>
<LI>Interpretation of illness and wellness by the patient.</LI>
<LI>Financial cost.</LI>
<LI>Patient knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about treatment.</LI>
<LI>Law and immigration status.</LI>
<LI>Gender and substance abuse.</LI>
<LI>Drug side effects.</LI>
<LI>Influence of the family, community and peers.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We adapted an existing conceptual framework by <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Boogaard-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Boogaard 2012</LINK> to develop a model for understanding approaches to improving adherence (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).There are health system level barriers (staff, inconvenient location, expensive and a poorly organized healthcare system) and personal level barriers (stigmatisation, poverty, competing demands and health beliefs) to adherence and the patient has to work through these barriers in order to be adherent. Healthcare workers have devised several strategies targeted at some of the key barriers to improve adherence, some of which are addressed by Cochrane Reviews:</P>

<LI>Reminder systems and late patient tracers in the diagnosis and management of TB (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2008</LINK>).</LI>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-05-05 12:03:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>'Directly observed therapy' (DOT) is one component of a wider WHO strategy called 'Directly Observed Therapy Short course' (DOTS). This strategy incorporates wide ranging health system improvements, political commitment to improving TB programmes, improved TB laboratory services, free TB drugs for all TB patients, and accurate documentation and monitoring of TB diagnosis and treatment outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). The DOT component is an attempt to improve adherence by active monitoring and recording of the consumption of each and every drug dose by an 'observer' acceptable to the patient and the health system (<LINK REF="REF-Hopewell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopewell 2006</LINK>). This approach was first adopted in studies in Madras, India and Hong Kong as early as the 1960s (<LINK REF="REF-Bayer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bayer 1995</LINK>), and is now considered a core component of TB programmes by the WHO to ensure cure and prevent the emergence of drug resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Chien-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chien 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirpa-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirpa 2013</LINK>). Proponents of DOT argue that the close monitoring has a social effect and acts as a peer pressure which leads to behavior change towards improved adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Macq-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macq 2003</LINK>) and it has strong proponents (<LINK REF="REF-Chaulk-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaulk 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frieden-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frieden 2007</LINK>). However, to opponents it has been seen as a coercive model which leaves the patient as a passive recipient of therapy thereby eroding the gains made in involving patients in management of their own health (<LINK REF="STD-Zwarenstein-1998-ZAF" TYPE="STUDY">Zwarenstein 1998 ZAF</LINK>).</P>
<P>The initial Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Volmink-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volmink 1997</LINK>) and subsequent updates (<LINK REF="REF-Volmink-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volmink 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Volmink-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volmink 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Volmink-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volmink 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Volmink-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volmink 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Volmink-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volmink 2007</LINK>) challenged the dogma that DOT improved cure and thus helped prevent drug resistance developing. The debate has continued, with some even advocating for a shift of resources away from DOT programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Barbara-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbara 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gross-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moonan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moonan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pasipanodya-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pasipanodya 2013</LINK>). There are also debates as to the best delivery of DOT, for example, should it be through healthcare workers or family members (<LINK REF="REF-Anuwatnonthakate-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anuwatnonthakate 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dick-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dick 2005</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-05-28 13:56:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Full implementation of DOT requires considerable resources. For example, in Pakistan it has been shown that direct observation at a health facility costs two times more than self-supervision (USD310 versus USD164). Therefore, it is important to evaluate the effects in order to inform decisions about whether the benefits are worth investing in (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2003</LINK>). This Cochrane Review is an update of <LINK REF="REF-Volmink-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volmink 2007</LINK>.</P>

In one trial participants were allowed to choose either a healthcare worker, a community health worker or a family member (<LINK REF="STD-Kamolratanakul-1999-THA" TYPE="STUDY">Kamolratanakul 1999 THA</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall TB cure was low with self-administered therapy, ranging from 41% to 69% across trials, but on average this did not substantially improve with DOT (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27; five trials, 1645 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). However, there was moderate statistical heterogeneity between trials (I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic = 68%; P = 0.01), with two trials finding benefits which reached standard levels of statistical significance (<LINK REF="STD-Kamolratanakul-1999-THA" TYPE="STUDY">Kamolratanakul 1999 THA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2008-TWN" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2008 TWN</LINK>). These differential effects may be explained by differences in the intensity of follow-up between the intervention and control arms (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kamolratanakul-1999-THA" TYPE="STUDY">Kamolratanakul 1999 THA</LINK> is the largest trial of DOT to date and found a higher TB cure with the intervention (76% versus 67%; RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.24; one trial, 836 participants). This trial had the least supervised control group (patients picked up their medication monthly), and one of the most intensely supervised intervention groups (doses were directly observed daily by a choice of health worker, community health worker or family member, and a health worker visited the patient at home every two weeks to check on adherence). This difference in intensity was similar in the second trial showing a difference (94% versus 69%; RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.75; one trial, 64 participants), but this trial was small and underpowered to have full confidence in this effect (<LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-2008-TWN" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 2008 TWN</LINK>).</P>
<P>Similarly, TB treatment completion ranged from 59% to 78% in those allocated to self-administration, and on average did not substantially improve with DOT (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.19; six trials, 1839 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).

<P>Treatment completion ranged from 62% to 85% in those being observed at home and between 57% and 83% in clinic observation.

<P>One trial, <LINK REF="STD-Lwilla-2003-TZA" TYPE="STUDY">Lwilla 2003 TZA</LINK>, had more intense supervision of the observer than the other three trials.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wandwalo-2004-TZA" TYPE="STUDY">Wandwalo 2004 TZA</LINK> had high completion rates (85% in home and 83% in clinic observation arm) but the cure rates were quite low in either arm (43% in both arms).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Community observed versus family observed</HEADING>
<P>Two trials compared community health worker based observation with family based observation (<LINK REF="STD-Newell-2006-NPL" TYPE="STUDY">Newell 2006 NPL</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wright-2004-SWZ" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2004 SWZ</LINK>). The trials are described in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>The Nepal trial, <LINK REF="STD-Newell-2006-NPL" TYPE="STUDY">Newell 2006 NPL</LINK>, had higher cure rates across the two arms (85% for community and 89% for family observed) compared with <LINK REF="STD-Wright-2004-SWZ" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2004 SWZ</LINK> (68% for community and 61% for family observed). There was little or no difference between community and family observation (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21; two trials, 1493 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). However there was high statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 86%; P = 0.009).</P>
<P>Similarly, for the completion of treatment outcome <LINK REF="STD-Newell-2006-NPL" TYPE="STUDY">Newell 2006 NPL</LINK> had higher rates across the two arms (96% in both arms) compared with <LINK REF="STD-Wright-2004-SWZ" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2004 SWZ</LINK> (74% for community and 67% for family observed). There was little or no difference between community and family observation (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22; two trials, 1493 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-28 13:58:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>TB cure and treatment completion were low with self-administered therapy in these trials, and direct observation did not substantially improve this. Positive effects with direct observation were seen in two trials where patients in the control group were only seen in clinic once a month, but not in the three trials where the controls were seen more frequently (every one or two weeks).</P>
<P>Trials comparing home observation (community observer or family observer) to clinic or healthcare worker led observation did not show any difference in TB cure or treatment completion. Within home-based direct observation, there were no differences between direct observation by a family member and direct observation by a community health worker.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-05-28 13:58:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This Cochrane Review includes trials from both high- and low-burden countries, conducted between 1994 and 2008. Direct observation was implemented in line with current recommendations, and the findings remain applicable to TB treatment programmes today.</P>
<P>Cure and treatment completion with self-administered treatment were low in these trials, consistent with the outcomes seen in TB programmes at the time, and consequently it is remarkable that direct observation failed to substantially improve these.</P>
<P>One interpretation, offered by <LINK REF="REF-Frieden-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frieden 2007</LINK>, is that these trials failed to implement direct observation effectively. This interpretation seems unreasonable to us, as the authors of the included trials did what they could to implement direct observation, and it may even be harder to implement, and less successful, outside of a clinical trial . Alternative interpretations are that the health systems were struggling to deliver TB treatment, and direct observation on its own did not resolve these underlying issues, or that TB patients experience financial or logistical barriers to compliance with direct observation. For example, it may cost patients money if they have to visit a health facility as was the case in <LINK REF="STD-Walley-2001-PAK" TYPE="STUDY">Walley 2001 PAK</LINK>.</P>
<P>Direct observation as a strategy is still debated in TB and other chronic diseases. These debates and the findings of this review and others are important given the often huge resource implications of implementing a direct observation therapy programme. In two studies conducted in Brazil to evaluate the cost effectiveness of direct observation strategy; one reported a doubling of indirect costs to the patient compared to self-administered therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Mohan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohan 2007</LINK>) while the other reported an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of USD6616 per completed direct observed treatment compared to self-administered therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Steffen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steffen 2010</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-05-28 13:58:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of this Cochrane Review are similar to the findings of a meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Pasipanodya-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pasipanodya 2013</LINK>, who reported no difference between DOT and self-administered treatment in terms of reduction in microbiological failure, adverse drug reactions acquired resistance and relapses. The meta-analysis included ten studies, five RCTs and five observational studies. However, it is worth noting that the included trials were quite heterogenous for a meta-analysis, the quality scales used were quite unclear and their findings were probably influenced by one observational study.</P>
<P>In their clinical review, <LINK REF="REF-Chan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2002</LINK> reported that direct observation is essential and effective for treatment and, by extension, TB elimination. The review was not systematic and mainly looked at areas where DOT has been done in conjunction with other interventions. It is probable that the other interventions or inputs, rather than specifically observing a patient as they take their medication, were beneficial for benefit, as highlighted by <LINK REF="REF-Volmink-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volmink 2000b</LINK>. A review by <LINK REF="REF-Tian-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tian 2014</LINK> reported that direct observation at a clinic was not more effective than self-treatment; but that community direct observation may be, with no difference detected between family and non-family direct observation. The review did not assess the inputs and associated supervision to the extent that we did in this Cochrane Review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Ford-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2009</LINK>, a review of direct observation in HIV therapy, also reported no effect on virological suppression. Though it might be argued that the therapy of these two diseases is different given that TB is for a finite duration whereas HIV is lifelong and thus adherence issues are different.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-05-12 08:46:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available evidence indicates that direct observation, even when supervised by health staff, does not resolve poor adherence in TB treatment. Given the huge cost implications of direct observation, policy makers therefore might want to rethink their strategies for improving adherence. It is probably worthwhile in considering financial and logistical barriers to care, motivating patients and staff, and enhancing defaulter tracing mechanisms.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-05-05 08:23:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The lack of effects of direct observation in improving cure and completion rates is surprising but reflects the complexity of adherence. Further research in well functioning health systems is needed to assess alternative and complementary strategies to direct observation. Qualitative work focusing on defaulters, where defaulter mechanisms exists and how clinicians interact with patients would especially be important. Evaluation of the cost of DOT for patients and providers would also help in properly assessing these strategies.</P>
