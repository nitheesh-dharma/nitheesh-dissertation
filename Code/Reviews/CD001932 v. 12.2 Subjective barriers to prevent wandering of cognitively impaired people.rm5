<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>No evidence that subjective barriers prevent wandering of cognitively impaired people</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Cognitive impairment is part of the clinical syndrome of dementia which is due to brain disorder, often progressive and irreversible. Wandering of cognitively impaired people presents risks, and places additional demands on carers. Traditional measures to reduce wandering include drugs, restraints, locked doors and other barriers, but these can be harmful. Subjective barriers (that appear as an obstruction only to those who are cognitively impaired) may provide an inexpensive, safe, effective and ethical alternative. They include mirrors, floor stripes and camouflage of door furniture. The review found no evidence so far that subjective barriers prevent wandering and could not exclude the possibility that such barriers cause psychological harm. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>People with dementia often wander, at times putting themselves at risk and presenting challenges to carers and institutional staff. Traditional interventions to prevent wandering include restraint, drugs and locked doors. Cognitively impaired people may respond to environmental stimuli (sounds, images, smells) in ways distinct from healthy people. This has led to trials of visual and other selective barriers (such as mirrors, camouflage, grids/stripes of tape) that may reduce wandering. <BR/>
</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>We assess the effect of subjective exit modifications on the wandering behaviour of cognitively impaired people. The second objective is to inform the direction and methods of future research.</P>

<P>The trials were identified from a searches of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources on 9 March 2009 using the terms: exit*, wander*, camouflage, bars, stripe*, grid*, floor*, door*, barrier*, elopement, ambulat*</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled trials provide the highest quality evidence, but interrupted time series are also considered as they may contribute useful information. </P>
<P>Participants are people with dementia or cognitive impairment who wander, of any age, and in any care environment - hospital, other institution, or their own home.</P>
<P>Interventions comprise exit modifications that aim to function as subjective barriers to prevent the wandering of cognitively impaired people. Locks, physical restraints, electronic tagging and other types of barrier are not included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The criteria for inclusion or exclusion of studies are applied independently by two reviewers. All outcomes that are meaningful to people making decisions about the care of wanderers are recorded. These include the number of exits or carer interventions, resource use, acceptability of the intervention and the effects on carer and wanderer (anxiety or distress). Heterogeneity of clinical area, of study design and of intervention was substantial.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>No RCTs or controlled trials were found. The other experimental studies that we identified were unsatisfactory. Most were vulnerable to bias, particularly performance bias; most did not classify patients according to type or severity of dementia; in all studies, outcomes were measured only in terms of wandering frequency rather than more broadly in terms of quality of life, resource use, anxiety and distress; no studies included patients with delirium; no studies were based in patients' homes.<BR/>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-03-30 16:07:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-03-30 16:06:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Wandering by people with dementia and cognitive impairment is common (<LINK REF="REF-Hope-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hope 1997</LINK>). A clear definition is lacking although several typologies have been suggested. Wandering is not a single, simple behaviour and wanderers are not all alike (<LINK REF="REF-Hope-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hope 1994</LINK>); people may wander for different reasons, in different ways and with differing results. Wandering may be problematic to both carer and patient, to the carer alone or to the patient alone. Wanderers may stray and be at risk of harm or death through injury, exposure or omitted treatments. This may cause anxiety and distress in both carer and wanderer. Problem wandering by people living in their own home may lead to placement in institutional care. However, wandering may be beneficial to the patient (meeting a need to spend time alone, or to relieve boredom) and to the carer (for example daytime wandering may reduce nocturnal wandering).<BR/>
<BR/>Traditional responses to wandering include human restraint, physical restraints (Buxton chairs, tethers), drugs, alarms, and the locking of doors. Frequency and method of restraint vary between nations, but there are trends towards minimising their use. Physical restraint and drugs are associated with higher risk of pressure sores, infection, sedation, falls and psychological consequences such as agitation, anxiety and violence. Closure of doors, with or without locking, is often unacceptable because of fire risk or the need for unimpeded access or exit. Exit alarms are disruptive and may be distressing; false alarms are wasteful of staff time. Furthermore, traditional responses have high direct and indirect financial costs. None of these traditional responses are satisfactory. An ideal barrier would not limit other non-problematic behaviour of the wanderer, would involve little staff monitoring or training, would allow a range of motion to occur, would be relatively inexpensive and not harmful to the wanderer or others (<LINK REF="STD-Hussian-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hussian 1987</LINK>). In addition, it would not lead to anxiety or distress amongst wanderers or others who wish to exit, and supervised passage of the wanderer (for example in an emergency) would be unimpeded, as would passage of the occasional visitor.</P>
<P>Cognitively impaired people may respond to modification of exits differently from those who are unimpaired. Visual, thermal or other stimuli may be perceived as absolute or relatively stronger barriers to exit than is rationally the case. Specifically, it has been claimed that visual agnosia may result in the interpretation of two-dimensional floor grids or bars as three-dimensional and therefore representing a physical barrier to exit (<LINK REF="STD-Hussian-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hussian 1987</LINK>), and that superficial modifications to doors, such as the concealment of door handles, may selectively disguise exits. This review examines systematically the evidence supporting these interventions.</P>
<P>Exit modification should form part of a holistic approach to problem wandering. This may include the identification and definition of other problems in the individual case, preventative activities such as exercise classes or occupational therapies and improved communication between carer and wanderer (<LINK REF="REF-Rader-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rader 1987</LINK>).<BR/>

</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Participants are people with acquired cognitive impairment who wander, including people: <BR/>1. with dementia, either unclassified or classified according to the major subtypes of vascular, Alzheimer's, mixed (vascular and Alzheimer's) and Lewy Body, as well as people who are chronically cognitively impaired but do not fulfil the accepted criteria for the classification of dementia. <BR/>2. with a syndrome of acute cognitive impairment (delirium), whether or not there is evidence of pre-existing chronic cognitive impairment.</P>
<P>Studies are considered if diagnostic criteria such as DSM (<LINK REF="REF-DSM-IV" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM IV</LINK>) or ICD (<LINK REF="REF-ICD-10" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICD 10</LINK>) or equivalents are rigorously applied or, less adequately, where a description of patient assessment clearly indicates the presence of acquired cognitive impairment. Studies applying the operational definitions 'cerebral insufficiency' or 'cerebral or senile deterioration', present in the literature during the 1960s and 1970s, are considered if they meet these criteria. </P>
<P>There is no consensus in the literature about what wandering is or how to measure it. Some authors have divided wandering into a number of subcategories (for example <LINK REF="REF-Hope-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hope 1994</LINK>). The problem remains, however, that categories overlap and that wandering is a complicated and multifaceted phenomenon. In this review rigorous definition and characterisation of participants' wandering behaviour(s) is not required. However, this is an area meriting further research, and later reviews may apply more demanding criteria. </P>
<P>Studies are not excluded on the grounds of participants' age or care environment (hospital, residential home or nursing home).</P>

<I>The Cochrane Library,</I> MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, many ongoing trial databases and other grey literature sources were searched separately on 9 March 2009 for the latest records. The search terms used to identify relevant controlled trials on dementia, Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment for the Group's Specialized Register can be found in the Group's module on <I>The Cochrane Library</I>. These search terms were combined with the following search terms and adapted for each database, where appropriate: exit*, wander*, camouflage, bars, stripe*, grid*, floor*, door*, barrier*, elopement, ambulat*.

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The search for trials was performed by one reviewer (DH). Both JDP and DH read the abstracts (or title if abstract not available) of all trials and reviews and discarded irrelevant publications to create a pool of relevant articles. The pools were merged and these articles obtained. After the potential trials are retrieved, two reviewers (JDP and DH) independently apply the inclusion/exclusion criteria to the full report. The reviewers are not blinded to the names of the authors, institutions or journal of publication. Disagreements about study inclusion are resolved by discussion. </P>
<P>The criteria used to assess the methodological quality of studies are those used by the Cochrane EPOC group (see Group Editorial information). Assessment of articles using these criteria provides a score indicating the methodological quality of each trial. The total score is intended to give a rapid indication of the methodological quality, provide a guide to the shortcomings of the studies and to assist in making recommendations about future research. Study quality is assessed independently by two reviewers (JDP and DH). Differences are resolved by discussion. Studies that are seriously compromised by weaknesses in design, conduct or analysis are excluded. Details of these excluded studies are reported in the excluded trials table and discussed in the narrative section of the review.</P>
<P>Descriptive characteristics and quantitative data on the outcomes of interest are extracted independently by two reviewers (JDP and DH) without masking of study site or author. All outcomes that are meaningful to people making decisions about the care of wanderers are extracted (see Types of outcome measures, above). <BR/> </P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-03-30 16:07:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>There is no evidence to resolve whether subjective barriers prevent wandering by cognitively impaired people.</P>
<P>Visual and other barriers tested in the excluded studies included contrasting tape (grid or stripes) applied to door (<LINK REF="STD-Namazi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Namazi 1989</LINK>) or floor (<LINK REF="STD-Chafetz-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chafetz 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hewawasam-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Hewawasam 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hewawasam-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Hewawasam 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hussian-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hussian 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Namazi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Namazi 1989</LINK>), mirrors (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1996</LINK>) and cloth panels (to conceal door or doorknob: <LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1996</LINK>). Many studies examined more than one intervention simultaneously (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 1998</LINK> used a blind and a cloth barrier). Others studied a sequence of single interventions with no assessment of the magnitude of learning effects. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Hussian-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hussian 1987</LINK> used progressively increasing numbers of floor stripes in different orientations. The description of the methods was at times unclear or incomplete (for example <LINK REF="STD-Hussian-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hussian 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>These experimental studies were forms of interrupted time series, and all were of unsatisfactory quality. Studies were vulnerable to bias, particularly performance bias. All studies were small (between 4 and 30 participants) and the interventions were heterogeneous. Most studies did not classify patients according to type or severity of dementia. Participants' characteristics were poorly described and/or evaluated. Age, sex, type and severity of dementia and diagnostic method were often not specified. Only one study examined for presence of specific cognitive impairment such as visual agnosia (<LINK REF="STD-Namazi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Namazi 1989</LINK>). No studies included patients with delirium. All studies took place in an institutional environment (care home or hospital). Definitions of wandering were omitted and some studies included non-wandering patients (<LINK REF="STD-Chafetz-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chafetz 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Outcomes were described narrowly in terms of increased or decreased number of exits. No study attempted a broader assessment to include quality of life issues, psychological aspects (anxiety or depression) or carer focused outcomes (time, stress, placement decision making) or cost evaluation. All outcomes were assessed in the short term only (days or a few weeks). Longer term evaluations would permit an assessment of whether efficacy reduces as the patient becomes more familiar with the device. None of the studies evaluated the effects on non-cognitively impaired people, particularly those unfamiliar with the barrier such as hospital visitors.</P>
<P>In institutions as well as at home, the availability of financial and human resources may be important concerns. Subjective barriers, if proven to be effective and safe, could help to reduce the resources committed to management of wandering, with potential benefits to patient and carer. However, subjective barriers, even if effective, may not be the intervention of choice. For example, other interventions such as occupational therapies may be both effective and enjoyable. Furthermore, ethical issues related to subjective barriers must be considered. Very few authors discuss the possible positive, therapeutic aspect of wandering: patients may need privacy, may want to move because of boredom or discomfort, and exercise may deliver physical, emotional and other benefits (for example improved sleep at night). Subjective barriers may cause fear, anxiety or bemusement.</P>
<P>An increasing elderly population - and increases in the number of cognitively impaired people - and the realities of restricted health resources suggest that we should continue to develop and evaluate subjective barriers as methods to prevent wandering at home or in institutions. Subjective barriers may be preferable to more traditional solutions in spite of the drawbacks mentioned above. To that end new studies, properly designed and executed, should be performed.<BR/>
</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence so far that subjective barriers reduce wandering, and the possibility of harm (particularly psychological distress) cannot be excluded. If used, then subjective barriers should form part of a diverse approach to problem wandering, which may include the identification and definition of the problem in the individual, preventative activities such as exercise classes or occupational therapies, and improved communication between carer and wanderer.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Fundamental and applied research in this area needs to be developed. Anecdotal evidence, a number of case studies and a few small experimental studies of modest quality have been published by a number of authors from many countries to suggest the topic is worth pursuing further.</P>
<P>There is a need for high quality trials of subjective barriers. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide the highest quality of evidence. In the home setting these are feasible but have not been done. However, within institutions randomization of individuals would be costly and impractical; cluster randomization (of wards or institutions) is a realistic but currently unexplored alternative. Where - perhaps for local reasons - RCTs are impractical, useful evidence may be obtained from well designed and implemented non-randomized studies. These include controlled trials and time series. Controlled trials are prone to selection bias. Time series are straightforward to implement, and most of the experimental studies so far performed are of this design. However, this study type is vulnerable to bias. Assessment of outcome should be objective and if possible observers should be blinded to the nature of the intervention; the presence of observers or monitoring equipment should be obscured if possible (as this may alter behaviour); changes in behaviour of carers and/or other staff in response to the intervention should be measured and reported; disease progression during the study should be monitored; other changes - in patients, staff or care environment - should be avoided where possible; serial interventions may result in learning effects which should be measured (for example by a second baseline period). <BR/> <BR/>Studies have been small, heterogeneous and have examined multiple hypotheses. Future studies should examine single interventions, including sufficient participants to enable confident conclusions to be drawn. Multiple interventions should be evaluated only if the size of the study justifies this and bias due to learning effects is minimised and its magnitude assessed. Power calculations should be performed early in the planning stage. Assessment at the point of enrolment should include type and severity of cognitive impairment. Studies should state the diagnostic criteria and process. </P>
<P>Researchers must be sensitive to the possibility of harm (for example anxiety and distress) and should consider assessing broad carer and patient-focused outcomes (cost of care, acceptability of intervention and quality of life). Studies should measure longer term outcomes, as learning effects may reduce the effectiveness of barriers over time. </P>
<P>It is hoped that updates of this review will be able to report more conclusive evidence of the efficacy of subjective barriers and the basic science underlying them.</P>
