<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-11-05 22:27:17 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Garlic is popularly believed to be useful for the common cold. This belief is based on traditional use and some laboratory evidence that garlic has antibacterial and antiviral properties. On average, adults have two to four common colds per year.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to the 7 August 2014. Of the eight studies identified, only one fulfilled the criteria for the review. This study assessed 146 participants over a three-month period. Half the participants took a placebo tablet and half took a garlic tablet during this time. The participants then wrote in a diary when they had symptoms of a cold.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The included study found that people who took garlic every day for three months (instead of a placebo) had fewer colds. That is, over the three-month period, there were 24 occurrences of the common cold in the garlic group, compared to 65 in the placebo group. When participants experienced a cold, the length of illness was similar in both groups (4.63 versus 5.63 days).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>More participants in the garlic group (four) than the placebo group (one) noted a smell when burping, so it is possible that blinding of participants was not adequate. However, other potential biases were well controlled. The only included study is directly relevant to the review question. Although the trial is small, there were enough participants to provide precise, reliable results. There is no evidence that results were selectively reported. However, this was possible as the outcomes do not appear to have been decided in advance. Considering the financial incentive for supplement companies to produce positive trials, it is also possible that trials that showed no effect of garlic were never published. Overall, the quality of the evidence is moderate.</P>
<P>
<B>Side effects</B>
</P>
<P>Possible side effects in this small trial included odour and a skin rash. More information is needed about the possible side effects of garlic.</P>

<P>Garlic is alleged to have antimicrobial and antiviral properties that relieve the common cold, among other beneficial effects. There is widespread usage of garlic supplements. The common cold is associated with significant morbidity and economic consequences. On average, children have six to eight colds per year and adults have two to four.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-05 22:30:18 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this updated review, we identified eight trials as potentially relevant from our searches. Again, only one trial met the inclusion criteria. This trial randomly assigned 146 participants to either a garlic supplement (with 180 mg of allicin content) or a placebo (once daily) for 12 weeks. The trial reported 24 occurrences of the common cold in the garlic intervention group compared with 65 in the placebo group (P value &lt; 0.001), resulting in fewer days of illness in the garlic group compared with the placebo group (111 versus 366). The number of days to recovery from an occurrence of the common cold was similar in both groups (4.63 versus 5.63). Only one trial met the inclusion criteria, therefore limited conclusions can be drawn. The trial relied on self reported episodes of the common cold but was of reasonable quality in terms of randomisation and allocation concealment. Adverse effects included rash and odour.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-24 21:39:47 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>There is insufficient clinical trial evidence regarding the effects of garlic in preventing or treating the common cold. A single trial suggested that garlic may prevent occurrences of the common cold but more studies are needed to validate this finding. Claims of effectiveness appear to rely largely on poor-quality evidence.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-11-10 19:52:48 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-08-28 07:59:19 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The common cold is a heterogenous group of diseases caused by numerous viruses that belong to several different families (<LINK REF="REF-Heikkinen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkinen 2003</LINK>). The viruses include picornaviruses (notably, rhinoviruses and enteroviruses), coronaviruses, adenoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, influenza viruses, metapneumoviruses and respiratory syncytial viruses (<LINK REF="REF-Fendrick-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fendrick 2003</LINK>). They all cause the common symptoms of nasal stuffiness and discharge, sneezing, sore throat and cough. Other symptoms may also include hoarseness, headache, malaise and lethargy (<LINK REF="REF-Heikkinen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkinen 2003</LINK>). The transmission of these viruses occurs via contact with secretions or small- or large-particle aerosols (<LINK REF="REF-Heikkinen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkinen 2003</LINK>). On average, children have six to eight and adults two to four colds per year (<LINK REF="REF-Heikkinen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkinen 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The total annual economic impact of the common cold is estimated to be USD 40 billion in the USA, including the financial impact of medical costs, days off work and the possibility of severe complications in at-risk groups (<LINK REF="REF-Fendrick-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fendrick 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to the many different virus types, all with varying pathogenetic mechanisms, it is understandable that an effective universal treatment for the common cold has not been developed (<LINK REF="REF-Heikkinen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkinen 2003</LINK>). Current treatments aim to relieve the symptoms of the common cold but Cochrane Reviews suggest that most commonly used treatments are of limited or uncertain effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Hemil_x00e4_-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemilä 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karsch_x002d_V_x00f6_lk-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karsch-Völk 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2013</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-11-05 22:27:17 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Garlic (<I>Allium sativum</I>) has been traditionally used for both culinary and medicinal purposes (<LINK REF="REF-Rivlin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivlin 2001</LINK>). Garlic remedies include raw garlic and commercial preparations such as powders, oil and aged extracts (<LINK REF="REF-Ruddock-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruddock 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Staba-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staba 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The exact usage of garlic for the common cold probably varies worldwide. A cross-sectional population study conducted in Australia in 2007 found that 10.7% of participants used garlic; 29.8% of these for cold, flu or fever (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2008</LINK>). In data from the USA in 2002, 3.76% of the population used garlic supplements (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2004</LINK>). However, like other usage surveys, this study did not report the indication for use (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harris-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacLennan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLennan 2006</LINK>). Since many manufacturers of garlic supplements claim their products boost the immune system and assist in the prevention and treatment of the common cold, it is reasonable to assume that garlic supplements are commonly used by consumers for this purpose. The prevalence of herbal medicine use seems to be relatively consistent between Western countries (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacLennan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacLennan 2006</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-11-05 22:27:17 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Garlic is alleged to have antimicrobial, antifungal and antiviral properties (<LINK REF="REF-Ankri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ankri 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruddock-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruddock 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weber-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 1992</LINK>). It is purported to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels, reduce blood pressure, slow the development of atherosclerosis and act as an anticoagulant (<LINK REF="REF-Kyo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kyo 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCCAM-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCAM 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tapsell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tapsell 2006</LINK>). Other studies have reported anti-carcinogenic and immunomodulatory effects (<LINK REF="REF-Kyo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kyo 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mechanism of action of garlic as an antimicrobial and antiviral agent is unknown. However, its sulphur-containing derivatives may exert an effect (<LINK REF="REF-Naganawa-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naganawa 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weber-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 1992</LINK>). Alternatively, the effects of garlic may be due to ajoene, a derivative of allicin which displays antiplatelet and antimicrobial activities in vitro (<LINK REF="REF-Naganawa-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naganawa 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruddock-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruddock 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weber-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 1992</LINK>). When raw garlic is crushed, allicin is produced (<LINK REF="REF-Naganawa-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naganawa 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weber-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 1992</LINK>). Allicin has demonstrated antibacterial properties in vitro (<LINK REF="REF-Cavallito-1944" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cavallito 1944</LINK>), but some studies suggest it is an unstable compound that is not detected in the circulation after ingestion (<LINK REF="REF-Naganawa-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naganawa 1996</LINK>). Fresh garlic is estimated to contain approximately 4.38 to 4.65 mg of allicin per gram of garlic; thus for one fresh clove of garlic, weighing approximately 4 g, there is approximately 17.52 to 18.60 mg of allicin (<LINK REF="REF-Ruddock-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruddock 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Staba-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staba 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). It is important to recognise that commercial garlic preparations may contain different garlic-derived compounds according to the process used to formulate the product (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruddock-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruddock 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Staba-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staba 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weber-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 1992</LINK>), and that there may be substantial differences in the release of allicin from different preparations (<LINK REF="REF-Lawson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawson 2001</LINK>). There may, therefore, be differences in the effects between preparations and this should be taken into account when evaluating studies of effectiveness. In vitro studies do not indicate clinical efficacy.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Andrianova-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Andrianova 2003</LINK> (Russian) was a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing Allicor (slow-release garlic tablets) to benzimidazole or placebo for treating acute respiratory disease (ARD) in children. The definition of ARD included influenza, thus excluding it from our review. The trial was conducted in two stages; the first stage was a five-month, open non-RCT, which investigated the tolerability of Allicor and its effects on ARD morbidity; the second stage was a five-month, double-blind RCT, which assessed effects on morbidity. In the first stage, 172 children aged 7 to 16 years were given Allicor and were compared to 468 controls; there was no difference in the prevalence of gastrointestinal side effects between the groups. In the second stage, 42 children aged 10 to 12 years were treated with Allicor, compared to 41 placebo-treated children. Allicor reduced ARD morbidity 1.7-fold compared to placebo.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Rafinski-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Rafinski 1974</LINK> (Polish) assessed the clinical course of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) in 49 children aged 2 to 15 years, following treatment with Alliofil, a coated garlic tablet. We excluded this study because there was no comparison group and it was a non-randomised controlled trial. Before treatment, swabs were taken from the patients and sensitivity tests were conducted for Alliofil and several major antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, terramycin, erythromycin, aureomycin, tetracycline, neomycin and sulphonamides). From the 49 cases of recurrent URTI, bacteria were sensitive to the tested antibiotics in only nine children. The authors report that the bacterial species isolated from the remaining 40 children were sensitive to Alliofil.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Ushirotake-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ushirotake 2004</LINK> (Japanese) was not a RCT and was thus excluded. The study assessed the number of occurrences of the common cold and the severity of symptoms in 272 volunteer participants at drugstores. One hundred and thirteen had been taking Kyoleopin (containing aged garlic extract) for more than one year, 41 had been taking Leopin-5 (containing aged garlic extract) and 118 had not been taking either. As the study was not randomised or blinded, there is a high risk of bias. Of interest, this study has been used to support claims by a nutritional supplement company that garlic is effective in preventing the common cold and decreasing the severity of symptoms. This emphasises the need for careful consideration before accepting claims of scientific evidence.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Hiltunen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hiltunen 2007</LINK> compared a cellulose nasal spray with a combination cellulose and garlic extract nasal spray to prevent airborne respiratory infections, including cold-like symptoms. We excluded the study because the study outcome did not meet the definition of the common cold defined in our protocol.

This study did not meet this criterion as the cellulose could not be considered a standard treatment or a placebo.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Yakoot-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yakoot 2011</LINK> assessed the efficacy of a multiherbal formula (including garlic) in the treatment of the common cold.

<LINK REF="STD-Nantz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nantz 2012</LINK> is a RCT that compared aged garlic extract (AGE) powder (four capsules: 2.56 g per day) to placebo capsules for cold and influenza symptoms. As documented symptoms included myalgia and fever we excluded this trial from our review. We contacted the authors to assess whether we could sub-analyse the data by excluding the participants with influenza. However, unfortunately this was not possible. The primary outcome of the trial focused on measurement of immune cell proliferation. On analysis of the secondary outcomes of cold and flu symptoms, the incidence of people who experienced at least one episode of a cold or influenza during the time period was not statistically different (28 of 56 people in the placebo group, and 26 of 56 in the AGE group) (P value = 0.848). However, the group consuming the AGE powder appeared to have reduced severity of symptoms.</P>
<P>The total number of symptoms reported during the study was lower in the AGE group (584 versus 737, or 21% fewer) (P value &lt; 0.001). Per episode of illness, this finding was not significant (11.9 in the AGE group versus 14.0 in the placebo group) (P value = 0.536).</P>
<P>Participants were asked to report whether or not they had a decrease in desire or ability to carry out their normal routine (decrease in activity or DIA). The total number of days of DIA during the study was significantly different between groups: 53 in the AGE group versus 126 in the placebo group, or 58% fewer (P value &lt; 0.001). A significant difference was also noted per episode of illness (61% fewer days of DIA in the AGE group, P value &lt; 0.001).</P>

<P>We conducted the assessment of study quality according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The included trial was of reasonable quality (<LINK REF="STD-Josling-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Josling 2001</LINK>). The trial author reported (in correspondence) that the study was analysed by intention-to-treat (ITT); that is, participant results were analysed according to the treatment group to which they were randomised, regardless of whether they completed the study or changed treatment. Not analysing by ITT can affect the validity of results.</P>

<BLINDING MODIFIED="2014-10-15 11:34:22 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>The research co-ordinator was blinded for the duration of the trial. As the outcomes were self reported and participants were recruited through advertising, poor blinding of participants may have biased outcome reporting. Reasonable measures were taken to blind participants to the intervention; the investigators reported using foil wrapping to prevent the active treatment from being identified by its smell. However, four of the participants in the active group and one in placebo group noticed a 'smell' when burping. The trial author was responsible for breaking the randomisation codes at the end of the trial after all diaries had been returned.</P>

<P>The included trial reported 24 occurrences of the common cold in the garlic intervention group compared with 65 in the placebo group (P value &lt; 0.001). There were fewer days of illness in the garlic group compared with the placebo group (111 versus 366). A cold could be defined as 'feeling low and beginning to exhibit symptoms' or 'full cold symptoms' (headache, sneezing, runny nose, tiredness). Statistical significance was not reported for the number of days to recovery from an occurrence of the common cold (4.63 versus 5.63) but these appear similar. The trial authors reported that 16 participants taking placebo had more than one full-blown cold compared to two participants taking garlic, but no statistical analysis was reported. Adverse effects included rash and odour.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-11-05 22:27:17 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Evidence</HEADING>
<P>Garlic may prevent occurrences of the common cold. The published evidence for this is positive but limited, as it comes from one relatively small trial with subjective outcome measures.</P>
<P>Only one trial that met the selection criteria could be identified (<LINK REF="STD-Josling-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Josling 2001</LINK>), limiting the conclusions that can be drawn. The trial reported significant differences in effect between the placebo and intervention groups. Adverse effects reported were relatively minor (smell and skin rash). It is not certain whether the single case of gout reported could be reasonably attributed to the garlic.</P>
<P>While the results suggest that garlic may have an effect on preventing the common cold, the subjective nature of the outcome measure means that this result is somewhat uncertain. The outcome of having a cold was not confirmed by any objective observation and may be unreliable. Further, a five-point categorical scale was collapsed for analysis; hence a cold was defined as a score of either 2 - 'feeling low and beginning to exhibit symptoms' or 1 - 'full cold symptoms' (headache, sneezing, runny nose, tiredness). The trial authors do not state whether this analysis was defined in advance and it is possible this was done to increase the likelihood of achieving a statistically significant result, since 'full cold symptoms' would seem to be the clearest definition of a cold. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were not reported, nor were differences in co-morbidity or concurrent illnesses. These factors reduce the ability to generalise from this trial to other situations and may have introduced bias into the results.</P>
<P>No trial was identified that looked at whether treating symptoms of the cold with garlic reduces their severity or duration. However, in the included study the number of days to recover from a cold was similar in both groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Josling-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Josling 2001</LINK> reported that one participant allocated to receive the garlic preparation withdrew due to development of gout and another due to pruritic rash below the knees, which faded after the garlic supplement was discontinued. Four participants in the intervention group and one in the placebo group noticed a 'smell' when burping. Adverse effects reported in excluded studies were also considered, acknowledging that any adverse events reported could not be attributed to garlic, because of weaknesses in randomisation or the lack of a control group. In the <LINK REF="STD-Andrianova-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Andrianova 2003</LINK> trial, there were no gastrointestinal side effects observed but it is unknown whether there were any other adverse effects. <LINK REF="STD-Rafinski-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Rafinski 1974</LINK> reported that no side effects were observed and <LINK REF="STD-Yakoot-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yakoot 2011</LINK> reported that the frequency of side effects did not differ significantly between intervention and placebo groups (no data reported). In <LINK REF="STD-Nantz-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nantz 2012</LINK>, there was no difference in the incidence of reported adverse effects (one person reported gastrointestinal side effects in each group). It is not known whether <LINK REF="STD-Ushirotake-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ushirotake 2004</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Polanco_x002d_Rojas-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Polanco-Rojas 2013</LINK> reported adverse effects.</P>
<P>The safety of consuming small quantities of raw garlic is evident in its worldwide use as a culinary spice (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). Adverse events associated with garlic have been reported in non-randomised studies, randomised trials in other conditions and in case reports. A review of other adverse effects reported in the literature included bad breath and body odour and allergic reactions, manifesting in minor respiratory or skin symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-AHRQ-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRQ 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). There is a potential for high-dose garlic to interact with antithrombotic drugs (for example, warfarin), increasing the risk of bleeding, but the few reported case studies are inconclusive (<LINK REF="REF-AHRQ-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRQ 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fugh_x002d_Berman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fugh-Berman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is no conclusive evidence to recommend garlic supplements as a preventative or treatment option for the common cold. A single, small trial was found suggesting garlic might reduce the incidence of the common cold if taken continuously as a daily prophylactic (preventive treatment) but the results require validation. There is currently no evidence to help decide whether treating common colds with garlic will reduce symptom severity or days of illness. Anecdotally, adverse events reported include odour and minor skin or respiratory irritation. The frequency of adverse effects could not be determined from the evidence available.</P>

<P>We contacted the study author to query how well garlic could be blinded to participants because of its strong smell. He replied that the tablets used had no odour with daily use. Asked how the groups were matched if they were randomly allocated, he replied that patients were "matched with a standard protocol rejecting same sex volunteers after the maximum number was reached. Age was included in the admission protocol so volunteers over 70 were rejected as were those under 20 years old." We took this to mean that the total sample recruited was balanced according to age, sex and previous garlic use and then randomly allocated</P>

<P>Dear Frans Nuijten,</P>
<P>Many thanks for your perceptive and helpful comments. We agree that the reporting of results in the Plain Language Summary is confusing and will clarify this in our next update.</P>
<P>As you recognised:</P>
<P>The total number of days of illness in the garlic group was 111, compared to 366 in the placebo group. However when participants experienced a cold, the length of illness was similar in both groups (4.63 vs 5.63). The trial authors also reported 'average days of illness' (total number of days of illness / number of colds): 1.52 vs 5.01 days. This significant difference is evidently derived from including participants with 0 days of illness (i.e. no cold), of which there were more in the garlic group (number of colds 24 vs 65). This is misleading; the more relevant result is the number of days of illness when a cold is present (4.63 vs 5.63).</P>
<P>Many thanks<BR/>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2015-08-13 12:49:57 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thank-you for your comments, Stephanie Stacey. The Cochrane review looked at prevention and treatment as separate outcomes. The Josling study (published in Advances in Therapy) looked at a number of different measures of outcome, including the number of days of cold symptoms in total. In Josling's study, 73 participants were each randomly allocated to either the placebo group or the garlic group. The placebo group experienced a greater number of colds (65) compared to the garlic group (24). Because the placebo group experienced more colds altogether, they were, on average, virally challenged for a greater number of days (366 days of infection / 73 people = 5.01), so the total number of days of cold symptoms was greater in this group. In contrast, the garlic group were, on average, unwell for fewer total days (111 days of infection / 73 people = 1.52). This study suggested that the garlic supplement may help to prevent a common cold. However, if the participant did contract a common cold, the number of days to recovery was similar (4.63 in the garlic group vs. 5.63 in the placebo group). Hence garlic appears to be ineffective for treating a common cold.</P>
