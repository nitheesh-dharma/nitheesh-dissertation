<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-22 14:27:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is currently not enough evidence for encouraging the mother to adopt different postures during pregnancy in order to change a breech baby's position in the womb.</P>
<P>Babies born in the breech position (bottom first) are more likely to have problems during birth than babies born head first (cephalic). There are different ways of trying to encourage the baby to turn so that he/she can be born head first. Some of these involve the mother adopting different postures. This review of six trials, involving 417 women, found too little evidence to support the use of certain postures to change the baby's position in pregnancy to head down. Further research is required.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2012-08-22 10:49:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Babies with breech presentation (bottom first) are at increased risk of complications during birth, and are often delivered by caesarean section. The chance of breech presentation persisting at the time of delivery, and the risk of caesarean section, can be reduced by external cephalic version (ECV - turning the baby by manual manipulation through the mother's abdomen). It is also possible that maternal posture may influence fetal position. Many postural techniques have been used to promote cephalic version. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-02-04 16:22:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of postural management of breech presentation on measures of pregnancy outcome. We evaluated procedures in which the mother rests with her pelvis elevated. These include the knee-chest position, and a supine position with the pelvis elevated with a wedge-shaped cushion.</P>

<P>We have included six studies involving a total of 417 women. The rates for non-cephalic births, Cesarean section and Apgar scores below 7 at one minute, regardless of whether ECV was attempted or not, were similar between the intervention and control groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.15; RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.37; RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.55).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-04 16:25:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Babies with breech presentation (bottom first) are at increased risk of complications during birth. This risk can be reduced by planned caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2003</LINK>). The chance of breech presentation persisting at the time of delivery, and the risk of caesarean section, can be reduced by external cephalic version (ECV - turning the baby by manual manipulation through the mother's abdomen) (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 1996</LINK>). Other methods used to attempt to correct the position of the baby include acupuncture, homoeopathy and postural methods. Over the years many postural techniques have been used by midwives, doctors and traditional birth attendants to promote cephalic version (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 1989</LINK>). Little, however, has appeared in the medical literature on this subject. <LINK REF="REF-Elkins-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elkins 1982</LINK> reported an uncontrolled trial of the knee-chest position, assumed for 15 minutes every two hours of waking for five days. Use of this procedure in 71 women with ultrasound-confirmed breech presentation after 37 weeks' gestation was followed by a normal cephalic birth in 65 cases. This method has been modified by researchers (e.g. knee-chest position assumed with full urinary bladder three times a day for seven days) (<LINK REF="STD-Chenia-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Chenia 1987</LINK>). Another postural method is 'Indian version', assuming the supine, head-down position with the pelvis supported by a wedge-shaped cushion for 10 to 15 minutes once or twice a day (<LINK REF="STD-Bung-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bung 1987</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-02-04 17:19:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and we judged the trials&#8217; populations and methods to be sufficiently similar. If there had been clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if we had detected substantial statistical heterogeneity, we would have used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials had been considered clinically meaningful. We would have treated the random-effects summary as the average range of possible treatment effects and we would have discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect had not been clinically meaningful we would not have combined trials. If we had used random-effects analyses, the results would have been presented as the average treatment effect with its 95% confidence interval, and the estimates of  T² and I².</P>

<P>If, in future updates of this review, we identify substantial heterogeneity, we will investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We will also consider whether an overall summary is meaningful, and if it is, use random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>
<P>We carried out the following subgroup analyses:</P>
<OL>
<LI>no external cephalic version attempted;</LI>
<LI>external cephalic version attempted.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We used only primary outcomes in subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>For fixed-effect inverse variance meta-analyses we assessed differences between subgroups by interaction tests. For random-effects and fixed-effects meta-analyses using methods other than inverse variance, we assessed differences between subgroups by inspection of the subgroups&#8217; confidence intervals; non-overlapping confidence intervals indicated a statistically significant difference in treatment effect between the subgroups.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Chenia-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Chenia 1987</LINK> modified Elkins's procedure to be used three times a day for seven days with a full urinary bladder. Seventy-six black women with breech presentation beyond 37 weeks' gestation were allocated by randomised sealed envelope to a study and a control group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bung-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bung 1987</LINK> reported a controlled trial of 'Indian' version. The women were encouraged to lie down once or twice a day for 10 to 15 minutes in the supine, head-down position, the pelvis being supported by a wedge-shaped cushion. Sixty-one women with breech presentation between the 30th and 35th weeks of pregnancy were allocated according to odd and even days of the month to a study and a control group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hartadottir-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hartadottir 1992</LINK> 'randomised' women with breech presentation after 34 weeks' gestation to a group taught to assume the knee-chest position for 15 minutes twice a day, or to a control group. There were three exclusions after randomisation, and compliance was poor in some women.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Obwegeser-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Obwegeser 1999</LINK> randomly allocated 109 women to an 'Indian version' or control group, but six left the clinic (lost to follow-up) and three were withdrawn for poor compliance.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1999</LINK> evaluated the knee-chest position, and differed from the others in that external cephalic version was offered to the women if the breech presentation persisted after a week (47/51 in the postural group, 44/49 in the control group). This may have obscured the effect of the procedure to some extent. For this reason, we have performed sub-group analysis for trials with and without external cephalic version (ECV) attempt. ECV was successful in one of the postural group and four of the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Founds-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Founds 2006</LINK> randomised women with singleton breech presentation between 34 and 38 weeks to a group taught to assume the maternal knee-chest position for 15 minutes three times daily, or to a control group. There were two protocol deviations in the study group and one woman was lost to follow-up. We applied an intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>In other respects, the studies were methodologically sound. Double blinding was not possible, but the measures of outcome other than Apgar score were not subject to observer bias. The results may, however, have been affected by a chance preponderance of primigravid women in the experimental group in four studies: 11/39 versus 4/37 (<LINK REF="STD-Chenia-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Chenia 1987</LINK>), 15/30 versus 11/31 (<LINK REF="STD-Bung-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bung 1987</LINK>), 19/30 versus 13/25 (<LINK REF="STD-Hartadottir-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hartadottir 1992</LINK>) and 9/14 versus 4/11 (<LINK REF="STD-Founds-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Founds 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because the basic principle of the two techniques investigated is similar, namely relaxation in a position in which the pelvis is elevated above the level of the shoulders, the findings of the studies have been combined. It should, however, be noted that the gestation at enrolment differed between the studies.</P>

<P>We included six studies involving a total of only 417 women. There was no effect on the rate of non-cephalic births (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.15; six trials, 417 women; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), overall caesarean section rate (RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.37; five trials, 317 women; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) and rate of low Apgar score at one minute (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.55; three trials, 237 women; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The findings are consistent, at the 95% CI, with anything between a moderate positive and a negative effect. These findings held for the subgroup in which external cephalic version was not attempted, and the group overall, but may have been affected by a chance preponderance of primigravid women in the intervention groups (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>). The two trials which showed a tendency to reduced non-cephalic births were those in which the procedure was started as early as 30 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="STD-Bung-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bung 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Obwegeser-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Obwegeser 1999</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>The studies must be regarded as too small to establish conclusively whether or not postural management is effective. </P>

<P>The controlled trials reported to date are too small to support or refute the evidence from uncontrolled trials of the value of postural management for breech presentation.</P>
<P>Because of the simplicity of postural management and its potential wide application in different settings, it is reasonable that the procedure be evaluated further by means of larger randomised clinical trials. These should include evaluation of the effect of the gestational age on the effectiveness of these procedures, and exploration of women's views. Additional procedures which might be investigated to facilitate version include maternal hydration to increase amniotic fluid volume, and performing the procedure with a full bladder to aid disengagement of the presenting breech from the mother's pelvis.</P>

<P>Excluded because posture was not used. May be included in a separate review. 130 primigravidas in the 33rd week of gestation were randomised to receive stimulation of acupoint BL 67 by moxa rolls for 7 to 14 days. The 130 in the control group received routine care. The intervention group experienced a mean of 48.45 fetal movements per day versus 35.35 in the control group (95% confidence interval (CI) for difference, 10.56 to 15.60). During the 35th week of gestation, 98 in the intervention group were cephalic versus 62 in the control group (risk ratio (RR) 1.58; 95% CI, 1.29 to 1.94). Despite the fact that 24 subjects in the control group and 1 subject in the intervention group underwent external cephalic version, 98 in the intervention group were cephalic at birth versus 81 in the control group (RR 1.21; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.43).</P>
</CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
</EXCLUDED_CHAR>
<EXCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Van-Drooge-1984">
<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>Excluded because the technique of hyperextension is fundamentally different from the techniques used in the other studies. Allocation of women at 32 to 38 weeks was by envelope. Unfortunately, there were more nulliparous women in the study than the control group (11/20 versus 7/20). Version was less common, but not significantly so, in the study than in the control group (7/20 versus 9/20).</P>

<P>The following methods were used to assess <LINK REF="STD-Bung-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bung 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chenia-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Chenia 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartadottir-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hartadottir 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Obwegeser-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Obwegeser 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1999</LINK>. Trials under consideration were evaluated for methodological quality and appropriateness for inclusion according to the prespecified selection criteria, without consideration of their results. Individual outcome data were included in the analysis if they met the prespecified criteria in 'Types of outcome measures'. Included trial data were processed as described in <LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>.</P>
<P>Data were extracted from the sources and entered onto the Review Manager computer software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2000</LINK>), checked for accuracy, and analysed as above using the RevMan software. For dichotomous data, risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and in the absence of heterogeneity, results were pooled using a fixed-effect model.</P>
