<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-01-12 12:05:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Various medicines, which are collectively termed 'antiepileptic drugs', have been used to treat persistent aggression. This review systematically examines the evidence supporting this practice. From the evidence available, we were unable to draw any firm conclusion about using these medicines to treat aggression. Four antiepileptic drugs (valproate/divalproex, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and phenytoin) helped to reduce aggression in at least one study. However, for three of these drugs (valproate, carbamazepine and phenytoin) we found at least one other study where there was no significant improvement. Further research is needed to clarify which antiepileptic drugs are effective for whom. Such research is best carried out using carefully designed clinical trials. Such trials need to take account of the type of aggression displayed, the severity of the aggression, and any other disorders experienced by the participants.</P>

<P>Fourteen studies with data from 672 participants met the inclusion criteria. Five different antiepileptic drugs were examined. Sodium valproate/divalproex was superior to placebo for outpatient men with recurrent impulsive aggression, for impulsively aggressive adults with cluster B personality disorders, and for youths with conduct disorder, but not for children and adolescents with pervasive developmental disorder. Carbamazepine was superior to placebo in reducing acts of self-directed aggression in women with borderline personality disorder, but not in children with conduct disorder. Oxcarbazepine was superior to placebo for verbal aggression and aggression against objects in adult outpatients. Phenytoin was superior to placebo on the frequency of aggressive acts in male prisoners and in outpatient men including those with personality disorder, but not on the frequency of 'behavioral incidents' in delinquent boys.<BR/>

<P>The authors consider that the body of evidence summarised in this review is insufficient to allow any firm conclusion to be drawn about the use of antiepileptic medication in the treatment of aggression and associated impulsivity. Four antiepileptics (valproate/divalproex, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and phenytoin) were effective, compared to placebo, in reducing aggression in at least one study, although for three drugs (valproate, carbamazepine and phenytoin) at least one other study showed no statistically significant difference between treatment and control conditions. Side effects were more commonly noted for the intervention group although adverse effects were not well reported. Absence of information does not necessarily mean that the treatment is safe, nor that the potential gains from the medication necessarily balance the risk of an adverse event occurring. Further research is needed.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-01-18 12:50:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-01-12 12:05:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-01-12 12:05:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The term aggression has been used to define a broad range of behaviours which generally involve non-accidental harm. This includes violence, defined by the World Health Organization as <I>"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death or psychological harm, maldevelopment or deprivation".</I>  Worldwide, violence is considered to be a major public health issue (<LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 2002</LINK>), and survey data on criminal violence in the UK has revealed that in the year 2006/7 there were just under 2½ million violent crimes in private households. Aggression is also used to describe other disturbed behaviour, such as intentional damage to property or hostile agitation.</P>
<P>Two broad subtypes of aggression have been identified &#8211; instrumental and reactive (<LINK REF="REF-Barratt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barratt 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berkowitz-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berkowitz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vitiello-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vitiello 1997</LINK>). Instrumental aggression is more controlled and consciously goal-directed. Reactive aggression, which is considered to be far more prevalent (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2007</LINK>), involves an emotionally-driven reaction to frustration or perceived threat. A key feature of reactive aggression is impulsivity. Impulsivity describes a tendency to act on impulse, i.e. a sudden or involuntary inclination or tendency to act without premeditation or reflection.</P>
<P>There is a well-established link between mental disorder and aggression. Aggressive behaviour is an integral part of some disorders. The conventional diagnostic systems, ICD-10 and DSM-IV, have been shaped by a medical model that relies on the identification of symptoms to determine pathology. However, mental disorder diagnoses, especially those associated with aggression, give undue prominence to behaviours rather than underlying process disturbances. Consequently there is the tautological problem that the diagnostic criteria are used both to identify the disorder and to characterise the disorder. However many mental disorders, including antisocial personality disorder and conduct disorder, appear to be aetiologically heterogeneous rather than distinct unitary phenomena. In the case of &#8216;intermittent explosive disorder&#8217;, extreme aggression is the defining feature. In this condition there is failure to resist aggressive impulses with a disproportionate response to stress (DSM-IV-TR; <LINK REF="REF-American-Psychiatric-Association-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">American Psychiatric Association 2000</LINK>). A study of psychiatric outpatients found the life-time prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder to be 7.3% (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>A history of aggression can contribute to the diagnosis of certain personality disorders. A <I>"very low tolerance to frustration and a low threshold for discharge of aggression"&#8217;</I> is a diagnostic feature of dissocial personality disorder under ICD-10 (<LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 1993</LINK>). The broader category of antisocial personality disorder within DSM-IV includes the criterion <I>&#8216;irritability and aggressiveness as indicated by repeated physical fights or assaults</I>&#8217;.  Key features of borderline personality disorder under DSM-IV are emotional dysregulation and impulsivity, which may be manifest in <I>"inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g. frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights)"</I>. The ICD-10 equivalent, &#8216;emotionally unstable personality disorder&#8217;, refers to <I>"liability to outbursts of anger or violence". </I>Impulsivity is also a diagnostic criterion in these two personality disorders.</P>
<P>Certain developmental disorders may also present with aggressive behaviour. Two of the four conduct disorder symptom clusters involve aggression (DSM-IV-TR). The <I>&#8216;aggression to people and animals&#8217;</I> cluster include items such as <I>"often initiates fights", "has used a weapon"</I> and <I>"has been physically cruel to people".</I> There is also a <I>&#8216;destruction of property&#8217;</I> cluster which includes <I>"has deliberately destroyed others&#8217; property"</I>. Oppositional defiant disorder is characterised by<I> "a pattern of negativistic, hostile and defiant behaviour" </I>(DSM-IV-TR).  </P>
<P>There are other mental disorders which do not have aggression as a specific diagnostic criterion, but which have been found to be associated with an increased risk of aggression. Substance abuse disorders are strongly associated with aggression (<LINK REF="REF-Nestor-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nestor 2002</LINK>). Epidemiological studies have established a modest but significant relationship between psychosis and violence (<LINK REF="REF-Arseneault-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arseneault 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brennan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brennan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fazel-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fazel 2006</LINK>). In the developmental period, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, which involves a loss of impulse control, is associated with aggression (<LINK REF="REF-Staller-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staller 2007</LINK>). Across mental disorders, key traits that are associated with aggression are impulse control and affect regulation (<LINK REF="REF-Nestor-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nestor 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has long been recognised that aggression can be a feature of organic brain conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Haller-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haller 2006</LINK>). Aggressiveness may be specifically associated with frontal and temporal lobe damage (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson_x00a0_1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 2000</LINK>). A diagnostic criterion of organic personality disorder is <I>&#8216;irritability and/or outbursts of anger and aggression&#8217;</I> (<LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 1993</LINK>). A specific relationship between epilepsy and aggression has also been found in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Kanemoto-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanemoto 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Elst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Elst 2000</LINK>) and children (<LINK REF="REF-Connor-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 1996</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-01-12 12:05:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of antiepileptic drugs in the treatment of aggression has a relatively long track-record (for example <LINK REF="REF-Stein-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tyrer-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyrer 1988</LINK>) and there are some supporting data (<LINK REF="REF-Goedhard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goedhard 2006</LINK>). Using a double-blind cross-over design, phenytoin has been reported to be associated with a reduction in the frequency of acts of aggression by individuals in a community sample (<LINK REF="REF-Stanford-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanford 2001</LINK>) and in a prison sample (<LINK REF="REF-Barratt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barratt 1997</LINK>). A similar effect has been found with carbamazepine and sodium valproate/divalproex (<LINK REF="REF-Gardner-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hollander-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollander 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hollander-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollander 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kavoussi-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kavoussi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindenmayer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindenmayer 2000</LINK>). The effect may be specific to impulsive aggression as opposed to instrumental aggression (<LINK REF="REF-Barratt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barratt 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanford-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanford 2001</LINK>).  There is some empirical support for the anti-aggression effect of other antiepileptics, such as lamotrigine (<LINK REF="STD-Tritt-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tritt 2005</LINK>) and topiramate (<LINK REF="REF-Gobbi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gobbi 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>An antiepileptic drug is defined here as one normally used prophylactically to reduce the frequency and/or severity of epileptic seizures. We consider pharmacological interventions where an antiepileptic drug is given not only as monotherapy but also as an adjunctive intervention. The review focuses on studies of persistent/serious aggression. We include, but have not confined ourselves to, studies of individuals resistant to other interventions.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-08-06 09:24:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Impulsive reactive aggression reflects a high arousal state (<LINK REF="REF-Haller-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haller 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2007</LINK>). It has been proposed that repeated acts of aggression, specifically of a reactive sort, may be underpinned by neuronal hyperexcitability, and there is some empirical support for this (<LINK REF="REF-Keele-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keele 2005</LINK>). Therefore drugs which reduce neuronal excitability, and specifically those classed as antiepileptics or anticonvulsants, could theoretically be expected to lower the likelihood of reactive aggressive outburst.</P>
<P>The precise mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. At a neurochemical level, an imbalance of gabaminergic systems is thought to be associated with aggression (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siever-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siever 2008</LINK>), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been found to suppress aggression in animal models (<LINK REF="REF-Miczek-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miczek 2002</LINK>). Therefore it follows that pharmacological antiepileptic agents that act on gabaminergic neurons, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin and valproate, may have a beneficial effect on aggressive behaviour.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-08-05 12:15:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Julie G Millener">
<P>Poorly controlled aggression is prevalent in society. It results in emotional and physical damage to victims, and is associated with considerable costs and distress. Medication has potential to provide one treatment option, and may be particularly relevant to individuals who seek treatment but who find difficulty engaging in psychological interventions. There is some evidence that antiepileptic drugs may be effective, but there are currently no clinical guidelines. A systematic review of the current evidence base is therefore timely.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2010-01-12 12:05:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For dichotomous (binary) data, we used the odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval to summarise results within each study. The odds ratio was chosen because it has statistical advantages relating to its sampling distribution and its suitability for modelling, and is a relative measure and so can be used to combine studies. For continuous data, such as the measurement of impulsiveness on a scale, we had intended to compare the mean score for each outcome as determined by a standardised tool between the two groups to give a mean difference (MD), again with a 95% confidence interval. We had intended to use the standardised mean difference (SMD) where different outcome measures of the same construct were reported. On this occasion, however, all continuous data from the 14 trials in this review met our criteria for skewness. We define skewness as occurring when, for a scale or measure with positive values and a minimum value of zero, the mean is less than twice the standard deviation (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). All skewed continuous data are reported in separate tables, together with results of any statistical analyses conducted by the trial investigators; we did not attempt to calculate treatment effect sizes for this data to minimise the risk of applying parametric statistics to data that departs significantly from a normal distribution.</P>
<P>Where possible, endpoint data are presented. Where both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcomes, then only the former are reported.</P>
<P>We had intended that the statistical comparisons on primary and secondary measures would be categorised into one of three specific follow-up periods (within the first month; between one and six months; between six and 12 months) and meta-analysed within these categories. For 12 of the 14 studies included in this review, however, the endpoint results fell within the one-to-six-month period and the four meta-analyses we report all fall within this category.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">a) Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>Had we found trials that used clustered randomisation, we anticipated that study investigators would have presented their results after appropriately controlling for clustering effects (using, for example, robust standard errors or hierarchical linear models). If a cluster-randomised trial had been found where it was unclear whether appropriate controls had been used for clustering, we planned to contact the study investigators for further information. If appropriate controls had not been used, individual participant data would have been requested and re-analysed using multilevel models which control for clustering. Following this, we planned that effect sizes and standard errors would be meta-analysed in RevMan using the generic inverse method (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). If appropriate controls had not been used and individual participant data had not been available, statistical guidance would have been sought from the Cochrane Methods Group and external experts as to which method to apply to the published results in attempt to control for clustering. If there had been insufficient information to control for clustering, outcome data would have been entered into RevMan using individuals as the units of analysis, and sensitivity analysis then used to assess the potential biasing effects of inadequately controlled clustered trials (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2001</LINK>). In this review, however, no cluster-randomised trials were identified.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">b) Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>Had we been able to conduct meta-analysis combining the results of cross-over trials, we planned to use the inverse variance methods recommended by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Had the data presented from a cross-over trial been restricted (and more information was not available from the original investigators), we planned to use the presented data within the first phase only, up to the point of cross-over.</P>

<P>Multi-arm trials were considered for inclusion in the review if (a) at least one arm constituted a relevant intervention with an antiepileptic drug, and (b) there was one arm which constituted a placebo condition. Separate data extractions were made for each pair-wise comparison between a relevant intervention and the placebo condition.</P>

</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2010-01-12 12:05:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We attempted to contact the original investigators to request any missing data and information on whether or not it could be assumed to be &#8216;missing at random&#8217;. For dichotomous data, we report missing data and dropouts for each included study. We report the number of participants included in the final analysis as a proportion of all participants in each study. We provide reasons for missing data in the narrative summary within the 'Risk of bias' tables. For missing continuous data, we provide a qualitative summary. We attempted to contact the investigators if the standard deviations of the outcome measures for each group were not given. Had meta-analyses been attempted where these standard deviations were unavailable, we planned to impute standard deviations using relevant data (for example, standard deviations or correlation coefficients) from other similar studies (<LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>) but only if, after seeking statistical advice, to do so was deemed practical and appropriate.</P>
<P>We considered people leaving early to have had the negative outcome, except for adverse effects such as death. We had planned to report separately all data from studies where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow up, and to exclude these from any meta-analysis. However, on this occasion we identified only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2005</LINK>) where the proportion of participants lost to follow up compared to the number randomised was 52.5%. Since this was the only study on oxcarbazepine, the results are already presented separately.</P>
<P>We had planned to subject the impact of including studies with high attrition rates (25% to 50%) to sensitivity analysis in comparison with those with low attrition rates (0% to 49%). If inclusion of data from this group had resulted in a substantive change in the estimate of effect of the primary outcomes, we would not have added data from these studies to trials with less attrition, but would have presented them separately, and we had planned to use this approach for continuous outcomes where the proportion missing can be taken as an indication of potential bias. For dichotomous (binary) outcomes, however, the higher the ratio of participants with missing data to participants with events, the greater potential there is for bias. We had therefore planned to report this ratio for each binary outcome, and to allow for it when interpreting results of any sensitivity analysis. On this occasion, however, the data extracted were insufficient for this procedure to be executed.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-01-12 12:05:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the extent of between-trial differences and the consistency of results of any meta-analysis in three ways: by visual inspection of the forest plots, by performing the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test of heterogeneity (where a significance level less than 0.10 was interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity), and by examining the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>; section 9.5.2). The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic describes approximately the proportion of variation in point estimates due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. We considered I<SUP>2</SUP> values less than 30% as indicating low heterogeneity, values in the range 31% to 69% as indicating moderate heterogeneity, and values greater than 70% as indicating high heterogeneity. We would have attempted to identify any significant determinants of heterogeneity categorised at moderate or high.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-11-24 20:16:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nick Huband">
<P>We had planned to draw funnel plots (effect size versus standard error) to assess publication bias if sufficient studies had been found. Asymmetry of the plots may indicate publication bias, although they may also represent a true relationship between trial size and effect size. If such a relationship had been identified, the clinical diversity of the studies would have been further examined as a possible explanation (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). On this occasion, however, we were able to perform only four meta-analyses (none of which were on primary outcomes) which were insufficient for this procedure to be executed.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2010-01-12 12:05:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We planned to perform meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model where we considered studies to have sufficiently similar participants, interventions, comparators and outcome measures. In carrying out such meta-analysis, the weight given to each study is such that the more precise estimates (from larger studies with more events) are given more weight.</P>
<P>For meta-analysis of dichotomous data, we used Mantel-Haenszel methods because they have been shown to have better statistical properties that other fixed-effect methods (such as Peto and inverse variance) when the study size is small or when the odds ratios are not close to unity.</P>
<P>The weighted average of the results of all the available studies would have been used, if appropriate, to provide an estimate of the effect of antiepileptic drugs for aggression and impulsiveness. Where appropriate and if a sufficient number of studies had been found, we planned to use regression techniques to investigate the effects of differences in the study characteristics on the estimate of the treatment effects. Statistical advice would have been sought before attempting meta-regression and if performed would have been executed using a random-effects model.

These 14 studies involved a total of 16 comparisons of an antiepileptic drug against placebo. There were some important differences between the studies. We summarise these differences and the main study characteristics below. Further details are provided in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Design</HEADING>
<P>Of these 14 placebo-controlled studies, eight were parallel trials and six were cross-over trials. Of the eight parallel trials, six were two-condition comparisons of an antiepileptic drug against placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Cueva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cueva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gottschalk-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Gottschalk 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellings-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hellings 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2008</LINK>), one study was a three-condition comparison of two drugs against placebo, one of which was not an antiepileptic (<LINK REF="STD-Conners-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Conners 1971</LINK>), and one was a four-condition comparison involving three antiepileptic drugs against placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Stanford-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stanford 2005</LINK>). When evaluating the six cross-over trials for inclusion in the review, we first considered whether the cross-over design was suitable for the condition being studied. Cross-over trials are suitable for evaluating interventions with a temporary effect in the treatment of stable conditions, and where long-term follow up is not required (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>, p.500). On this basis, the cross-over design was considered suitable since recurrent aggression is a reasonably stable condition and long-term follow up, though desirable, is not essential for evaluating the effects of antiepileptic medication. Of the six studies with cross-over designs, five were two-condition studies of an antiepileptic drug against placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Barratt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barratt 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donovan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donovan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gardner-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenblatt-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenblatt 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stanford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stanford 2001</LINK>), and one was a three-condition study of an antiepileptic drug at two dose regimes against placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Barratt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barratt 1991</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sample sizes</HEADING>
<P>There was a considerable variation in sample size between studies. Overall, the number of participants initially randomised per study ranged from 13 to 246 (mean 54.4; median 34), and the number of participants completing per study ranged from 8 to 145 (mean 33.3; median 23.5). The distribution of sample size across the studies was uneven. Whereas one large multi-centre trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2003</LINK>) randomised 246 participants and the other multi-centre trial (<LINK REF="STD-Barratt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barratt 1997</LINK>) reported on a subgroup of 60 randomised participants, the remaining 13 studies involved less than 50 participants, with sample sizes ranging from 13 to 48.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Setting</HEADING>
<P>All 14 studies were carried out in North America. Two were multi-centre trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barratt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barratt 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2003</LINK>), 10 were single-centre trials, and two did not give sufficient information to allow classification. The trials took place in a number of very different settings encompassing custodial, hospital and community environments. Three studies involved participants who were prisoners (<LINK REF="STD-Barratt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barratt 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barratt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barratt 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gottschalk-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Gottschalk 1973</LINK>), one involved boys at a residential centre for delinquent juveniles (<LINK REF="STD-Conners-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Conners 1971</LINK>) and one involved hospitalised children (<LINK REF="STD-Cueva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cueva 1996</LINK>). The remaining nine studies involved participants in outpatient settings. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>An inclusion criterion for this review was that participants must have been recruited on the basis of having displayed recurrent aggression. Investigators defined recurrent aggression in various ways (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table), but all required either a chronic pattern of aggressive behaviour or some minimum frequency of observed or reported acts of aggression over a recent time interval. Several studies required additional indicators of aggression or hostility: a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder was an inclusion criterion for <LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2008</LINK>; a score of 8 or higher on the irritability subscale of the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory was an inclusion criterion for <LINK REF="STD-Stanford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stanford 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stanford-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stanford 2005</LINK>; and a minimum score of 15 on the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) was required by <LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2003</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Rosenblatt-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenblatt 1976</LINK> recruited participants who had complained of difficulty in controlling physically punitive impulses towards (or were suspected of physical assault on) their own children.</P>
<P>In 10 of the 14 included studies, the aggression was described specifically as directed against others, against property or both. <LINK REF="STD-Donovan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donovan 2000</LINK> had inclusion criteria that included either oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder (both diagnosed under DSM-IV) with, additionally, an explosive temper defined as four or more outbursts of rage, property destruction or fighting per month on minimal provocation. Where the trial investigators appeared to have included violence towards the self (i.e. self-harm) in their definition of aggression, we excluded the study only if participants had been recruited solely on the basis of having self-harmed. We therefore included <LINK REF="STD-Hellings-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hellings 2005</LINK> with an inclusion criterion of significant aggression to self, others, or property at least three times a week, and <LINK REF="STD-Gardner-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 1986</LINK> who recruited on the basis of an extensive history of &#8216;behavioural dyscontrol&#8217; which included aggression towards the self as well as towards others and property.</P>
<P>In eight of the 14 included studies, participants were recruited on the basis of meeting criteria for a formal clinical diagnosis in addition to having displayed recurrent aggression: pervasive developmental disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Hellings-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hellings 2005</LINK>), conduct disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Cueva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cueva 1996</LINK>), conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Donovan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donovan 2000</LINK>), borderline personality disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Gardner-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 1986</LINK>), personality disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Stanford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stanford 2001</LINK>), intermittent explosive disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2008</LINK>), and either intermittent explosive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder or cluster B personality disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were considerable differences between the studies in terms of sex and age of the participants recruited.

<P>Five antiepileptic drugs were compared to placebo in the 14 included studies. In each case, the route of administration was oral (by tablets, capsules or liquid). Studies varied in the way they reported the dose administered to the treatment group: a fixed daily dose (mg/day), a fixed daily dose in relation to body weight (mg/kg/day), or a dose adjusted in attempt to achieve a target blood serum concentration (&#956;g/ml). Full details are provided in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table but can be summarised as follows.</P>

</UL>
<P>In identifying these five antiepileptic drugs, we took account of the following.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Phenytoin is described as diphenylhydantoin in some early studies (the name was subsequently shortened), but both terms refer to the same drug (<LINK REF="REF-Marson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marson 2009</LINK>); we therefore consider them together in this review.</LI>
<LI>Divalproex sodium is an equimolar compound of sodium valproate and valproic acid; because the two drugs are regarded as equivalent in efficacy and have similar side effect profiles, we consider them together in this review.</LI>
<LI>Oxcarbazepine is a recently developed analogue of carbamazepine which is claimed to have a lower potential for drug interactions and to induce liver enzymes to a lesser extent than carbamazepine than carbamazepine; because the two drugs are essentially different agents and are likely to have different efficacies and side effect profiles, we consider them separately in this review.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The duration of the interventions ranged between two and 24 weeks (mean 8.1 weeks; median 6.0 weeks). None of the 14 studies followed up participants beyond the end of the intervention period. The duration of the trials ranged between two and 24 weeks (mean 12.2 weeks; median 12.5 weeks).</P>

<P>For the primary outcome of observer-reported aggression, one study reported the frequency of aggressive incidents as observed by a third party (<LINK REF="STD-Barratt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barratt 1991</LINK>). Five studies reported measurements made using the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) in its original form (<LINK REF="STD-Barratt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barratt 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cueva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cueva 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellings-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hellings 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stanford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stanford 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stanford-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stanford 2005</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Donovan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donovan 2000</LINK>) reported aggression using the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) in conjunction with scores from six 'irritability' items from the anger-hostility subscale of the SCL-90, with the combined scores dichotomised to improved/not improved. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Cueva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cueva 1996</LINK>) reported additional aggression data using the aggression subscale of the Children&#8217;s Psychiatric Rating Scale (CPRS).</P>
<P>For the primary outcome of self-reported aggression, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2003</LINK>) used the Overt Aggression Scale - Modified (OAS-M) which takes the form of a clinician-rated semi-structured interview. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2008</LINK>) measured aggression using the OAS-M with slight revision by the trial investigators. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Gardner-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 1986</LINK>) reported the frequency of aggressive incidents as reported by the participants in response to questioning by the trial investigators.</P>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Conners-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Conners 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gottschalk-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Gottschalk 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenblatt-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenblatt 1976</LINK>), all carried out more than 30 years ago, did not include any formal measure of primary outcome (aggression) as defined in the protocol of this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Studies varied widely in terms of choice of secondary outcomes. Two studies included a measure of impulsivity: <LINK REF="STD-Conners-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Conners 1971</LINK> reported Porteus Maze scores, and <LINK REF="STD-Rosenblatt-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenblatt 1976</LINK> reported data from the impulsiveness subscale of a Q-sort scale developed by the investigators. Four studies included a measure of hostility: <LINK REF="STD-Cueva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cueva 1996</LINK> reported scores from the hostility subscale of the Children&#8217;s Psychiatric Rating Scale (CPRS), <LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2008</LINK> reported scores from the hostility subscale of the British Psychiatric Rating scale (BPRS), <LINK REF="STD-Gottschalk-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Gottschalk 1973</LINK> reported using three hostility subscales from a speech content analysis, and <LINK REF="STD-Rosenblatt-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenblatt 1976</LINK> reported a hostility measure from a Q-sort scale developed by the investigators. Two studies included a measure of anger: <LINK REF="STD-Conners-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Conners 1971</LINK> reported using the Rosenweig Picture Frustration Test categories, and <LINK REF="STD-Gardner-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 1986</LINK> provided data on the self-reported presence or absence of angry outbursts. No studies included any measure of quality of life. No studies included any measure of satisfaction with treatment. Eight studies included information on non-compliance as the proportion of participants discontinuing treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Donovan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donovan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gardner-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellings-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hellings 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenblatt-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenblatt 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stanford-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stanford 2005</LINK>).

The review authors were unable to decide whether this should be classified as a measure of anger or of hostility, and so considered anger-hostility as a unique secondary outcome measure (and additional to those defined in the original protocol).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effects of antiepileptic drugs on primary outcome (aggression)</HEADING>
<P>With regards the primary outcome (aggression), much of the quantitative data available from the studies included in this review met our criteria for skewed data as described in the section on <LINK TAG="EFFECT_MEASURES" TYPE="SECTION">Measures of treatment effect</LINK>. This arises in part because most studies used measurements of aggression (such as the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS)) which are based on the number of observed aggressive acts over a given period. The minimum value of such a measurement is zero (i.e. no aggressive incidents) but there is no maximum value since the number of aggressive acts that an individual can perpetuate in a given time interval has no obvious limit. Consequently, in the absence of raw data from the trial investigators, we have had no alternative but to present much of the primary outcome data in separate tables. A further consequence is that we have often had to report statistics on primary outcomes as calculated by the trial investigators rather than performing our own analysis. This absence of effect size data prevented any synthesis of primary outcome data via meta-analysis. The summaries that follow below are therefore essentially descriptive.</P>
<P>The focus of this review is relatively broad since it seeks evidence on effectiveness of any antiepileptic drug in the treatment of aggression. Considerable heterogeneity of the 14 included studies might therefore be anticipated. We found considerable difference between the studies in terms of participants, size of sample, intervention drug and choice of outcome measures. There were also differences between dosage regimes, although all doses were within the recommended range for prophylactic treatment of epilepsy according to the British National Formulary.</P>
<P>We found four antiepileptics (valproate/divalproex, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and phenytoin) which were effective, compared to placebo, in reducing aggression in at least one study, although it is important to note also that for three of these (valproate, carbamazepine and phenytoin) at least one other study showed no statistically significant difference between treatment and control conditions.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Valproate/divalproex</B> was superior to placebo at a dose of 750 mg/day on OAS aggression scores in outpatient men (<LINK REF="STD-Stanford-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stanford 2005</LINK>, using sodium valproate) (no data on adverse effects), but was not significantly different from placebo on OAS total scores for children and adolescents with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) (<LINK REF="STD-Hellings-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hellings 2005</LINK>, using sodium valproate). <LINK REF="STD-Hellings-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hellings 2005</LINK> found increased appetite significantly more likely to occur in the valproate than the placebo group. This medication was also superior to placebo at up to 30 mg/kg/day on OAS-M scores in impulsively aggressive adults with cluster B personality disorders in a relatively large trial (n = 246) in which treatment continued for 10 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2003</LINK>, using divalproex). However, <LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2003</LINK> also reports that weight gain, nausea, and any side effect were significantly more common in the divalproex than the placebo condition. Divalproex was also superior to placebo at a dose of 750 to 1500 mg/day on modified-MOAS scores in youths with conduct disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Donovan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donovan 2000</LINK>, using divalproex) although this study provided no data on adverse effects. Meta-analysis of data from <LINK REF="STD-Hellings-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hellings 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2003</LINK> indicated that participants receiving valproate/divalproex were significantly more likely to report an adverse effect (any) and to report weight gain compared to those receiving placebo.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Carbamazepine</B> was superior to placebo at a mean dose of 820 mg/day in reducing acts of self-directed aggression in a small study of women with borderline personality disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Gardner-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 1986</LINK>) (no data on adverse effects), but was not significantly different from placebo on OAS scores for children with conduct disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Cueva-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cueva 1996</LINK>) nor on CPRS aggression scores in outpatient men (<LINK REF="STD-Stanford-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stanford 2005</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>
<B>Oxcarbazepine</B> was superior to placebo at a mean dose of 1500 mg/day over 10 weeks on revised OAS-M scores for verbal aggression and aggression against objects in adult outpatients (<LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2005</LINK>), although the proportion of participants lost to follow up was statistically significant (52.5%). This study provides no data on adverse events other than noting they were generally minor and that hyponatraemia did not occur.</LI>
<LI>
<B>Phenytoin</B>, at a dose of 300 mg/day, was superior to placebo on the frequency of aggressive acts in a small study of male prisoners (<LINK REF="STD-Barratt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barratt 1991</LINK>) (no data on adverse effects), and in male prisoners with impulsive (but not premeditated) aggression (<LINK REF="STD-Barratt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barratt 1997</LINK>) with no significant difference reported between conditions for the presence of nausea. Phenytoin was also found superior to placebo on OAS scores in two studies of outpatient men (<LINK REF="STD-Stanford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stanford 2001</LINK>) and of outpatient men with personality disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Stanford-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stanford 2005</LINK>) (neither study providing data on adverse effects). Phenytoin was, however, not superior to placebo on the frequency of 'behavioural incidents' in boys (<LINK REF="STD-Conners-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Conners 1971</LINK>) during a brief study lasting only two weeks.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The protocol required that we report these comparisons classified into three specific follow up periods: (1) within the first month, (2) between one and six months, and (3) between six and 12 months (see section on <LINK TAG="EFFECT_MEASURES" TYPE="SECTION">Measures of treatment effect</LINK>). Because we were unable to perform any meta-analysis of data on the primary outcome measure (aggression), we simply provide the following descriptive summary. In the 16 comparisons of an antiepileptic drug against placebo, only two reported endpoint results within the first month (<LINK REF="STD-Barratt-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Barratt 1991</LINK> after four weeks of treatment with phenytoin; <LINK REF="STD-Conners-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Conners 1971</LINK> after two weeks of treatment with phenytoin), and none reported endpoint results at a time period greater than six months. Fourteen of the 16 comparisons thus fell within the one-to-six-month period.</P>
<P>We identified three studies in which the beneficial effect of an antiepileptic drug appeared confined to a specific type of aggression:</P>
<UL>
<LI>In the small study by <LINK REF="STD-Gardner-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 1986</LINK>, carbamazepine was found to reduce acts of aggression towards others, objects and self significantly compared to placebo, but not towards others and objects alone. Similar effects have been observed elsewhere. For example, in a non-randomised pre-post study by <LINK REF="REF-Lawson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawson 2008</LINK> for divalproex in prisoners, the authors report: <I>&#8220;surprisingly, reduction of behaviors directed against self reached significance, but disruptive behaviors directed towards others did not&#8221;</I>. This finding may be a reflection of the aetiological heterogeneity of aggression. Although there may be contextual factors that are common to self-directed aggression and aggression directed at others, it is likely that there will be distinct processes that influence how aggressive urges are manifest in behaviour.</LI>
<LI>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Barratt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barratt 1997</LINK>, where phenytoin was found to significantly reduce acts of impulsive aggression, but not premeditated aggression, compared to placebo. This is in line with evidence from the wider literature on aggression which suggests that different forms of aggression to others are underpinned by different mechanisms. The differences between impulsive or reactive aggression and premeditated or instrumental aggression have been well documented (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Blair-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blair 2001</LINK>). We suggest therefore that studies evaluating the effectiveness of interventions for aggression should use outcome measures that enable distinctions to be made according to the evidence-based typologies of aggression.</LI>
<LI>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2005</LINK>, where oxcarbazepine had a statistically significant effect on verbal aggression and aggression against objects but not on aggression against others. This finding would suggest that, as well as accounting for different types of aggression, outcome measures should be employed that allow differential effects by severity to be tested.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We identified one study in which the beneficial effect of an antiepileptic drug appeared confined to participants with a particular diagnosis.</P>
<UL>
<LI>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2003</LINK>, divalproex was found to significantly reduce aggression in participants with cluster B personality disorder, but not with post traumatic stress disorder or intermittent explosive disorder. One possibility is that cluster B personality disorders are more likely to be associated with both low-anxiety premeditated aggression (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-DeBrito-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeBrito 2009</LINK>, p.143) and high-anxiety impulsive/reactive aggression, whereas post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and intermittent explosive disorder (IED) are more likely to be associated with only high-anxiety reactive impulsive aggression. This may arise from hypervigilance in the case of PTSD, and from sudden emotional outbursts in the case of IED.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment compliance and attrition</HEADING>
<P>There were eight comparisons in which compliance was reported, in each case as the proportion of participants leaving the study early: valproate/divalproex versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Donovan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Donovan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hellings-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hellings 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stanford-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stanford 2005</LINK>); carbamazepine versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Stanford-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stanford 2005</LINK>); oxcarbazepine versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2005</LINK>); phenytoin (<LINK REF="STD-Stanford-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Stanford 2005</LINK>). In none of these did the difference between intervention and control reach statistical significance. However, in their study of oxcarbazepine versus placebo, <LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2005</LINK> found attrition due to ineffectiveness to be significantly more likely in the placebo group.</P>
<P>The protocol required that we consider separately any studies where the rate of attrition exceeded 50%. We identified one study (<LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2005</LINK>) where the proportion of participants lost to follow up compared to the number randomised was 52.5%, but here the results are already presented separately since this was the only study on oxcarbazepine. Statistics on rates of attrition in the 14 studies are given in the section on <LINK TAG="EXCLUSIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Incomplete outcome data</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>The information on adverse events from the studies included in this review is relatively sparse with only five of the fourteen trials providing data. This is of concern because absence of such information does not necessarily mean that the treatment is safe, nor that the potential gains from the medication necessarily balance the risk of an adverse event occurring.</P>
<P>In this review we have included data on the three most common adverse effects reported for each trial, and have additionally included data on weight gain/loss where this has been presented by the trial investigators. Data on the occurrence of leucopenia has also been included where available on account of the potential seriousness of this adverse event. Statistically significant differences between conditions emerged in two studies with side effects more commonly noted for the intervention group in each case: increased appetite was more common in the valproate condition (<LINK REF="STD-Hellings-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hellings 2005</LINK>), and weight gain, nausea and any side effect were more common in the divalproex condition (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2003</LINK>). Meta-analysis of data from <LINK REF="STD-Hellings-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hellings 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hollander-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 2003</LINK> indicated that participants receiving valproate/divalproex were significantly more likely to report an adverse effect (any) and to report weight gain compared to those receiving placebo.</P>
<P>A detailed side effect profile is, however, available for each of the drugs investigated here since each is (or has been) licensed for use in epilepsy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>No studies reported on quality of life or satisfaction with care. Two studies reported on impulsivity (<LINK REF="STD-Conners-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Conners 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenblatt-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenblatt 1976</LINK>)<B> </B>and two reported on anger (<LINK REF="STD-Conners-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Conners 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gardner-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gardner 1986</LINK>) although none detected any statistically significant difference between treatment conditions. <LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2005</LINK> reported on British Psychiatric Rating scale (BPRS) hostility, with results favouring oxcarbazepine over placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Stanford-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stanford 2001</LINK> reported on Profile of Moods Scale (POMS) anger-hostility, with results favouring phenytoin over placebo.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-01-12 12:05:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whilst the evidence obtained from the identified studies is relevant to the review question, it is incomplete. In terms of interventions, the included studies addressed only five types of antiepileptic drug, whereas 13 are currently listed in the British National Formulary; these include a significant number of so-called 'second-generation' antiepileptic drugs that are purported to have better tolerability and a lower potential for interactions with other drugs. However, most of the studies identified in this review are of first-generation antiepileptics (i.e. sodium valproate/divalproex, carbamazepine, phenytoin), and so the second-generation antiepileptics are under-represented.</P>
<P>In terms of participants, the differences between the studies in terms of sex and age were considerable (for example, six studies were male-only, one was female-only, and four involved children or youths). In terms of outcomes, there was inconsistency in the way primary and secondary outcomes were measured and reported, and the different types of aggression were poorly differentiated. We conclude that the studies identified are insufficient to address all the objectives of the review. This limits the review's external validity.</P>

<P>We identified 14 studies that met the criteria for inclusion in this review, involving a total of 672 participants. We judged the overall quality of the evidence from these trials to be relatively poor for the following reasons.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The mean number of participants per study was only 54.4 (median 34.0) which is small compared to most drug trials.</LI>
<LI>The studies were carried out in a number of very different settings, including prisons, hospitals and in the community, and there was considerable heterogeneity of participants in terms of age and clinical diagnosis.</LI>
<LI>None of the studies followed up participants beyond the end of the intervention period.</LI>
<LI>There was considerable variation in how the studies were reported, and the information provided by the trial investigators in their published reports was often insufficient to allow a valid judgement to be made on the quality of their investigations. Attempts to contact the investigators for additional information that would allow decisions to be made on the risk of bias were not always successful.</LI>
<LI>Rates of attrition were significant in some studies, and ranged from zero to 52.5%.</LI>
<LI>A significant proportion of the primary (aggression) outcome data from these studies appeared not to be normally distributed, which prevented use of meta-analysis to pool results and provide a quantitative summary.</LI>

<P>We were unable to identify any recent systematic review covering precisely the area defined in our protocol. However, two systematic reviews focusing more broadly on interventions for aggression have been published within the last three years, and we compare our findings with these.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Goedhard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goedhard 2006</LINK> reviewed 35 studies of various classes of medication (including antiepileptics) in the treatment of outward-directed aggressive behaviour within general adult psychiatry. As with the current review, only randomised controlled trials were included and applications in acute or emergency situations were excluded. They found six studies where an antiepileptic drug was the experimental condition, with the antiepileptic medication superior to placebo in three studies, each involving outpatients with cluster B personality disorders (divalproex in two studies; topiramate in one study). In comparison, our current review identified a greater number of relevant studies. This arises partly because additional relevant studies have been published in the last three years and partly because we searched more electronic databases with a more expansive search strategy. We identified the same six studies as <LINK REF="REF-Goedhard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goedhard 2006</LINK>, but excluded five of these because the two reviews differed in their inclusion and exclusion criteria. We required that study participants had displayed recurrent aggression, whereas <LINK REF="REF-Goedhard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goedhard 2006</LINK> included studies of <I>&#8220;psychiatric patients in whom aggression might be an ongoing problem&#8221;</I>. Additionally, we included only placebo-controlled studies whereas <LINK REF="REF-Goedhard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goedhard 2006</LINK> did not have this restriction. <LINK REF="REF-Goedhard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goedhard 2006</LINK> concluded that there was <I>&#8220;weak evidence of efficacy in the management of aggression in Cluster B personality disordered outpatients&#8221;</I> with <I>&#8220;no serious adverse effects observed or reported,&#8221;</I> but no strong evidence of efficacy overall. Our findings are similar in that we also found no strong evidence of efficacy, but we have been able to report on eight comparisons involving five different drugs where medication was superior to placebo.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Connor-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 2006</LINK> conducted a systematic review of both drug treatments and psychosocial interventions for juvenile aggression using an age limit of 18 years. They found four randomised studies where an antiepileptic drug was the experimental condition, with divalproex superior to placebo in two of these. We identified the same four studies as <LINK REF="REF-Connor-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 2006</LINK>, but excluded one that was not placebo-controlled. <LINK REF="REF-Connor-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 2006</LINK> concluded that divalproex sodium (and lithium) had been found effective in reducing aggression in children and adolescents with conduct disorder, but that it was predominately reactive, impulsive affective aggression that responded to medication. Our conclusions, based on a single study, are similar for individuals in this age group, and we have identified additional evidence to suggest that it is impulsive rather than premeditated aggression that appears more responsive to antiepileptic medication. <LINK REF="REF-Connor-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 2006</LINK> also concluded, as do we, that most studies do not distinguish the different forms of aggression and that this is an important area for future research.</P>

Current use of antiepileptic drugs to treat aggression in clinical practice remains a matter for the prescribing physician who will wish to weigh the limited evidence of effectiveness against any risk of possible harm; it should ideally be based on consultation with the multi-disciplinary team involved in individual care.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-01-13 12:44:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Further well-designed, placebo-controlled randomised trials are needed. Studies with positive findings reported here require replicating to confirm apparent efficacy, and further work is needed to explain the inconsistent findings reported for valproate/divalproex, carbamazepine and phenytoin (where at least one other study showed no statistically significant difference between treatment and control conditions). The design of such trials should take into account that aggression is a phenomenon for which there are likely to be many causal mechanisms and manifestations (<LINK REF="REF-McGuire-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGuire 2008</LINK>). We suggest attempts be made in future research to delineate different forms of aggression as well as measuring its severity and recording the diagnostic profile of the participant. Examples of different forms of aggression would include: directed at self versus others, reactive versus instrumental, relationship domain within which aggression displayed, presence versus absence of intoxication, and sexual versus non-sexual.</P>

<P>The review includes two additional outcomes not specified in the original protocol. These were:</P>
<OL>
<LI>number of overall clinical responders (reported by <LINK REF="STD-Hellings-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hellings 2005</LINK> in a trial of valproate for outpatient children and adolescents with pervasive developmental disorder);</LI>
<LI>patient-rated global improvement (reported by <LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2008</LINK> in a trial of levetiracetam and by <LINK REF="STD-Mattes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mattes 2005</LINK> in a trial of oxcarbazepine, both for outpatients with intermittent explosive disorder).</LI>
</OL>
<P>We chose to include them because none of the prespecified outcomes provided information on global change.</P>
<P>The review omits two analyses specified in the original protocol because of insufficient data. These were:</P>
<OL>
<LI>subgroup analysis of effect on primary outcome of participants' age, diagnosis, setting and class of drug.</LI>
<LI>sensitivity analysis to investigate the robustness of findings concerning concealment of allocation, blinding of outcome assessors, and extent of dropouts.</LI>

<P>Reported as part of the complete study involving cross-over trials with placebo and 4 active medications (only one of which was an antiepileptic). This study was limited to: <I>&#8220;the preliminary findings regarding behavioral dyscontrol during the carbamazepine and placebo trials&#8221;</I> (p.520 col. 1).

<P>There was a 1-week placebo washout period between phases in this cross-over trial. Trial investigators report no significant cross-over effects for the aggression measures for the combined groups suggesting the study was not biased by carry-over effects. However, of 150 randomised, results reported for only 60 of 126 completers (30 of which committed primarily impulsive and 30 of which committed primarily premeditated aggression; the remaining 66 had committed mixed types of aggression and were not included). Thus there is the possibility of bias through excluding the &#8216;mixed aggression&#8217; group, although it is unclear what effect this would have on the results.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>An extensive history of behavioural dyscontrol (which the investigators take to include self-harm) was an inclusion criterion for this study. The study is included in this review since the participants were not recruited solely on the basis of having self-harmed. However, it is possible that 2 of the participants had not demonstrated episodes of either rage or violence and so may not have been aggressive other than to themselves. Clarification has been requested from the trial investigators, but no further information was available at the time this review was prepared. The study appeared to be free of other sources of bias, and the trial investigators report a 1-week placebo washout period between phases in this cross-over trial which will have reduced the possibility of carryover effects.</P>
