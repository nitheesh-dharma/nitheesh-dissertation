Synopsis added &lt;br&gt;2. Likely relevant studies from the update search included under 'Studies awaiting assessment' with explanatory paragraph under 'Description of Studies'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replies to points made by Paul in his Email to me dates 11 11 01 15.24&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have edited this, but it needs a few things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. The referee who responded questioned your use of 'clinical &lt;br&gt;significance', especially in the Abstract. I think that this a fair &lt;br&gt;point. In the text I have tended to change 'significant' or &lt;br&gt;'meaningful' to 'worthwhile', but at least in the abstract I think &lt;br&gt;that you should stick to values in the results and confine your &lt;br&gt;comment about significance to the Reviewers conclusions. (Note: when &lt;br&gt;you put in any continuous data can you put it in the 'right way &lt;br&gt;round'. As you know this review uses the 'old' data entry convention. &lt;br&gt;I made that point in a cuople of places in the text)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. The other main point from the referee concerns the Pauwels study &lt;br&gt;inclusion criteria. I think that you give a reasonable description of &lt;br&gt;the problems around the interpretation of this trial in the &lt;br&gt;Discussion, but I agree with him that it does need a more full &lt;br&gt;discussion perhaps with its own subheading under Description of &lt;br&gt;Studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. There were no other sig comments from referee apart from a &lt;br&gt;complaint that it was a complex review. Well -  tough !&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. I have tidied up the description of the results. You seem to slip &lt;br&gt;in some other trials under some headings eg 200 vs 400 mcg/d includes &lt;br&gt;comments on 200 vs 800 arms. This may be why the ref complained a &lt;br&gt;bit.  I have changed things around in the 200 vs 400 and 400 vs 800 &lt;br&gt;subheadings. Can you check that I got it right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. A reference is needed for the cortisol results under the &lt;br&gt;subheading 800 vs 1600 mcg/d.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. I have severely reduced the Implications for Practice (please &lt;br&gt;check that you agree with me).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Can you write a lay synopsis (contact Steve for advise please).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;I made the following changes in the data tables:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.The outcomes for comparison 3 were incorrectly numbered from 02. These have been relabelled from 1 to 13. The outcome 'Change in night-time asthma symptom score compared to baseline did not have any data and should have been removed before, I overlooked this. This has been removed. &lt;br&gt;2.Comparison 03 01 (Morning PEFR L/min) originally 03 02  - axis label LEFT changed from 400 mcg to 'Favours 800 mcg/d'&lt;br&gt;3.Comparison 03 07 (change in clinic breathlessness score compared to baseline) originally 03 08  - axis label RIGHT corrected to 'Favours 800 mcg/d'&lt;br&gt;4.Comparison 19 04 (daily use of beta2 agonists puffs/day: changed Group labels to Low dose (LEFT) and High dose (RIGHT), corrected Meta-analysis graph labels to 'Favours Lower dose' (LEFT) and 'Favours higher dose (RIGHT)&lt;br&gt;5.Comparison 19 05 (withdrawal due to asthma exacerbation (No. of patients) Corrected graph Labels and meta-analysis labels in the same way as 19 04.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made the following changes in the text:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I make a reference to the BUD v placebo review: 'Adams 2000'. This was not actually on the library when I first gave Paul this review for editing. I have inserted this reference and made the hyperlink for it in the text: Adams 2001&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description of studies:&lt;br&gt;Under the section asthma severity I have made further comments about the Pauwels 1997a/1997b study, emphasising that this is the well known FACET study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changed the following:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Moderate to severe asthma&lt;br&gt;In one study (Pauwels 1997a/Pauwels 1997b) use of a regular ICS was an inclusion criterion for the study. The mean daily dose of BDP or BUD used by patients randomised to treatment was between 823 and 856 mcg/d.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TO:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Moderate to severe asthma: the FACET study&lt;br&gt;In one study use of a regular ICS was an inclusion criterion. This is was the multicentre trial undertaken by the Formoterol and Corticosteroids Establishing Therapy (FACET) International Study Group (Pauwels 1997a/Pauwels 1997b) This was a large study (852 adults) in which the relative efficacy of budesonide at either 200 mcg/d or 800 mcg/d were evaluated, either with or without the addition of formoterol 24 mcg/d in a four arm parallel group design. The mean daily dose of beclomethasone/budesonide used by patients randomised to treatment was between 823 and 856 mcg/d. This is an influential study and is discussed in detail below (see Results: 200 v 800 mcg/d).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Typo removed &amp;quot;c) did not include a treatment arm with (AN removed) inhaled budesonide&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Because the data were stripped of the negative values originally used for data entry the following paragraph has been removed from Data Analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In this review data were entered using an 'old' convention in which positive continuous data were given a negative sign to permit the Metaview graphs to follow the Cochrane convention that a beneficial treatment effect lies to the left of the line if no difference&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. The abreviation'OCS' has been removed and replaced with 'oral steroids' - term appears only once (this instance) in the text, hence its replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Under Outcomes typo with failed hyperlink: Wolthers 1990 should be Wolthers 1991, Wolthers 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;Under 400 v 800&lt;br&gt;I have grouped together the descriptions of results for the 2 crossover studies that included this comparison as a separate paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One further crossover design study (Boe 1989), of good quality (Jadad score 4) in patients with moderately severe disease (level of control unclear) also assessed BUD 400 v 800 mcg/d in adult patients. No numerical data were presented but no significant differences between doses were apparent for FEV1, morning PEFR, evening PEFR or daily symptom score. One three limbed crossover study allowed a comparison of 400 vs 800 mcg/d (Swystun 1998), but no significant difference between any measured outcome was apparent.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under 200 v 800&lt;br&gt;I have removed the negative signs from the meta-analysis results in this paragraph. For example:&lt;br&gt;morning PEFR, WMD -1.5 L/min (95% CI, -16 to 13 L/min).&lt;br&gt;Has been changed to:&lt;br&gt;morning PEFR, WMD 1.5 L/min (95% CI, -13 to 16 L/min).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-07-21 15:15:38 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson" REVIEW_NO="IBU1-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.14" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="5.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Budesonide is an inhaled corticosteroid used to treat the inflammation of airways (passages to the lungs) that occurs in asthma. This review presents the effects of budesonide at different doses for people with varying degrees of asthma. In patients with mild-moderate asthma no important differences were apparent between the lowest dose (200 mcg/d) and the highest dose (1600 mcg/d) for measures of airway opening and symptoms. However, patients with more severe asthma are less likely to experience an acute worsening of their asthma control when a higher dose (1600 mcg/d) is used regularly compared to a lower dose (200 mcg/d). Future research should report results more comprehensively, and should use quality of life questionnaires. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-21 15:07:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>24 studies met the inclusion for the review (3907 participants). In non-oral steroid treated, mild to moderately severe asthma, no clinically worthwhile differences in FEV1, morning PEFR, symptom scores or rescue beta2 agonist use were apparent across a dose range of 200-1600 mcg/d. However, in moderate to severe asthma a significant reduction in the likelihood of trial withdrawal due to asthma exacerbation was apparent when treating patients with BUD 800 mcg/d compared to 200 mcg/d: Relative Risk 3.93 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 10.9). This result was weighted largely by a single, large, high quality RCT. In severe asthma significant improvements favouring high dose BUD (1600 mcg/d) over low dose (200 mcg/d) were apparent for FEV1 but not morning PEFR. This finding was based on two large RCTs of good quality. In oral steroid treated asthmatics no dose dependent oral steroid sparing effect was apparent for BUD 1600 mcg/d v 800 or 400 mcg/d. Statistically significant, dose dependent suppression of 24 hour urinary free cortisol excretion and serum cortisol post synthetic ACTH infusion over the dose range 800-3200 mcg/d was apparent but the clinical significance of these findings is unclear.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Budesonide exhibits a significant dose response effect between low and high dose for improvement in FEV1 in severe asthma and reduction of exacerbations in moderate to severe asthma. No significant dose dependent improvements in FEV1, PEFR or symptoms are evident in non-oral steroid treated asthmatics with mild to moderate disease. Dose dependent alterations in sensitive measures of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function were evident but the clinical significance of these changes is unclear.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-21 15:13:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Asthma is common disorder affecting children and adults, is increasing in incidence and constitutes a significant worldwide health problem. It is generally acknowledged that whatever the genetic factors determining the likelihood of developing disease or specific allergic/non-allergic precipitants in particular individuals, a phenotype characterised by persistent inflammation of the airway mucosa and allied structures is common to all asthmatic individuals. Resulting airway hyper-responsiveness with variable airway calibre probably account for the majority of symptoms experienced by asthmatic patients. Avoidance of the specific exacerbating factors (where they can be identified) may help some patients but is often difficult to achieve; altering the genetic pre-disposition to asthma development is not currently a therapeutic option. Pharmacological treatment to reduce airway inflammation is therefore the cornerstone of therapy for most asthmatic patients. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are anti-inflammatory agents that have been available for the treatment of asthma for over 30 years; budesonide (BUD) was introduced in the early 1980's and had been widely used since. </P>
<P>It would seem intuitive that greater efficacy would result from using higher doses of ICS, in other words that a dose-response relationship exists for ICS. A previous systematic review has shown that budesonide leads to significant improvements in measures of airway calibre, symptoms and bronchial hyper-responsiveness compared to placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2001</LINK>). Having established the basic efficacy of budesonide we were interested in assessing how this response varies with dose. This question is best addressed by a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that compares one nominal daily dose of budesonide to a second nominal daily dose using the same delivery system. This review systematically evaluates the evidence from these RCTs in a qualitative and quantitative manner.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>1. To assess the efficacy and safety outcomes in studies that have compared one nominal daily dose of budesonide to a second nominal daily dose of budesonide in treating chronic asthma. </P>
<P>2. To establish whether a dose response relationship exists for budesonide in the treatment of chronic asthma.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-07-21 15:10:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Only prospective randomised trials were included. Double, single and unblinded studies were considered.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies assessing children and adults with chronic asthma were included. Studies concerned with acute asthma and/or exclusively concerned with infants (two years of age or less) were excluded. Studies enrolling both asthmatic patients and COPD sufferers were included, provided the data for asthma subjects was separately available. Studies carried out in primary care, institutional care and the hospital outpatient setting were eligible for inclusion.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Budesonide at one nominal daily dose delivered by mouth inhalation versus a different nominal daily dose. Treatment periods needed to be at least one week. Studies using pressurised aerosol metered dose inhalers (MDI) with or without spacer or dry powder inhalers (DPI) were eligible for inclusion; studies using any type of nebuliser were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>All outcome measures were considered. Outcomes reported as both absolute values and change compared to baseline were considered. Important outcomes identified a priori were as follows:</P>
<P>1. Outcomes reflecting airway calibre: FEV1, morning and evening PEFR, diurnal variability in diary card PEFR.<BR/>2. Asthma symptoms<BR/>3. Rescue short-acting beta2 agonist use<BR/>4. Bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) to histamine and methacholine<BR/>5. Quality of life <BR/>6. Asthma exacerbations: hospital admission rates, days off work or school, unscheduled doctor visits due to exacerbation<BR/>7. Safety outcomes: hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function reflected in serum and urinary cortisol measures<BR/>8. Oropharyngeal side effects: hoarseness, sore throat, oropharyngeal Candidiasis</P>

<P>Stage 1:<BR/>A search was carried out of the Cochrane Airways Group Trial Register. This consists of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and has been compiled from searches of MEDLINE (1966-1999), EMBASE (1980-1999) and CINAHL (1982-1999) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR). It is also augmented by RCTs found as a result of hand searching 20 of the leading respiratory care journals. The following search terms were applied:</P>
<P>steroid* OR glucocorticoid* OR corticosteroid* OR beclomethasone</P>
<P>OR budesonide OR fluticasone OR triamcinolone OR flunisolide OR</P>
<P>Becotide OR Becloforte OR Pulmicort OR Flixotide</P>
<P>The electronic abstracts of citations resulting from this search were then imported into a bibliographic database and termed the inhaled steroid register. This was hand-searched by two reviewers (NPA and JB) for duplicate publications, which were removed.</P>
<P>Stage 2:<BR/>The inhaled steroid register was searched using the following terms:</P>
<P>budesonide OR Pulmicort</P>
<P>Electronic abstracts were exported to a new database and termed the budesonide register. Citations were initially excluded if it was clear that the study:</P>
<P>a) Was not concerned with treatment of chronic asthma in humans<BR/>b) Was not an RCT<BR/>c) Did not include a treatment arm with inhaled budesonide</P>

<OTHER_SEARCHES MODIFIED="2008-07-21 15:08:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The bibliographies of all papers retrieved in full text form and relevant narrative reviews were searched for additional publications. The British Journal of Clinical Research and the European Journal of Clinical Research were hand searched for relevant studies. Authors of included studies were contacted and asked if they were aware of further studies. The European headquarters of Astra Zeneca manufacturers of Pulmicort were contacted to find details of studies sponsored that may have been missed. Finally, the proceedings of meetings of the European Respiratory Society (1997/1998), British Thoracic Society (1997/1998) and American Thoracic Society (1997 to 1999) were searched for relevant trials.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-07-21 15:10:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>One reviewer (NPA) extracted data for each outcome from the published results of included trials. In the case of continuous outcomes such as spirometry:</P>
<P>1. Where outcomes were evaluated at a number of time points, only data from the last evaluable time point was used.<BR/>2. Data were extracted from graphical plots when presented in this form; and an attempt was made to verify such data by contacting authors.<BR/>3. If an intention-to-treat analysis was not used by the investigators, and it was not explicit in the presentation of results how many subjects were in each group at the time of last evaluation of that outcome, the appropriate N value for each intervention group was calculated by subtracting the number of patients who withdrew in each intervention group from those randomised to each intervention group.<BR/>
<BR/>Authors were written to (by mail, fax and/or electronic mail) on at least two occasions to clarify details of randomisation and/or request missing outcome data. Attempt was made to send requests to correct current addresses by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE and hospital World Wide Web (WWW) sites for up- to-date contact details. Astra Zeneca were approached for data for those trials in which contact authors did not initially reply or when authors suggested doing so and which the company had sponsored.</P>

<P>A weighted treatment effect across trials was calculated using the Cochrane statistical package RevMan 4.0.4 with MetaView 3.1. For continuous outcomes, a weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) was calculated as appropriate. For dichotomous outcomes a relative risk (RR) was calculated. Pooled treatments effects are expressed with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Heterogeneity of effect size across studies pooled was calculated, with p&lt; 0.05 used as the cut-off level for significance. A number of a priori conditions were established regarding the comparisons made:</P>
<P>1. Studies were categorised into those in which patients were a) not treated with regular oral steroids b) dependent upon regular oral steroid treatment prior to study. It was recognised, a priori, that trials in which the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids was being assessed in patients dependent upon oral steroids may have an 'oral steroid down-titration' design using reduction in the use of oral steroids as an outcome measure, whilst maintaining a given level of asthma control. However, studies in which patients were not treated with regular oral steroids are more likely to have a design aimed at detecting improvements in asthma control. It would be inappropriate to combine trials with such different designs and aims.</P>
<P>2. The results of parallel and crossover trials were not pooled because there is no agreement on the methods for this.</P>
<P>3. It was anticipated that measures of bronchial hyper-responsiveness (PD20 FEV1, PC20 FEV1) would often be reported as geometric means. Presentation of results in this way indicates that data has been logarithmically transformed prior to analysis by investigators to take account of skewed distribution. Data for such outcomes were only pooled across studies where the mean and standard deviation of logged values (from which geometric means are derived) could be calculated.</P>

<P>28 publications (representing 24 studies) met the inclusion criteria for the review. All were published in English, although none were excluded on the basis of language.</P>
<P>We would like to draw the reader's attention to the 17 citations listed under Studies awaiting assessment. Due to unforeseen delays in the publication of this review, a number of potentially relevant trials have been identified after an updated search of the electronic sources from April 1999 - August 2001. These studies will be fully evaluated and included as appropriate in a future update at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
<P>Populations<BR/>The studies were conducted in North America (USA, Canada) Europe (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands, Turkey, UK) and Israel. 7 (30%) studies assessed children, 16 (70%) studies were in adult asthmatics.</P>
<P>Diagnosis of asthma<BR/>Country specific or international asthma guideline criteria were used in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Boe 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Busse-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jonasson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jonasson 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Molen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van der Molen 1998</LINK>). In five (21%) studies it was stated that patients had episodic respiratory symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of asthma; in eight (33%) studies 15% or greater FEV1/PEFR variability over time or reversibility in response to short acting beta2 agonist was an inclusion criterion. In three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Juniper-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Juniper 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kraan-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kraan 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Swystun-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swystun 1998</LINK>) the diagnosis of asthma was supported by demonstrable methacholine BHR (PC20 FEV1 &lt; 8 mg/ml). In seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aaronson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Aaronson 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Agertoft-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Agertoft 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Laursen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Laursen 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Toogood-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Toogood 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tukiainen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tukiainen 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wolthers-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wolthers 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wolthers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wolthers 1992</LINK>) the criteria upon which a diagnosis of asthma was made was not clear.</P>
<P>Asthma severity<BR/>Attempt was made to classify asthma severity for patients' enrolled to each study using current <LINK REF="REF-GINA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 1995</LINK>/<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1997</LINK> criteria. This classification of severity is based upon FEV1 (% predicted), frequency of symptoms and exacerbations and diurnal PEFR variability. Four grades of severity are defined: severe, moderate, mild persistent and mild intermittent. The classification applies to untreated patients. These guidelines also recommend a range of daily doses of ICS for disease at each severity grade. For example, BUD 200-400 mcg/d for mild persistent disease, 400-600 mcg/d for moderate disease, &gt; 600 mcg/d for severe disease in adult patients. For studies in which patients were using an ICS at the time of enrolment, an attempt was made to classify severity according to baseline ICS use using these ranges.</P>
<P>Severe asthma<BR/>In two parallel group design studies (<LINK REF="STD-Laursen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Laursen 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1998</LINK>) and one crossover design study (<LINK REF="STD-Tukiainen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tukiainen 1987</LINK>), dependence on oral prednisolone for asthma control was an inclusion criterion. The parallel group studies were conducted with the primary objective of determining if inhaled BUD demonstrated a dose dependent oral corticosteroid sparing effect. In two further parallel group studies (<LINK REF="STD-Busse-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 1998a</LINK>) and two crossover studies (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Toogood-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Toogood 1984</LINK>) a proportion of enrolled patients were treated with oral corticosteroids for asthma control. In these trials no attempt was made to taper the oral corticosteroid dose. In the studies recruiting oral corticosteroid treated asthmatics, baseline symptom frequency was not reported at all; however in those studies which reported baseline FEV1 (% predicted) this was significantly reduced in all cases (see Included study characteristics). It appears that asthma control was sub optimal in most of these studies. Demonstration of a requirement in most/all recruited patients for oral steroid treatment would class the asthmatic in these studies as having severe disease.</P>
<P>Moderate to severe asthma: the FACET study<BR/>In one study use of a regular ICS was an inclusion criterion. This is was the multicentre trial undertaken by the Formoterol and Corticosteroids Establishing Therapy (FACET) International Study Group (<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997a</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997b</LINK>). This was a large study (852 adults) in which the relative efficacy of budesonide at either 200 mcg/d or 800 mcg/d were evaluated, either with or without the addition of formoterol 24 mcg/d in a four arm parallel group design. The mean daily dose of beclomethasone/budesonide used by patients randomised to treatment was between 823 and 856 mcg/d. This is an influential study and is discussed in detail below (see Results: 200 v 800 mcg/d).</P>
<P>Mild to moderate asthma<BR/>In the four studies that enrolled non-ICS treated asthmatics, there was an indication that symptoms were not adequately controlled at the time of enrolment (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Molen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van der Molen 1998</LINK>). In these studies asthma severity was classed as mild to moderate. In five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Boe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Boe 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Juniper-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Juniper 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kraan-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kraan 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rees-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 1993</LINK>) some/all patients were receiving a regular ICS at the time of enrolment.</P>
<P>Mild asthma<BR/>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Agertoft-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Agertoft 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wolthers-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wolthers 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wolthers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wolthers 1992</LINK>) gave no indication of symptom frequency or baseline FEV1 (% predicted) hence the degree of severity and level of control was unclear although investigators stated that disease was mild. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aaronson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Aaronson 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jonasson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jonasson 1998</LINK>) no indication of symptom frequency at baseline was provided, but baseline FEV1 (% predicted) of enrolled patients approached 100 %. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Swystun-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swystun 1998</LINK>) symptom control was clearly good, and baseline FEV1 &gt; 74 % predicted. In these studies asthma severity was classed as mild.</P>
<P>Study design<BR/>15 (63%) studies were of a parallel group design; nine (37%) were crossover studies. Only four crossover design studies employed a washout period between treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Agertoft-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Agertoft 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Swystun-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swystun 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Toogood-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Toogood 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wolthers-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wolthers 1991</LINK>). 10 (42%) studies employed a treatment period of between one and four weeks, 11 (46%) had a treatment period of one to five months. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Juniper-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Juniper 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997a</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1996</LINK>) employed a treatment period of between nine and 12 months.</P>
<P>Interventions<BR/>Ranges of different nominal daily doses of BUD were compared (see Included study characteristics). Identical delivery devices (either MDI, MDI+spacer or DPI) were used to deliver different nominal daily doses of BUD in all studies. In one six period crossover study (<LINK REF="STD-Toogood-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Toogood 1984</LINK>) patients received BUD with both MDI and MDI+spacer during different treatment periods. One study (Pauwels 1997) employed four parallel intervention groups: BUD 200 mcg/d, BUD 800 mcg/d, BUD 200 mcg/d+formoterol 24 mcg/d, BUD 800 mcg/d+formoterol 24 mcg/d. The latter two intervention groups were included in the meta-analysis. The rationale for this is as follows: an additive effect of formoterol and BUD was assumed, and since we were interested in the relative efficacy of the two doses of BUD, it seemed appropriate to treat formoterol given by equal doses in each group as a controlled intervention that would not influence the relative efficacy comparison between the two doses of BUD. To include these results, the Pauwels study has been listed as two studies: <LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997b</LINK>. This was necessary to allow inclusion of data for the second comparison group in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Outcomes<BR/>A wide range of efficacy and safety outcomes was assessed (see Included study characteristics). A number of studies evaluated specific outcomes that have not been considered in this review. These included growth assessment by lower leg knemometry (<LINK REF="STD-Agertoft-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Agertoft 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wolthers-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wolthers 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wolthers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wolthers 1992</LINK>) and biochemical markers of bone turnover (<LINK REF="STD-Wolthers-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wolthers 1991</LINK>). These are the subject of separate reviews in preparation. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Rees-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 1993</LINK>) included a cost effectiveness analysis. Cost effectiveness of ICS's is likely to be the subject of a future analysis and has not been considered here. Incomplete outcome data that could not be included in the meta-analysis is listed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>

<P>The overall quality of included studies was high. All studies were randomised. 21 (88%) were double blind, and in 19 (80%) the number of patients withdrawn and the reasons for withdrawal were stated. 19 (80%) of studies were graded with a Jadad score of three or greater. Only five (20%) studies were graded with a Jadad score of 2 or less. In eight (33%) studies allocation concealment was clearly employed.</P>

<P>A single parallel design study (<LINK REF="STD-Jonasson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jonasson 1998</LINK>) of high quality (Jadad score 4) in children with mild, controlled asthma (163 subjects) assessed the relative efficacy of BUD 100 v 200 mcg/d over a 12 week treatment period. No significant difference in the maximal percentage fall in FEV1 following a six minute exercise test was apparent between treatment groups: WMD 0.7% (95% CI -2.0 to 3.5 %). Similarly no differences between doses were apparent for FEV1, morning PEFR, daytime and night-time symptom scores or methacholine BHR (PD20 FEV1).</P>
<P>A single crossover design study of high quality (Jadad score 4) in 19 children with moderate, uncontrolled asthma assessed BUD 100 v 200 with four week treatment periods (<LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1995</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="6">200 v 400 mcg/d</HEADING>
<P>Three crossover design studies assessed the relative efficacy of BUD 200 v 400 mcg/d. All recruited inhaled steroid naïve asthmatics. Two enrolled children, with either mild asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Agertoft-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Agertoft 1997</LINK>) or moderate, uncontrolled asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1995</LINK>). One assessed adults with mild, controlled disease (<LINK REF="STD-Swystun-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swystun 1998</LINK>). They were of high methodological quality (Jadad score 4). Treatment periods ranged between one and four weeks. A number of common outcomes were assessed: FEV1, morning PEFR, evening PEFR, daytime and night-time symptom scores, 24 hour urinary free cortisol excretion (corrected for urinary creatinine). No significant differences were apparent between the BUD doses for these outcomes in any study, although data were not presented in a form suitable for inclusion in a meta-analysis. However, <LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1995</LINK> demonstrated a significantly smaller drop in post exercise test FEV1 for patients receiving 400 mcg/d (9.9%) compared to 200 mcg/d (20.1%), p &lt;0.01. No significant differences were found for allergen and methacholine bronchial hyper-responsiveness expressed as PC15 FEV1 (<LINK REF="STD-Swystun-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swystun 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">400 v 800 mcg/d</HEADING>
<P>Three parallel group studies assessed the relative efficacy and safety of BUD 400 v 800 mcg/d. One enrolled ICS naïve adults with mild, sub-optimally controlled asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998b</LINK>) and was of high methodological quality (Jadad score 4); one study enrolled adults with moderately severe uncontrolled asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Rees-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 1993</LINK>) and was graded poorly for quality (Jadad score 1). Both were large studies (&gt;500 adult subjects) and had intervention periods of six weeks. The third study assessed children with mild asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Wolthers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wolthers 1992</LINK>) and was of high quality (Jadad score 5). Different outcomes were assessed in each study. No significant differences were apparent between doses for change in morning PEFR, rescue beta2 agonist use or symptom scores compared to baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1998b</LINK>); morning PEFR, evening PEFR or rescue beta2 agonist use (<LINK REF="STD-Rees-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wolthers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wolthers 1992</LINK>); daytime symptom score or and sleep disturbance score (Rees 1992); FEV1 (<LINK REF="STD-Wolthers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wolthers 1992</LINK>). One three limbed crossover study allowed a comparison of 400 vs 800 mcg/d (<LINK REF="STD-Swystun-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swystun 1998</LINK>), but no significant difference between any measured outcome was apparent.</P>
<P>A single, high quality (Jadad score 4) parallel group study (<LINK REF="STD-Juniper-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Juniper 1990</LINK>) had a unique study design. Patients already receiving treatment with inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) had their daily dose titrated during a run-in period to optimise their asthma control such that they were not woken at night by symptoms and did not experience exercise-related symptoms. They were then randomised to the same or double the nominal daily dose of BUD as that of BDP required to control symptoms. Patients were therefore randomised to BUD 200-400 mcg/d or 400-800 mcg/d, i.e. a two fold differences in dose. No significant differences were apparent for change in FEV1 (litres), methacholine BHR, clinic assessed symptom score or rescue beta2 agonist use compared to baseline. No significant differences in the number of patients withdrawn due to asthma exacerbation or experiencing oropharyngeal side effects were apparent.</P>
<P>One further crossover design study (<LINK REF="STD-Boe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Boe 1989</LINK>), of good quality (Jadad score 4) in patients with moderately severe disease (level of control unclear) also assessed BUD 400 v 800 mcg/d in adult patients. No numerical data were presented but no significant differences between doses were apparent for FEV1, morning PEFR, evening PEFR or daily symptom score. One three limbed crossover study allowed a comparison of 400 vs 800 mcg/d (<LINK REF="STD-Swystun-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swystun 1998</LINK>), but no significant difference between any measured outcome was apparent.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">800 v 1600 mcg/d</HEADING>
<P>Two parallel design studies assessed the relative effects of BUD 800 v 1600 mcg/d in adult asthmatics on measures of HPA function. One study of reasonable quality (Jadad score 3) assessed the effects of treatment over a six week period in mild, well controlled asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Aaronson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Aaronson 1998</LINK>). The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Turkas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Turkas 1995</LINK>) was of low quality (Jadad score 2) and used a four week treatment period. Prior ICS use and degree of control were unclear. Both studies assessed basal morning cortisol levels. Patients treated with BUD 800 mcg/d had significantly higher serum cortisol levels WMD 114 nmol/L (95% CI, 26 to 203 nmol/L). However when a sensitivity analysis was done excluding the lower quality study no significant difference between doses was apparent. Individual studies assessed further outcomes. BUD 800 mcg/d resulted in significantly higher 24 hour urinary free cortisol levels WMD 68 mcg (95% CI, 46 to 90) compared to BUD 1600 mcg/d treated patients (<LINK REF="STD-Turkas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Turkas 1995</LINK>). It should also be noted that mean post treatment 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels were suppressed below the normal range in patients treated with BUD 1600 mcg/d. <LINK REF="STD-Aaronson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Aaronson 1998</LINK> assessed serum cortisol post co-syntropin infusion. No difference was apparent between treatments: WMD 65 nmol/L (95% CI -64 to 194 nmol/L). This study also included a very high dose BUD 3200 mcg/d treatment arm. No differences between treatment groups in terms of basal or stimulated cortisol levels were apparent for the two fold dose comparison BUD 1600 mcg/d v 3200 mcg/d.</P>

No significant differences were apparent between daily doses for FEV1, FVC, clinic and diary card assessed PEFR, symptom scores or rescue beta2 agonist use.

Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Molen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van der Molen 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wolthers-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wolthers 1992</LINK>) were undertaken in ICS naïve asthmatics with mild disease. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kraan-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kraan 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997a</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997b</LINK>) were undertaken in patients with moderate to severe disease. A number of common outcomes were reported in these studies; results were pooled. No significant difference between treatment groups were apparent for FEV1, WMD 1.4% predicted (95% CI, 0.8 to 3.6 %predicted) or morning PEFR, WMD 1.5 L/min (95% CI, 13 to 16 L/min). It should be noted that in the largest study (<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997a</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997b</LINK>), comprising 852 subjects a more powerful ANCOVA model was used to assess group differences and small but statistically significant differences in favour of BUD 800 mcg/d were apparent for these outcomes. The mean differences between groups in this single study were of the similar magnitude to those found in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>There were significantly fewer patient withdrawals due to asthma exacerbation for BUD 800 mcg/d compared to 200 mcg/d RR 3.93 (95% CI, 1.4 to 10.9). The results are largely weighted by one large trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997a</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997b</LINK>). No heterogeneity in effect size across studies was apparent. All studies were rated as having good methodological quality (Jadad scores 3-4).</P>
<P>Individual studies examined other outcomes. No significant differences between doses were apparent for evening PEFR, daytime asthma symptom score, rescue beta2 agonist use (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Molen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van der Molen 1998</LINK>); methacholine BHR, blood eosinophil count or clinic assessed asthma symptom score (<LINK REF="STD-Kraan-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kraan 1988</LINK>). In the most influential study in this group (Pauwels 1997) a significantly higher number of patients experienced severe exacerbations when receiving BUD 200 mcg/d compared to 800 mcg/d RR 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2 to 1.8), although this was not reflected in differences in number of patients hospitalised due to exacerbation: RR 0.6 (95% CI, 0.2 to 2.0).</P>
<P>Significantly lower daytime symptom scores and night-time rescue beta2 agonist use were apparent in the higher dose group compared to the lower dose group. The primary outcome measure in (<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997a</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997b</LINK>) was an annualised rate of severe and mild exacerbations (exacerbations/patient/year). A significantly lower rate was apparent in the higher dose BUD dose group corresponding to approximately one less severe exacerbation every 2-3 years and 8-13 less mild exacerbations every year for BUD 800 mcg/d compared to BUD 200 mcg/d.</P>
<P>Three crossover design studies assessed the relative effects of BUD 200 v 800 mcg/d. Two studies were conducted in children and one in adult patients. All were small (12 - 33 subjects) and of variable quality (Jadad scores 2-4). Patients recruited were ICS naïve with mild asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Swystun-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swystun 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wolthers-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wolthers 1991</LINK>) or had moderately severe disease already receiving 200-400 mcg/d of an ICS (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 1991</LINK>). The degree of control (good) was clear in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Swystun-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swystun 1998</LINK>). FEV1 was assessed in all three studies, but complete data for this outcome was available from only one (<LINK REF="STD-Swystun-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swystun 1998</LINK>) so a pooled treatment effect could not be calculated. A significant difference between doses was not apparent in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Swystun-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swystun 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wolthers-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wolthers 1991</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 1991</LINK>) effects on FEV1 were difficult to assess due to the way in which results were presented. Individual studies assessed further outcomes: no significant differences were apparent between daily doses for allergen and methacholine BHR PC15 FEV1 (<LINK REF="STD-Swystun-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Swystun 1998</LINK>), 24 hour urinary free cortisol (<LINK REF="STD-Bisgaard-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bisgaard 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wolthers-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wolthers 1991</LINK>), morning PEFR, evening PEFR or rescue beta2 agonist use (<LINK REF="STD-Wolthers-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wolthers 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>400 v 1600 mcg/d<BR/>A single parallel design study (<LINK REF="STD-Pedersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pedersen 1996</LINK>) in ICS naïve adult asthmatics with mild, sup-optimally controlled disease assessed the relative efficacy of BUD 400 v 1600 mcg/d. This study was of lower methodological quality (Jadad score 2). No significant differences in FEV1 (% predicted), histamine BHR or blood eosinophil count were apparent between treatment groups.</P>
<P>800 v 1600 mcg/d<BR/>Significantly higher serum cortisol was apparent for the lower dose: WMD 114 nmol/L (26 to 203). Two studies undertaken in adults contributed to this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Aaronson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Aaronson 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Turkas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Turkas 1995</LINK>). No significant differences between doses were apparent for cortisol levels at 6 hours post co-syntropin infusion.</P>

<P>Two large (&gt; 400 subjects) parallel design studies of 12 weeks duration assessed the relative efficacy and safety of BUD over a range of different doses. A significant proportion of patients in each study were oral steroid treated but no attempt was made to taper prednisolone use. Both were of fair methodological quality (Jadad score 3) and studied either adult patients (<LINK REF="STD-Busse-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 1998</LINK>) or children (<LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 1998b</LINK>) who already required large doses of ICS and/or regular oral steroids for asthma control. Each assessed the relative efficacy of BUD 200, 400 and 800 mcg/d. Busse assessed a fourth active treatment arm of BUD 1600 mcg/d 1998. No outcome data were presented in a form that allowed pooling in the meta-analysis. In both studies outcomes were reported as change compared to baseline.</P>
<P>Significant differences in certain outcomes between high and low dose BUD were apparent when comparing the highest and lowest daily doses. Differences were consistently in favour of the higher dose. In the case of <LINK REF="STD-Busse-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 1998</LINK> this was BUD 1600 v 200 mcg/d (eight fold dose difference); for Shapiro 1998 BUD 800 v 200 mcg/d (four fold dose difference).

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Busse-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Busse 1998</LINK>) demonstrated a significantly increased risk of withdrawal due to asthma exacerbation for BUD 200 mcg/d v 1600 mcg/d RR (95% CI) 2.78 (1.2 to 6.3). No difference in the rate of withdrawal between BUD 800 mcg/d and 200 mcg/d was apparent (Shapiro 1998).</P>
<P>No significant differences were apparent between any daily dose in either study when assessing daytime and night-time symptom scores, morning plasma cortisol and cortisol post co-syntropin.</P>
<P>A single parallel group study (<LINK REF="STD-Laursen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Laursen 1986</LINK>) of lower quality (Jadad score 2) assessed the relative oral prednisolone sparing efficacy of BUD 1600 v 400 mcg/d in adult patients. The rationale by which decision was made to taper the daily dose was not clear. No significant difference in the absolute daily dose of oral prednisolone at end of treatment was apparent between the two groups WMD 2.0 mg (95% CI -0.6 to 4.6 mg).</P>
<P>A single large (159 subjects) parallel group study (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1998</LINK>) of fair quality (Jadad score 3) assessed the relative oral prednisolone sparing efficacy of BUD 1600 v 800 mcg/d in adult patients. Prednisolone dose tapering was undertaken using a forced down titration approach (see: Included study characteristics). No significant differences were apparent between BUD doses for the percentage reduction in daily prednisolone dose compared to baseline or the number of patients able to discontinue prednisolone completely.</P>
<P>Three crossover design studies assessed the relative efficacy and safety of BUD 1600 v 400 mcg/d in oral steroid treated adults. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tukiainen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tukiainen 1987</LINK>) were of high quality (Jadad score 5) one of fair quality (<LINK REF="STD-Toogood-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Toogood 1984</LINK>). However no studies employed an ICS free washout period. A number of common outcome measures were assessed. No significant differences in morning PEFR WMD -21 L/min (95% CI -63 to 21 L/min); evening PEFR WMD -15 L/min (95% CI -52 to 22 L/min) or daily beta2 agonist use WMD -0.1 puffs/day (95% CI -1.5 to 1.3) were apparent. No differences were apparent between BUD doses for daytime and night-time symptom scores.</P>
<P>Individual studies assessed other outcomes. No differences in FEV1, FVC, or morning plasma cortisol or were apparent (<LINK REF="STD-Tukiainen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Tukiainen 1987</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Toogood-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Toogood 1984</LINK> assessed efficacy outcomes expressed as change compared to baseline. This study had a complex six period crossover design (see: Included study characteristics). Statistically significant advantages of high dose BUD over low dose BUD were apparent for change in FEV1 and change in FEF25-75 compared to baseline. However, due to the way in which the results were presented it is difficult to quantitatively assess the difference between doses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Higher doses of inhaled BUD have been found to be more effective than lower doses of BUD (so demonstrating a dose response effect) in the following situations:</P>
<P>1. Treatment with BUD 400 mcg/d resulted in significant reductions in the fall in FEV1 following exercise when treating ICS naïve, symptomatic children compared to either 200 or 100 mcg/d (results based on a single, high quality study). The clinical value of the difference in effect between doses is difficult to assess, but it could reasonably argued that children with exercise related symptoms not controlled on low dose BUD (100-200 mcg/d) should have their daily dose increased to 400 mcg/d. </P>
<P>2. Treatment of adults with BUD 800 mcg/d significantly reduced the number of exacerbations/patient/year relative to BUD 200 mcg/d in a single large study (<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997a</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997b</LINK>). The reductions appear to be clinically significant. An important caveat regarding these findings concerns the fact that patients enrolled to this study had demonstrated a requirement for moderately high doses of BDP prior to randomisation. It is possible therefore that these conclusions only apply to patients with moderate to severe asthma and cannot necessarily be extrapolated to asthmatics with mild disease. The study also demonstrated significant reductions in daytime asthma symptom score and night-time rescue beta2 agonist use, but the clinical importance of these differences is harder to assess.</P>
<P>3. In adults and children with sub optimally controlled, severe asthma receiving oral corticosteroids and/or high dose ICS, improvements in FEV1, morning PEFR and rescue beta2 agonist use were apparent when high dose BUD 800-1600 mcg was compared to low dose BUD 200 mcg/d. The differences in FEV1 are probably of clinical importance, the differences in PEFR less clearly so.</P>
<P>In non oral corticosteroid treated asthmatics there was no evidence of a clinically meaningful dose response effect for FEV1, morning PEFR, symptom scores or rescue beta2 agonist use. This seemed to be the case irrespective of the estimated severity of disease. Statistically significant but very small advantages of BUD 800 mcg/d over 200 mcg/d were found for FEV1 (2% predicted), and morning PEFR (2 L/min) in one study only, demonstrated using an ANCOVA analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997a</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1997b</LINK>). These are probably not of clinical significance. </P>
<P>Treatment of non-oral steroid treated adults with BUD 800 mcg/d resulted in significantly higher post treatment 24 hour urinary free cortisol excretion rates compared to 1600 mcg/d, suggesting dose-dependent suppression over this range. However this was reported a single low quality study. Dose-dependent reductions in serum cortisol level post co-syntropin infusion were apparent over a dose range of 800 - 3200 mcg/d. This again was the finding of a single (fair quality) study. The clinical relevance of perturbations in these sensitive measures of HPA function is not clear. No trials have assessed the long term risk of adrenal crisis in children or adults treated with different doses of BUD (or indeed any other ICS).</P>
<P>In oral steroid treated asthmatics no dose dependent oral steroid sparing effect was apparent. This concerned comparisons over the dose range 1600 v 800 mcg/d and 1600 v 400 mcg/d.</P>
<P>Methodological limitations:</P>
<P>Assessment of the relative efficacy of BUD at different doses is difficult because a wide range of doses are available, so a large number of dose combinations are possible. Baseline severity and symptom control are likely to be important determinants of relative response, depending on the particular outcome assessed. If three levels of severity are defined (mild, moderate, severe), two levels of control (well controlled, poorly controlled), six nominal daily doses (100 -1600 mcg/d) and two age groups (children and adults) there are 180 possible combinations. In other words 180 separate studies would need to be conducted to assess each dose combination in each given clinical situation. If a distinction between studies of different duration is made (&lt;1-4 weeks, 1-5 months, &gt; 6 months) using different delivery device (MDI, DPI, MDI+spacer) this number rises to over 1600. The total number of studies included in this analysis is only 24. Assessment of different doses under all conditions has clearly not been covered and the reader should be aware of this limitation when assessing the results of this review. </P>
<P>Outcome measures common to different studies were often reported in different ways. Absolute values (e.g. FEV1 in litres), standardised values (e.g. FEV1 as % predicted) or change in either of these metrics compared to baseline were used. This factor, combined with the fact that a significant proportion of results were incompletely reported (e.g. no standard deviations around means) limited the poolable data and hence the power of the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Too few studies were available to undertake meaningful subgroup analyses to assess the influence of patient age, delivery device or study duration on the results of analysis. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There appears to be no benefit of higher doses of budesonide in mild asthma. Clinically meaningful improvements in asthma control may be achieved when patients with moderate to severe asthma are treated with doses in the range 800-1600 mcg/d. This effect appears to be greatest in terms of the effect on exacerbations. This review supports current guideline recommendations that the dose of inhaled corticosteroids should be increased in patients who demonstrate inadequate control. There is no evidence for increased effect in doses &gt; 1600 mcg/d. There is a lack of reliable evidence concerning the relative safety of different doses in terms of their long-term effect on HPA function. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. Quantitative meta analyses concerning the relative efficacy and safety of inhaled corticosteroids would be improved by more complete reporting of numerical data in the published reports of primary studies.<BR/>2. Assessment of the influence of baseline severity and asthma control when assessing relative efficacy and safety measures would be improved by the adoption of a standardised scale of symptom frequency and uniform reporting of baseline FEV1 (% predicted) in primary studies.<BR/>3. Assessment of the impact of different doses of BUD on sensitive respiratory disease specific quality of life instruments is lacking and would be a useful area of future research.</P>
