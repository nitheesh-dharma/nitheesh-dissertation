<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-03-17 15:32:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>The majority of patients with cancer of the pancreas are diagnosed only after blockage of the bile ducts has occurred. Surgical by-pass (SBP) or endoscopic stenting (ES) of the blockage are the treatment options available for these patients. This review compares 29 randomised controlled trials that used surgical by-pass, endoscopic metal stents or endoscopic plastic stents in patients with malignant bile duct obstruction. All included studies contained groups where cancer of the pancreas was the most common cause of bile duct obstruction. This review shows that endoscopic stents are preferable to surgery in palliation of malignant distal bile duct obstruction due to pancreatic cancer. The choice of metal or plastic stents depends on the expected survival of the patient; metal stents only differ from plastic stents in the risk of recurrent bile duct obstruction. Polyethylene stents and stainless-steel alloy stents (Wallstent) are the most studied stents.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-04-10 12:34:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>We searched the databases of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Group specialised register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CancerLit, Current Concepts Database and BIDS (September 2002 to September 2004). The searches were re-run in December 2005 and November 2008.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing surgery to endoscopic stenting, endoscopic metal stents to plastic stents, and different types of endoscopic plastic and metal stents, used to relieve obstruction of the distal bile duct in patients with inoperable pancreatic carcinoma.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Adverse effects information was collected from the trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-03-02 16:10:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-nine trials, that enrolled over 1,700 participants with pancreatic carcinoma, were included. Three eligible studies compared plastic stents to surgery. Endoscopic stenting with plastic stents was associated with a reduced risk of complications (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 - 0.81), but with higher risk of recurrent biliary obstruction prior to death (RR 18.59, 95% CI 5.33 - 64.86) when compared with surgery. There was a trend towards lower risk of 30-day mortality with plastic stents (p=0.07, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32, 1.04). One published study compared metal stents to surgery and reported lower costs and better quality-of-life with metal stents.<BR/>
<BR/>Nine studies compared metal to plastic stents. Metal stents were associated with a lower risk of recurrent biliary obstruction than plastic stents (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.38 - 0.62). There was no significant difference in risk of technical failure, therapeutic failure, complications or 30-day mortality by meta-analysis.<BR/>
<BR/>When different types of plastic stents were compared to polyethylene stents, only perflouro alkoxy plastic stents had superior outcomes in one trial. The addition of an anti-reflux valve improved the patency of Teflon stents.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Endoscopic metal stents are the intervention of choice at present in patients with malignant distal obstructive jaundice due to pancreatic carcinoma. In patients with short predicted survival, their patency benefits over plastic stents may not be realised. Further RCTs are needed to determine the optimal stent type for these patients.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-04-10 14:19:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-04-10 14:19:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Pancreatic cancer accounts for 3% of all new cancers in the UK, and is the 7th commonest cause of death from cancer in the EU (<LINK REF="REF-ONS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ONS 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bray-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bray 2002</LINK> ). Despite technological advances, the five year survival remains less than 5% (<LINK REF="REF-ONS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ONS 2007</LINK>). In the majority of patients, pancreatic carcinoma presents at a late stage making most of these tumours inoperable when diagnosed (<LINK REF="REF-Baxter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baxter 2007</LINK>). Because of this dismal natural history, palliation remains the principal management in such patients, and relief of biliary tree obstruction is a prime concern.</P>
<P>Biliary tree obstruction and the consequent jaundice occur in 70 to 90% of patients with pancreatic neoplasms and has important consequences for a patient's quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Bosch-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Bosch 1994</LINK>). It can potentially exacerbate the patient's condition by causing cholangitis, malabsorption, pruritus and liver failure (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Bosch-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Bosch 1994</LINK>). Although initial results with surgical bypass demonstrated low rates of recurrent jaundice (2-5%), the surgery itself carries an appreciable risk of post-operative morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Das-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Das 2000</LINK>). Comparative studies have recorded complication rates up to 56% and 30-day mortality up to 24% (<LINK REF="REF-Yermilov-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yermilov 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1989</LINK>). Furthermore, the operation is extensive and may have important quality of life consequences for these patients who often only have a short life expectancy. However, operative bypass could provide the opportunity during the procedure for gastrojejunostomy in patients with duodenal obstruction and celiac plexus neurolysis for those with severe pain (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Heek-NT-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Heek NT 2003</LINK>; Weaver 1987). Surgical decompression has been advocated in most patients who, at the time of laparotomy for planned tumour resection, are found to have unresectable disease, and in occasional patients with longer projected survival (<LINK REF="STD-Liliemoe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Liliemoe 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-04-10 14:19:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>In response to these operative complications, advances in minimally-invasive therapy have led to the development of luminal stents whose insertion aims to relieve jaundice and hence avoid the need for surgery. These can be inserted percutaneously under fluoroscopic guidance, or endoscopically, which is the focus of this review. Endoscopic placement is the primary mode of insertion in most centres for distal biliary obstruction due to pancreatic cancer. Once inserted via the endoscope, these endoprosthesis allow minimally invasive relief of biliary obstruction and shorter hospitalisations (<LINK REF="STD-Shepherd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Shepherd 1988</LINK>). Unfortunately, obstructive jaundice recurs in up to 50% of patients treated endoscopically, necessitating recurrent intervention and stent replacement (<LINK REF="REF-Stern-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stern 2008</LINK>). Less common potential complications related to their use include malposition, stent migration and breakage (<LINK REF="REF-Born-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Born 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Plotner-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plotner 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Early biliary stents came in the form of plastic prosthesis that was inserted across the obstructing pancreatic mass to provide drainage of the biliary tree. The high occlusion rates in these appeared to occur due to development of biofilm on the internal surface with bacterial colonisation (<LINK REF="STD-Sung-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 1993</LINK>). The precipitation of calcium bilirubinate promoted by bacterial enzyme activity lines the luminal surface and narrows the functional stent diameter. The biliary sludge that accumulates as a result of delayed drainage facilitates stent blockage. Other studies have suggested a role for bilioduodenal reflux and food fibres in stent blockage (<LINK REF="STD-van-Berkel-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van Berkel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weickert-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weickert 2001</LINK>).As a result, a number of methods have been employed to enhance stent patency. For example, irregularities on the surface of the stent may enhance precipitation and so manufacturers have adapted this type of stent by producing them from, or coating them with, numerous different materials to impair bacterial colonisation (<LINK REF="STD-Sung-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 1992</LINK>). However, the clinical benefits from these specification changes are variable (<LINK REF="REF-Das-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Das 2000</LINK>). Similarly, prophylactic use of antibiotics in addition to stents has not been shown to improve patency (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Galandi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Galandi 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Technological advances have also produced expandable endoscopic metal mesh stents to improve stent patency. With a wider bore than plastic stents, several studies have shown their patency lasts an average of 9 months (<LINK REF="STD-Davids-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Davids 1992a</LINK>). A number of uncontrolled and retrospective studies have shown advantages to these self expanding metal stents in comparison to plastic stents and these benefits have remained in randomised studies (<LINK REF="REF-Lammer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lammer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prat-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Prat 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knyrim-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Knyrim 1993</LINK>). The most commonly studied types are constructed from stainless-steel alloy (Wallstent) or nickel-titanium alloy (Ultraflex Diamond). Stent occlusion may still occur, due to tumour growth through the mesh, and once placed they are mostly permanent (unlike plastic stents). The addition of a polyurethane cover to these stents has not been shown convincingly to improve patency, or has done so with a higher risk of complications (<LINK REF="REF-Hausegger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hausegger 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Isayama-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Isayama 2004</LINK>). Another strong limiting factor to their use is their cost, being between 15 and 40 times more expensive than plastic stents. Cost-effectiveness analyses have found metal stents to be economical only when patients survive beyond six months (<LINK REF="STD-Arguedas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Arguedas 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moss-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moss 2007</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-03-02 16:17:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Obstructive jaundice due to invasive pancreatic carcinoma can thus be relieved by surgery or endoprosthesis insertion. What is not clear is which method is optimal. Surgery may offer high success rates in terms of relief of obstructive jaundice but carries high risks in terms of post-operative morbidity and mortality. Many of the secondary advantages of surgery have been met by advances in endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and duodenal stents. Stents appear to offer a less invasive option, but replacement rates rise with patient survival and with numerous different types of stent there is no definitive evidence by which to judge their relative efficacy. As adjunctive treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy may prolong patient survival, determining which stent type produces the longest patency time is important. This review aims to assess the evidence to determine whether surgery or endoscopic stents offer the best solution to obstructive jaundice due to pancreatic cancer and, likewise, if stents are to be used, which type offers the best outcomes.</P>

<P>The 29 included studies (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>) involved 2,762 participants, over 1,700 with pancreatic cancer, and consisted of 1 trial comparing surgery to metals stents, 3 trials comparing surgery to endoscopic plastic stenting, 9 trials comparing endoscopic metal to plastic stents, 5 comparing Teflon to polyethylene stents, 3 comparing polyurethane to polyethylene, 4 comparing other types of plastic stents, and 4 comparing different types of metal stents. Twenty-four of the included studies were in the form of published papers, and five were only published as abstracts from conference proceedings. We contacted authors of abstracts for additional data.<BR/>
<BR/>All included trials contained a mixture of patients with "malignant obstructive jaundice". Only one of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Artifon-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Artifon 2006</LINK>) provided separate data for pancreatic causes of malignant obstruction alone, or subgroup analysis for this group. The percentage of patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer in the included studies ranged from 39 to 95% (mean 76%). Twenty-five of the 29 studies specified that they included only enrolled patients with mid or distal malignant bile duct obstruction. Thus the analyses are based on all patients with malignant obstructive jaundice, the majority of whom had pancreatic cancer, and the analyses should be considered in this light. The total numbers of patients randomised were 336 in the surgery / stent studies, 871 in the metal / plastic stent studies, 1023 in the plastic stent studies, and 532 in the metal / metal studies<BR/>
<BR/>Not all of the considered outcomes were reported in each study; the number of outcomes ranged from 1 to 10 (mean 6). In addition, the methods for measuring some of the outcomes differed between studies; many studies reported median values for time outcomes. Cost-effectiveness measures also differed in the unit of currency, and the time point at which costs were estimated. There were major differences in the detail of reporting of results in the form of raw data; many studies only reported "no significant difference".</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Surgery versus Plastic Stents</HEADING>
<P>There were three trials reported that compared surgery to endoscopic plastic stenting and met the inclusion criteria for this study (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shepherd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Shepherd 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1994</LINK>). In all three trials the baseline characteristics of participants were similar, with 64 to 86% of participants having pancreatic carcinoma as the underlying diagnosis. One trial did not treat with antibiotics at the time of procedure, two used polyethylene stents, and the third used Teflon stents; the results were similar for all three stent groups, except for technical success. The majority of surgical interventions were cholecystojejunostomy or choledochoduodenostomy. The total number of randomised patients was 308, and none were lost to follow-up.</P>
<P>There was no difference in relative risk for technical failure (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.31, 1.44; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) and therapeutic failure (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.51, 1.92; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>) between stenting and surgery in malignant obstructive jaundice. The relative risk of all complications was significantly reduced in those receiving stents compared to surgery (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 - 0.81; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) with a p value of 0.0007. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1989</LINK>) only reported infectious complications; when this data was excluded from meta-analysis the relative risk of complications for stenting fell to 0.52 (95% CI 0.38 - 0.51). The 30-day mortality showed a trend in favour of stenting (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32 - 1.04; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>), but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). The relative risk of recurrent biliary obstruction prior to death / end of study was 18.59 (95% CI 5.33 - 64.86; <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) in favour of surgery, which was highly statistically significant (p &lt; 0.00001). There were no significant differences in survival or quality of life between the two treatment groups in any of the studies. The median survival of participants in Andersen et al study (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1989</LINK>) was 84 days (range 3 to 498) for particpants treated endoscopically versus 100 days (range 10 to 642) for those managed surgically. In Shepherd et al (<LINK REF="STD-Shepherd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Shepherd 1988</LINK>) the figures were 152 (range 39 to 411) days and 124.5 (range 52 to 354) for endoscopically versus surgically treated patients and for Smith et al (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1994</LINK>) 26 weeks (no range given) and 21 weeks (no range given). Two of the trials demonstrated shorter total hospital stay for those in the stented group (<LINK REF="STD-Shepherd-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Shepherd 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1994</LINK>). These outcomes were not suitable for meta-analysis due to the different methods of reporting results. Sensitivity analysis performed by altering the statistical test, and model (random or fixed) did not change the results.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Metal Stent versus Plastic Stents</HEADING>
<P>Nine studies were identified that met inclusion criteria and compared endoscopic metal to plastic stents (<LINK REF="STD-Carr-Locke-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Carr Locke 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davids-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Davids 1992b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaassis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kaassis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kastinelos-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kastinelos 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knyrim-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Knyrim 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moses-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moses 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prat-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Prat 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosch-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rosch 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soderlund-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Soderlund 2006</LINK>). All compared uncovered metal Wallstents to polyethylene stents except 2 which used covered Wallstents (<LINK REF="STD-Moses-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moses 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soderlund-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Soderlund 2006</LINK>), and another 2 which used teflon stents (<LINK REF="STD-Kaassis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kaassis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kastinelos-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kastinelos 2006</LINK>). As three non-RCT studies have shown no difference between covered and uncovered Wallstents (<LINK REF="REF-Park-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Park 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shim 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yoon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoon 2006</LINK>), meta-analysis was performed with and without these studies; the included data did not alter the results. In one study unsuccessful endoscopic insertion was repeated using a combined percutaneous-endoscopic approach (rendez-vous); for meta-analysis the technical success was based on the endoscopic success only, and complications were not included in meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Knyrim-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Knyrim 1993</LINK>). The percentage of patients in these trials with inoperable pancreatic cancer ranged from 52 to 74%, and all studies contained patients with similar baseline characteristics. In total, 871 participants were randomised and six were lost to follow-up. All studies were considered at moderate risk of bias based on quality criteria.<BR/>
<BR/>Seven studies reported data for risk of technical failure, with no difference between metal and plastic stents (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.55- 2.07; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). There were no significant differences in any of the studies for risk of therapeutic failure (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.39 - 4.57; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>) or complications (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.45 - 1.9; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>) between metal and plastic stents. The relative risk of death within 30 days after intervention was 1.43 (96% CI 0.79 - 2.58; <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>) in the metal stent group, which was not statistically significant. However, metal stents had a significantly reduced relative risk of recurrent biliary obstruction prior to death / end of study (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.38 - 0.62; <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). There were no significant differences reported for survival, or quality of life in these studies. The results on survival and stent patency were not suitable for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Five studies reported significantly longer duration of patency for metal stents over plastic stents (p &lt; 0.05), but there was no difference in patient survival between either stent type. For cost-effectiveness, two studies found significant difference for metal stents, but two others did not. Three studies reported a higher number of ERCPs per patient in the plastic stent groups (mean 1.6 versus 1.0 per patient). These outcomes were not suitable for meta-analysis due to the method of reporting results. Sensitivity analysis performed by altering the statistical test, and model (random or fixed) did not change the results. There was no statistical heterogeneity between studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Teflon Stent versus Polyethylene Stent</HEADING>
<P>Within the 12 studies using plastic stents for obstructing biliary cancer, there were five studies comparing Teflon to polyethylene biliary stents (<LINK REF="STD-Catalano-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Catalano 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-England-2000" TYPE="STUDY">England 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terruzzi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Terruzzi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Berkel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van Berkel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Berkel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Berkel 2004</LINK>), three comparing polyurethane to polyethylene stents (<LINK REF="STD-Costamagna-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Costamagna 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Landoni-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Landoni 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Berkel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Berkel 2003</LINK>), two comparing teflon to polyurethane (<LINK REF="STD-Benz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Benz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schilling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schilling 2003</LINK>), and two comparing other combinations (<LINK REF="STD-Prat-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Prat 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tringali-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tringali 2003</LINK>). There were risk of bias for each study is described below (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Within the Teflon / polyethylene studies four compared 10 Fr Tannenbaum-type Teflon stents to 10 Fr Cotton-Leung polyethylene stents, and one used a Teflon stent with side-holes. The percentage of patients with pancreatic carcinoma ranged from 65 to 95% in these studies. The characteristics of participants in both intervention groups were comparable at baseline.<BR/>
<BR/>In comparison of teflon and polyethylene stents, there was no statistical difference between the two stents with regard to risk of technical failure (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.34 - 4.5; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>), 30-day mortality (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.77 - 2.11; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>) or recurrent biliary obstruction prior to death (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 - 1.24; <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>). The relative risk of therapeutic failure with a Teflon stent was significantly higher (RR 2.84, 95% CI 1.31- 6.16; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>) than with polyethylene stents (p = 0.008). The relative risk of complications was higher in those who received a Teflon stent (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.83 - 4.36; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>), due to the results of one study (<LINK REF="STD-England-2000" TYPE="STUDY">England 2000</LINK>) but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.13). All five studies analysed reported median duration of stent patency and patient survival, but there were no differences between both stent types for either of these outcomes (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Sensitivity analysis performed by altering the statistical test, and model (random or fixed) did not change the results. There was no statistical heterogeneity between studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other Stent Comparisons - plastic stents</HEADING>
<P>Two trials comparing Tannenbaum-type Teflon stents to both uncoated and hydrophilic-coated polyurethane stents randomised 168 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Benz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Benz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schilling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schilling 2003</LINK>). Neither reported a difference in outcomes (time to stent dysfunction, technical success, therapeutic success, complications) between groups. Two trials compared polyethylene stents to hydrophilic-coated polyurethane stents, with 183 patients randomised. There was no difference between interventions with regard to therapeutic success, complications, 30-day mortality or survival. One of the studies demonstrated a significantly longer patency for polyethylene stents (105 days versus 77 days) (<LINK REF="STD-van-Berkel-2003" TYPE="STUDY">van Berkel 2003</LINK>). Omitting side-holes, or using uncoated polyurethane, does not improve the results from standard polyethylene stents (<LINK REF="STD-Landoni-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Landoni 2000</LINK>). However one RCT comparing polyethylene to perflouro alkoxy stent (Double Layer Stent) placed endoscopically found a shorter patency period and higher risk of stent occlusion prior to death (RR 3.05; 95 % CI, 1.57 - 5.89) with polyethylene stents (<LINK REF="STD-Tringali-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tringali 2003</LINK>). Finally, a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Dua-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dua 2006</LINK>) compared the addition of an anti-reflux valve to a Tannenbaum stent to standard Tannenbaum stents. The addition of this valve did improve median stent patency from 101 to 145 days (p=0.02), without any difference in technical success or complications.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Other Stent Comparisons - metal stents</HEADING>
<P>There were four published RCTs comparing different types of endoscopic metal stents in malignant biliary obstruction, and one study that compared metal stents to surgery in metastatic pancreatic cancer. The first compared polyurethane covered to uncovered Ultraflex Diamond stents. This reported a higher cumulative patency rate in covered stents (304 days versus 161 days), but also a higher incidence of complications with this stent (8/57 versus 3/55) (<LINK REF="STD-Isayama-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Isayama 2004</LINK>). The second compared ferrous stainless steel radial stent (Spiral Z-Stent) to standard Wallstent in 145 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Shah-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 2003</LINK>). The two stents were comparable results in terms of stent placement, stent occlusion, time to occlusion and median patency rates. One study that compared a nitinol non-forshortening metal stent (Zilver) to a 10mm Wallstent found no difference between the stent in terms of technical success, complications, mortality or patency (<LINK REF="STD-Howell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Howell 2006</LINK>). Kastinelos et al compared a Hanaro uncovered to a Luminex uncovered self-expanding metal stent (<LINK REF="STD-Kastinelos-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kastinelos 2008</LINK>). There was no difference between these stent types in any measured outome. Finally, a single study compared a self-expanding metal stent to surgery for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Artifon-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Artifon 2006</LINK>). This small study (N=30) reported no differences in technical success, complications or survival betwen both interventions, but patients treated with the metal stent had lower costs and better quality of life scores at 30 days follow-up.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-04-10 14:19:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>In patients with malignant distal biliary tree obstruction due to advanced pancreatic carcinoma, endoscopic stenting with plastic stents is associated with fewer complications, shorter total hospital stay, but with a higher risk of recurrent biliary obstruction than surgery. There is no difference between the two interventions with regard to technical success, therapeutic success, survival, or quality of life in the studies reviewed. There was a trend towards higher 30-day mortality with surgery in the meta-analysis, but no individual trial reported a significant difference. These results may not be particular to endoscopic stents, as the one randomised trial published comparing percutaneous stents and surgery reported no significant difference in outcome between both groups (<LINK REF="REF-Bornman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bornman 1986</LINK>). The results of these trials confirm the role of palliative endoscopic stenting as the preferred therapy over surgery in the management of inoperable biliary obstruction due to pancreatic carcinoma. However, it should be noted that only three randomised trials comparing surgery to stents were identified and these span a reasonably long time period (1988 to 1994). In recent years considerable advances have taken place in pancreatic surgery to attempt to improve its efficacy and safety. Endoscopic stents have also not been compared to laparoscopic biliary bypass, which may have advantages over open approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2005</LINK>). The single small study that has compared surgery to metal stents (<LINK REF="STD-Artifon-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Artifon 2006</LINK>) did report that metal stents had lower costs and improved short-term quality of life compared to surgery. A longer-term comparison of quality-of-life would be worthwhile in this group.</P>
<P>Our review of the data comparing metal stents to plastic stents in this patient group confirms that there is no difference between the two interventions in technical failure, therapeutic failure, complications or 30-day mortality. Metal Wallstents lead to significantly less episodes of recurrent biliary obstruction, and reduced re-intervention rates than plastic stents. The median time to stent occlusion in these studies ranged from 62 to 165 days for plastic stents, and 111 to 273 days for metal stents. However, median length of survival ranged from 99 to 175 days, suggesting that many patients die before either stent occludes. The differences between stent patency rates appear at three months after insertion. None of the continuous outcome data was comparable between studies as all used medians of values to compare groups. Although metal stents have clear benefits in terms of patency, their higher initial cost raises issues of cost-effectiveness. No conclusion could be made from the comparisons of cost-effectiveness from these studies. One study in this review examined cost-effectiveness over a number of time points from initial insertion; there was no difference in costs per patient in those surviving less than six months, but metal stents has a higher cost per patients when patients survived less than three months (<LINK REF="STD-Prat-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Prat 1998a</LINK>). A cost-effective analysis based on Markov models has also made this conclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Arguedas-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Arguedas 2002</LINK>). A number of other factors have previously been suggested as a guide to when to select a plastic stent over a metal stent in patients with malignant obstructive jaundice. These include the presence of liver metastases (<LINK REF="STD-Kaassis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kaassis 2003</LINK>), tumour size (<LINK REF="REF-Prat-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prat 1998b</LINK>), and predicted survival less than four months (Yeoh 1999). A prospective study of metal stents in malignant biliary obstruction reported the absence of metastases and coadjuvant chemotherapy as independent predictive factors of survival &gt; 4 months in multi-variate analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Gomez-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomez 2006</LINK>). In the studies reviewed, only 40 to 50% of patients survived beyond four months.</P>
<P>The comparison of the role of Teflon and polyethylene stents demonstrated higher risk of therapeutic failure (RR 2.84) with 10Fr Tannenbaum-type Teflon stent in the three studies that reported this outcome. This does not appear to be related to experience, as the studies date from 1998 to 2004, with similar results. There was no significant difference in any of the other outcomes measured. The addition of side-holes to Tannenbaum stents, or a stainless steel mesh with polyamide outer layer, does not improve outcome compared to standard polyethylene stents (<LINK REF="STD-van-Berkel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van Berkel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Berkel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van Berkel 2004</LINK>). Similarly neither hydrophilic-coated polyurethane, uncoated polyurethane, nor the omission of side-holes improves outcomes compared to polyethylene or Tannenbaum Teflon stents (<LINK REF="STD-Landoni-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Landoni 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sung-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 1994</LINK>). The only improvement on polyethylene was with the perflouro alkoxy plastic stent in one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Tringali-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tringali 2003</LINK>). The only improvement in Tannenbaum stents was a longer patency when an anti-reflux valve was added (<LINK REF="STD-Dua-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dua 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a paucity of RCTs comparing the different types of endoscopic metal stents in palliation of malignant biliary obstruction of any cause. Two retrospective studies comparing the Wallstent (stainless-steel alloy) to the Ultraflex Diamond stent (nickel-titanium alloy) reported no differences between the stents in one, and improved Wallstent patency in another (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmad-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmad 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dumonceau-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dumonceau 2000</LINK>). A prospective RCT would be useful in this area. The three published RCTs comparing types of endoscopic metal stents have reported similar outcomes to the standard Wallstent (<LINK REF="STD-Howell-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Howell 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shah-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 2003</LINK>). One trial that compared covered to uncovered Diamond stents reported less occlusion (14% versus 38%) at the expense of more complications with covered stents; 4.2% developed cholecystitis and 8.7% developed pancreatitis (<LINK REF="STD-Isayama-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Isayama 2004</LINK>). The cumulative patency of the covered stents was significantly higher in patients with pancreatic cancer (p = 0.0363) and metastatic lymph nodes (p = 0.0354) in this trial. Given that these participants already have a terminal condition, this high complication rate would likely impact significantly on quality-of-life. Like the early studies of different types of endoscopic plastic stents, further RCTs would be required to assess the role of covered metal stents.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-04-10 14:28:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>A number of points need to be kept in mind when considering these results. Firstly, as discussed above (see<I> '</I>
<LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>'<I>)</I> the data includes a minority of participants with distal bile duct cholangiocarcinoma as no data for pancreatic carcinoma alone was available. These patients had cancers whose biological behaviour may be very different to pancreatic cancer, and thus influence outcomes. Likewise, not all patients had a pathological diagnosis of disease. This is a direct result of the difficulty of obtaining specimens and the extent of illness in these patients. Although unavoidable, this is a potential source of bias in the studies. An attempt was made to undertake sub-group analyses of proven pancreatic cancer patients only but this was thwarted by poor reporting of disease-specific results in the literature. We cannot, therefore, discount the fact that the presence of non-pancreatic tumours within the study population is confounding the results. However, in each study the randomisation process should have led to an even distribution of non-pancreatic cancer patients across the study arms. This should go some way to limiting the potential bias. In addition univariate analysis has not identified tumour type as an influence on either stent patency or patient survival in patients with malignant biliary tract obstruction (<LINK REF="STD-Davids-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Davids 1992b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaassis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kaassis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prat-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prat 1998b</LINK>). In actual clinical practice, palliative management of malignant biliary obstruction is not influenced by the underlying histological diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Das-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Das 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Secondly, the trials are spread over 20 years, and improvements in techniques over time may influence differences between studies. Finally the majority of the studies reviewed failed to report whether participants or outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention each participant was randomised to. It is possible that unblinded outcome assessors may allow detection bias to affect results. Blinding of intervention was not a practical option in the surgical trials. However in the endoscopic stent trials it would be possible to blind the patients and assessors (but not endoscopists) to the stent type without adversely affecting clinical outcome. There was little consistency in the methods of measuring outcomes, and a number did not report complete results. Although cross-over was permitted between arms, most studies did not include comparisons of results as per randomisation as well as treatment.</P>
<P>Finally, this review's purpose was to compare endoscopic stents to surgery and other endoscopic stent types only. An alternative approach is to place the stents percutaneously via the trans-hepatic route, in particular for proximal biliary obstruction. These two approaches have only been compared in two RCTs. The more recent reported an improved therapeutic success and overall median survival (3.7 versus 2.0 months) with percutaneous stents, but with more major complications (61% vs 35%) (<LINK REF="REF-Pinol-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pinol 2002</LINK>). The original RCT reported percutaneous insertion was associated with less success in relieving jaundice and a higher 30-day mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Speer-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speer 1987</LINK>). Endoscopic stenting remains the primary route of stent placement for these patients in most centres.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-12-20 13:56:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>All patients with biliary obstruction due to unresectable pancreatic carcinoma should receive palliative drainage via an endoscopic stent. The choice of stent depends on the expected survival of the individual patient; 10Fr polyethylene stents are the stent of choice in those with a short expected survival (three to six months). In those patients with longer expected survival, a metal expandable mesh stent should be used. The evidence, however, for choosing stent type according to life expectancy is weak. No conclusions on the choice of covered or uncovered stents, or metal alloy types can be made based on available literature. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-12-20 13:56:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Further development on plastic stent composition to improve patency rates is needed to provide a more cost-effective alternative to metal stents.</P>
<P>Randomised controlled trials are needed comparing:</P>
<OL>
<LI>metal stents to plastic stents in patients with life expectancy less than six months e.g. hepatic metastases, large tumour size, ECOG &gt; 2)</LI>
<LI>covered to uncovered metal stents</LI>
<LI>stainless-steel alloy (Wallstent) to nickel-titanium alloy (Diamond) endoscopic metal stents</LI>
<LI>perflouro alkoxy (Double Layer) plastic to metal stents</LI>
</OL>
<P>An analysis of quality of life and cost effectiveness in these studies would be essential. Universal outcome measures would also allow clinicians to better compare interventions in this area.</P>
