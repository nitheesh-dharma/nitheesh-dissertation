<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-09-26 14:15:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>User-held information is where the ill person holds personal information about their care. Such records are becoming the norm in many settings and are becoming more popular with patients. This is especially the case where the person concerned is not in hospital and receives care from more than one professional. Providing people with information about their care is thought to increase their feelings of involvement in their treatment and aims to increase people&#8217;s satisfaction and participation with services, ensure early treatment and prevent hospital admission.</P>
<P>The value of user-held personal information for those with severe mental illnesses is not known however and research evaluating the effectiveness is rare. Some research suggests that while many people decline the offer of a user-held record, the majority of those who carry their records report this to be useful.</P>
<P>Based on a search in 2011, this review includes four trials with a total of 607 people and evaluates the effects of user-held information for people with severe mental illness. In the main, the number of relevant studies is low, with poor reporting of some outcomes. Based on moderate quality evidence, the review found that user-held information did not decrease hospital admissions, and did not decrease compulsory admissions or encourage people with severe mental illness to attend appointments (when compared to treatment as usual). Other important outcomes, such as satisfaction with care, costs and effect on mental health, were not available due to the limited quality of the four studies. There is therefore a gap in knowledge and evidence regarding user-held information for people with severe mental health problems. Further evidence is also required on the different types of user-held information (for example, if it involves the mental health team and what type of information is included in the record). Large-scale, well-conducted and well-reported studies are required to assess the effects of user-held information for people with mental illness. Two important randomised studies are currently taking place. For the present, despite a gap in evidence, user-held information is low cost and acceptable to patients, so its use is likely to grow. However, it cannot be assumed that user-held information is of benefit to people and is cost-effective without further large-scale, well-conducted and well-reported trials.</P>

<P>We updated previous searches by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register in August 2011. This register is compiled by systematic searches of major databases, and handsearches of journals and conference proceedings.<BR/>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-09-10 13:52:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that:<BR/>i. have recruited adult participants with a diagnosis of a severe mental illness (specifically psychotic illnesses and severe mood disorders such as bipolar and depression with psychotic features); and<BR/>ii. compared any personalised and accessible clinical information held by the user beyond standard care to standard information routinely held such as appointment cards and generic information on diagnosis, treatment or services available.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-09-10 13:52:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Study selection and data extraction were undertaken independently by two authors and confirmed and checked by a third. We contacted authors of trials for additional and missing data. Where possible, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-10 13:52:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four RCTs (n = 607) of user-held records versus treatment as usual met the inclusion criteria. When the effect of user-held records on psychiatric hospital admissions was compared with treatment as usual in four studies, the pooled treatment effect showed no significant impact of the intervention and was of very low magnitude (n = 597, 4 RCTs, RR 0.99 CI 0.71 to 1.38, moderate quality evidence). Similarly, there was no significant effect of the intervention in three studies which investigated compulsory psychiatric hospital admissions (n = 507, 4 RCTs, RR 0.64 CI 0.37 to 1.10, moderate quality evidence). Other outcomes including satisfaction and mental state were investigated but pooled estimates were not obtainable due to skewed or poorly reported data, or only being investigated by one study. Two outcomes (violence and death) were not investigated by the included studies. Two important randomised studies are ongoing.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-10 13:52:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence gap remains regarding user-held, personalised, accessible clinical information for people with psychotic illnesses for many of the outcomes of interest. However, based on moderate quality evidence, this review suggests that there is no effect of the intervention on hospital or outpatient appointment use for individuals with psychotic disorders. The number of studies is low, however, and further evidence is required to ascertain whether these results are mediated by the type of intervention, such as involvement of a clinical team or the type of information included.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-10 13:52:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is important to seek cost-effective methods of improving the care and outcome of those with serious mental illnesses. User-held records, where the person with the illness holds all or some personal information relating to the course and care of their illness, are now the norm in some clinical settings (<LINK REF="REF-Kaelber-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaelber 2008</LINK>). This is particularly the case where the person concerned is not in hospital and receives care from more than one professional. User-held notes are becoming popular for obstetric care (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phipps-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phipps 2001</LINK>) both in developed and developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 1993</LINK>). Parent-held records are widely used in paediatric care (<LINK REF="REF-Bourgeois-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourgeois 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghossein-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghossein 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hampshire-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hampshire 2004</LINK>). The management of people with chronic disabilities such as stroke or cancer can also involve user-held records (<LINK REF="REF-Banet-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banet 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finlay-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finlay 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ko-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ko 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Brief types of user-held information are available for use in emergencies such as anaphylaxis and post-splenectomy infection (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wharry-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wharry 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1996</LINK>). This type of information tends not to be comprehensive and the aims vary with setting and condition. Nevertheless, as with the full notes, the aim of these truncated personal record systems is to promote patient participation in care, increase consumer satisfaction with services, facilitate early treatment and help avoid hospital admission.</P>
<P>Both long and short forms of user-held information are now being used for people with mental health problems (<LINK REF="STD-Backlar-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Backlar 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Essex-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Essex 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lester-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pickersgill-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pickersgill 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reuler-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Reuler 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stafford-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stafford 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherby-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherby 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swanson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 2006</LINK>a; <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 1996</LINK>). In certain countries legislation obligates the provision of a copy of the treatment outline and professionals' contact details to those in receipt of specialist mental health services (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 1990</LINK>). This information is not specifically designed to be something patients might wish to carry, nor to be of use in a crisis, but it may in itself have an effect, so evaluation is justified. Another form of personal information has recently emerged. Advance Statements can be defined as statements regarding service user preferences for future treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2008</LINK>). These are typically devised and held by the service user and include such interventions as Psychiatric Advance Directives, Joint Crisis Plans (<LINK REF="STD-Sutherby-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherby 1999</LINK>) and Wellness Recovery Actions Plans (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Attempts at evaluation of the effects of user-held records for those with long term mental illness are rare. There are several audit and case series studies of the use of user-held records (<LINK REF="STD-Essex-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Essex 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pickersgill-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pickersgill 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reuler-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Reuler 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stafford-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stafford 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 1996</LINK>). These suggest that while many people refuse the offer of a user-held record, the majority of those who carry their records report this activity to be useful (<LINK REF="STD-Stafford-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stafford 1997</LINK>). In the USA, Psychiatric Advance Directives (PADs) have been shown to be popular with service users and their carers (<LINK REF="REF-Backlar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Backlar 2001</LINK>) and some professional groups (<LINK REF="REF-Atkinson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkinson 2004</LINK>). However, there are some concerns regarding the implementation of wishes contained in PADs during crises from both service users and clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Atkinson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkinson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Backlar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Backlar 2001</LINK>); the ability of the service user to generate a valid PAD (<LINK REF="REF-Amering-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amering 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Atkinson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkinson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elbogen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbogen 2007</LINK>); and questions regarding their impact on or relationship to outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Backlar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Backlar 2001</LINK>). Additionally, clinicians often express concern regarding the possibility of service users requesting unreasonable treatments or indeed refusing treatment altogether (<LINK REF="REF-Atkinson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkinson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Backlar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Backlar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elbogen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbogen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swartz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swartz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Dorn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dorn 2006</LINK>). However, an analysis of the content of PADs developed by 106 outpatients in the US (<LINK REF="REF-Srebnik-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Srebnik 2005</LINK>) showed that in 95% of cases the PADs were rated as clinically useful and consistent with clinical practice standards. Another type of advance statement, the Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) is a structured self-management intervention that assists users both manage symptoms and consider broader life issues. A recent assessment of WRAPs for mental illness (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2009</LINK>) suggests that it may generate improvements in a range of areas including symptoms, hopefulness and feelings of empowerment. Furthermore, a case series study of the Joint Crisis Plan intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Sutherby-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherby 1999</LINK>) in which patients develop their personalised plan for use in a crisis or possible relapse, suggests that hospital use may be reduced in those who develop such a plan. The increased input in determining future treatment was suggested to be an important factor in determining the perceived coerciveness of the treatment experience (<LINK REF="REF-Lidz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lidz 1995</LINK>). It certainly seems plausible that those who have little knowledge of the patient or no access to their notes, such as a junior psychiatrist in a hospital emergency department, would find such information useful in making an appropriate disposition, and further that actions carried out which have been previously negotiated are less likely to require compulsory interventions.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-10 13:52:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the purpose of this review, we defined severe mental illness (SMI) as psychotic disorders and severe mood disorders such as bipolar disorder and depression with psychotic features. Psychosis is a collective term used to describe a range of conditions including schizophrenia, delusional disorder, and schizoaffective disorder. Individuals with psychotic disorders may experience a range of symptoms including unusual thoughts or 'delusions', hallucinations, and mood disturbance such as emotional flatness and withdrawal. Recent studies of schizophrenia globally suggest that about seven individuals per 1000 will be affected and individuals with schizophrenia have a two to threefold increased risk of dying compared to the general population (<LINK REF="REF-McGrath-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGrath 2008</LINK>). The economic burden associated with schizophrenia is substantial, with recent estimates suggesting it represents between 1.5% and 3% of total healthcare expenditures (<LINK REF="REF-Knapp-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knapp 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>'User-held records' may be defined as information, held by the individual with the illness, which contains all or some personal information relating to the course and care of his or her illness.

<P>The main aim of providing individual patients with personalised information about their illness and treatment is to improve the individual's sense of control and empowerment. Providing patients with information is thought to increase their feelings of involvement in their treatment, reducing the perceived coerciveness of the treatment experience (<LINK REF="REF-Lidz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lidz 1995</LINK>); it may also facilitate early help-seeking.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-09-10 13:52:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1999 (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 1999</LINK>). The previous review found no studies meeting the criteria for inclusion, but found two ongoing trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lester-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papageorgiou-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Papageorgiou 2002</LINK>). Since the publication of the original Cochrane review, there have been a number of published and relevant clinical trials undertaken. Additionally, current national treatment guidelines in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>) recommend involving mental health service users in decisions about their treatment and providing opportunities for service users to make advance statements and advance decisions to refuse treatment. Valid advance decisions are now legally binding under the UK's Mental Capacity Act 2005. User-held records potentially provide a cost-effective methodology for facilitating such involvement.

<P>Adults with SMI. For the purposes of the review we defined SMI as a diagnosis of a psychotic illness, including other psychoses such as bipolar disorder and depression with psychotic features. In studies where there was a mixture of diagnostic groups, only those studies where the majority of participants (that is, more than 50%) had psychotic diagnosis were included. We did not include studies where the sole diagnosis was bipolar disorder or depression. People whose main problem and primary diagnosis was one of deliberate self harm were also not the focus of this review.</P>

CH provided advice and final decisions were documented. We attempted to contact authors through an open-ended request in order to obtain missing information or for clarification whenever necessary.

<P>We included continuous data from rating scales only if:<BR/>a. the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>); and<BR/>b. the measuring instrument has not been written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial.</P>
<P>Ideally the measuring instrument should either be: i. a self-report, or ii. completed by an independent rater or relative (for example, not the therapist). We acknowledge that this is often not reported clearly and noted if this was the case or not in the 'Description of studies' section.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.3 Endpoint versus change data</HEADING>
<P>There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between-person variability from the analysis. On the other hand the calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be problematic in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We decided to primarily use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former were not available. If we had found both, we would have combined endpoint and change data in the analysis and used mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences throughout (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.4 Skewed data</HEADING>
<P>Many of our targeted outcomes tend to be skewed, for example, duration of admission and duration of compulsory admission. For this reason the authors of included studies have provided non-parametric summary measures and tests, that is, the median and range, and tested with the Mann-Whitney U test. Since it is not possible to combine non-parametric data in a meta-analysis, and there were so few studies that met the inclusion criteria and provided these data, we report these data in 'Other data' tables.</P>

<P>SF and GB worked independently to assess risk of bias by using the criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) to assess trial quality. This set of criteria is based on evidence of associations between overestimation of effect and high risk of bias of the article, such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Binary data</HEADING>
<P>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). For statistically significant results we had planned to calculate the number needed to treat to provide benefit/to induce harm statistic (NNTB/H), and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using Visual Rx (<A HREF="http://www.nntonline.net/">http://www.nntonline.net/</A>) taking account of the event rate in the control group. This, however, has been superseded by the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and calculations therein.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>We had too few studies to combine continuous outcomes. Furthermore, outcomes common to more than one study were assessed by different measures therefore precluding any combined estimate of effect. However, if we had found sufficient studies we would have estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups. Data from included studies were often skewed, in these circumstances we have presented the data as reported by the original authors in 'Other data' tables.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2013-09-30 18:03:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Cluster trials</HEADING>
<P>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra-class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>For relevant cluster trials that did not account for clustering in the primary studies (<LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK>), we have presented data in a table marked with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. We have sought statistical advice and were advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) (design effect = 1 + (m - 1)*ICC) (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clustering was appropriately incorporated into the analysis of one of the cluster studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lester-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2003</LINK>) but not in the second (<LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK>). Therefore we have reported the original data as if from a non-cluster randomised study (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) and, in addition, have provided a cluster-adjusted outcome where frequencies have been divided by the design effect (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (for example, pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). We did not find any cross-over trials in our search.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Studies with multiple treatment groups</HEADING>
<P>We did not find any multiple treatment group studies, but we would have presented the additional treatment arms in comparisons. If data were binary we would have added and combined the data within the two-by-two table. If data were continuous we would have combined data following the formula in section 7.7.3.8 (Combining groups) of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>. Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, we would not have reproduced these data.</P>

We chose that, for any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for we would not reproduce these data or use them within analyses. If, however, more than 50% of those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than 50%, we would have marked such data with (*) to indicate that such a result may well be prone to bias.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Binary</HEADING>
<P>The included studies had low attrition on the primary outcomes. However, had we found higher attrition rates we would have followed the following procedure. Where attrition for a binary outcome was between 0% and 50% and where these data were not clearly described, we would have presented data on a 'once randomised always analyse' basis (an intention-to-treat analysis). We would have assumed that data were missing at random, and that those leaving the study early would be similar to those remaining and have the same rates of negative outcome as those who completed the study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">3.2 Standard deviations</HEADING>
<P>The continuous outcome measures in our studies were skewed and authors reported the median as a summary measure rather than the mean. In the case of skewed data the standard deviation is not a useful measure and so we did not seek to obtain it. Had the mean values been reported but not the standard deviations we would have first tried to obtain the missing values from the authors.

An I<SUP>2 </SUP>estimate greater than or equal to around 50%, accompanied by a statistically significant Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, was interpreted as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). These are described in Section 10 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-09-10 13:52:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random-effects model. It adds an extra weight to all studies, making the weights more evenly spread and giving small studies relatively more weight compared to the fixed-effect model analysis. The small studies are often the most biased ones and, depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We chose the random-effects model for all analyses as the studies were all of similar size. The reader is, however, able to choose to inspect the data using the fixed-effect method.</P>

For this review we decided that should this occur with data contributing to the summary finding of no more than around 10% of the total weighting, the data were presented. If not, the data were not pooled and issues were discussed.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Study design</HEADING>
<P>All studies were randomised controlled trials. <LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lester-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2003</LINK> used cluster randomisation and the remaining trials used individual level randomisation. Both cluster trials acknowledged and investigated clustering effects within their reported data. The <LINK REF="STD-Lester-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2003</LINK> study reported that the random-effects model did not alter the results of their analysis and so reported the original figures, which we use in our report. The <LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK> study did not specifically report a cluster-adjusted analysis, but provided a design effect based on the intra-class correlation coefficient of 1.53. We have reported the results with the original data and have additionally provided a cluster-adjusted result where the <LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK> frequencies have been divided by the design effect.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Study sizes</HEADING>
<P>The total number of participants included in the four studies was N = 607. The average among the studies was n = 152 and the range was 90 to 201.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Study setting</HEADING>
<P>All studies were conducted in the United Kingdom. <LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lester-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2003</LINK> were conducted in a 'shared care' setting, that is, care that was jointly provided by primary and secondary care. <LINK REF="STD-Lester-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2003</LINK> was conducted between six community mental health teams in Birmingham (UK); <LINK REF="STD-Papageorgiou-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Papageorgiou 2002</LINK> was delivered in an inpatient setting, whereas all other trials involved participants who were treated in community settings. Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2004</LINK> were from eight community mental health teams in South London and Kent (UK).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Participants</HEADING>
<P>With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Lester-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2003</LINK>, which included only those people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, all studies had a mixture of diagnoses. <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2004</LINK> recruited individuals with psychosis and bipolar disorders (proportions not reported). <LINK REF="STD-Papageorgiou-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Papageorgiou 2002</LINK> had 63% with psychosis and 28% with depression and bipolar. <LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK> had 42% schizophrenia and 12% bipolar (the remaining diagnoses included 22% depression and 14% 'other') and thereby reached our inclusion criterion (at least 50%). In terms of gender profile, there were 338 male participants and 269 female participants across the studies, with the studies having a majority male sample (range 53% to 68%). The average age in the studies was very similar, with inclusion criteria ranging from 18 to 66 years, and a mean age of 39 years.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papageorgiou-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Papageorgiou 2002</LINK>) tested a form of advance statement (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2008</LINK>); that is, personal information and treatment preferences held for use in the event of a crisis or relapse. In these two studies, the user developed the user-held record with the help of a researcher or 'facilitator', and in the <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2004</LINK> study the clinical team involved in delivering routine care was also involved. The content of these interventions was similar and broadly included the users' views on relapse indicators, wishes for future treatment, contact details for themselves, their clinicians and family and carers. They may also have included an indication of treatments that they did not want, that is, a refusal of medication.</P>
<P>The other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lester-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK>) tested a form of medical record which included aspects such as contact details, clinical notes, future appointments and medication. <LINK REF="STD-Lester-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2003</LINK> also included an indication of relapse indicators and a diary section. For <LINK REF="STD-Lester-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK>, these records were given to the user after randomisation.</P>
<P>All studies compared the active intervention to 'treatment as usual' in primary or secondary care. In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2004</LINK> provided control participants with information leaflets regarding local services, treatments, and relevant legislation and policies (<LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">6. Outcomes (rating scales)</HEADING>
<P>A range of outcomes were investigated in the included studies. However, only four outcomes were investigated by more than one study: psychiatric hospital admissions; psychopathology; satisfaction; and outpatient attendance. All outcomes investigated by the studies are listed below.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">6.1 Psychiatric admissions</HEADING>
<P>Each included study compared the effect of user-held records to treatment as usual on the rate and length of psychiatric admission.</P>
<P>
<B>6.2 Compulsory psychiatric admissions</B>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lester-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Papageorgiou-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Papageorgiou 2002</LINK> also examined the rates of compulsory psychiatric hospital admissions under a section of the UK's Mental Health Act. <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Papageorgiou-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Papageorgiou 2002</LINK> additionally looked at number of days spent under a section of the Mental Health Act.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">6.3 Psychopathology</HEADING>
<P>Psychopathology was examined by three of the four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lester-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papageorgiou-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Papageorgiou 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>6.3.1 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>)</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK> used the BPRS, which is a rating scale designed to assess psychopathology across 16 dimensions: somatic concern; anxiety; emotional withdrawal; conceptual disorganisation; guilt feelings; tension; mannerisms and posturing; grandiosity; depressive mood; hostility; suspiciousness; hallucinatory behaviour; motor retardation; uncooperativeness; unusual thought content; and blunted affect. The BPRS is usually rated by an experienced researcher or clinician, with each item rated on a seven-point scale, varying from 0 = 'not present' to 7 = 'extremely severe', with high scores indicating more severe symptoms.</P>
<P>
<I>6.3.2 Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale (BASIS-32) </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Eisen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisen 1994</LINK>)</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Papageorgiou-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Papageorgiou 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK> used the BASIS-32 scale, which is a self-report measure completed by patients. The BASIS-32 has five subscales: relation to self and others; daily living and role functioning; depression and anxiety; impulsive and addictive behaviour; and psychosis. Thirty-two items are rated between 0 (= no problem) and 4 (= severe problem).</P>
<P>
<I>6.3.3 Krawiecka and Goldberg (K &amp; G) scale</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Krawiecka-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krawiecka 1977</LINK>)</P>
<P>Additionally, <LINK REF="STD-Lester-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2003</LINK> used the K &amp; G scale, which is a five-point rating scale assessing psychopathology across the following domains: depressed; anxious; coherently expressed delusions; hallucinations; incoherence and irrelevance of speech; poverty of speech; flattened incongruous affect; psychomotor agitation; and side effects of medication (tremor, rigidity, dystonic reactions, akathisia, difficulties with vision, other). A score of 0 represents the absence of an item, where a score of 4 may indicate severe psychopathology.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">6.4 Satisfaction</HEADING>
<P>
<I>6.4.1 Verona Service Satisfaction Scale (VSSS) </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Ruggieri-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruggieri 1993</LINK>)</P>
<P>Three studies examined the effect of the intervention on patient satisfaction. <LINK REF="STD-Lester-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Papageorgiou-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Papageorgiou 2002</LINK> used the Verona Service Satisfaction Scale (VSSS), however <LINK REF="STD-Papageorgiou-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Papageorgiou 2002</LINK> used an 'adapted brief version'. The full VSSS-54 contains 54 items rating questions over seven dimensions: overall aspects; professionals' skills and behaviour; information; access; efficacy; types of intervention; and relative's involvement. This is a five-point Likert scale, with a score of 1 = 'terrible' and 5 = 'excellent'.</P>
<P>
<I>6.4.2 Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ)</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Larsen-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsen 1979</LINK>)</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK> used the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ), which is an eight-item self-report measure covering: quality of service; needs addressed; amount of assistance; effect of assistance; recommendable; and overall satisfaction. Each item is rated on a one to four scale, with a lower score indicating a worse outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">6.5 Outpatient visits</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lester-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Warner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Warner 2000</LINK> both examined outpatient visits in terms of attendance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">6.6 Economic costs</HEADING>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2004</LINK> study published a secondary economic evaluation paper comparing the costs of service use between those who received the intervention and the control group over the 15-month study period. They used a modified version of the client service receipt inventory to collect information about use of services. Hospital use was collected from patient medical records and the Mental Health Act office.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">6.7 Other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Several other outcomes were investigated by individual studies including: self efficacy (no summary statistics so unable to include) (<LINK REF="STD-Papageorgiou-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Papageorgiou 2002</LINK>); and use of home treatment and non-mental health referrals (<LINK REF="STD-Lester-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>Of the 75 potentially relevant references identified in the updated search, 17 were duplicate studies or secondary references, and 49 were excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria described in the 'Types of studies&#8217;, &#8216;Types of participants&#8217;, and &#8216;Types of interventions&#8217;. The most common reason for exclusion was that the intervention did not involve a user-held information component. Four further references were excluded after contacting the authors (n = 3) or having materials translated (n = 1). <LINK REF="STD-Hamann-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hamann 2006</LINK> was a trial of shared decision making compared with standard treatment for 113 individuals with psychotic disorders treated in an inpatient setting in Germany. The intervention involved patients working through a decision aid booklet and noting their preferences for care, and using that as a prompt for discussion with their treating doctor; however, the patients did not hold the a record after this consultation. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Van-Os-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Van Os 2004</LINK> examined the effect of patients completing a checklist (2-COM) to identify care needs prior to routine consultations with their doctor, however the patients did not hold a record of the consultation or treatment plan. Likewise, <LINK REF="STD-Borell-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Borell 1995</LINK> examined a psycho-education initiative that involved some personalised information, but the patients did not hold the records after the sessions. Finally, <LINK REF="STD-Swanson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 2008</LINK> was excluded as it was a secondary paper from the <LINK REF="STD-Swanson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Swanson 2006</LINK> study that examined coercive events within the intervention group who received a Facilitated Psychiatric Advance Directive, that is, there was no comparison group.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Stafford-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stafford 1997</LINK> was an audit of 45 people with long term mental illness who agreed to carry a small pocket-sized file containing contact details, early warning signs for relapse, and notes made by professionals. Level of use was recorded by checking entries in the professionals' notes against those in the record, and the holders were surveyed on their views of the usefulness of the record as a whole and of its separate components. There was no control group. Two randomised studies concerned the use of 'green cards' to facilitate access to services for patients with a primary diagnosis of deliberate self harm (<LINK REF="STD-Cotgrove-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cotgrove 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morgan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 1993</LINK>) rather than one of a psychotic illness.

The aims of three (<LINK REF="STD-Essex-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Essex 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pickersgill-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pickersgill 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 1996</LINK>) were to improve shared care between professional primary care givers and specialist mental health services as well as to empower users of mental health services (<LINK REF="STD-Essex-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Essex 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reuler-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Reuler 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolf-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wolf 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Pickersgill-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pickersgill 1998</LINK> primarily focused on patient empowerment along with developing partnerships with users and carers. Each of these uncontrolled studies described the development and introduction of a personal record and then surveyed the individuals' views on its usefulness or level of use. (<LINK REF="STD-Sutherby-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherby 1999</LINK>) described the use of crisis cards and joint crisis plans for people with severe mental illnesses who were in receipt of specialist care. 'Joint crisis plans' were drawn up once the contents had been agreed by both the team and patient at a meeting between the patient, an advocate if required, team members and a facilitator. Where the team could not agree with the patient's wishes, these were to have been written on a 'crisis card' instead. Participants were then followed up and asked their views on the plans and whether they had affected how they felt about their illness and treatment. There was no control group. The last case series (<LINK REF="STD-Backlar-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Backlar 1996</LINK>) was not an intervention study but a postal survey of members of organisations for relatives of mentally ill people, to assess the level of use of advance directives for mental health treatment.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.1.1 Psychiatric admission</HEADING>
<P>Psychiatric hospital admission data were available for four trials involving 597 participants. We found no significant effect of the intervention in any of these studies individually. The pooled treatment effect showed no significant impact of the intervention and was of very low magnitude (n = 597, 4 RCTs, RR 0.99 CI 0.71 to 1.38, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), see <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. There was some heterogeneity between the studies (P = 0.16; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 41%), with the variance explained by between-study differences.</P>
<P>We adjusted the cluster randomised study for the design effect but found very little effect on the pooled effect estimate (n = 566, 4 RCTs, RR 0.97 CI 0.70 to 1.35, <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.1.2 Compulsory admission</HEADING>
<P>Only three studies involving 507 participants provided information on compulsory admissions to hospital. This is a low number of studies for a meta-analysis, though we have provided a pooled estimate (see Figure 5). When pooled there was no significant effect of the intervention (n = 507, RR 0.64 CI 0.37 to 1.10, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Heterogeneity was lower in this comparison (P = 0.28; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 21%), though this was very difficult to judge with only three studies considered (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1.1.3 Psychiatric admission - number of days spent in hospital</HEADING>
<P>Summary data on the length of admissions were provided by three studies, none of which found a significant impact of the intervention. It was not possible to pool this data as the measure was skewed and so non-parametric summary measures were provided (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). There was evidence of some heterogeneity between the studies in terms of the median length of admissions, and the magnitude and direction of the treatment effect.

A significant effect of the intervention was stated to have been found in one study but not the other (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>); the results generally suggested that people who received user-held personal information spent less time in hospital under compulsory admission.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Completeness</HEADING>
<P>With only four studies investigating the core question of the effect of user-held records on psychiatric hospitalisation, and fewer examining other outcomes, it is too early to determine the effectiveness of user-held records. We note with interest two ongoing trials, due to be completed in 2012, that examine our primary and secondary outcomes of interest including hospitalisation, costs and working alliance (<LINK REF="STD-Ruchlewska-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ruchlewska 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thornicroft-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Thornicroft 2010</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Applicability</HEADING>
<P>The only study to find a significant reduction in compulsory psychiatric admissions (<LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2004</LINK>) investigated a form of advance statement (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2008</LINK>), suggesting that both the involvement of the service user in deciding the content and inclusion of future treatment wishes or refusals in the record may have an important effect. However, one other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Papageorgiou-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Papageorgiou 2002</LINK>) also investigated a form of advance statement but found no effect on the outcomes of interest. There were several differences between <LINK REF="STD-Papageorgiou-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Papageorgiou 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2004</LINK>; firstly, the <LINK REF="STD-Papageorgiou-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Papageorgiou 2002</LINK> study was conducted in an inpatient setting with service users who were under a section of the Mental Health Act and due for discharge. It is conceivable that service users may have felt compelled to participate in the trial or that their participation could influence their discharge from the hospital ward. By contrast, the <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2004</LINK> study was conducted in the community and thus the potential for perceived pressure to participate was lessened. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2004</LINK> study had some direct or indirect involvement (see <LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2008</LINK>) of the clinical team. This suggests that the efficacy of this type of user-held record may be increased if clinical teams are also involved in the discussion of the contents and thus may be better placed to facilitate the service user's wishes in the event of a future relapse.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-09-10 13:52:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four studies involving 607 participants and two different types of interventions were included. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate. Each of the individual studies were methodologically quite strong, notwithstanding some gaps in reporting of randomisation and blinding procedures. However, there were too few studies addressing each outcome of interest to reach a robust conclusion regarding the effectiveness of user-held records.</P>
<P>There was a great deal of heterogeneity in both the outcomes reported and their measurement, which prevented synthesis of most outcomes. Additionally, we believe the between-study variability for the psychiatric hospital admissions and compulsory psychiatric admission outcomes resulted in wide confidence intervals for these estimations. We therefore downgraded the precision rating for these estimations in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2004</LINK>) found a significant reduction in compulsory psychiatric admissions.</P>

<P>The search for studies was rigorous, using the Cochrane database, reference chaining, grey literature searching and contact with topic experts. One study was identified in a trial registry entry from the early 2000s, but neither reports of findings nor the authors could be located. It is unlikely that this trial would strongly affect our results as the primary outcomes were only of secondary interest to this review (for example, health behaviours and psychological variables such as locus of control). Study selection and data extraction were conducted separately by two authors and confirmed by a third, and thus the risk of bias in study selection and extraction is limited. Authors of included studies were contacted for information regarding gaps in the reports of methods but the information was not available. Without this information, the risk of bias is inconclusive and noted as such in the risk of bias tables.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>The current state of the evidence suggests that practitioners should be wary of user-held information systems until their effects have been more thoroughly evaluated with respect to hospital admissions and other outcomes (see 'Implications for research'). In the meantime, any decision about whether to use such systems must be made based on clinical judgement and in the light of current mental health care legislation unsupported by trial-based evidence. This lack of evidence should be made clear to patients (see below). Clinicians interested in this question may wish to participate in clinical trials to test the effects of user-held information systems.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. For people with psychotic illnesses</HEADING>
<P>If a user of services with a diagnosis of a psychotic illness is offered the choice of holding clinical information regarding their care and treatment, it should be on the understanding that, currently, no evidence exists as to whether this helps or harms, although some patients report finding it useful. It would be understandable if users of services who are interested in establishing whether they and others would be better off or not with such information ask to be included in a randomised controlled trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. For managers and policymakers</HEADING>
<P>A policy that mandates the provision of information to patients on their care plan is not based on evidence from randomised controlled trials; nor is there any evidence for or against promoting the holding of personalised clinical information by patients with a diagnosis of psychotic illness. Managers and policymakers should encourage randomised controlled trials of this potentially inexpensive but potent intervention.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. General</HEADING>
<P>Registration of trials before anyone is randomised would ensure that participants could be confident that people would know that the study had at least taken place. Unique study numbers would help researchers identify single studies from multiple publications and reduce the risk of duplicating the reporting of data. Compliance with <A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</A> would help clarify methodology and many outcomes. Failure to do this results in both loss of data and confusion in the results.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2.2 Trials</HEADING>
<P>The findings of this updated review suggest that the evidence gap remains regarding user-held, personalised, accessible clinical information for people with psychotic illnesses. Since the cost of such information systems is low and their use seems acceptable to some patients, it is likely that interest in user-held records will grow. It cannot be assumed, however, that user-held information is beneficial and cost effective without evidence from well planned, conducted and reported randomised trials.</P>
<P>As noted, two large trials are underway and are due to report findings shortly. Both are investigating a form of advance statement. The <A HREF="http://crimson.iop.kcl.ac.uk/">CRIMSON</A> trial (<LINK REF="STD-Thornicroft-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Thornicroft 2010</LINK>) is a large effectiveness trial of the Joint Crisis Plan intervention, following on from the <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2004</LINK> trial reported in this review. Such a large scale trial is likely to provide important evidence regarding both the effectiveness and acceptability of these types of intervention in a range of treatment settings. Similarly, the <LINK REF="STD-Ruchlewska-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ruchlewska 2009</LINK> is underway in the Netherlands and is comparing both service user facilitated and clinician facilitated joint crisis plans with treatment as usual. This important trial is likely to add to the understanding of the mechanism of action of such interventions.</P>

<P>We were concerned about splitting outcome data for the results at 12 months; the review authors appreciate that time frames were specified in the protocol, but we made the decision that it does not fairly represent the data by making a distinction between three studies with a 12-month follow-up and one study with a 15-month follow-up. We think that representing the data in this way may lead to misleading messages about time trends that we do not have evidence for.</P>

<P>2. Assessment of quality<BR/>Trials were allocated to three quality categories, as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1999</LINK>) by each reviewer, again, working independently.<BR/>A. Low risk of bias (all criteria met e.g. adequate allocation concealment)<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (one or more criteria partly met e.g. some doubt about the results)<BR/>C. High risk of bias (one or more criteria not met e.g. inadequate allocation concealment).</P>
<P>When disputes arose as to which category a trial was allocated, resolution was attempted by discussion. When this was not possible, and further information was necessary, data were not entered into the analyses and the study was allocated to the list of those awaiting assessment. Only trials in Category A or B were included in the review.</P>
<P>**Please note that no trials were found that met these criteria in the previous review. The originally proposed method for data management and analysis is included below for completeness.</P>
<P>3. Data management<BR/>3.1 Data extraction<BR/>This was performed independently by both reviewers and, where further clarification was needed, the authors of trials were contacted to provide missing data.</P>
<P>3.2 Intention to treat analysis<BR/>Data were excluded from studies where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow up (this does not include the outcome of 'leaving the study early'). In studies with less than 50% dropout rate, people leaving early were considered to have had the negative outcome, except for the event of death. The impact of including studies with high attrition rates (25-50%) was analysed in a sensitivity analysis. If inclusion of data from this latter group did result in a substantive change in the estimate of effect their data were not added to trials with less attrition, but presented separately.</P>
<P>4. Data analysis<BR/>4.1 Binary data<BR/>For binary outcomes a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. The number needed to treat statistic (NNT) was also calculated. If heterogeneity was found (see section 5) a random effects model was used.</P>
<P>4.2 Continuous data<BR/>4.2.1 Skewed data: Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data the following standards are applied to all data before inclusion: i. standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; ii. when a scale starts from a finite number (such as 0), the standard deviation, when multiplied by 2, was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution) (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and this rule can be applied to them. Change data is more problematic, and this rule cannot be applied with confidence. Change data were therefore only presented if no endpoint data were available (see 4.2.4).</P>
<P>4.2.2 Summary statistic: For continuous outcomes a weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups was estimated. Again, if heterogeneity was found (see section 5) a random effects model was used.</P>
<P>4.2.3 Valid scales: Continuous data from rating scales were included only if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal and the instrument was either a self report or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist).</P>
<P>4.2.4 Endpoint versus change data<BR/>Where possible endpoint data were presented and if both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcomes then only the former were reported in this review.</P>
<P>5. Test for heterogeneity<BR/>A Chi-square test was used, as well as visual inspection of graphs, to investigate the possibility of heterogeneity. A significance level less than 0.10 was interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity. If this was found the data were re-analysed using a random effects model to see if this made a substantial difference. If it did not the studies responsible for the heterogeneity were not added to the main body of homogeneous trials, but summated and presented separately.</P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias<BR/>Data from all included studies were entered into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>7. General<BR/>Where possible, reviewers entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for user-held notes.</P>
<P>8. Sensitivity analysis<BR/>The sensitivity of the results from the main outcomes will be tested for change when the assumption that those who did not complete the study had a poor outcome was not employed.</P>
