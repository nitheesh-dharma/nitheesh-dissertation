<P>No strong evidence to show who, other than women at risk, should be screened before or during pregnancy for fragile X syndrome.</P>
<P>Fragile X syndrome is caused by an inherited genetic defect that can result in mental disability. There is no way of reversing the syndrome. Although it runs in families, many people do not realise they are carriers until they have an affected child. A blood test can identify whether a person is a carrier, and therefore whether a test on the unborn baby is worthwhile. Currently, only women who are thought to be more likely to pass on fragile X are offered testing before or during pregnancy. There are no trials to show whether offering the test to everyone is worthwhile.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-07 11:18:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-07 11:18:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation, and is the second most common cause after Down Syndrome. It affects one in 4000 males and one in 8000 females.</P>
<P>The syndrome derives its name from the folate-sensitive fragile site on the long arm of the X chromosome at Xq27.3. This has been shown to result from a dynamic mutation in a gene-designated FMR1 where there are multiple copies of the CGG (cytosine-guanine-guanine) sequence of DNA. A mutation is an error in a gene which affects the function of that gene. Usually mutations stay the same once they have occurred and are passed down unchanged from parent to child. Dynamic mutations are those that can change as they are passed down to future generations. In normal individuals there are six to 50 repeats of this sequence although some groups suggest this upper number could be as high as 55 (<LINK REF="REF-Maddalena-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">
Maddalena 2001
</LINK>) or 59 repeats (
<LINK REF="REF-Berkenstadt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">
Berkenstadt 2007
</LINK>
). When the number of repeats ranges between 50 (or 55 or 59) and 200, this is known as a premutation (PM); more than 200 repeats is considered a full mutation (FM). Full mutations in the FMR1 gene inactivate the gene resulting in the Fragile X phenotype in males (who only have one copy of the gene) and a proportion of females. A PM is subject to expansion during a female meiosis (a form of cell division in which the number of chromosomes is halved), but remains fairly stable during a male meiosis. Therefore, a female with a PM or a FM may pass on a larger mutation than her own, resulting in offspring affected by Fragile X syndrome. Meanwhile, men with a PM may pass this onto their daughters, who will be of normal intellect, but may pass a larger mutation onto their offspring.</P>
<P>Males with a PM are phenotypically normal, while males with a FM nearly always have a typical fragile X phenotype. This FM phenotype shows moderate disability when the boy is prepubertal, with IQs ranging from 35 to 55, and more severe intellectual disability in adults with IQs from 20 to 40. This level of intellectual ability would imply a need for special education and an inability to live independently in the long term. Seizures occur in approximately 20% of males with fragile X syndrome and behavioral problems are often significant, including problems with attention deficit and hyperactivity. Some show aggressive behaviour in adulthood.</P>
<P>Females with a PM have a normal intellect. They appear to be at higher risk (up to 30%) of premature ovarian failure than women with either a normal fragile X gene or a full mutation. There is also a suggestion that they may have subtle emotional and cognitive features. Females with a FM have either normal intelligence (one-third), are borderline mentally retarded (one-third), or severely mentally retarded (one-third). While fragile X syndrome is therefore formally an X-linked, dominantly-inherited disorder it has a complex non-mendelian pattern of inheritance where females as well as males can be affected, and both males and females can be unaffected carriers. It has recently been shown that there is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder called the Fragile X associated tremor-ataxia syndrome (FXTA) which may present later in life in premutation carriers (more markedly in male than female carriers. 
</P>
<P>The aim of population screening for fragile X is to provide couples with reproductive choices. Fragile X is generally inherited from the mother. In order to identify women at risk of having a pregnancy affected by fragile X, women carrying the PM or FM need to be identified through a blood test. Women identified as having a PM or FM are then able to make informed decisions. They have the choice of avoiding pregnancy altogether, the use of donor ova, undergoing invasive antenatal diagnosis (usually by chorionic villous sampling) followed by either terminating an affected pregnancy or continuing with this pregnancy aware of the possible problems facing the child and family. A new option is that of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) which enables selection of an unaffected zygote prior to embryo transfer after in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). The secondary objective of screening is to bring forward the diagnosis of affected individuals who may then possibly benefit from early medical, social, educational and psychological interventions to improve symptoms. The screening strategies aimed at improving prognosis in an affected child are outside the scope of this review. There may also be potential benefit in the provision of information for its own sake (<LINK REF="REF-Mooney-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mooney 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three types of screening strategies can be used to identify women at high risk of an affected pregnancy:</P>
<OL>
<LI>antenatal testing of all women regardless of risk;</LI>
<LI>preconceptional testing of all women (regardless of age) prior to first pregnancy;</LI>
<LI>systematic testing within the families of affected individuals, so-called 'cascade' screening.</LI>
</OL>
<P>All of the effective screening methods rely on a protocol of DNA amplification by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which is relatively cheap on a large scale. Southern blotting, a much more expensive process, is then used for ambiguous alleles. This sequential testing protocol, when used liberally (both tests are required in around thirty per cent of women) gives very accurate results about the presence of both PMs and FMs. As the probes are readily available and the methods more accurate than the cytogenetic techniques originally used, it is now important to address the issue of the effectiveness of population screening programmes, and their human and financial cost. Cuckle and Murray have constructed a model of allele inheritance and predicted the likely outcome for antenatal screening. They predict that there should be a detection rate and negative predictive value approaching 100%, a false-positive rate of 0.4% and a positive predictive value of 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Cuckle-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuckle 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>
There have been no large scale population-based studies comparing antenatal or preconceptional screening of low-risk women with that of women at high risk of carrying fragile X. There have been three prospective studies in which women with no known family history of fragile X were screened (<LINK REF="REF-Ryynanen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryynanen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pesso-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pesso 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berkenstadt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berkenstadt 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Ryynanen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryynanen 1999</LINK> offered screening to low-risk women attending an antenatal clinic. Eighty-five per cent of women chose to use the screening test. There was a carrier rate of one in 246, and all six carriers accepted antenatal testing. <LINK REF="REF-Pesso-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pesso 2000</LINK> found a frequency of carriers of fragile X of one in 70 in their population. In subsequent pregnancies, 111 fetuses were tested and nine had a full mutation. All theses nine fetuses were terminated. Recently (<LINK REF="REF-Berkenstadt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">
Berkenstadt 2007
</LINK>) reported a population-based study from Israel which included over 40,000 women with no known history of Fragile X. Thirty-six thousand of these women also had no family history of mental retardation, developmental delay or autism. These were women who requested the test and needed to make a co-payment. Overall there was a carrier frequency of 1 in 154 women. In those 4000+ women with a positive family history, the rate was 1 in 128. Of the 255 PM carriers, 214 underwent invasive testing. There were 30 FM pregnancies (8.1%), all of which were terminated.</P>
<P>There are two further studies in which almost 1000 women were screened, many of whom had a family history of mental retardation or learning disabilities (<LINK REF="REF-Howard_x002d_Peebles-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard-Peebles 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spence-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spence 1996</LINK>). In the former study, none of the women with a suspicious family history were shown to carry fragile X, while three of the 474 women with no relevant history did have a PM.</P>
<P>There are three reported programmes of cascade screening (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nolin-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nolin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gabarron-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gabarron 1992</LINK>). These are based on case-finding among the mentally handicapped, contacting and testing the relatives and then estimating the potential number of affected males that could be identified antenatally as a result of this form of screening. There is a fourth from Finland (<LINK REF="REF-Ryynanen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryynanen 1995</LINK>), which used cytogenetics records for case finding. In this earlier study by this group, forty-eight per cent of those people identified as 'at risk' accepted the test. All the women who were found to be carriers of the mutation and who became pregnant within the study period made use of invasive antenatal diagnosis.</P>
<P>A further study compares screening pregnant women with a family history of mental retardation with screening mentally retarded individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Wenstrom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wenstrom 1999</LINK>). This study found no cases of fragile X in the 12,349 women tested, all of whom had a family history of unspecified mental retardation or learning or behavioural disorders, but 31 cases of fragile X in 1637 people who themselves suffered from these disorders.</P>
<P>A theoretical model of cascade screening has suggested that it is not very efficient in detecting carriers (<LINK REF="REF-Wildhagen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wildhagen 1999</LINK>); in order to detect 90% of all PM and FM carriers, at least eight generations of a family would need to be tested.</P>
<P>There have been several papers addressing the potential cost-benefit of routine screening. An earlier study assessing the cost of routine antenatal carrier testing for fragile X (<LINK REF="REF-Vintzileos-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vintzileos 1999</LINK>) found that it was not then economically viable in the United States. Cascade screening is much cheaper in absolute terms than population screening due to far fewer tests being required (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gabarron-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gabarron 1992</LINK>). However, despite the higher cost of testing a population, recent studies in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Song-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">
Song 2003
</LINK>), the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Musci-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">
Musci 2005
</LINK>) and Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Hollingsworth-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">
Hollingsworth 2005
</LINK>) have all suggested that a population screening program may be cost effective.</P>
<P>There is little information on the psychological aspects of either screening or antenatal diagnosis of fragile X syndrome. One small study in the Netherlands (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Rijn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Rijn 1997</LINK>) examined the psychosocial implications for parents and families in 19 fragile X families and there has also been a longitudinal study of the psychological effects of carrier testing on a group of women at high risk of inheriting fragile X, suggesting a reduction in positive feelings about oneself in those women shown to be carriers of fragile X (<LINK REF="REF-McConkie_x002d_Rosell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McConkie-Rosell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McConkie_x002d_Rosell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">McConkie-Rosell 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>There have been extensive health technology assessments on the implication of fragile X screening for health planners (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>) and more recently by <LINK REF="REF-Song-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">

<P>This review highlighted the inadequacy of research into the efficacy of differing antenatal or preconceptional screening strategies for fragile X.

<P>No information is available from randomised trials to indicate whether or not non-selective screening for fragile X in women desirous of, or already pregnant, confers any benefit over the existing practice of selective screening of those thought to be at increased risk. Screening for genetic disease in pregnant women is important, is expanding, is understudied and has major ethical concerns which have not as yet been sorted out.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Trials are needed in order to assess the benefits and risks of screening all women, desirous of or already pregnant, for fragile X, compared with the existing practice of screening those perceived to be at increased risk. </P>
<P>Any trial will require adequate funding to ensure appropriate counselling as well as proper screening and antenatal testing where indicated, and provision for longer term follow up. </P>
