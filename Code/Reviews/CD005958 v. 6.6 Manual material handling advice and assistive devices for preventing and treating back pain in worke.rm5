<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-10 05:20:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Jos H Verbeek">
<P>Back pain is very common among adults. There is evidence that individuals who physically move or lift objects (manual material handling) on a regular basis increase the strain on their backs and the risk of developing back pain. In many occupations, it is difficult to avoid this. Training on proper lifting techniques and the use of mechanical aides (assistive devices) are considered important techniques to prevent back pain.</P>
<P>We included nine randomised controlled trials (20,101 employees) and nine cohort studies (1280 employees) that examined the effects of training and the use of assistive devices on preventing low-back pain and reducing back-related disability. We found no studies that examined the effects of training or the use of assistive devices as part of a treatment plan for back pain.</P>
<P>We found moderate quality evidence that reports of back pain, back-related disability or absence from work were similar between groups who received training on proper lifting techniques and assistive devices compared to a control group that received either no training, minor advice only, professional education, exercise training or back belts. Reports of back pain were also similar between those who received intensive training and those who received shorter instruction. These findings were consistent when measured in the short-term or long-term and when examined in randomised trials or cohort studies.</P>
<P>These results are similar to other reviews that examined a range of possible prevention measures. Some of the other reviews found that workers who received training were satisfied and demonstrated increased knowledge on the subject, but this did not appear to consistently translate into behaviour change.</P>
<P>In conclusion, training workers in proper material handling techniques or providing them with assistive devices are not effective interventions by themselves in preventing back pain. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</P>

<P>We included nine RCTs (20,101 employees) and nine cohort studies (1280 employees) on the prevention of back pain in this updated review. Studies compared training to no intervention (4), professional education (2), a video (3), use of a back belt (3) or exercise (2).

<P>Six RCTs had a high risk of bias.</P>
<P>None of the included studies showed evidence of a preventive effect of training on back pain.</P>
<P>There was moderate quality evidence from seven RCTs (19,317 employees) that those who received training reported levels of back pain similar to those who received no intervention, with an odds ratio of 1.17 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.68 to 2.02) or minor advice (video), with a relative risk of 0.93 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.25).

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-09 13:57:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence that strain on the back caused by adverse ergonomic factors in manual material handling (MMH) leads to an increased risk of developing back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Kuiper-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuiper 1999</LINK>). MMH refers to a variety of techniques related to moving inanimate or animate objects from one place or level to another, using muscular force with or without assistive devices.</P>
<P>With the term 'adverse ergonomic factors', we usually describe the maladjustment between the worker and the workplace or the work organisation in general (<LINK REF="REF-Scheer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheer 1997</LINK>). Adaptation of workers to the work environment depends on the workplace and the nature of the work, such as the lay-out and other physical factors of the workplace (e.g. lighting, temperature), organisation of work, working methods, or availability of tools and assistive devices. Because the skills of the worker are also crucial, educating the individual to cope with the conditions of the workplace could be a feasible option to prevent back pain.</P>
<P>In many occupations, it is difficult to avoid heavy loads on the back (e.g. lifting and moving patients in health care). Therefore, it is not surprising that emphasis has been given to optimising lifting techniques and ways to manually handle patients and objects to prevent back pain and injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Menzel-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menzel 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Straker-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straker 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Straker-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straker 2002b</LINK>). Better skilled workers are supposed to cope better with adverse ergonomic conditions, resulting in less strain on the back, less back pain and consequently, less back pain-related disability.</P>
<P>This has lead to a strong belief that it is useful to advise employees or organise training for them on correct MMH techniques and to provide them with assistive devices. Usually, the training is given by occupational health personnel and is considered a major intervention to prevent back pain among workers (<LINK REF="REF-Hignett-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hignett 2003</LINK>). The interventions are based on the idea that individual workers can change the load on their back by using different lifting techniques, assistive devices, or both. Most interventions are based on a simple model of learning in which increased knowledge, different attitudes and increased skills will lead to an improved ability to cope with strain on the back. The content of interventions ranges in intensity from advice on a technique given once to an extensive several-day course with training and practice.</P>
<P>Several lifting techniques have been advocated to reduce the load on the back. Probably the best known is the so-called 'leg lift' (lifting an object using a squat position). However, over the past dozen years or so, it has been questioned whether there are valid arguments for this technique from a biomechanical point of view (<LINK REF="REF-van-Die_x00eb_n-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Dieën 1999</LINK>). Other authors question the concept of 'correct' lifting techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Straker-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straker 2002b</LINK>). Several reviews on the effectiveness of work-related interventions in the prevention of back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Bos-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bos 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hignett-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hignett 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Poppel-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Poppel 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Poppel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Poppel 2004</LINK>) have concluded that training in lifting techniques does not prevent back pain.</P>
<P>In addition to advice on lifting techniques, the provision of assistive devices to reduce physical loads in heavy work is a well-known strategy to prevent low-back pain. Based on the notion that it is preferable to reduce the work load rather than its effects ('prevention at the source'), many products have been developed to alleviate the worker's task (<LINK REF="REF-de-Looze-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Looze 2001</LINK>). Assistive devices are devices that assist in the manual handling but do not fully automate or replace the process of manual handling. Therefore, they relieve part of the workload but do not eliminate it completely.</P>
<P>The assumption underlying advice and training for MMH is that it will teach workers to relieve the strain on their back. Therefore, it can be applied both by workers who already have back pain and want to resume ordinary activities and those who are exposed to strain but do not yet have back pain. We refer to these two situations as treatment and prevention.</P>
<P>Back pain is a very prevalent condition among workers (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 2006</LINK>). The resulting disability has enormous consequences for working life in terms of human suffering, as well as direct and indirect economic costs due to lost workdays and reduced productivity. Therefore, it is important to conduct a systematic Cochrane review focusing on the effectiveness of MMH advice and training and use of assistive devices in preventing and treating back pain in workers. The original review was published in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Martimo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martimo 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martimo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martimo 2008</LINK>). In 2011, we updated the literature and the review.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of MMH advice and training and the use of assistive devices in preventing and treating back pain (or its recurrence) in workers.</P>

<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) for the primary study selection and analysis. If we had found any, we would also have included controlled clinical trials (CCT), which are intervention studies with a comparison group, but the assignment to the groups has not been properly randomised. For the first version of the review, we assumed that there would not be many RCTs because it is not easy to randomise in the occupational health setting. Therefore, we also included prospective cohort studies that used a concurrent control group, to be able to compare the results of RCTs to those of cohort studies. While choosing trials for this update we recognized that RCTs were possible and available, however, we kept the cohort studies to see if there were differences across different study designs.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Inclusion criteria</HEADING>
<P>Participants were working age adults (16 to 70 years, male or female) who were engaged in jobs with MMH to the extent that their risk for back pain was increased. The studies were supposed to include a description of the exposure.</P>
<P>We had originally intended to only include studies with workers without back pain for the prevention studies. However, this proved to be too impractical because in many studies, some workers did have back pain, and it was too arbitrary a decision to define the maximum percentage of them that could be included for a study to still qualify as one of prevention. Therefore, we changed this inclusion criterion to workers who were not actively seeking treatment for current back pain. There were no restrictions on previous episodes of back pain.</P>
<P>We had also planned to include treatment studies, where participants with (sub)acute (12 weeks or less) or chronic (longer than 12 weeks) non-specific back pain were seeking treatment. Pain could have been located in the lumbar or thoracic part of the back, with or without radiating symptoms (leg pain). Pain intensity should not have been severe enough to prevent participation in the intervention. We found one study nested in a prevention study (<LINK REF="STD-Daltroy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Daltroy 1997</LINK>) that evaluated the effect of training after workers returned to work following a low-back injury. Workers received training at a median of five months after returning to work; the outcome measured was the recurrence of back injury. The average length of sick leave was not given. The authors did not require participants to be experiencing back pain or seeking treatment at the time of recruitment. Since both are inclusion criteria in the present review, we excluded the treatment part of this study.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Exclusion criteria</HEADING>
<P>Non-specific back pain was described as back pain that was not caused by specific pathologic entities. Patients with back pain due to infections, metastatic diseases, neoplasm, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or fractures were excluded. Back pain presenting with sciatica as the major symptom, and back pain during pregnancy or postpartum were also excluded, as were patients with pain occurring only in the cervical area.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Inclusion criteria</HEADING>
<P>All interventions aimed at changing human behaviour in MMH or using MMH assistive devices were included.</P>
<P>The interventions were divided into two groups according to the target of the intervention:<BR/>a) MMH techniques to decrease the mechanical load of MMH on the back,<BR/>b) the use of assistive devices to decrease the mechanical load of MMH on the back.</P>
<P>We included all interventions, regardless of the content, as long as the focus was on MMH techniques and the use of assistive devices. We expected to find: educational classes (including back schools focused on prevention), individual training and instructions, posters, leaflets, videos, audiotapes, on the spot or on the job training, and combinations of several interventions.</P>
<P>Any MMH assistive device could qualify as such, for example, hoists and other lifting aids, or sliding boards and other patient transfer aids.</P>
<P>We included a broad range of MMH exposures (e.g. lifting, lowering, pulling and pushing), even though the amount of evidence on the relationship with back pain varies for the different exposures, e.g. the relationship with pushing and pulling, is not very clear. We dealt with this problem by classifying the interventions by the type of MMH exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Harkness-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harkness 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoozemans-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoozemans 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Nieuwenhuyse-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Nieuwenhuyse 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>We compared training with no training or a minor and passive form of training such as providing a video instruction. In addition, we included alternative interventions such as exercises or the use of back belts.</P>
<P>We also compared the use of assistive devices such as hoists for lifting patients plus training to no intervention or the provision of assistive devices alone.</P>
<P>The only co-interventions allowed in the treatment studies would have been analgesics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Exclusion criteria</HEADING>
<P>We excluded studies on classical back schools as the intervention of interest from the treatment studies, because their scope of education is broader than MMH techniques and a systematic review on their curative effectiveness already exists (<LINK REF="REF-Heymans-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heymans 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>We excluded studies on lumbar supports as the intervention of interest because there already is a systematic review on their effectiveness for the prevention and treatment of low-back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Duijvenbode-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Duijvenbode 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>We also excluded studies on interventions aimed at workplace adaptations because they go beyond advising workers about MMH techniques.</P>
<P>However, we included studies in the review if advice on MMH techniques, use of assistive devices, or both, had been used in comparison to the above-mentioned interventions.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2011-05-09 14:51:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In prevention studies, the primary outcome was the incidence, duration, frequency of episodes or intensity of non-specific back pain, with or without radiating pain, during follow-up. The secondary outcome was the number of days on sick leave due to back pain.<BR/>
<BR/>In treatment studies, the primary outcomes would have been time to return-to-work, the proportion of persons off work, or the number of days on sick leave with back pain during the follow-up period. The secondary outcome measures would have been recurrences (number or length) of back pain, intensity of symptoms, functional status, or well-being (e.g. quality of life, psychological and psychosocial outcome measures).</P>
<P>We looked for intermediate outcomes in both preventive and treatment studies, such as change in knowledge, behaviour or attitudes related to MMH (adherence to the training or advice), or reduction in the exposure to physical workload. A secondary outcome in all studies was participant satisfaction with the intervention. Complications related to new MMH techniques or devices were also taken into consideration.</P>

<P>Trials reported in any language were considered.</P>
<P>With the primary focus on RCTs and CCTs, we used the search strategy that was developed and updated by the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). We used the strategy to search CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Nioshtic, CISdoc, Science Citation Index and PsychLIT to.</P>
<P>First, we applied the recommended sensitive search for RCTs, then combined it with the terms for spinal disorders for a more specific search. Finally, we added the terms for MMH. We tested a list of possible search words in MEDLINE for their sensitivity and specificity. The problem with many search words for lifting or carrying was that they were not very specific for MMH.

<P>We have based the results and conclusions of this review on the primary analysis alone, which includes evidence from RCTs. If studies were sufficiently similar with regard to the intervention, the control condition, the outcome and the follow-up time, they were combined in a meta-analysis. If outcomes were deemed similar, such as sick leave and back pain-related disability scores, or if back pain was measured in different ways and with different scales, we converted ORs to effect sizes or standardised mean differences (SMD) by dividing the ln(OR) by 1.81 as recommended in <I>The Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x0171_neman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sch&#369;neman 2011</LINK>). For the effect sizes, we used the generic inverse variance method as implemented in RevMan 5 to perform the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Had heterogeneity been substantial, as indicated by the I² statistic, we had intended to use a random effects model to pool study results, but this was not the case for any of the outcomes. Therefore, we used a fixed effects model for all outcomes that could be combined in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>A secondary analysis was completed using only the prospective cohort studies. We analysed the cohort studies in the same way as the RCTs, where we summarised the results of each comparison in a qualitative way. Thereafter, we compared and contrasted the conclusions from the primary and secondary analyses.</P>
<P>Regardless of whether there were sufficient data available to use quantitative analyses to summarize the data, we assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome in each comparison. We used the GRADE approach, as recommended in <I>The Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and by the updated CBRG method guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2009</LINK>). The quality of the evidence on a specific outcome is based on the performance against five factors: study design, risk of bias in the studies, consistency of results, directness (generalisability), imprecision (sufficient data) and publication bias. The quality started at <I>high</I> when high quality RCTs provided results for the outcome, and was reduced by a level for each of the factors not met.</P>

<P>In August 2005, the primary search strategy for RCTs and CCTs in nine databases resulted in the identification of 3547 titles altogether. The additional sensitive search strategy in MEDLINE was applied in order to find all relevant cohort studies. This yielded 1229 references. After excluding the ones already covered by previous searches, 47 additional titles remained for evaluation. Manual searches of the reference lists in reviews and other sources yielded another 17 references. All of these searches combined to give a total of 3611 potentially eligible articles.</P>
<P>Two members of the research group screened the titles and abstracts of the identified articles, and 101 full articles were ordered for closer evaluation. Seventy-eight articles were excluded because the study did not have a specific intervention in MMH handling; the article was a review; the study did not include the required outcome measures; or the study did not include a control group. Of the 23 remaining articles, 11 were excluded, and the reasons are given in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>Consequently, 12 articles were left for closer evaluation (<LINK REF="STD-Best-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Best 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daltroy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Daltroy 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dehlin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Dehlin 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fanello-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fanello 1999</LINK> (2); <LINK REF="STD-Feldstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Feldstein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartvigsen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hartvigsen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-M_x00fc_ller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Müller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reddell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Reddell 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Poppel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van Poppel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yassi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yassi 2001</LINK>). The results of one study were reported in two articles (<LINK REF="STD-Fanello-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fanello 1999</LINK>). Thus, the final number of studies we included in the first version of the review was eleven; six RCTs and five cohort studies. We did not find any CCTs.</P>
<P>For the update of 2011, we searched the same databases with the same search strategy in February 2011, which yielded 1874 references. From these, two members of the review team selected 59 studies for full-text scrutiny. Applying the inclusion criteria to the full-text articles, we included seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lavender-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luijsterburg-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Luijsterburg 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Muto 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warming-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Warming 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zadvinskis-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zadvinskis 2010</LINK>). Together with the already included studies, this resulted in 18 included studies. After reviewing studies that had been included in the original review, it turned out that one study was incorrectly classified as a RCT; it was actually a prospective cohort study (<LINK REF="STD-M_x00fc_ller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Müller 2001</LINK>). Thus, the final result was nine RCTs and nine cohort studies.</P>

<P>All included articles focus on prevention of back pain; none on treatment. Even though the study by <LINK REF="STD-Muto-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Muto 2008</LINK> required the participants to have experienced prior episodes of back pain, we did not consider this a treatment study, because the intervention was not intended to alleviate the back pain immediately, but to prevent future episodes.</P>
<P>The studies were carried out between 1981 and 2010, with 11 of the 18 studies published in the past ten years. The studies were conducted in various geographical regions, with six studies from the US, three from Denmark, two from the Netherlands, and one each from Canada, China, France, Germany, Australia, Japan and Sweden.</P>

<P>As for the participants, in four RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kraus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warming-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Warming 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yassi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yassi 2001</LINK>), and in eight cohort studies, MMH exposure was related to lifting and moving patients. Postal workers handling mail were studied in one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Daltroy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Daltroy 1997</LINK>), and two RCTs studied baggage handlers (<LINK REF="STD-Reddell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Reddell 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Poppel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van Poppel 1998</LINK>). The number of participants varied from 131 to 12,772 in RCTs, and from 41 to 345 in cohort studies.</P>
<P>The interventions varied from one session of simple advice on lifting (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feldstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Feldstein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reddell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Reddell 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yassi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yassi 2001</LINK>) to training once a week for two years (<LINK REF="STD-Hartvigsen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hartvigsen 2005</LINK>). In some of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Daltroy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Daltroy 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feldstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Feldstein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Poppel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van Poppel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yassi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yassi 2001</LINK>), traditional training was supported by follow-up and feedback at the workplace. The advocated lifting technique was usually not described in detail except for the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Lavender-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Warming-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Warming 2008</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Lavender-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 2007</LINK> measured the load on the back in real time and fed this back to the participant via a high pitched tone if the back was assessed to be overloaded. <LINK REF="STD-Warming-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Warming 2008</LINK> gave nurses specific instructions about patient transfer techniques. Involvement of the supervisors in the intervention was clearly articulated in only a few studies (<LINK REF="STD-Daltroy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Daltroy 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feldstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Feldstein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartvigsen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hartvigsen 2005</LINK>), as was the encouragement to use available lifting aids (<LINK REF="STD-Dehlin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Dehlin 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feldstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Feldstein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartvigsen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hartvigsen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yassi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yassi 2001</LINK>). If reported, the number of participants in the training group was fewer than 15 employees. In four studies, the instructor was a trained colleague (<LINK REF="STD-Fanello-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fanello 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartvigsen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hartvigsen 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warming-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Warming 2008</LINK>); in the other studies, the instructor was usually a professional in ergonomics. For details of the interventions see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. All interventions used an educational model that assumed that the information provided in the intervention would lead to a change in knowledge, attitude or skills. In addition to information, all interventions included the opportunity to practice the skills to some extent in either the educational setting or at follow-up in practice. None of the studies used a more elaborate model of change of health behaviour, such as the stages-of-change model, the protection-motivation theory or the theory of reasoned action and planned behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Ogden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogden 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effectiveness of MMH advice was studied in comparison with no intervention in five RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Kraus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reddell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Reddell 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Poppel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van Poppel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yassi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yassi 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Warming-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Warming 2008</LINK>), and in four cohort studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dehlin-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Dehlin 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fanello-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fanello 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feldstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Feldstein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zadvinskis-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zadvinskis 2010</LINK>).

<P>Blinding of participants or providers is very difficult with an educational intervention and was not attempted in any of the studies. Blinding of the outcome assessment was judged as adequate when the outcome data were based on administrative data that were routinely collected. This was the case in three studies.</P>

<EXCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-05-10 15:24:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was doubt about the intention-to-treat analysis in only two studies. All other studies analysed the data according to the randomisation assignment. How studies dealt with missing data such as drop-outs, was only reported in four studies. For six studies, the drop-out rate was described and judged as acceptable because it was less than 20%.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-05-09 17:00:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review shows moderate to very low quality evidence that the effect on back pain or back-related disability of MMH advice and training, with or without MMH assistive devices, is similar to no intervention, minor advice, professional education, exercise or back belts.</P>
<P>The strength of our review is that we only included studies with designs that are least susceptible to bias. In addition, we were able to compare the results to studies with less valid study designs. There were no differences in conclusions between the analyses from the RCTs and the cohort studies.</P>
<P>There are several possible explanations for not finding an effect of the intervention in this review such as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a lack of power to detect a relevant difference,</LI>
<LI>a bias towards a negative outcome in this review,</LI>
<LI>a lack of sufficient exposure to back strain in the included studies,</LI>
<LI>the interventions in the included studies are not appropriate to elicit an effect, or</LI>
<LI>the theory behind the interventions is incorrect.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We will deal with these possible explanations one at a time.</P>
<P>Our correction for the design effect of cluster randomised trials increased the confidence intervals of the included cluster randomised trials and thus considerably reduced the power to find small differences. Even though we included nine RCTs, in none of the comparisons were there more than three studies. To find a compromise between heterogeneity and power we combined all studies that evaluated the effect of MMH advice on back pain versus no intervention, regardless of how and when back pain was measured. This made it possible to combine four studies and this yielded a pooled OR of 1.17 (95%CI 0.68 to 2.02). Even though we can still overlook a small but relevant positive outcome, the likelihood of this is not very big, given the consistency of the negative results over studies. In addition, our adjustment for the cluster effect was based on a large intra-cluster correlation and was therefore a very conservative approach.</P>
<P>In the back pain prevention studies, the occurrence of back pain was much less frequent than in the treatment studies. In this review, we did not deal with patients who wanted to get better, but with workers in whom back pain should be prevented. In all studies, new cases were defined as new episodes, not taking into account if these were recurrences. Depending on the definition of back pain, even new episodes of back pain are fairly rare in a non-selected 'healthy' population. The average incidence per 100 person years in the included RCTs was 7.4 for back-related injuries in Yassi's study (<LINK REF="STD-Yassi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yassi 2001</LINK>), 1.3 for back injuries in Kraus' study (<LINK REF="STD-Kraus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 2002</LINK>), 14.8 for back injuries in <LINK REF="STD-Lavender-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 2007</LINK>, 11.1 for back injuries in <LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2009</LINK> and 57 for low-back pain in the past 12 months in <LINK REF="STD-Warming-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Warming 2008</LINK> and 70 for self-reported back pain in van Poppel's study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Poppel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van Poppel 1998</LINK>). At least partially, these differences in incidence can be explained by the definition of the outcome measure and the amount of exposure. We could not relate the exposure level to differences in outcome due to lack of measurement and reporting details.</P>
<P>Publication bias usually results in studies with positive outcomes being published more easily. In our review, we only found studies with negative results. Publication bias is therefore an unlikely explanation. The same holds for language bias, because we did not exclude any languages. We could not think of any other bias caused by our search methods or inclusion criteria that could explain the negative results of this review.</P>
<P>In four of the included RCTs, the MMH exposure was related to lifting patients, four RCTs studied handling of mail or luggage and one RCT evaluated construction workers. Even though the nature of MMH exposure varied, the results of the studies were not different with respect to different biomechanical exposures. All jobs studied had more than sufficient exposure to biomechanical strain to the back to leave ample room for alleviation by effective interventions. Also, studies among nurses, where the biomechanical exposure can be sudden and unexpected, for example when a patient falls, did not show different results.</P>
<P>Another explanation for not finding an effect for the intervention could be that the intervention was not appropriate. Reviews on effectiveness of training workers in skills related to safety and health (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Looze-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Looze 2001</LINK>) show that training methods that engage the participants and the organisation to a greater extent lead to greater knowledge acquisition. Therefore, we analysed the interventions according to the training methods used (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). The participants' involvement in the training process varied from study to study. However, several studies used intensive training programs of several days' duration, and the participation of supervisors and feedback in practice. Workers reported they were satisfied, and believed that this was an effective tool for prevention. Therefore, we would have expected a more positive outcome in the studies that engaged more intense training methods. However, this was not the case.</P>
<P>Even though the interventions were theoretically correct, it could be that the participants still did not comply with the instructions and therefore, that the intervention did not lead to an effect. Compliance with the instructions and with the use of MMH assistive devices was monitored in six studies using either objective measurement (<LINK REF="STD-Lavender-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 2007</LINK>), self-assessments (<LINK REF="STD-Hartvigsen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hartvigsen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Poppel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van Poppel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warming-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Warming 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yassi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yassi 2001</LINK> ) or observation (<LINK REF="STD-Best-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Best 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feldstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Feldstein 1993</LINK>). The results indicated positive changes in four studies, and marginal or no changes in two studies. In addition, Daltroy reported separately (<LINK REF="REF-Daltroy-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daltroy 1993</LINK>) that the intervention in his study resulted in increased knowledge but not in significant improvement of MMH behaviour. Therefore, a possible explanation of the negative findings is that the current approach does not lead to a change in MMH behaviour that reduces the strain on the back. New and innovative approaches would be needed. In other areas of health, it is argued that interventions should be based on a theory of changing health behaviour. It would be worthwhile to further explore the theoretical underpinning of changing health behaviour and how it may relate to MMH (<LINK REF="REF-Ogden-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogden 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>A further possible explanation for not finding an effect is that the risk of back pain is not directly related to incorrect lifting techniques but to other work-related factors inherent in the studied populations (e.g. psychosocial strain or other non-neutral postures without MMH), which are not captured with the MMH training and advice. However, we were not able to test this hypothesis based on the included studies, because none of the studies described the context of the intervention in sufficient detail to be used for further analysis.</P>
<P>The results of this Cochrane review are supported by previously published systematic reviews, even though their scope and methods were different. The main differences between this and earlier reviews are the focus on MMH advice and MMH assistive devices as the main intervention and back pain and back-related disability as the main outcomes.</P>
<P>In a systematic review of controlled clinical trials on the primary prevention of back pain in industry (<LINK REF="REF-van-Poppel-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Poppel 1997</LINK>), the conclusion based on the results of four RCTs and two non-randomised CCTs was that there was limited evidence that education does not prevent back pain. Because the main focus of education in some of the included studies was other than MMH advice and MMH assistive devices, only two RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Daltroy-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daltroy 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reddell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Reddell 1992</LINK>) and one non-RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Feldstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Feldstein 1993</LINK>) are included in both <LINK REF="REF-van-Poppel-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Poppel 1997</LINK> and the present review.</P>
<P>In the update of this review (<LINK REF="REF-van-Poppel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Poppel 2004</LINK>), one more RCT was included, along with new data on a previous RCT presented in an additional paper. Both of these studies are also included in the present review (<LINK REF="STD-Daltroy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Daltroy 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Poppel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van Poppel 1998</LINK> ). <LINK REF="REF-van-Poppel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Poppel 2004</LINK> concluded that there was no evidence to support the effectiveness of education for the primary prevention of low-back pain at the workplace.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Maher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2000</LINK> was a review on the effectiveness of workplace interventions besides MMH advice and MMH assistive devices, to prevent low-back pain. Based on the results of six RCTs, the conclusion was that there was moderate evidence that education was ineffective in reducing the prevalence of low-back pain, severity of low-back pain and sick leave due to low-back pain. Compared to the present review, two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Reddell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Reddell 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Poppel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van Poppel 1998</LINK>) were included, but the other four excluded, because training did not include MMH advice.</P>
<P>The review by <LINK REF="REF-Hignett-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hignett 2003</LINK> also focused on a variety of strategies to reduce musculoskeletal injuries among employees handling patients. A wide range of randomised and non-randomised studies, both quantitative and qualitative, were included in the review. The author concluded that there was strong evidence that interventions based predominantly on training of handling techniques have no impact on working practices or injury rates. This review included three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Best-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Best 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fanello-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fanello 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feldstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Feldstein 1993</LINK>) that were in the present review, and five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Engkvist-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Engkvist 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evanoff-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Evanoff 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lynch-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lynch 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Videman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Videman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1987</LINK>) that were excluded from the present review, because the study designs did not meet the inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>A review assessing the effects of occupational interventions in the primary prevention of musculoskeletal symptoms in the nursing profession (<LINK REF="REF-Bos-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bos 2006</LINK>) included 13 studies. Compared to the present review, four of them (<LINK REF="STD-Fanello-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fanello 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feldstein-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Feldstein 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartvigsen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hartvigsen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yassi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yassi 2001</LINK>) are included, three (<LINK REF="STD-Lynch-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lynch 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Videman-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Videman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1987</LINK>) are excluded, and six more studies were not eligible (study design was not appropriate, MMH advice or assistive device was not the main intervention, required outcomes were not measured). Despite the differences in the design, <LINK REF="REF-Bos-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bos 2006</LINK> also supported the conclusion that training and education alone is not sufficient to decrease musculoskeletal symptoms.</P>
<P>Another review (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Molen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Molen 2005</LINK>) assessed the effectiveness of measures and implementation strategies in reducing physical work demands due to manual handling at work. This review excluded studies that measured musculoskeletal symptoms without measuring physical work demands at the same time. Therefore, only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Yassi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yassi 2001</LINK>) from the present review is included. The authors concluded that reductions in physical work demands and low-back disorders were found when mechanical lifting devices were part of the intervention. They also hypothesized that the success of an intervention aimed at reducing the physical work demands associated with MMH and musculoskeletal symptoms is not only dependent on the effectiveness of ergonomic measures, but also on the implementation strategy. The study by Yassi (<LINK REF="STD-Yassi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yassi 2001</LINK>) was the only eligible study in the present review to combine MMH assistive devices with MMH advice.</P>
<P>Since the first version of our review was published, two other systematic reviews have been published on the effectiveness of MMH advice and training which concurred with our conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Bigos-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bigos 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dawson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 2007</LINK>). Both reviews included a smaller numbers of RCTs and non-RCTs than included in this review.</P>

<P>Presently, many health professionals are involved in training and advising workers on MMH. The studies included in this review do not provide evidence that training and advice prevent back pain when compared to no intervention or another intervention. There were no studies that showed that they are useful in the treatment of back pain. The quality of the evidence was judged as moderate and we think that further research is likely to have an impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-05-02 02:04:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Jos H Verbeek">
<P>There could be more high quality research in this area to further reduce the already small margin of uncertainty in our conclusions. An individual level randomised trial, including at least 500 workers, and measuring back pain incidence would be needed. In order to be able to devise new and innovative ways to prevent back pain, researchers need a better understanding of the causal chain between exposure to biomechanical stressors at work and the subsequent development of back pain. Because the incidence of new cases of back pain is fairly low, large scale trials are needed with several years follow-up to adequately evaluate preventive interventions. In such trials, better and more uniform outcome measures should be used, including intermediate outcomes like changes in behaviour and reduction of mechanical exposure.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2011-02-15 09:00:41 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Jos H Verbeek">
<P>Feedback comments:<BR/>1. The conclusion about MMH advice and assistive devices is based upon a misreading of the paper by Yassi et al. Yassi had three arms to the study:<BR/>Arm A Control, i.e. "usual practice", training on request<BR/>Arm B Intervention: "safe lifting" programme<BR/>Arm C Intervention: "no strenuous lifting" program.</P>
<P>The review authors characterise Arm B as "MMH advice only" (e.g. Results, p7, 5th bullet and section 4, p9) This is simply wrong. The intervention in Arm B involved the provision and the encouragement of the use of additional lifting equipment, a total body lift, transfer belts and slide devices (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> of Yassi). The training was on back care, patient assessment and handling techniques with practice using the equipment provided. Therefore, the study was a comparison of two different interventions that provided MMH devices with a no intervention control group. It is therefore totally inappropriate to characterise the Yassi study as having implemented an MMH advice intervention.</P>
<P>Because of this basic misunderstanding of the Yassi study, the authors' conclusions about the effectiveness of MMH devices cannot be relied upon and this part of the review needs complete revision.</P>
<P>Moreover, on p17 in the table of included studies they correctly describe Arm B as "safe lifting" but incorrectly label it as a control group.</P>
<P>2. The incidence rate reported by Yassi et al is misrepresented in the discussion on p10. Yassi (p1744-5 and Table 8) reported back/trunk injuries in their three study arms as follows: Arm A: 75% of 20 MSIs, i.e. 15 Arm B: 62% of 13 MSIs, i.e. 8 Arm C: 35% of 17 MSIs, i.e. 6 This gives a total of 29 back/trunk injuries for 260 subjects completing one year of follow up, a incidence rate of 11%, i.e. 11 injuries per 100 person years, not the quoted figure of 0.0033 injuries per 100 person years. Moreover, the authors should have realised that the rates they quote across three studies vary by so many orders of magnitude that errors in their figures were almost certain. I have not bothered to check the figures from Kraus and van Poppel. I strongly recommend that the authors do so.</P>
<P>3. The statement in the Authors' conclusions that "There is no evidence available for the effectiveness of MMH advice and training or MMH assistive devices for treating back pain" reflects the authors' (flawed) findings. The statement in the plain language summary that "providing ... assistive devices" is "not [an] effective intervention[s]" is very different and completely unsupported. The authors have made the classic error of assuming that no evidence of effectiveness is evidence of no effectiveness.</P>
<P>4. The authors compare their findings with those of the earlier review by Maher. I note that Maher classified the paper by Daltroy as low quality but that the authors classify the same paper as high quality. This highlights a fundamental issue with systematic reviews - there is no agreed standard for assessing papers. I suggest the authors discuss the discrepancy between the two ratings of the Daltroy paper.</P>
<P>5. In Table 07 a distinction is drawn between "Use of MMH devices" and "Ergonomic intervention". As introducing MMH devices is usually regarded as an ergonomic intervention, I ask that the distinction being made be clarified.</P>
<P>6. The authors state that their results are supported by previously published systematic reviews (Discussion, p11). This is certainly true with regard to MMH advice. However, other reviews have concluded that there is evidence that multidisciplinary interventions are effective (Tveito et al 2004) and that some mechanical or modifier interventions are effective (Boocock et al 2007).</P>

<P>1. We totally agree that the classification of the interventions into "MMH advice" and "MMH devices" is rather complicated because the use of assistive devices inevitably also includes training and, in most cases, advice on correct lifting technique also includes encouragement to use the available equipment. The contents of training in the studies have been described in more detail in Table 7, where the interventions by Yassi have been described as "handling techniques coupled with available equipment". However, the difference between the study groups is that in group B, the participants received advice on lifting that included encouragement to use the available equipment in order to manage the remaining risks related to patient handling. In group C, the ward was provided with new equipment with the goal of eliminating all strenuous lifting. This led us to the simplified categorization that we use in the review. Also in some other included studies, training included encouragement to use available equipment, as listed in Table 7.</P>
<P>2. Yes, we made a mistake here. Thank you very much for noticing it. We gave the number of injuries per worked hour which, as a factor of 2000 is too small and which should not have been overlooked. This was due to recalculation of the rates from a number per 100,000 worked hours to a number per 100 person-years. The numbers for the participants and the numbers for the population at risk for injuries were not the same in Yassi's article. The correct figure is 7.4 per 100 person-years for the whole group of nurses working on the participating wards. We checked the other figures and they were correct. Fortunately, this did not have any influence on the other results.</P>
<P>3. The statement that there is no evidence that either of these interventions provide effective treatment is fully supported by our review because we did not find any treatment studies and we don't think that there is any flaw there.</P>
<P>4. In the assessment of methodological quality, Maher et al used the PEDro scale described by Verhagen et al in 1998. The criteria differ slightly from those recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group in 2003 and applied in the present review. This explains the different outcome. Despite the different scale, assessment by Maher et al resulted in five fulfilled criteria out of 11, and in our assessment the result was 6/11. A trial was considered to be of high quality in both reviews if it scored at least 6/11 on either quality scale. Therefore, the results were not as different as the conclusions.</P>
<P>5. <LINK REF="STD-Daltroy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Daltroy 1997</LINK> is the only study where ergonomic intervention was linked to the study intervention. This is because the authors clearly state that "The therapists examined each work station with workers and supervisors and suggested physical and procedural modifications, such as the adjustment pf shelf heights, the use of lumbar supports on chairs, the installation of rollers on chairs, and changes in the pacing of mechanized operations."</P>
<P>6. The review by Boocock et al was published after our review was finished and was not directed at back pain but at neck and upper extremity disorders. Multidisciplinary interventions including, for example, physical therapy and exercise, as in the review by Tveito et al, were out of the scope of the present study.</P>

<P>
<I>1. The method of randomisation was adequate. (selection bias)</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>There is a low risk of selection bias</I> if a random (unpredictable) assignment sequence was used.</P>
<P>
<I>Examples of low risk methods are:</I> referring to a random number table, using a computer random number generator, coin tossing, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice, drawing of lots, minimization (minimization may be implemented without a random element, and this is considered to be equivalent to being random).</P>
<P>
<I>Examples of high risk methods</I> are: alternation, birth date, social insurance/security number, date in which they are invited to participate in the study, or hospital registration number</P>
<P>
<I>2. The treatment allocation was concealed. (selection bias)</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>There is a low risk of selection bias</I> if the assignment was generated by an independent person not responsible for determining the eligibility of the patients. This person had no information about the persons included in the trial, no influence on the assignment sequence or eligibility of the patient, and could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation:  central allocation (including telephone, web-based, and pharmacy-controlled, randomisation); sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially numbered, opaque, or sealed envelopes. </P>
<P>
<I>Examples of high risk methods</I> are: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers), assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non-opaque or not sequentially numbered), alternation or rotation, date of birth, case record number, or other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
<P>
<I>Knowledge of the allocated interventions was adequately prevented during the study. (performance bias) </I>
</P>
<P>
<I>3. The patient was blinded to the intervention.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>There is a low risk of performance bias</I> if the index and control groups were indistinguishable for the patients, the success of blinding was tested among the patients and it was successful, or the outcome measurements were not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</P>
<P>
<I>4. The care provider was blinded to the intervention. (performance bias)</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>There is a low risk of performance bias</I> if the index and control groups were indistinguishable for the care providers, the success of blinding was tested among the care providers and it was successful, or the outcome measurements were not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</P>
<P>
<I>5. The outcome assessor was blinded to the intervention. (detection bias)</I>
</P>
<P>Adequacy of blinding should be assessed for the primary outcomes. <I>There is low risk of detection bias</I> if the success of blinding was tested among the outcome assessors and it was successful, or:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>for patient-reported outcomes</I> in which the patient was the outcome assessor (e.g., pain, disability): <I>there is a low risk of bias</I> for outcome assessors if there is a low risk of bias for participant blinding.*</LI>
<LI>
<I>for outcome criteria assessed during scheduled visit and that supposes a contact between participants and outcome assessors</I> (e.g., clinical examination): <I>there is a low risk of bias</I> for patients and the treatment or adverse effects of the treatment could not be noticed during clinical examination.*</LI>
<LI>
<I>for outcome criteria that do not suppose a contact with participants</I> (e.g., radiography, magnetic resonance imaging): <I>there is a low risk of bias</I> if the treatment or adverse effects of the treatment could not be noticed when assessing the main outcome.*</LI>
<LI>
<I>for outcome criteria that are clinical or therapeutic events</I> that will be determined by the interaction between patients and care providers (e.g., co-interventions, length of hospitalisation, treatment failure), in which the care provider is the outcome assessor: <I>there is a low risk of bias</I> for outcome assessors if there is a low risk of bias for care providers.*</LI>
<LI>
<I>for outcome criteria that are assessed from data from medical forms</I>: <I>there is a low risk of bias</I> if the treatment or adverse effects of the treatment could not be noticed in the extracted data.*</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Incomplete outcome data were adequately addressed. (attrition bias)</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>6. The drop-out rate was described and acceptable.</I>
</P>
<P>The number of participants who were included in the study but did not complete the observation period or were not included in the analysis must be described and reasons given.</P>
<P>
<I>There is a low risk of attrition bias</I> if there were no missing data, reasons for missing outcome data were unlikely to be related to the true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias), missing outcome data were balanced in numbers, with similar reasons for missing data across groups, the percentage of withdrawals and drop-outs did not exceed 20% for short-term follow-up and 30% for long-term follow-up and did not lead to substantial bias (<I>Note:</I> these percentages are arbitrary, not supported by literature). For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with the observed event risk was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; for continuous outcome data, the plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size, or missing data were imputed using appropriate methods (<I>Note:</I> if drop-outs are very large, even imputation using "acceptable" methods may still suggest a high risk of bias)</P>
<P>
<I>7. All randomised participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated. (attrition bias)</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>There is low risk of attrition bias</I> if all randomised patients were reported/analysed in the group to which they were allocated by randomisation for the most important moments of effect measurement (minus missing values), regardless of non-compliance and co-interventions.  <I> </I>
</P>
<P>
<I>8. Reports of the study are free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting. (reporting bias)</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>There is low risk of reporting bias</I> if the results from all pre-specified outcomes have been adequately reported in the published report of the trial.  This information is either obtained by comparing the protocol and the report, or in the absence of the protocol, assessing that the published report includes enough information to make this judgment. </P>
<P>
<I>There is a high risk of reporting bias </I>if one or more outcomes of interest is not measured or reported as pre-specified, is not reported or is reported incompletely so that data cannot be entered in a meta-analysis; the study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.</P>
<P>
<I>Other sources of potential bias: </I>
</P>
<P>
<I>9.  The groups are similar at baseline for the most important prognostic indicators. </I>
</P>
<P>
<I>There is low risk of bias</I> if groups are similar at baseline for demographic factors, duration and severity of complaints, percentage of patients with neurological symptoms, or value of main outcome measure(s).</P>
<P>
<I>10. Co-interventions were avoided or similar. </I>
</P>
<P>
<I>There is low risk of bias</I> if there were no co-interventions or they were similar between the index and control groups.</P>
<P>
<I>11. The compliance was acceptable in all groups. </I>
</P>
<P>
<I>There is low risk of bias</I> if compliance with the interventions was acceptable, based on the reported intensity, duration, number and frequency of sessions for both the index and control intervention(s). For example, since physiotherapy treatment is usually administered over several sessions, it is important to assess how many sessions each patient attended. For single-session interventions (e.g., surgery), this item is irrelevant.</P>
<P>
<I>12. The timing of the outcome assessment was similar in all groups.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>There is low risk of bias</I> if all important outcome assessments for all intervention groups were measured at the same time.</P>
<P>13.   <I>The study appears to be free of other sources of bias.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>There is a low risk of bias</I> if the study appears to be free of other sources of bias not addressed elsewhere (e.g., study funding).</P>
