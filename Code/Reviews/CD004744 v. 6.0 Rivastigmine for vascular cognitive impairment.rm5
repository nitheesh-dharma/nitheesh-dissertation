<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-03-11 14:33:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline Birks">
<P>Vascular dementia (i.e. dementia caused by disease of blood vessels affecting the supply of blood to the brain) is one of the most common types of dementia. It includes dementia caused by stroke. It may exist by itself or with other common dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. Sometimes vascular disease can present with cognitive problems which are less severe than dementia. Those with vascular dementia may have significant cognitive impairment without major memory loss. The term vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is useful, because of the range of different ways in which people are affected. Rivastigmine is a drug widely used in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It works by preventing breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter (signalling molecule). Levels of acetylcholine are reduced in VCI as well as in AD and so it may also help people with VCI. Researchers searched for all trials that compared rivastigmine with placebo in people with VCI, and identified three. Only one of these showed any significant results, and it did show some benefit for people with VCI who took rivastigmine. However, nausea and vomiting were a frequent side effect of taking the drug. Therefore it remains uncertain how useful rivastigmine is for people with VCI .</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-03-07 13:32:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline Birks">
<P>Vascular dementia represents the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. In older patients, in particular, the combination of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease is common, and is referred to as mixed dementia. The classification of vascular dementia broadly follows three clinico-pathological processes: multi-infarct dementia, single strategic infarct dementia and subcortical dementia. Not all victims fulfil strict criteria for dementia and may be significantly cognitively impaired without memory loss, when the term vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is more useful. Currently, no established standard treatment for VCI exists. Reductions in acetylcholine and acetyltransferase activity are common to both Alzheimer's disease and VCI, raising the possibility that cholinesterase inhibitors - such as rivastigmine - which are beneficial in Alzheimer's disease, may also be beneficial for VCI.</P>

<P>We searched ALOIS (the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group&#8217;s Specialized Register) on 12 February 2013 using the terms: rivastigmine, exelon, "SDZ ENA 713". ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS), numerous trial registries and grey literature sources.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-03-05 17:25:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline Birks">
<P>Two reviewers extracted and assessed data independently, and agreement was reached after discussion. They noted results concerning adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-03-07 15:41:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline Birks">
<P>Three trials, with a total of 800 participants, were identified for inclusion. The participants in one trial did not have dementia, while the other two studies included participants with dementia of different severities. The dose of rivastigmine was different in each study. No pooling of study results was attempted because of these differences between the studies.</P>
<P>One trial included 40 participants with subcortical vascular dementia (age range 40 to 90 years) with a mean mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score of 13.0 and 13.4 in the rivastigmine and placebo arms, respectively. Treatment over 26 weeks was limited to 3 mg rivastigmine twice daily, or placebo. No significant difference was found on any outcome measure relevant to cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, function or global rating, or in the number of withdrawals before the end of treatment.</P>
<P>Another trial included 710 participants with vascular dementia, including subcortical and cortical forms (age range 50 to 85 years). Over 24 weeks, a mean dose of rivastigmine of 9.4 mg/day was achieved versus placebo. Baseline MMSE was identical for both groups, at 19.1. Statistically significant advantage in cognitive response (but not with global impression of change or non-cognitive measures) was seen with rivastigmine treatment at 24 weeks (MMSE change from baseline MD 0.6, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.09, P value 0.02; Vascular Dementia Assessment Scale (VaDAS) change from baseline MD -1.3, 95% CI-2.62 to 0.02, P value 0.05 ). Significantly higher rates of vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea and anorexia and withdrawals from treatment were noted in the participants randomized to rivastigmine compared with placebo (withdrawals rivastigmine 90/365, placebo 48/345, OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.98) (withdrawals due to an adverse event rivastigmine 49/365, placebo 19/345, OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.62, P value 0.0005).</P>
<P>The third study included 50 participants (age range 48 to 84 years) with mean MMSE scores of 23.7 and 23.9 in the rivastigmine and placebo arms, respectively. Over a 24-week period, participants labelled as having cognitive impairment but no dementia (CIND) following ischaemic stroke were given up to 4.5 mg rivastigmine twice daily, or placebo. Primary and secondary outcome measures showed no statistically significant difference when considering neurocognitive abilities, function, neuropsychiatric symptoms and global performance. One participant in the rivastigmine group and two in the placebo group discontinued their medication because of an adverse effect.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-03-07 13:32:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline Birks">
<P>There is some evidence of benefit of rivastigmine in VCI from trial data from three studies. However, this conclusion is based on one large study. Rivastigmine is capable of inducing side effects that lead to withdrawal in a significant proportion of patients.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-03-11 14:34:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline Birks">
<P>As the older population increases, the number of dementia sufferers increases proportionally. Vascular dementia represents the second most common subtype of dementia and may exist in 'pure' form or 'mixed' with Alzheimer's disease or other common dementias. As not all of those affected fulfil strict criteria for dementia, and may be significantly cognitively impaired without memory loss, the term vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is useful.</P>
<P>Several forms of vascular damage can lead to cognitive impairment. Traditional concepts based on stroke and multi-infarct dementia are limited, as VCI can arise from a broad range of pathologies. Mixed vascular dementia with Alzheimer's disease is the commonest form of VCI (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-CFAS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC CFAS 2001</LINK>). Vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease share risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2011</LINK>), some histopathological changes (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003</LINK>), and may even represent different subtypes of the same entity (<LINK REF="REF-Bullock-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bullock 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the absence of Alzheimer's disease, VCI may result from large cortical infarcts (death of brain tissue caused by a blocked artery) or more subtle white matter ischaemia (lack of oxygen) (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2003</LINK>). Between these extremes lie small infarcts or lacunae. The clinical presentation varies according to the location and nature of the neuropathology (damage to the brain): single strategic infarcts present abruptly, while the onset of symptoms and signs due to subcortical damage from lacunae or white matter disease may be more insidious. Memory impairment is usually mild, and patients characteristically present with abnormalities in attention and executive functioning. The underlying damage is often to the neuronal circuitry of the prefrontal region rather than of the mesial temporal lobe (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Erkinjuntti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erkinjuntti 2000</LINK>). Non-cognitive features such as depression, apathy and emotional lability may also be prominent (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2000</LINK>). Physical impairment such as gait disorder or imbalance may be a concomitant feature (<LINK REF="REF-Pohjasvaara-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pohjasvaara 2003</LINK>). Radiological changes associated with VCI are common, most obviously following an overt event such as stroke, but also silently in a majority of the older population (up to 95% demonstrate white matter ischaemia, or small lacunar defects (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2011</LINK>)).</P>
<P>Currently, there is no established standard treatment for VCI, so clinicians must extrapolate from large primary and secondary prevention trials in ischaemic heart disease, hypertension and stroke. Cholinesterase inhibitors effectively improve a broad range of symptoms in some patients with Alzheimer's disease through enhancement of cholinergic neurotransmission. Reductions in acetylcholine and acetyltransferase activity are common to both Alzheimer's disease and VCI, raising the possibility that these drugs may also be beneficial for the latter (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Toghi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toghi 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The three internationally-established cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease are donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine. Methodologically robust, placebo-controlled trials involving large numbers of participants have demonstrated clear cognitive benefit in Alzheimer's disease with each drug (<LINK REF="REF-Hansen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 2008</LINK>). Additional gain has also been demonstrated in other areas, such as activities of daily living, global functioning and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors in VCI is less clear. A Cochrane review of the role of donepezil in VCI noted improvements in cognitive function and activities of daily living as well as more global measures of change (<LINK REF="REF-Malouf-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malouf 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Rivastigmine is a 'pseudo-irreversible' inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl-cholinesterase (BuChE). The additional inhibition of BuChE may be relevant in VCI, as rivastigmine is reasoned to have particular activity in affected regions of the brain associated with executive dysfunction and reduced attention (<LINK REF="REF-Moretti-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moretti 2004</LINK>).</P>

Where the rating scales used in trials had a reasonably large number of ordered categories (more than 10), the data were treated as continuous outcomes arising from a normal distribution.</P>
<P>Summary statistics (number of participants, mean and standard deviation) for change from baseline are required for each rating scale at each assessment time for each treatment group in each trial.</P>
<P>When change from baseline results are not reported, the required summary statistics are calculated from the baseline and assessment time treatment group means and standard deviations. In this case a zero correlation between the measurements at baseline and assessment time is assumed. This method overestimates the standard deviation of the change from baseline, but this conservative approach is considered to be preferable in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis requires the combination of data from trials that may not use the same rating scale to assess an outcome. The measure of treatment difference used for any outcome in the review will be the weighted mean difference when pooled trials used the same rating scale or test, and the standardised mean difference (i.e. the absolute mean difference divided by the standard deviation) when they used different rating scales or tests.</P>
<P>The duration of trials may vary considerably. In future, if the range is considered too great to combine all trials into one meta-analysis, it will be divided into smaller time periods, and a separate meta-analysis conducted for each period. Some trials may contribute data to more than one time period, if multiple assessments have been done.</P>
<P>For binary outcomes, such as clinical improvement or no clinical improvement, the odds ratio has been used to measure treatment effect. A weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials will be calculated.</P>
<P>In future, it is planned that overall estimates of the treatment difference will be presented. In all cases the overall estimate from a fixed-effect model will be presented and a test for heterogeneity using a standard Chi<SUP>2</SUP> or the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic will be performed. If, however, there is evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials then only homogeneous results will be pooled or a random-effects model will be used (in which case the confidence intervals would be broader than those of a fixed-effect model).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-04-08 12:36:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline Birks">
<P>Two of the three included studies had small numbers of participants: <LINK REF="STD-Mok-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mok 2007</LINK> had 40 participants, and <LINK REF="STD-Narasimhalu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Narasimhalu 2010</LINK> had 50, divided equally into active (rivastigmine) and placebo arms. These studies were inadequately powered. Thus, conclusions are necessarily limited and an inability to detect an effect size is a potential weakness.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Ballard-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ballard 2008</LINK> trial, however, included 710 participants at study commencement. It demonstrated superiority of rivastigmine over placebo for several cognitive measures. It should be noted that the 24-week duration of the trial was short, given that vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a chronic illness with an uncertain natural history in terms of both survival and rate of decline (<LINK REF="REF-Bruandet-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruandet 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Unfortunately, trials within the area of VCI or vascular dementia are problematic. Uncertainties around diagnosis make it difficult to identify a target population (<LINK REF="REF-Kerola-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerola 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MRC-CFAS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC CFAS 2001</LINK>). It is recognised increasingly that vascular risk factors influence the development of AD (<LINK REF="REF-Kivipelto-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kivipelto 2005</LINK>), and there is a limited knowledge base concerning the effect of coexisting dementias on outcome and response (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Further trials are required before rivastigmine can be recommended for the treatment of vascular dementia or VCI.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-03-05 16:58:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jacqueline Birks">
<P>Only one placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized trial has been conducted that was large enough to detect a clinically significant effect for rivastigmine compared with placebo for important outcomes in vascular dementia or vascular cognitive impairment. This trial demonstrated a positive effect of rivastigmine on cognition, but not on other important outcomes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-03-07 15:42:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a theoretical basis for believing that rivastigmine may be beneficial in vascular cognitive impairment, but there are limited trial resources that have explored this in depth. Such trials are needed, and accurate trial design depends on further research into the aetiological mechanisms of vascular cognitive impairment, separation of subtypes and knowledge of their natural history, and better clarification of the role of other pharmacological methods of reducing neurovascular morbidity in general.</P>
