<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-06-07 08:10:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review Question</B>: If CPAP were started immediately after birth before the onset of respiratory distress would it reduce the need for mechanical ventilation and would it reduce bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)?</P>
<P>
<B>Background: </B>Preterm babies may have breathing difficulty due to immature lungs, a condition known as Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS).The usual treatment is to assist their breathing with the help of a mechanical ventilator. Recent studies have shown that these babies are further helped by instilling surfactant into the 'breathing tube' while giving support with mechanical ventilation. However using a mechanical ventilator has its own dangers, the most important being BPD, a form of lung damage that occurs when preterm lungs are exposed to mechanical ventilation. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nasal CPAP) is a form of respiratory support delivered either via tubes inserted into the nostrils or a mask placed over the nose, leaving the mouth free. It is designed to ease the breathing effort of babies who can breathe on their own and has been found to help preterm babies if it is used to treat established RDS.</P>
<P>
<B>Search Date: </B>The evidence is current to January 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study Characteristics:</B> Randomised controlled trials of preterm babies below 32 weeks' gestation or below 1500 grams at birth who were treated with CPAP applied within the first 15 minutes of life compared with babies who were given either (1) routine supportive care such as oxygen therapy or (2) mechanical ventilation.</P>
<P>
<B>Results: </B>There were a total of seven studies involving 3123 infants. They were generally of moderate quality. Parents and care-givers would have known which treatment group the babies were in, but we judged this not to be important for most outcomes measured. In the four studies (765 babies) comparing CPAP with supportive care, CPAP resulted in fewer infants requiring further breathing assistance but there was considerable inconsistency between the studies. In the three studies (2354 babies) that compared CPAP with assisted ventilation with or without surfactant, CPAP resulted in a small but clinically important reduction in BPD and the combined outcome of BPD and mortality. There was a reduction in the need for mechanical ventilation and the use of surfactant in the CPAP group.</P>

<P>Cohort studies have suggested that nasal continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) starting in the immediate postnatal period before the onset of respiratory disease (prophylactic CPAP) may be beneficial in reducing the need for intubation and intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) and in preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm or low birth weight infants.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-06-08 13:47:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman">
<P>To determine if prophylactic nasal CPAP started soon after birth regardless of respiratory status in the very preterm or very low birth weight infant reduces the use of IPPV and the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) without adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-06-07 07:26:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 31 January 2016), EMBASE (1980 to 31 January 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to 31 January 2016). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-06-07 07:33:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All trials using random or quasi-random patient allocation of very preterm infants (under 32 weeks' gestation) or less than 1500 grams at birth were eligible. We included trials if they compared prophylactic nasal CPAP started soon after birth regardless of the respiratory status of the infant with 'standard' methods of treatment such as IPPV, oxygen therapy or supportive treatment. We excluded studies where prophylactic CPAP was compared with CPAP along with other interventions.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-06-07 07:34:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard methods of Cochrane and its Neonatal Review Group, including independent study selection, assessment of trial quality and extraction of data by two authors. Data were analysed using risk ratio (RR) and the meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effect model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-06-10 09:48:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman">
<P>Seven trials recruiting 3123 babies were included in the meta-analysis. Four trials recruiting 765 babies compared CPAP with supportive care and three trials (2364 infants) compared CPAP with mechanical ventilation. Apart from a lack of blinding of the intervention all studies were of low risk of bias.</P>
<P>In the comparison of CPAP with supportive care there was a reduction in failed treatment (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 0.98; typical risk difference (RD) &#8722;0.16, 95% CI &#8722;0.34 to 0.02; 4 studies, 765 infants, very low quality evidence). There was no reduction in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or mortality.</P>
<P>In trials comparing CPAP with assisted ventilation with or without surfactant, CPAP resulted in a small but clinically significant reduction in the incidence of BPD at 36 weeks, (typical RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99; typical RD &#8722;0.04, 95% CI &#8722;0.08 to 0.00; 3 studies, 772 infants, moderate-quality evidence); and death or BPD (typical RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97; typical RD &#8722;0.05, 95% CI &#8722;0.09 to 0.01; 3 studies, 1042 infants, moderate-quality evidence). There was also a clinically important reduction in the need for mechanical ventilation (typical RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.59; typical RD &#8722;0.49, 95% CI &#8722;0.59 to &#8722;0.39; 2 studies, 760 infants, moderate-quality evidence); and the use of surfactant in the CPAP group (typical RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.73; typical RD &#8722;0.41, 95% CI &#8722;0.54 to &#8722;0.28; 3 studies, 1744 infants, moderate-quality evidence).</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence to evaluate prophylactic CPAP compared to oxygen therapy and other supportive care.

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2016-06-10 10:11:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-06-07 08:26:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-06-07 08:11:32 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is the most common respiratory disorder of premature infants especially for those below 35 weeks' gestation although older infants with delayed lung maturation of different etiologies can also be afflicted.  In RDS the structurally immature, surfactant-deficient lung has a tendency to collapse. Although the poorly ventilated areas may be relatively well perfused this can result in the typical ventilation-perfusion mismatch leading to hypoxia and hypercarbia. If severe enough there may be pulmonary vasoconstriction leading to persistent pulmonary hypertension and left-to-right ductal shunting leading to more severe hypoxia. Histologically RDS is characterised by leakage of proteinaceous fluid into the alveoli and hyaline membrane formation (<LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 2002</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-06-07 08:20:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the early days of neonatal intensive care the only available treatments for RDS were supportive, such as provision of warmth, fluid, calories and oxygen. Two major categories of respiratory support became available in the 1960s and 1970s: mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Both could be given prophylactically to infants at risk of developing RDS or as rescue therapy to infants with signs of respiratory failure (<LINK REF="REF-Polin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polin 2002</LINK>). Subsequently two effective perinatal interventions &#8212; surfactant administration, administered via an endotracheal tube (<LINK REF="REF-Seger-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seger 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soll-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soll-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1998b</LINK>); and antenatal corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>) &#8212; were evaluated and incorporated into standard care.</P>
<P>Nasal CPAP is a noninvasive method for applying a constant distending pressure to the lungs via the nostrils during inhalation and exhalation to support spontaneously breathing newborn infants with lung disease. The clinical goals of CPAP are to maintain the functional residual capacity of the lungs and support gas exchange. This reduces apnoea, work of breathing, and lung injury. CPAP is most commonly delivered to the nasal airway opening using bi-nasal short prongs or a nasal mask. Pressure is generated using a variety of devices. CPAP is generally well tolerated, in part because infants are preferential or &#8220;obligatory nasal-breathers&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Kattwinkel-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kattwinkel 1973</LINK>).</P>
<P>CPAP is an attractive option for supporting neonates with respiratory distress, because it preserves spontaneous breathing, does not require endotracheal intubation, and may result in less lung injury than mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Sweet-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweet 2007</LINK>). Cohort studies of variations in practice between centres have suggested that early nasal CPAP may be beneficial in reducing the need for intubation for intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) and the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jonsson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jonsson 1997</LINK>). Therefore CPAP needs to be compared with both supportive care and mechanical ventilation.</P>
<P>Cohort studies using historical controls have suggested that prophylactic nasal CPAP initiated immediately after birth regardless of respiratory status in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants is effective in reducing the need for IPPV without worsening other measures of neonatal outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Gittermann-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gittermann 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacobsen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobsen 1993</LINK>). In these studies no significant decrease in the incidence of BPD was found with elective CPAP.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-06-07 08:23:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nasal CPAP has been adopted by many NICUs as a way of reducing rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature neonates, but assessment of its benefits is complicated by questions about the simultaneous effects of concomitant surfactant treatment and other NICU interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>CPAP prevents end-alveolar collapse, reduces the work of breathing and decreases ventilation-perfusion mismatch and may reduce adverse effects of mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>CPAP might not work as well in less mature babies, such as those below 28 weeks' gestation whose lungs are less developed and who are more prone to apnoea and respiratory failure (<LINK REF="REF-Gerber-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerber 2012</LINK>); and it might work better if given simultaneously with surfactant (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>A feasibility pilot study by the NIH network, in which early CPAP in the delivery room was used for infants less than 28 weeks' gestational age, showed that while nasal CPAP could be initiated early only 20% of infants did not need intubation during the seven days after birth (<LINK REF="STD-Finer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 2010</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-06-07 08:26:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several problems interpreting these observational studies. Comparisons between centres and between infants in different eras are confounded by variations in the characteristics of infants entering treatment programmes, such as the gestational age of cohorts based on birth weight (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1987</LINK>); and in co-interventions such as antenatal steroid administration (<LINK REF="REF-Gittermann-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gittermann 1997</LINK>). Furthermore, the definition of the major end-point (failed CPAP) varies. The general approach towards intubation is often more 'restrictive' in centres which use the policy of elective CPAP as part of a package of minimal intervention and 'permissive hypercarbia'.</P>
<P>Randomised controlled trials are required to minimise bias and give a more precise measure of the effectiveness of prophylactic nasal CPAP (<LINK REF="REF-Lundstrom-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundstrom 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Bancalari-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bancalari 1992</LINK> carried out an earlier systematic review of this subject.</P>
<P>Cochrane reviews have described a variety of uses of CPAP for the neonate. These include: CPAP compared with theophylline for apnoea prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 2001</LINK>); CPAP compared with nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Lemyre-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemyre 2002</LINK>); CPAP for respiratory distress (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ho-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2015</LINK>); CPAP to reduce extubation failure after mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2003</LINK>); and CPAP compared with high flow nasal cannula (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 2011</LINK>). An existing review describes the use of surfactant during the course of CPAP (INtubate-SURfactant administration and Extubate to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (INSURE)) (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review looks at the routine use of CPAP prior to the onset of respiratory disease and compares it with other forms of treatment.</P>

<P>The following headings and associated questions (based on the questions in the 'Risk of bias' table <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) were evaluated independently by the two authors and entered into the 'Risk of bias' table. </P>
<OL>
<LI>Selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment): for each included study, we categorised the risk of selection bias as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk - adequate (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk - inadequate (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Allocation concealment: for each included study, we categorised the risk of bias regarding allocation concealment as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk - adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk - inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Blinding: for each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study personnel (i.e. Clinician/Nurse administering the intervention) from knowledge of which intervention a participant received.</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk - adequate for personnel (an attempt was made to conceal the intervention and control from the study personnel);</LI>
<LI>high risk - inadequate (personnel aware of group assignment);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Detection bias: for each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. (As our study population consisted of neonates they would all be blinded to the study intervention). Blinding was assessed separately for different classes of outcomes. We categorised the methods used as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk - adequate follow-up was performed with assessors blinded to group assignment;</LI>
<LI>high risk - inadequate (assessors at follow-up were aware of group assignment);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Attrition bias: we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. We categorised the methods with respect to the risk of attrition bias as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk - no missing data or missing data balanced across groups;</LI>
<LI>high risk - numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; &#8216;as treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Reporting bias: for each included study, we described how we investigated the risk of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk - adequate (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk - inadequate (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk - no or unclear information provided (the study protocol was not available).</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Other bias: for each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk - no concerns of other bias raised;</LI>
<LI>high risk - concerns raised about multiple looks at the data with the results made known to the investigators, difference in number of patients enrolled in abstract and final publications of the paper;</LI>
<LI>unclear - concerns raised about potential sources of bias that could not be verified by contacting the authors.</LI>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-06-07 09:34:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the statistical package in Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-5.3" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 5.3</LINK>) provided by Cochrane. We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and trial populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>The quality of evidence reflects the extent to which we are confident that the estimate of the effect is correct (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>We assessed the quality of evidence for the two main comparisons at the outcome level using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011d</LINK>). This methodological approach considers randomised controlled trials as high-quality evidence that may be 'down-rated' by limitations in any of five areas: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates and presence of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011d</LINK>). The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the quality of a body of evidence in one of four grades: 1) High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect; 2) Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different; 3) Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect; 4) Very Low: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>We independently assessed the quality of the evidence found for outcomes identified as critical or important for clinical decision making. Outcomes for CPAP compared with supported care were: failed treatment, bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (defined as supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks' gestation), bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, pulmonary air leak syndromes (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pulmonary interstitial emphysema), intraventricular haemorrhages (grades 3 and 4), and neurodevelopmental outcome (measured on a validated scale that measures cognitive, motor, behavioural function or blindness, deafness, or cerebral palsy at about 2 years of age).</P>
<P>For the comparison of CPAP with assisted ventilation, outcomes assessed were: mortality at 28 to 30 days and at hospital discharge, bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (defined as supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks' gestation), bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, pulmonary air leak syndromes (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pulmonary interstitial emphysema), intraventricular haemorrhages (grades 3 and 4), and neurodevelopmental outcome (measured on a validated scale that measures cognitive, motor, behavioural function, or blindness, deafness, or cerebral palsy at about 2 years of age).</P>
<P>In cases where study authors did not take measures to ensure concealment of allocation, randomised assignment, completed follow-up or blinded outcome assessment, we downgraded the quality of evidence because of design limitations (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011b</LINK>). We evaluated consistency by similarity of point estimates, extent of overlap of confidence intervals and statistical criteria including a test for heterogeneity (I²). We downgraded the quality of evidence when inconsistency across studies' results was present, large and unexplained (i.e. some studies suggest important benefit; and others no effect or harm without a clinical explanation) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011a</LINK>). We used the 95% confidence interval around the pooled estimation to assess for precision (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011e" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011e</LINK>). When trials were conducted in populations other than the target population, we downgraded the quality of evidence because of indirectness (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011c</LINK>).</P>
<P>We entered data (i.e. pooled estimates of the effects and corresponding 95% confidence Intervals) and explicit judgements for each of the above assessed aspects into GRADEprofiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2008</LINK>), the software used to create 'Summary of findings' (SoF) tables.

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Han-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1987</LINK> the experimental group received nasal CPAP via the nasopharyngeal route and the control group received supportive care. The optimal level of CPAP was determined by measuring pressure in the lower oesophagus (<LINK REF="REF-Tanswell-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanswell 1980</LINK>). The control group received oxygen via head box and CPAP was initiated according to criteria in the protocol. Thirty-three per cent of the control infants received CPAP and 11 of these 13 infants received it within the first six hours of life.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Sandri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sandri 2004</LINK>, six centimetres of nasal CPAP was used delivered by a CPAP driver through nasal prongs. The control group received head box oxygen; if this failed according to predetermined criteria CPAP was started. In the control group, 66 infants (57.4%) received CPAP at a median age of 108.5 minutes.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Morley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Morley 2008</LINK>, 8 cmH&#8322;O with short single or double prong nasal CPAP was initially used and after admission to the nursery a double prong was used and the CPAP pressure could be altered as required. Intubation and mechanical ventilation was initiated only if strict criteria were met. The control group received intubation and mechanical ventilation. Surfactant was not mandatory but could be administered to either treatment group after intubation.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Finer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 2010</LINK> infants in the CPAP group were resuscitated according to the neonatal resuscitation programme guideline. CPAP was delivered by a T-piece resuscitator, ventilator or an equivalent device at 5 cmH&#8322;O. If they required intubation for the purpose of resuscitation, surfactant was administered. They subsequently received nasal CPAP in the NICU via a ventilator, purpose-built flow driver or bubble CPAP circuit. Intubation was only performed after arrival in the NICU if the infant met strict predetermined criteria and surfactant was administered if the infant was under 48 hours of life. Control infants received intubation and surfactant in the delivery room and could be extubated within 24 hours if they met predetermined criteria. Delivery room CPAP was received by 81.1% and 22.4% of the CPAP and control groups respectively.<BR/>
</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Dunn--2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 2011</LINK> nasal CPAP was administered in the delivery room within 15 minutes of life initially at a pressure of 5 cmH&#8322;O, which could be increased to a maximum of 7 cm H&#8322;O. Short, binasal prongs were used as the interface. All infants received bubble CPAP generated by continuous gas flow delivered through a heated, humidified circuit with the end submerged to an appropriate depth in a water-filled bottle. The control group were intubated at 5 to 15 minutes of life and administered surfactant. Infants remained intubated for a minimum of six hours of life. Delivery room CPAP was received by 91% and 5.3% of the experimental and control groups, respectively. A third group, not included in our study, received intubation and surfactant at 5 to 15 minutes of life followed by extubation to CPAP.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Tapia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tapia 2012</LINK> study Infants were given CPAP (as soon as possible after allocation) using a bubble CPAP system (Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare) with a distending pressure of 5 cm H&#8322;O. The short binasal prongs included with the CPAP system were used. Prior to insertion of the nasal prongs CPAP was maintained at 5 cmH&#8322;O through a mask connected to a T-piece resuscitator ensuring that the infants in this group were maintained on CPAP from the time of enrolment. If the infant reached predetermined criteria an endotracheal tube was inserted and surfactant was administered followed by extubation to CPAP according to the INSURE protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2008</LINK>). CPAP could be increased to 7 cmH&#8322;O.

<P>A number of outcomes were not defined by the authors in the first published paper but have been clarified by contact with Dr Han (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Han-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1987</LINK>). The outcomes defined in <LINK REF="STD-Sandri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sandri 2004</LINK> included neonatal death, IVH of greater than grade 2, PVL, ROP greater than grade 2, necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), sepsis, BPD (oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age), air leaks and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).</P>
<P>The primary outcomes defined by both <LINK REF="STD-Morley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Morley 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Finer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 2010</LINK> were death and BPD. <LINK REF="STD-Morley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Morley 2008</LINK>'s secondary outcomes were the incidence of intubation, reasons for intubation, the need for oxygen treatment at 28 days, the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO&#8322;) at 36 weeks' gestational age, the incidence of air leaks and intracranial haemorrhages, the duration of ventilation and CPAP, the number of days in the hospital, the number of days to regain birth weight, methylxanthine treatment, treatment with postnatal corticosteroids and the dose of surfactant.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes defined by <LINK REF="STD-Finer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 2010</LINK> included pneumothorax (in the first 14 days), IVH (grades 3 or 4), and the need for chest compressions or epinephrine during resuscitation, NEC, postnatal corticosteroid therapy for BPD, and severe ROP among survivors</P>
<P>The primary outcomes defined by <LINK REF="STD-Dunn--2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 2011</LINK> included death or moderate to severe BPD at 36 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the number of infants who received surfactant, number of surfactant doses, use of postnatal steroids, growth, days on assisted ventilation, days on nasal CPAP, days on supplemental oxygen, pneumothorax, pulmonary haemorrhage, PDA, NEC, sepsis, IVH, PVL and ROP.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Tapia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tapia 2012</LINK> study, the primary outcome was any requirement for mechanical ventilation and the secondary outcomes included death, use of surfactant, pneumothorax, IVH, PDA, late-onset sepsis, ROP, BPD, days of oxygen therapy, days of mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay.</P>
<P>The primary outcome for <LINK REF="STD-Gon_x00e7_alves_x002d_Ferri---2014" TYPE="STUDY">Gonçalves-Ferri 2014</LINK> was use of mechanical ventilation or surfactant, or both, during the first five days of life. Further details of the management of the control group were supplied by the authors. According to the study protocol infants in the control group who failed supportive therapy should be administered CPAP prior to the use of mechanical ventilation. We therefore used the number of infants who received CPAP for our primary outcome of failed treatment. Failed CPAP for the intervention group consisted of the number of infants who received assisted ventilation. Secondary outcome was morbidity and mortality during hospital stay. Data on mortality and BPD was received from the authors.</P>

<P>In previous updates, we excluded two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Drew-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Drew 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tooley-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tooley 2003</LINK>). For this update, we excluded three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rojas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rojas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thomson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zaharie-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zaharie 2008</LINK>), Of these, we excluded <LINK REF="STD-Rojas-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rojas 2009</LINK> because the infants were randomly assigned to either CPAP alone or CPAP with surfactant given during a brief period of mechanical ventilation. There was no comparison with supportive care. <LINK REF="STD-Zaharie-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zaharie 2008</LINK> was not an RCT. One further study from the Unitied Kingdom was a multi-centre RCT with four arms (n = 237) (<LINK REF="STD-Thomson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thomson 2002</LINK>). The authors state that in the two groups of infants randomised to prophylactic CPAP about 76% (Group 1) and 79% (Group 2) of the participants were on prophylactic CPAP by six hours of life. Therefore it is highly unlikely that this study meets our inclusion criteria of prophylactic CPAP starting within 15 minutes of life. In addition this study was only published as an abstract with insufficient data to include in the analysis. Of note, the findings of this study were in line with our conclusion that CPAP reduces the need for mechanical ventilation.

<P>Details are given in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> and in <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>. In the <LINK REF="STD-Han-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1987</LINK> trial, randomisation was concealed but treatment was not blinded. Five infants (10%) were excluded after randomisation (two treatment, three control). Three of these were excluded for treatment violations; therefore this study was not strictly analysed according to an intention-to-treat principle. There was blinding of the assessment of radiological outcomes for BPD. The trial stopped early because of concern raised during the second planned interim analysis; after entry of 30 infants, the outcomes in the treatment group were possibly worse. In the <LINK REF="STD-Sandri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sandri 2004</LINK> trial randomisation was concealed by use of a central telephone service and stratified by weeks of gestational age in blocks of six but not by centre. The treatment was not blinded and it was not stated whether there was blinding of any of the outcomes. Follow-up was complete. In the <LINK REF="STD-Morley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Morley 2008</LINK> study randomisation was stratified according to centre and gestational age by use of a random number table and block randomisation with variable block sizes and was concealed by sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. <LINK REF="STD-Finer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 2010</LINK> used specially prepared double-sealed envelopes opened just prior to delivery and this was stratified by centre and gestational age group. In the <LINK REF="STD-Dunn--2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 2011</LINK> study, randomisation was stratified according to centre and gestational age and this was done by an independent statistician using a random number table and block randomisation with variable block sizes. Infants were randomly allocated to the treatment arms by drawing a card contained within a sealed opaque envelope. In <LINK REF="STD-Tapia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tapia 2012</LINK>'s study a computerized randomisation system was used. The infants were stratified by birth weight (800 to 999 grams and 1000 to 1500 grams) and by centre. Allocation was obscured in sealed opaque envelopes. <LINK REF="STD-Gon_x00e7_alves_x002d_Ferri---2014" TYPE="STUDY">Gonçalves-Ferri 2014</LINK> did not specify the method of generation of the random sequence; however allocation was concealed by opaque sealed envelopes stratified into two weight groups and by centre and block randomisation of four.</P>

For three studies failed treatment was defined as the use of assisted ventilation; and for one study it was defined as use of rescue CPAP prior to the use of mechanical ventilation, surfactant, or both (<LINK REF="STD-Gon_x00e7_alves_x002d_Ferri---2014" TYPE="STUDY">Gonçalves-Ferri 2014</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Han-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sandri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sandri 2004</LINK> there is no significant difference in the use of IPPV between CPAP and control groups.

The meta-analysis of the four studies showed a reduction in failed treatment (typical RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.98; typical RD &#8722;0.16, 95% CI &#8722;0.34 to 0.02; 4 studies, 765 infants, random effects) (<LINK REF="STD-Gon_x00e7_alves_x002d_Ferri---2014" TYPE="STUDY">Gonçalves-Ferri 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Han-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sandri 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tapia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tapia 2012</LINK>). There was substantial heterogeneity using the fixed-effect model (I² = 70%); therefore the above treatment estimates are derived using the random-effects model. Subgroup analysis by birth weight did not explain this heterogeneity (typical RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.18; I² = 77%) for infants greater than 1000 grams (3 trials, 716 infants, random effects, test for subgroup differences I² = 0% and P = 0.66).

Both studies reported a significant reduction in the need for assisted ventilation. In the meta-analysis, both studies showed a significant reduction in the CPAP group. Although the meta-analysis suggested moderate heterogeneity, in the overall meta-analysis CPAP resulted in a significant reduction in the use of assisted ventilation (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.54, 2 studies, 1042 infants, I² = 71%, P = 0.06) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>). The results were not substantially altered using a random-effects model for the meta-analysis. On subgroup analysis (5 vs 8 cmH&#8322;O) there was a trend for a reduced need for assisted ventilation in the trial using 8 cmH&#8322;O (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.52), compared with the trial using 5 cmH&#8322;O (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.62, test for subgroup differences: P = 0.07, I² = 70.5%) (<LINK REF="STD-Morley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Morley 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dunn--2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 2011</LINK>). The quality of evidence for this outcome was downgraded because the decision to provide assisted ventilation is a subjective outcome susceptible to the lack of blinding of the intervention and outcomes assessors.</P>

All three showed a significant reduction in the use of surfactant. When combined in the meta-analysis there was substantial heterogeneity between the studies (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.73; RD &#8722;0.41, 95% CI &#8722;0.54 to &#8722;0.28; NNTB 2, 95% CI 1 to 6, I² = 96%, P &lt; 0.00001, 3 studies, 2354 infants, random effects; low-quality evidence due to lack of blinding and imprecision) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>).</P>

There was substantial heterogeneity and this could be explained on subgroup analysis by starting CPAP pressures (5 cmH&#8322;O vs 8 cmH&#8322;O). In the analysis of the studies receiving 5 cmH&#8322;O (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.37, 2 studies, 1747 infants, I² = 0%) (<LINK REF="STD-Dunn--2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Finer 2010</LINK>) and in the study using 8 cmH&#8322;O (<LINK REF="STD-Morley-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Morley 2008</LINK>), there was a significant increase in pneumothorax in the CPAP group (RR 3.07, 95% CI 1.47 to 6.40, one study, 610 infants), test for subgroup differences P = 0.005, I² = 87.2%.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-06-07 11:51:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This update presents new information about the effects of prophylactic CPAP over previous versions of this review. We have included five new trials and overall the results show some benefits of CPAP without any definite harms except possibly when CPAP is applied at higher pressures.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison 1. </B>There was a reduction in the incidence of failed treatment in the CPAP compared with supportive care group. Similarly there is no overall reduction in the use of surfactant except in a small subgroup of infants below 1000 grams, but this should be treated with caution. There is no difference in BPD at 28 days or 36 weeks postmenstrual age.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison 2</B>. For both outcomes, BPD and the combined outcome of death or BPD, there was a small but statistically significant and clinically important reduction in babies treated with CPAP.</P>
<P>Prophylactic CPAP also reduced the need for assisted ventilation by almost half, and substantially reduced the use of surfactant. Overall there was no increase in the incidence of pneumothorax except in the small subgroup using CPAP applied at 8 cm of water. Although this finding is biologically plausible this should be treated with caution.</P>
<P>There is no difference in IVH, NEC, ROP or PVL. There was a non-significant trend to a reduction of sepsis in the one study which reported this outcome.</P>
<P>There was very little information on the effect of the interventions on local trauma such as nasal trauma, endotracheal trauma or subglottic stenosis.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-06-10 10:04:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman">
<P>Although we had insufficient studies to construct a funnel plot we have no reason to believe that we have missed any studies. The extensive search done by the Neonatal Review Group and consultation with experts in the field did not reveal any other studies. The <LINK REF="STD-Thomson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thomson 2002</LINK> multicentre study could not be included in our analysis because it has not been published in full. Data from that trial might affect our final conclusions about the effect of CPAP compared with supportive care.</P>
<P>We are more confident about the overall completeness of the evidence for Comparison 2, CPAP versus assisted ventilation. The main clinically important outcomes were reported in all the included trials, but there was no evidence from randomised controlled trials on the cost effectiveness of prophylactic CPAP.</P>
<P>Cost data are needed because CPAP is a simple and inexpensive form of treatment to implement and hence has implications for use in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Observational studies from LMIC show that there is a high incidence of RDS in very low birth weight infants, despite the frequent use of antenatal steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Fehlmann-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fehlmann 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fidanovski-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fidanovski 2005</LINK>). RDS also remains one of the most common causes of neonatal death in LMIC (<LINK REF="REF-Ravikumara-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravikumara 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Kamath-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamath 2011</LINK> stated that interventions such as oxygen and CPAP would have the greatest impact on decreasing RDS-specific mortality rates around the world. Equipment for bubble-CPAP cost 15% of the cost of the cheapest mechanical ventilator. In models of neonatal care for resource-limited countries, bubble-CPAP may be the first type of ventilatory support that is recommended. Its low cost and safety when administered makes it ideal for this purpose (<LINK REF="REF-Koyamaibole-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koyamaibole 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Vidyasagar-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vidyasagar 2011</LINK> suggested that in developing countries, CPAP may be used as a primary mode of management of RDS. He also stated that the cost of surfactant therapy may exceed the per capita GNP in some countries. Our study shows that prophylactic CPAP substantially reduces the use of surfactant and therefore would have great impact in the management of RDS in LMIC. Our study included two trials from LMIC countries (<LINK REF="STD-Gon_x00e7_alves_x002d_Ferri---2014" TYPE="STUDY">Gonçalves-Ferri 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tapia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tapia 2012</LINK>). Both compared CPAP to supportive care and both these studies showed a reduction in failed treatment in the CPAP group. A limitation to this review is that there is no long-term follow-up data for either comparison.<BR/>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-06-07 12:01:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials were generally of low risk of selection bias but due to the nature of the included interventions all studies lacked blinding of the intervention. We judged that lack of blinding might influence the subjective outcomes (failed treatment, use of surfactant and assisted ventilation) but would be unlikely to affect outcomes such as BPD, neonatal mortality and the combined outcome of BPD and neonatal death, all of which have well-recognised objective definitions. After applying the GRADE criteria, all primary outcomes for both comparisons were judged moderate quality except 'failed treatment', which we judged to be very low quality evidence. Downgrading was because of imprecision. The other primary outcome was downgraded to very low quality because of lack of blinding, imprecision and unexplained heterogeneity.</P>
<P>There were protocol-driven definitions for failed CPAP in comparison 1 and use of assisted ventilation in comparison 2 in all studies. With these strictly controlled definitions it could be argued that the lack of blinding is less important. Reported data were generally complete and we did not find evidence of reporting biases but the study protocols were not available for some studies.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-06-10 09:48:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman">
<P>The overall consistency of the results was generally high. However we encountered moderate heterogeneity in our primary outcome (failed treatment) and moderate heterogeneity for the outcome BPD at 28 days, both for the comparison CPAP versus supportive care.</P>
<P>There were too few trials in the subgroup analysis of use of antenatal steroids to draw a meaningful conclusion. However since the trials were spread out over more than two decades, this and a number of other clinical differences could explain this heterogeneity.</P>
<P>There was overall very good consistency in the outcomes for comparison 2 with substantial heterogeneity seen only in the use of surfactant. This is probably due to differences in the study protocols but clinical differences in the maturity of infants could also possibly explain this. <LINK REF="STD-Dunn--2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 2011</LINK> included more mature infants.</P>
<P>The rest of the outcomes showed minimal heterogeneity. There was a lack of reporting of local trauma such as subglottic stenosis and nasal injury. Subglottic stenosis was only reported by <LINK REF="STD-Han-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Han 1987</LINK>; and there was one report on nasal injury and these numbers were quite small (<LINK REF="STD-Tapia-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tapia 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The protocol was first written in 1997 and since then both the research questions about the use of prophylactic CPAP and the methods used for Cochrane reviews have changed and we have therefore updated our protocol substantially. In addition due to the changes in the research questions about CPAP we have had to add a second comparison which could have resulted in the reduction in the strength of our evidence.</P>

<LI>CPAP compared to assisted ventilation: there is moderate evidence that CPAP applied prophylactically within the first 15 minutes of life reduces the incidence of BPD and the combined outcome of death and BPD as well as the need for assisted ventilation.

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-06-07 12:04:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. There is an urgent need to evaluate the cost and effectiveness of prophylactic CPAP in both low- and middle-income settings where surfactant therapy is limited. This should be compared with current methods of management available in these settings such as low flow nasal oxygen, head box or other forms of delivery of oxygen therapy that do not generate a positive pressure. Other supportive care such as warmth and nutrition should be available to both comparison groups. Trials need to be stratified for weight or gestational age to determine if differences in effectiveness occur in lighter, less mature infants. It would also be important to follow up infants into childhood where possible.</P>
<P>2. In high-income countries further trials to determine the best definition of CPAP failure and to evaluate alternative methods of surfactant delivery to babies managed on CPAP are required.</P>

<P>Experimental: prophylactic nasal CPAP of 4 to 6 cmH&#8322;O applied within 30 minutes of birth (n = 115)<BR/>Control: received nasal CPAP when the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO&#8322;) in the hood was &gt; 0.4 for more than 30 minutes, to maintain transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO&#8322;) at the right hand between 93% and 96%. Nasal CPAP was given through nasal prongs using the Infant Flow Driver system (n= 115).

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2016-06-10 09:48:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="Colleen Ovelman">
<P>If the review is &#8220;Prophylactic nasal continuous positive airway pressure for preventing morbidity and mortality in very preterm infants&#8221;, then I think you should include the COIN trial. The other situation where the word prophylactic is used is for surfactant. You can argue about the minutiae of the definition of prophylactic but the COIN trial was the largest RCT so far to enrol infants to nasal CPAP within 5 minutes of birth and therefore it really fulfils the definition of prophylactic.</P>

<P>Feedback Comment:<BR/>
<U>To be included in COIN, babies had to have some respiratory distress at 5 minutes of age</U> Therefore this is <U>treatment not prophylaxis</U>. This included the subjective and inaccurate sign of cyanosis. The numbers of infants eligible by gestational age but excluded because they had no respiratory distress isn't captured in the paper and I don't think we have the unpublished data to tell. In practice, lack of respiratory distress was a very rare exclusion criteria at RWH where most of the babies were recruited. The spirit of the trial was that babies who were breathing at 5 minutes were randomised but they had signs of respiratory distress and or failure (cyanosis) which I guess makes it not suitable for inclusion in the prophylaxis review rather than the treatment review</P>
