<P>Cancer treatment can lead to severe fungal infections (candidiasis, called thrush) in the mouth. This can cause pain, difficulties in eating and longer hospital stays. Infection can sometimes spread through the body and become life-threatening. Different drugs are used to try and relieve candidiasis. There is insufficient evidence that any of the antifungal drugs may cure fungal infections in the mouth for people with cancer and more research is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-03-31 09:49:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Worthington">
<P>Treatment of cancer is increasingly effective but is associated with short and long term side effects. Oral and gastrointestinal side effects, including oral candidiasis, remain a major source of illness despite the use of a variety of agents to treat them.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of oral candidiasis for patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy or both. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-06-03 09:55:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Littlewood">
<P>Computerised searches of Cochrane Oral Health Group and PaPaS Trials Registers (to 1 June 2010), CENTRAL via <I>the Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 2, 2010, 1 June 2010), MEDLINE via OVID (1 June 2010), EMBASE via OVID (1 June 2010), CINAHL via EBSCO (1 June 2010), CANCERLIT via PubMed (1 June 2010), OpenSIGLE (1 June 2010) and LILACS via Virtual Health Library (1 June 2010) were undertaken.<BR/>Reference lists from relevant articles were searched and the authors of eligible trials were contacted to identify trials and obtain additional information.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled trials comparing agents prescribed to treat oral candidiasis in people receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy for cancer. The outcomes were eradication of oral candidiasis, dysphagia, systemic infection, amount of analgesia, length of hospitalisation, cost and patient quality of life.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-06-09 16:08:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were independently extracted, in duplicate, by two review authors. Trial authors were contacted for details of randomisation and withdrawals and a quality assessment was carried out. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated using fixed-effect models.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-06-09 16:15:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten trials involving 940 patients, satisfied the inclusion criteria and are included in this review. Drugs absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract were beneficial in eradication of oral candidiasis compared with drugs not absorbed from the GI tract (three trials: RR = 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 1.52), however there was significant heterogeneity. A drug absorbed from the GI tract, ketoconazole, was more beneficial than placebo in eradicating oral candidiasis (one trial: RR = 3.61, 95% CI 1.47 to 8.88). Clotrimazole, at a higher dose of 50 mg was more effective than a lower 10 mg dose in eradicating oral candidiasis, when assessed mycologically (one trial: RR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.60). Only one of the ten trials was assessed as at low risk of bias.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-06-09 15:50:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence to claim or refute a benefit for any antifungal agent in treating candidiasis. Further well designed, placebo-controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of old and new interventions for treating oral candidiasis are needed. Clinicians need to make a decision on whether to prevent or treat oral candidiasis in patients receiving treatment for cancer.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-09 16:22:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment of solid malignant tumours and the leukemias with cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy or both is becoming increasingly more effective but it is associated with short and long term side effects. Among the clinically important acute side effects is the disruption in the function and integrity of the oral mucosa. The consequences of this include severe ulceration (mucositis) and fungal infection of the mouth (oral candidiasis). These disease and treatment induced complications may also produce oral discomfort and pain, poor nutrition, delays in drug administration, increased hospital stays and costs and in some patients life threatening infection (septicaemia).</P>
<P>Patients with cancer are advised to maintain oral hygiene. Depending on the cancer centre, the patient's age and the expected toxicity of their treatment protocol, additional agents may be provided to prevent oral complications. Nevertheless, oral complications remain a major source of illness despite the use of a variety of agents to prevent them. A recent Cochrane review looked at the use of oral and topical prophylactic agents for the prevention of oral candidiasis in patients with cancer treated by chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Clarkson-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarkson 2007a</LINK>). The review concluded that there is strong evidence, from randomised controlled trials, that drugs absorbed or partially absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract prevent oral candidiasis in patients receiving treatment for cancer. There is also evidence that these drugs are significantly better at preventing oral candidiasis than drugs not absorbed from the GI tract. This present review follows on from this and looks at the treatment of overt oral candidiasis in patients receiving treatment for cancer. This review is one in a series of four Cochrane reviews looking at the prevention and treatment of both oral candidiasis and oral mucositis (<LINK REF="REF-Clarkson-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarkson 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clarkson-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarkson 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Worthington-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worthington 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>This review is part of a series of four reviews on the prevention and treatment of oral candidiasis and oral mucositis in patients with cancer, and the same search strategies were used for all four reviews.<BR/>The searches attempted to identify all relevant trials irrespective of language. Papers not in English were translated by members of The Cochrane Collaboration.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Electronic searches:</HEADING>
<P>The following databases were searched:<BR/>Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (whole database, to 1 June 2010) (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>)<BR/>Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care (PaPaS) Group Trials Register (whole database, to 1 June 2010) (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>)<BR/>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2010, Issue 2; searches conducted 1 June 2010) (see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>)<BR/>MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 1 June 2010) (see <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>)<BR/>EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 1 June 2010) (see <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>)<BR/>CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 1 June 2010) (see <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>)<BR/>CANCERLIT via PubMed (1950 to 1 June 2010) (see <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>)<BR/>OpenSIGLE (1980 to 1 June 2010) (see <LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK>)<BR/>LILACS via the Virtual Health Library (1980 to 1 June 2010) (see <LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK>)</P>
<P>Sensitive search strategies were developed for each database using a combination of free text and MeSH terms. The MEDLINE and CANCERLIT subject searches were conducted with the addition of the <I>Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy (CHSSS) for identifying randomized trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity maximising version (2009 revision) </I>as referenced in Chapter 6.4.11.1 and detailed in boxes 6.4.a and 6.4c of the<I> Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>Version 5.0.2 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). Filters developed by the Cochrane Oral Health Group for identifying randomised controlled trials were used for the searches of EMBASE and CINAHL. The LILACS subject search was linked to the Brazilian Cochrane Center search strategy for identifying randomised controlled trials in LILACs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Searching other resources:</HEADING>
<P>Only handsearching carried out by The Cochrane Collaboration is included in the search (<I>see</I> master list <A HREF="http://www.cochrane.org">www.cochrane.org</A>).</P>
<P>The controlled trials database (<A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com">www.controlled-trials.com</A>) was also searched to identify ongoing and completed trials and to contact trialists for further information about these trials.</P>
<P>The reference list of related review articles and all articles obtained were checked for further trials. Authors of trial reports and specialists in the field known to the review authors were written to concerning further published and unpublished trials.</P>
<P>The review will be updated every 2 years using the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CANCERLIT and LILACS. OpenSIGLE is no longer being updated and will not be searched for future updates of this review.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>The titles and abstracts (when available) of all reports identified through the searches were scanned by two review authors (Jan Clarkson (JC) and Helen Worthington (HW)). Full reports were obtained for trials appearing to meet the inclusion criteria or for which there was insufficient information in the title and abstract to make a clear decision. The full reports obtained from all the electronic and other methods of searching were assessed independently, in duplicate, by two review authors to establish whether the trials met the inclusion criteria or not. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>Data were extracted by two review authors independently using specially designed data extraction forms. The characteristics of the trial participants, interventions and outcomes for the included trials are presented in the study tables. Candidiasis was recorded as absent or present, and data for both clinical and mycological assessments were extracted. The duration of trials was recorded along with interim assessments and a decision made about which to use to maximise commonality. We also recorded the country where the trial was conducted, which year it was conducted and whether a dentist was involved in the investigation. Trial authors were contacted for clarification or for further information.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>The assessment of risk of bias for included trials was undertaken independently and in duplicate by two review authors. Studies were analysed for the following to assess validity as a threshold for inclusion of the studies, which is described as one of the options in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>Version 5.0.2 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>) on the following individual quality criteria:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Adequate sequence generation: Yes, No, Unclear</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment: Yes, No, Unclear</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants and carers: Yes, No, Unclear</LI>
<LI>Blinidng of outcome assessors: Yes, No, Unclear</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data addressed: Yes, No, Unclear</LI>
<LI>Free of selective outcome reporting: Yes, No, Unclear</LI>
<LI>Free of other biases: Yes, No, Unclear</LI>
</UL>
<P>'Yes' indicates a low risk of bias, 'No' indicates high risk of bias and 'Unclear' indicates either lack of information or uncertainty over the potential for bias. A risk of bias table was completed for each included study.

<P>The search was conducted for the four similar reviews in this series (<LINK REF="REF-Clarkson-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarkson 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clarkson-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarkson 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Worthington-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worthington 2007</LINK>) and has now been repeated seven times since 1999 for different updates. The most recent searches in October 2008, August 2009, January 2010 and June 2010 identified 1924, 621, 394 and 294 records respectively. Following screening of all three databases 125 potential trials were identified for the four reviews. There was only one further trial to be included in this review update (<LINK REF="STD-Bensadoun-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bensadoun 2008</LINK>) and one further study to be excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Yamaguchi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yamaguchi 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>Of the 10 included trials, four were conducted in USA (<LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shechtman-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Shechtman 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yap-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Yap 1979</LINK>) and six in Europe (<LINK REF="STD-Bensadoun-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bensadoun 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finlay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Finlay 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oude-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Oude 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Studena-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Studena 1995</LINK>). Six of the trials received external funding, three obtained government funding and five acknowledged assistance from the pharmaceutical industry. The providers and assessors of the treatments were mainly medical staff although one of the trials involved a dentist (<LINK REF="STD-Finlay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Finlay 1996</LINK>). None of the trials involved the patients in the outcome measurement.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The results of the 10 trials included in the review are based on 940 patients. The range of patients was from 6 to 141 per treatment or control group.</P>
<P>Six of the 10 trials recruited only adult patients with cancer, one included both adults and children (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1983</LINK>), one included only children (<LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>) and in two trials the age of the patients was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shechtman-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Shechtman 1984</LINK>). The type of cancer being treated was a combination of leukemias and solid tumours in seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meunier-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oude-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Oude 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shechtman-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Shechtman 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Studena-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Studena 1995</LINK>), head and neck cancer in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bensadoun-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bensadoun 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finlay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Finlay 1996</LINK>), and children with unspecified malignancies in the remaining trial (<LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>). Little information was provided on the cancer treatment regimens received by patients in the trials. In one trial only radiotherapy was used (<LINK REF="STD-Finlay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Finlay 1996</LINK>), one trial used both cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Oude-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Oude 2004</LINK>) and for one trial information was provided for individual patients regarding the use of steroids and antibiotics in addition to chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Shechtman-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Shechtman 1984</LINK>). The diagnosis of oral candidiasis at entry into the trial was usually a combination of both clinical and mycological diagnosis. However in two trials only clinical diagnosis was used (<LINK REF="STD-Finlay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Finlay 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Studena-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Studena 1995</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>There was variation between the trials in the assessment of oral candidiasis. All trials reported both a clinical and microbiological outcome of oral candidiasis. All trials used the dichotomous clinical outcome 'eradicated' verus 'not eradicated'. In addition two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Finlay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Finlay 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>) compared the severity before and after treatment using a 4-point scoring system. For three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Meunier-1990b" TYPE="STUDY">Meunier 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Studena-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Studena 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yap-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Yap 1979</LINK>) the method of assessment was not given. Mycological assessments were based on cultures rather than smears in all trials and the dichotomous classification of eradicated or not could be obtained from all the 10 trials. Only in three trials were outcome measures of pain or dysphagia collected (<LINK REF="STD-Bensadoun-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bensadoun 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shechtman-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Shechtman 1984</LINK>) and only three reported side effects (<LINK REF="STD-Bensadoun-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bensadoun 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oude-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Oude 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>One of the two placebo controlled trials found a significant benefit (risk ratio (RR) = 3.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47 to 8.88) for patients taking the absorbed drug ketoconazole (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1983</LINK>).

<P>Three trials compared absorbed drugs (ketoconazole or fluconazole) with drugs not absorbed (nystatin or amphotericin B). Two of these trials demonstrated a significant clinical benefit of the absorbed drug fluconazole over the non-absorbed drug nystatin (<LINK REF="STD-Finlay-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Finlay 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Flynn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Flynn 1995</LINK>), and the meta analysis found a benefit for the absorbed drugs over the non-absorbed drugs (RR = 1.29, 95% CI fixed 1.09 to 1.52; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity P = 0.01).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1, Outcome 1.2 - Mycological: eradication of oral candidiasis</HEADING>
<P>There were some differences between the results for the mycological assessments compared with those from the clinical assessment. Despite a significant clinical improvement there was no statistically significant difference in mycological eradication between an absorbed drug ketoconazole and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1983</LINK>). However, there was evidence of different eradication rates with different absorbed drugs and a statistically significant benefit was found for fluconazole over itraconazole (RR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.33; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity P = 0.30). In agreement with the clinical assessment there was a statistically significant difference in terms of a benefit for absorbed drugs compared to not absorbed drugs (RR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.57; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity P = 0.001). One further trial (<LINK REF="STD-Yap-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Yap 1979</LINK>) demonstrated that 50 mg of the partially absorbed drug clotrimazole eradicated more cases than the lower dose of 10 mg (RR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.60).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-06-09 17:19:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whilst we have been able to achieve our objective in evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to treat oral candidiasis, there were insufficient trials to make strong recommendations for patient care. The generalisability of the results is difficult to comment on as reporting of the types of cancer and details of treatment was unclear and few trials included children.</P>
<P>There were only two trials that compared the treatment of candidiasis using an active drug with a placebo. There was some evidence, based on one trial, that ketoconazole is effective, but there is a need for more trials that include a placebo group. The risk of hepatotoxicity with prolonged use of ketoconazole could influence treatment decisions and the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines has recommended that prescibers should weigh up the potential benefits against the risk of liver damage, and should carefully monitor patients both clinically and biochemically (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is evidence that absorbed drugs are more effective than drugs not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. There was no difference found in either trial comparing two absorbed drugs, and there was an indication that a higher dose of clotrimazole was more effective than a lower dose, although this was only found for the mycological assessment. There were no trials comparing partially absorbed drugs with either absorbed drugs or drugs not absorbed.</P>
<P>The findings from this review are disappointing as there were only 10 trials including 940 patients, 69 of whom were included in the two trials with placebo control groups. This is far fewer than the 28 trials with 4226 patients included in the prevention review (<LINK REF="REF-Clarkson-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarkson 2007a</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was limited consistency between trials on the clinical diagnosis of oral candidiasis and there was also little reported in terms of relief of pain, relief of dysphagia, incidence of systemic infection, amount of analgesia, days stay in hospital, cost of oral care and patient quality of life. It is therefore difficult to comment on the importance of these patient based outcomes, although they are frequently cited as the justification for conducting trials.</P>
<P>It is not possible to assess whether there was any evidence of publication bias however, with few trials and patients, this could be a major problem.</P>
<P>For patients being treated for cancer the clinical dilemma is whether to prevent or treat oral candidiasis. The findings from the prevention review would suggest that if the incidence of oral candidiasis for a patient subgroup is likely to be high then a drug absorbed or partially absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract should be prescribed at the start of cancer treatment. The incidence of oral candidiasis is variable and depends on the nature of the underlying disease and the intensity of treatment. For absorbed drugs in populations with an incidence of 20% (mid range of results in control groups), the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one extra case of oral candidiasis was 9 (95% confidence interval 7 to 13) (<LINK REF="REF-Clarkson-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarkson 2007a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The findings of this review should be considered in the context of the general medical management of patients with cancer. A review investigating the routine use of antifungal therapy in cancer patients did not find an effect on mortality and only a modest effect on systemic fungal invasion (<LINK REF="REF-Gotzsche-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotzsche 2002</LINK>). The authors questioned the current widespread practice of prophylactic antifungal therapy and this finding should be considered when interpreting the results of this review where we are specifically looking at oral outcomes.</P>

<P>There is a need for more well designed trials that compare the effectiveness of drugs absorbed, partially absorbed or not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with a placebo control. These should be conducted before comparing specific agents with each other. The limited evidence of effectiveness of current therapies, combined with side-effects profiles of those agents with proven efficacy suggest that new interventions for treating oral candidiasis are needed.</P>
