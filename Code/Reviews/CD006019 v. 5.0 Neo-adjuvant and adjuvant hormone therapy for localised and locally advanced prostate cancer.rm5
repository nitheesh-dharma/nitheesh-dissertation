<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-06-04 10:45:08 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>The management of early prostate cancer is one of the most controversial areas in the field of cancer medicine with surgery, radiotherapy, primary hormonal therapy (achieved either by medication or by the surgical removal of the testes - orchidectomy) and watchful waiting, all being acceptable forms of initial treatment. Treatment decision making is often based on patient and provider preferences taking into account the risks and benefits of therapies and disease progression. Since prostate cancer is driven, in part by male sex hormones, the use of hormonal treatment to reduce the level of circulating male hormones is a potentially very useful method of treating all stages of this disease. Recently, research on the use of such hormonal therapy in combination with both surgery and radiotherapy has increased. This systematic review combines the results of all the important trials looking at the role of hormones in combination with surgery and radiotherapy for localised and locally advanced prostate cancer.</P>
<P>The results of this review indicate that neo-adjuvant hormone therapy administered three to six months before the primary curative therapy (radical prostatectomy radical radiotherapy) did not, as yet, result in a detectable improvement in overall survival or disease-specific survival. There was, however, a significant improvement in disease-free survival (approximately 90%) when given before radiotherapy. Neo-adjuvant hormone therapy prior to radical prostatectomy also significantly improved pathological variables associated with poor prognosis, such as the positive surgical margin rate and the proportion of patients with positive lymph nodes. Adjuvant hormone therapy following prostatectomy did not change overall or disease-specific survival compared to prostatectomy alone. However, adjuvant therapy following radiotherapy significantly improved overall survival and disease-specific survival up to 10 years post-treatment. Disease-free survival was also significantly improved at 10 years. Hormone therapy is associated with a number of side effects including hot flushes and gynaecomastia. The decision to use these agents has to be made after a full discussion between the patient and the physician regarding the disease risk of the patient, the benefits from the use of additional hormones and the side effects of hormonal therapy.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Hormone therapy for early prostate cancer has demonstrated an improvement in clinical and pathological variables, but not always an improvement in overall survival. We performed a systematic review of both adjuvant and neo-adjuvant hormone therapy combined with surgery or radiotherapy in localised or locally advanced prostate cancer.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to undertake a systematic review and, if possible, a meta-analysis of neo-adjuvant and adjuvant hormone therapy in localised or locally advanced prostate cancer.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-06-03 15:00:38 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched MEDLINE (1966 to 2006), EMBASE, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, <I>Science Citation Index</I>, LILACS, and SIGLE for relevant randomised trials. Handsearching of appropriate publications was also undertaken.</P>

<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of patients with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer, that is, stages T1 to T4, any N, M0, comparing neo-adjuvant or adjuvant hormonal deprivation in combination with primary therapy (radical radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy) versus primary therapy alone were included in this review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted from eligible studies and assessed for quality, and included information on study design, participants, interventions, and outcomes. Comparable data were pooled together for meta-analysis with intention-to treat principle. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-06-03 15:00:58 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Men with prostate cancer have different clinical outcomes based on their risk (T1 to T2, T3 to T4, PSA levels and Gleason score). However, the majority of studies included in this review did not report results by risk groups; therefore, it was not possible to perform sub-group analysis.</P>
<P>Neo-adjuvant hormonal therapy prior to prostatectomy did not improve overall survival (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.85, P = 0.69). However, there was a significant reduction in the positive surgical margin rate (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.42, P &lt; 0.00001) and a significant improvement in other pathological variables such as lymph node involvement, pathological staging and organ confined rates. There was a borderline significant reduction of disease recurrence rates (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.0, P = 0.05), in favour of treatment. The use of longer duration of neo-adjuvant hormones, that is either 6 or 8 months prior to prostatectomy, was associated with a significant reduction in positive surgical margins (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.80, P = 0.002).</P>
<P>In one study, neo-adjuvant hormones prior to radiotherapy significantly improved overall survival for Gleason 2 to 6 patients; although, in two studies, there was no improvement in disease-specific survival (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.32, P = 0.97). However, there was a significant improvement in both clinical disease-free survival (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.93 to 2.40, P &lt; 0.00001) and biochemical disease-free survival (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.56, P &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<P>Adjuvant androgen deprivation following prostatectomy did not significantly improve overall survival at 5 years (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.85, P = 0.2); although one study reported a significant disease-specific survival advantage with adjuvant therapy (P = 0.001). In addition, there was a significant improvement in disease-free survival at both 5 years (OR 3.73, 95%CI 2.30 to 6.03, P &lt; 0.00001) and 10 years (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.15, P = 0.0009).</P>
<P>Adjuvant therapy following radiotherapy resulted in a significant overall survival gain apparent at 5 (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.83, P = 0.0009) and 10 years (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.84, P = 0.003); although there was significant heterogeneity (P = 0.09 and P = 0.07, respectively). There was also a significant improvement in disease-specific survival (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.88, P = 0.00001) and disease-free survival (OR 2.53, 95% CI 2.05 to 3.12, P &lt; 0.00001) at 5 years.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Hormone therapy combined with either prostatectomy or radiotherapy is associated with significant clinical benefits in patients with local or locally advanced prostate cancer. Significant local control may be achieved when given prior to prostatectomy or radiotherapy, which may improve patient's quality of life. When given adjuvant to these primary therapies, hormone therapy, not only provides a method for local control, but there is also evidence for a significant survival advantage. However, hormone therapy is associated with significant side effects, such as hot flushes and gynaecomastia, as well as cost implications. The decision to use hormone therapy should, therefore, be taken at a local level, between the patient, clinician and policy maker, taking into account the clinical benefits, toxicity and cost. More research is needed to guide the choice, the duration, and the schedule of hormonal deprivation therapy, and the impact of long-term hormone therapy with regard to toxicity and the patient's quality of life. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-08 12:58:57 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Since the advent of routine PSA screening in the mid 1990s the incidence of early prostate cancer has increased. The management of patients with early stage disease has remained one of the most controversial areas in oncological practice.</P>
<P>The hormone responsive nature of prostate cancer was first demonstrated by Huggins and Hodges in 1941 (<LINK REF="REF-Huggins-1941" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huggins 1941</LINK>). Since then the rationale for combined modality treatment, such as radiotherapy with hormone therapy or surgery with hormone therapy, has gained prominence, although not yet established in routine clinical practice. For patients undergoing prostatectomy, neo-adjuvant hormonal treatment (that is, hormone therapy given for various lengths of time prior to definitive therapy) has been shown to cause both clinical as well as pathological downstaging and thereby reduces the positive margin rates (<LINK REF="STD-Witjes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Witjes 1997</LINK>). This, however, does not translate into an improvement in overall and disease-free survival (<LINK REF="REF-Aus-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aus 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baert-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baert 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klotz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The rationale for neo-adjuvant treatment prior to radical radiotherapy is to shrink the tumour thus enabling optimal doses to be administered to the prostate, whilst reducing surrounding tissue exposure. Another rationale is that it may reduce margin positivity prior to prostatectomy and thereby allow adequate coverage of the cancerous area by surgery. Adjuvant hormones are given so as to eliminate micrometastatic disease and thereby reduce both local recurrence and distant metastasis. Several studies have demonstrated an improvement in clinical and pathologic endpoints, but not always an improvement in overall survival (<LINK REF="REF-Hanks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanks 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawton-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lawton 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laverdiere-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laverdiere 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pilepich-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilepich 2000</LINK>). The EORTC 22863, which was a phase 3 trial evaluating the role of long term therapy, - that is, 3 years of adjuvant hormones immediately after radiotherapy - did however, show an improvement in overall survival. These studies have primarily investigated patients with bulky and locally advanced disease, and indeed adjuvant hormonal treatment has become the standard of care for locally advanced disease.</P>
<P>It is, however, unclear whether hormonal treatment combined with surgery or radiotherapy will impact on earlier stage disease, i.e. stage T1 and T2a, and is currently being evaluated in RTOG trial 94-08. No randomised trials have been performed to look at the role of hormones in patients receiving brachytherapy alone. However, Stone and Stock (<LINK REF="REF-Stone-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 1999</LINK>) report an improvement in freedom from biochemical relapse with the addition of hormones to brachytherapy for intermediate risk patients (i.e. stage T2b, Gleason grade &gt; 6, and PSA &gt; 10). There is, therefore, a need to evaluate the role of hormone therapy in combination with either radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, interstitial brachytherapy or cryotherapy for localised or locally advanced prostate cancer.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to conduct a systematic review and, if possible, a meta-analysis of neo-adjuvant and adjuvant hormone therapy in localised or locally advanced prostate cancer to assess the effectiveness and adverse effects of these treatments.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised trials reporting on neo-adjuvant and adjuvant hormone therapy for localised or locally advanced prostate cancer. Randomised controlled trials that compare schedules of neo-adjuvant or adjuvant hormone therapy will also be eligible for inclusion. Only full peer-reviewed published articles will be included for analysis.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2008-06-03 14:40:38 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Men with stage T1 to T4, N1, M0 according to the WHO 1997 TNM classification will be used. Alternative systems of staging such as the Jewett system will also be accepted. Clinically or histologically confirmed local or locally advanced prostate cancer with or without lymph node involvement, but not with bone or visceral metastasis, will be the included in the review. Stage A1 and A2 in the Jewett staging system roughly corresponds to stage T1 in the 1997 TNM staging system. Similarly, stage B corresponds to stage T2, stage C to stage T3 and T4. Stage D1 of the Jewett system corresponds to N1 of the TNM system and stage D2 corresponds to M1 disease in the 1997 TNM system. There was no limitation on age or ethnicity of study participants.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Primary therapies included either radical prostatectomy, radical radiotherapy, brachytherapy or cryotherapy. Neo-adjuvant (hormonal manipulation started 3 to 6 months prior to and including the duration of radiotherapy or until the time of radical prostatectomy) prior to the primary treatment of either surgery or radiotherapy, or adjuvant hormone therapies (hormonal manipulation given after completion of radical prostatectomy and for radiotherapy studies, beginning either at the start or at completion of radiotherapy), may consist of combination hormone therapy with LHRH agonists plus anti-androgens, or single agent hormone deprivation therapies. Hormone therapies of any duration were considered. Only studies of either adjuvant or neo-adjuvant hormones were included and not those that are looking at both. For the purposes of this review, neo-adjuvant and adjuvant hormonal therapies were taken to include those that overlap or were concurrent with radiotherapy treatment.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>For neo-adjuvant studies, the primary outcome was overall survival, with secondary outcomes of disease-specific survival, disease-free survival, disease recurrence, pT staging, surgical margin status, seminal vesicle invasion rate, the presence of lymph node involvement (radical prostatectomy patients only). Overall survival was defined from the date of randomisation to the date of death, due to whatever cause, or date of last contact. Disease-specific survival was also defined from the date of randomisation to the date of death, caused by prostate cancer. Disease recurrence was either local, distant metastasis or biochemical, that is, PSA progression. Pathological staging was expressed in a number of ways either as organ-confined rates, pathological overstaging or downstaging compared to clinical staging. </P>
<P>For adjuvant hormone therapy the primary outcome of interest was overall survival with secondary outcomes of disease-free survival, disease recurrence and time-to-progression. Disease-free survival, time-to-progression or progression-free survival were determined from the date of randomisation, or from the completion of protocol treatment to relapse either clinical or biochemical. Treatment-related side effects were assessed in all studies as well as any quality of life measures reported.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trial Selection</HEADING>
<P>The electronic literature listed the titles and abstracts of potentially relevant trials reporting on neo-adjuvant or adjuvant hormone therapy for localised or locally advanced prostate cancer. Two authors searched the list from each search independently, and by consensus, relevant articles were retrieved. Data was extracted from each identified paper independently by two or more reviewers, and included information on trial design, participants, the type of intervention, and outcome measures. Randomised trials that had more than two arms but include one of the previous outlined comparisons were eligible for review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of Trial Quality</HEADING>
<P>The assessment of trial quality followed the guidelines described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions</I>. Each study was evaluated for quality using Jadad's five-point scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>). These scores were not used to select studies for inclusion or weight studies for analysis. The five points were assigned by the following criteria:</P>
<P>Randomised trials were to receive one point. Randomisation was considered adequate if a central randomised centre was used, allocation by sealed envelopes, or coded numbers by the pharmacy. Trials that described an appropriate method of randomisation, such as table of random numbers or computer generated randomisation, received an additional point. However, if the report described the trial as randomised and used an inappropriate method, such as the date of birth or hospital numbers, a point was deducted.</P>
<P>Studies reporting that the trial was double-blind received one point. Those that described the method of double-blinding, such as identical placebo, active placebo, received an additional point. However, if the report described the trial as double-blind and it was inappropriate, such as comparison of tablets versus injection with no double dummy, a point was deducted.</P>
<P>Trials reporting the number and reasons for patient dropouts and withdrawals for each group received one point. However, if there was no statement for withdrawals, no point was given.</P>
<P>Other quality issues included the comparability of patients in the treatment and control groups, the employment of appropriate statistical methods and whether an intention-to-treat analysis was performed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data Synthesis</HEADING>
<P>Data analysis compared neo-adjuvant therapy plus primary therapy with placebo plus primary therapy or primary therapy alone. The analysis for adjuvant therapy compared primary therapy plus adjuvant therapy with primary therapy plus placebo or primary therapy alone. The data analysis was performed using Review Manager version 4.2.8 supplied by the Cochrane Collaboration. Comparable data from each trial was combined in a meta-analysis where possible. For dichotomous data the odds ratio was calculated with the 95% confidence interval according to the Peto method. The results were tested for homogeneity at a significance level of P &lt; 0.1 according to the methods outlined by DerSimonian and Laird (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>). A fixed-effect model was used if there was no evidence of heterogeneity between studies. Attempts were made to identify possible causes of heterogeneity when observed in the data.</P>
<P>The data derived from different primary therapies were not pooled and were analysed separately. If sufficient data were available, the effect of hormone therapy duration, stage of disease, and the type of hormone intervention on disease outcomes were explored using sensitivity analyses.</P>

<P>A total of 93 studies were identified as potentially suitable for inclusion in the review. However, 71 trials were excluded from the review. Thirty-seven studies were initial or preliminary reports or updated results while ten were not randomised controlled trials. Fourteen studies did not fit the protocol criteria and there were 12 reviews. A full list of these studies and reasons for exclusion are given in the 'Table of excluded studies'.</P>
<P>A total of 21 studies fulfilled all the inclusion criteria and were the subject of this review, and included a total of 11,149 patients. One study, <LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2003</LINK>, was an assessment of quality of life in the <LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK> study. They were divided into the following categories:</P>
<P>1. Studies on neo-adjuvant hormones and prostatectomy</P>
<P>There were a total of 10 studies that included seven studies of 0 versus 3 months of neo-adjuvant hormones with a total of 1534 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Dalkin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dalkin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aus 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klotz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Labrie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Labrie 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prezioso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prezioso 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schulman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soloway-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Soloway 2002</LINK>). The remaining three studies, <LINK REF="STD-Selli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Selli 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Van-Der-Kwast-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Der Kwast 1999</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Gleave-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gleave 2001</LINK>, evaluated three versus a longer duration - ie six or eight months in the case of the <LINK REF="STD-Gleave-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gleave 2001</LINK> study. Included patients had predominantly localised T1 and T2 disease, low and intermediate grade with Gleason scores up to and including 7, and PSA &lt; 20 in most patients. Thus study participants were predominantly of low and intermediate risk categories by conventional definitions with no study having stringent restrictions on serum PSA or grade of tumour. The mean age ranged from 64 to 67 years.</P>
<P>Three studies reported on overall survival (<LINK REF="STD-Klotz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schulman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aus 2002</LINK>) and only two studies analysed disease-free survival (<LINK REF="STD-Klotz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soloway-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Soloway 2002</LINK>). All studies analysed positive surgical margins as one of the primary outcomes and some studies assessed other pathological variables such as organ confined rates, lymph node status and seminal vesicle invasion rate. Additionally, some papers gave information on disease recurrence either biochemical (<LINK REF="STD-Klotz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prezioso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prezioso 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schulman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 2000</LINK>) or clinical recurrence (<LINK REF="STD-Prezioso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prezioso 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schulman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 2000</LINK>). Three studies examined the issue of duration of neo-adjuvant therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Selli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Selli 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Der-Kwast-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Der Kwast 1999</LINK>) and compared 3 versus 6 months of neo-adjuvant hormones, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Gleave-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gleave 2001</LINK> compared 3 versus 8 months of hormonal therapy. The follow up of these studies were as follows: <LINK REF="STD-Schulman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 2000</LINK> - four years; <LINK REF="STD-Klotz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 2003</LINK> - six years; <LINK REF="STD-Aus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aus 2002</LINK> - seven years; and <LINK REF="STD-Prezioso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prezioso 2004</LINK> - six months.</P>
<P>2. Studies of neo-adjuvant hormones and radiotherapy</P>
<P>Four studies with a total of 1865 patients were included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laverdiere-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Laverdiere 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crook-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Crook 2004</LINK>). All patients had non-metastatic, localised or locally advanced prostate cancer (T1 to T3). The vast majority of patients included in these studies had T3 or T4 disease, locally advanced with lymph node involvement, or moderate to high Gleason scores of 7 or higher (those patients with intermediate to high-risk disease by conventional criteria). The mean age ranged from 67 to 72 years and the radiotherapy doses were between 65 and 70 Gy given over 6 to 7 weeks.</P>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laverdiere-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Laverdiere 2004</LINK>) evaluated the addition of neo-adjuvant hormones prior to radiotherapy. One study, <LINK REF="STD-Crook-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Crook 2004</LINK>, compared two different durations of hormone therapy prior to radiotherapy.</P>
<P>3. Studies of adjuvant hormones and prostatectomy</P>
<P>There were three studies with 4906 patients in this category (<LINK REF="STD-Messing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Messing 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirth-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLeod-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McLeod 2005</LINK>). Eligible patients had a mean age ranging from 64 to 66 years, and stages of T3, T4, N0 or N1 disease with any PSA level and grade (<LINK REF="STD-Messing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Messing 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirth-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 2004a</LINK>). Patients included in the <LINK REF="STD-McLeod-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McLeod 2005</LINK> Early Prostate Cancer programme with adjuvant bicalutamide were men with clinically or pathologically localised (T1 to T2, N0/Nx) or locally advanced (T3 to T4, any N; or any T, N+) prostate cancer and no distant metastases. All studies analysed overall survival and disease-free survival. The <LINK REF="STD-Messing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Messing 1999</LINK> study also presented disease-specific survival, and all studies reported information on adverse events.</P>
<P>4. Studies of adjuvant hormones and radiotherapy</P>
<P>There were four studies with a total of 2844 patients in this category (<LINK REF="STD-Bolla-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bolla 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zagars-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Zagars 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Bolla-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bolla 2002</LINK> was the only study which characterised the subject population and 80% of the study population had T3 disease of intermediate and high grade. The radiation dose used in all the studies was 70 Gy given over 7 weeks. All studies reported overall survival and disease-free survival as primary outcomes and, additionally <LINK REF="STD-Bolla-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bolla 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 2005</LINK> reported information on toxicity.</P>

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>All the studies included in this review were randomised. However, only six studies described the method of randomisation. Three were centrally generated by telephone (<LINK REF="STD-Dalkin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dalkin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klotz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 2003</LINK>), one by centralised sealed envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Crook-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Crook 2004</LINK>). One was centralised using the minimisation method after patient stratification (<LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK>), and one utilised the method of Zelen (<LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2005</LINK>). All but two of the studies adequately described the number and reasons for patients' withdrawals and dropouts (<LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laverdiere-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Laverdiere 2004</LINK>). None of the studies reported blinding the allocation of interventions or the assessment of outcomes, apart from the <LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 2005</LINK>. There were no obvious differences in the characteristics of patients recruited in control groups compared to treatment groups. The quality scores of included studies are summarised in the table 'Characteristics of included studies'.</P>

<P>The results are discussed based on primary treatment modalities of either prostatectomy or radiotherapy and whether the hormonal therapy was administered as neo-adjuvant or adjuvant. There were no relevant studies using brachytherapy or cryotherapy. The studies comparing different durations of hormonal therapy will be discussed separately.</P>
<P>
<B>NEO-ADJUVANT HORMONAL THERAPY IN LOCALISED PROSTATE CANCER </B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Neo-adjuvant hormone therapy and prostatectomy</B>
</P>
<P>There were 10 studies of neo-adjuvant hormones prior to prostatectomy, which were heterogeneous for the type of hormonal therapy used and the staging of disease. Three of the 10 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dalkin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dalkin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aus 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klotz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 2003</LINK>) investigating neo-adjuvant hormones and prostatectomy, included single agents either as an anti-androgen or LHRH analogue. One study, <LINK REF="STD-Prezioso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prezioso 2004</LINK>, allowed either an LHRH analogue or bilateral orchidectomy, whereas the remaining six studies used combined androgen blockade as the hormonal therapy of choice (<LINK REF="STD-Gleave-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gleave 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Labrie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Labrie 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schulman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Selli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Selli 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soloway-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Soloway 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Der-Kwast-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Der Kwast 1999</LINK>). The study participants included patients with T1 to T3 disease with or without lymph node involvement and no evidence of distant metastatic disease, but the patients were predominantly those with T1 and T2 disease. All but two studies (which specified PSA levels of &lt; 50 and &lt; 100 ng/mL) had no limits on PSA or grade of tumour.</P>
<P>Studies comparing zero versus three months of hormonal therapy</P>
<P>Hormonal therapy consisted of an anti-androgen alone, a LHRH analogue alone or a combination of the two. As per study protocol, the outcomes for the neo-adjuvant studies included the positive surgical margins, the seminal vesicle invasion rate, lymph node positivity, pathological stage and disease-free-survival. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis and, in addition, evaluable patient data were analysed to look for differences in results.</P>
<P>
<I>Overall Survival</I>
</P>
<P>Three studies provided information on overall survival (<LINK REF="STD-Klotz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schulman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aus 2002</LINK>). With a 4-year follow-up period, <LINK REF="STD-Schulman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 2000</LINK> reported no difference in overall survival rates, with 93% and 95% of patients alive in the treatment and control groups, respectively (P = 0.64). Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Klotz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 2003</LINK>, had a 6-year follow-up period and also reported no difference in overall survival (P = 0.38), with 5-year overall survival rates of 88.4% and 93.9%, respectively, for the neo-adjuvant hormonal and surgery only arms. The third study, <LINK REF="STD-Aus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aus 2002</LINK>, recruited 126 patients, 63 randomised to both arms and a follow up of 7 years, and again indicated no significant difference in overall survival (P = 0.513). These three studies all show that neo-adjuvant hormone therapy before prostatectomy does not provide a significant survival advantage over prostatectomy alone (pooled OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.85, P = 0.69, comparison 1: outcome 1).</P>
<P>There were no data available for disease-specific survival.</P>
<P>
<I>Disease-free survival</I>
</P>
<P>Five studies analysed disease-free survival, defined by either biochemical progression (PSA) or clinical progression (an enlarged prostate or distant metastasis) (<LINK REF="STD-Klotz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prezioso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prezioso 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schulman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soloway-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Soloway 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aus 2002</LINK>). The follow-up period varied from approximately six months (<LINK REF="STD-Prezioso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prezioso 2004</LINK>) to seven years (<LINK REF="STD-Aus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aus 2002</LINK>). The study with the longest follow up, <LINK REF="STD-Aus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aus 2002</LINK>, showed no significant difference in PSA progression-free survival rates (49.8% for the neo-adjuvant arm and 51.5% for the prostatectomy arm, P = 0.588). The <LINK REF="STD-Klotz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 2003</LINK> study had the second longest follow-up period with a median of 5.75 years, but showed no difference in 5-year biochemical free survival between treatment arms (60.2% and 68.2%, respectively, for the hormonal and surgery only arms, P = 0.73). One study, <LINK REF="STD-Soloway-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Soloway 2002</LINK>, recruited patients with clinical stage T2bNXMO, and also reported a 5-year biochemical-free survival that was not significantly different between treatment arms (64.8% for the hormonal arm versus 67.6% for the surgery only arm, P = 0.663). A further study, <LINK REF="STD-Schulman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 2000</LINK>, evaluated the 4-year PSA progression rate of patients with T2 to T3,NO,MO disease and showed no difference in disease-free survival (26% versus 33%, respectively, P = 0.18). The main aim of another study, <LINK REF="STD-Prezioso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prezioso 2004</LINK>, was to evaluate the effect of neo-adjuvant hormone therapy on pathological variables and PSA compared to prostatectomy alone, but also reported data on PSA relapse. However, the median follow-up period was less than 7 months and the data were considered to be immature (90% treatment group versus 84% surgery, no P value given). None of the above studies showed a statistical difference in disease-free survival between the control and the treatment arms. Data for disease-free survival at 5 years was extracted from four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Klotz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aus 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schulman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soloway-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Soloway 2002</LINK>) and gave a pooled OR of 1.24 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.57), which did not achieve statistically significance (P = 0.13) (comparison 1: outcome 2).</P>
<P>
<I>Pathological outcomes</I>
</P>
<P>Treatment with neo-adjuvant hormones was shown to substantially improve local pathological variables such as organ confined rates (overall OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.72 to 3.08, P &lt; 0.00001, comparison 1: outcomes 3 and 4), pathological down-staging (overall OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.50 to 3.90, P = 0.0003, comparison 1: outcomes 5 and 6), positive surgical margins (overall OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.42, P&lt; 0.00001, comparison 1: outcomes 7 and 8) and rate of lymph node involvement (overall OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.93, P = 0.02, comparison 1: outcomes 11 and 12). One study, <LINK REF="STD-Soloway-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Soloway 2002</LINK>, reported a decrease in seminal vesicle invasion rate with neo-adjuvant therapy, whereas one study, <LINK REF="STD-Klotz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 2003</LINK>, showed no difference (comparison 1; outcomes 9 and 10).</P>
<P>Different durations of neo-adjuvant hormonal treatment</P>
<P>Two studies evaluated six versus three months of neo-adjuvant hormonal therapy before radical prostatectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Selli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Selli 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Der-Kwast-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Der Kwast 1999</LINK>) and one study, <LINK REF="STD-Gleave-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gleave 2001</LINK>, evaluated three versus eight months of hormonal therapy. When evaluable cases from these three studies with a total of 805 patients were pooled, there was a significant improvement in positive surgical margin rate with the longer duration of therapy (overall OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.80, P = 0.002, comparison 2: outcome 1). Data from the two studies (case analysis only) without significant heterogeneity, with a total of 805 patients were pooled for organ-confined rates, and shown to have a significant improvement with 6 months of neo-adjuvant hormonal therapy (overall OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.89, P = 0.02, comparison 2 : outcome 2).</P>
<P>
<B>Neo-adjuvant hormonal therapy and radiotherapy</B>
</P>
<P>There were four eligible studies included in this section of the review that investigated the role of neo-adjuvant hormones before radiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crook-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Crook 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laverdiere-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Laverdiere 2004</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Crook-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Crook 2004</LINK> study compared three versus eight months of neo-adjuvant hormones prior to radiotherapy, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK> examined zero, three and six months of neo-adjuvant concurrent hormonal therapy and radiotherapy. The duration of hormonal therapy (all were of approximately three to four months in duration), the radiotherapy techniques used and the definitions of biochemical relapse varied between studies.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Laverdiere-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Laverdiere 2004</LINK> study included patients with T2 to T3 disease and neo-adjuvant hormones were given for 3 months prior to radiotherapy. The <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2001</LINK> study included those patients with bulky T2 to T4 disease with or without pelvic lymph node involvement, with hormones being administered for three months before and during radiotherapy. Similarly, the <LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK> study evaluated the use of either three months or six months of neo-adjuvant therapy in a group of patients with T2b, T3, T4 disease without lymph node involvement and no limit on initial PSA levels.</P>
<P>
<I>Overall survival</I>
</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2001</LINK> study provided data on overall survival at both five and eight years. At 8 years, there was no significant improvement of overall survival between neo-adjuvant and control groups (53% versus 44%, P = 0.10). Sub-group analysis, however, showed that there was a significant survival benefit for those patients with Gleason 2 to 6 tumours (70% versus 52%, P = 0.015).</P>
<P>
<I>Disease-specific survival</I>
</P>
<P>Two studies reported on this endpoint, <LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2001</LINK>. In one study, 3 months of hormonal therapy had no impact on disease-specific survival at 5 years (HR 0.91, P = 0.91), whereas, 6 months of neo-adjuvant therapy had a significant effect on disease-specific survival (HR 0.58, P = 0.04) (<LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK>). There was a trend of increasing benefit with increasing Gleason scores, PSA levels and high risk groups. <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2001</LINK> reported the 8-year disease-specific mortality as being significantly lower in the neo-adjuvant arm compared to the radiotherapy only arm (23% versus 33%, P = 0.05). Both studies, with a total of 991 patients were available for analysis of 5-year disease-specific survival (heterogeneity, P = 0.68). The overall OR of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.75 to 1.32) was not statistically significant (P = 0.97) between the two arms (comparison 3: outcome 1).</P>
<P>
<I>Biochemical disease-free survival</I>
</P>
<P>The 3 studies with a total of 1097 patients were eligible for analysis of biochemical disease-free survival (<LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laverdiere-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Laverdiere 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2001</LINK>). The first study reported an improvement in 5-year biochemical failure-free survival for those patients receiving 3 months of androgen deprivation compared to no treatment ( HR 0.70, P = 0.002). <LINK REF="STD-Laverdiere-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Laverdiere 2004</LINK> reported the 7-year biochemical disease-free survival as 42% for the control arm and 66% for the neo-adjuvant treatment arm (P = 0.009). Similarly, the third study reported the 8-year biochemical disease-free survival (that is, PSA &lt; 1.5) as 24% and 10% for the treatment and control arms, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001) (<LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2001</LINK>). Pooling these three studies resulted in an overall odds ratio of 1.93 which was highly statistically significant in favour of neo-adjuvant hormones (P &lt; 0.00001) (comparison 3: outcome 2). Heterogeneity was observed between these studies (P = 0.05) and variations in PSA methodology, subject population and differences in sequencing treatment, may contribute to this, and are described in the discussion.</P>

<I>Clinical disease-free survival</I>
</P>
<P>Two studies reported results for clinical disease-free survival of neo-adjuvant hormone therapy prior to radiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK> reported that for those receiving three months of neo-adjuvant hormones, there was an improvement of five-year disease-free survival (HR 0.65, P = 0.0001) compared to the control arm. The study did not show a significant interaction between treatment effect and prognostic subgroups such as tumour stage, grade and PSA levels; however, there was a trend of increasing treatment effect with increasing Gleason score, PSA levels and high risk. The RTOG trial 86-10 by <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2001</LINK> also reported a statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival at 8 years in favour of the neo-adjuvant arm (33% versus 21%, P = 0.004). Subset analysis in this study showed a preferential benefit in Gleason score 2 to 6 patients in whom there was an improvement in all end-points including survival. The two studies with a total of 991 patients were available for a pooled analysis (heterogeneity P = 0.39). The overall OR was 1.86 (95% CI, 1.93 to 2.40) and was highly significant in favour of the treatment arm (P &lt; 0.00001) (comparison 3: outcome 3).</P>
<P>Different durations of hormonal therapy prior to radiotherapy</P>
<P>Two studies investigated the duration of neo-adjuvant therapy prior to radiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Crook-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Crook 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK> study evaluated 0, 3 and 6 months of combined androgen blockade in patients with T2b - T4,NO prostate cancer. The <LINK REF="STD-Crook-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Crook 2004</LINK> study evaluated 3 versus 6 months of hormonal therapy in patients with clinically localised prostate cancer (T1c - T4) and all levels of PSA.</P>

<I>Overall survival</I>
</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Crook-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Crook 2004</LINK> paper reported the actuarial survival rate at 5 years for the 3 and 8 months as 85% and 88%, respectively (P = 0.13). No overall survival data were reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK>.</P>

<P>Three months of androgen deprivation before radiotherapy did not reduce the probability of deaths from prostate cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK>). However, 6 months of hormone therapy significantly reduced this probability (HR 0.56, 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.98, P = 0.04).</P>
<P>
<I>Disease-free-survival</I>
<BR/>
<BR/>The data presented by <LINK REF="STD-Crook-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Crook 2004</LINK> indicated that after a follow up of 44 months, there was an improvement of 5-year disease free survival for the 8 month arm in the high risk group (39% versus 52%), that is, those with stages T3 and T4, Gleason score 8 to 10 and PSA &gt; 20 ng/mL, but did not reach statistical significance. The <LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK> study evaluated combined androgen blockade in patients with T2b - T4,NO prostate cancer, and reported that in the 6 month treatment arm there was significant improvement in disease-free survival (HR 0.56, 05% CI, 0.45 to 0.69, P &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<P>Biochemical disease-free survival</P>
<P>The same two studies reported biochemical disease-free survival (<LINK REF="STD-Crook-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Crook 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK>). Crook et al reported the actuarial biochemical disease-free survival at 3 years as 66% for the 3-month arm and 68% for the 8-month arm, and by 5 years was 61% versus 62%, respectively (P = 0.88). Denham et al reported a significant improvement in biochemical disease-free survival for 6 months of neo-adjuvant therapy compared to 3 months (HR 0.83, 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.07, P = 0.155). The two studies with a total of 893 patients were available for analysis of 3 and 5-year biochemical disease-free survival. Pooling the data at 3 years (heterogeneity P = 0.87) resulted in an overall OR of 1.06, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.39, which was not statistically significant (P = 0.67) (comparison 4: outcome 1). At 5 years (heterogeneity P = 0.72) the overall OR of 0.91, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.24 and again was not statistically significant (P = 0.55) (comparison 4: outcome 2).</P>
<P>
<B>ADJUVANT HORMONAL THERAPY IN LOCALISED PROSTATE CANCER</B>
</P>
<P>There were a total of six randomised studies reporting adjuvant hormone therapy; three of them combined hormone therapy with prostatectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Messing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Messing 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirth-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLeod-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McLeod 2005</LINK>) and four with radiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Bolla-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bolla 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zagars-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Zagars 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 2005</LINK>). (Note: The <LINK REF="STD-McLeod-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McLeod 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 2005</LINK> reports were the same study, The Early Prostate Cancer Programme. However, data on adjuvant therapy with prostatectomy were extracted from the <LINK REF="STD-McLeod-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McLeod 2005</LINK> paper, and data for adjuvant therapy with radiotherapy were extracted from both papers). The prostatectomy studies used different hormonal treatments; <LINK REF="STD-Wirth-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 2004a</LINK> used an anti-androgen, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Messing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Messing 1999</LINK> used either an LHRH analogue or bilateral orchidectomy. The largest of the adjuvant studies is the Early Prostate Cancer Programme (<LINK REF="STD-McLeod-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McLeod 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 2005</LINK>), which used adjuvant bicalutamide or placebo in addition to standard therapy and included surgery, radiotherapy and watchful waiting. An important difference between trials was that while the <LINK REF="STD-Messing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Messing 1999</LINK> study included T1, T2 and node positive patients, the <LINK REF="STD-Wirth-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 2004a</LINK> study included pT3 and pT4 (only 2 pT4) node-negative patients. Similarly in the radiotherapy studies, different drugs were used which also differed in the timing of treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Zagars-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Zagars 1988</LINK> used adjuvant estrogen beginning at completion of radiotherapy, whereas the other two trials used an LHRH analogue. <LINK REF="STD-Bolla-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bolla 2002</LINK> started adjuvant hormones at the beginning of radiotherapy whilst <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2005</LINK> started adjuvant hormones during the last week of radiation therapy.</P>

<I>Overall survival<BR/>

<BR/>The three randomised studies evaluated overall survival and included a total of 4861 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Messing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Messing 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirth-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLeod-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McLeod 2005</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Messing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Messing 1999</LINK> study reported a median follow up of 7.1 years and showed that overall survival was better in the immediate hormonal treatment arm compared to the control arm (7 out of 47 deaths compared to 18 of 51 in the observation arm, P = 0.02). On the other hand the <LINK REF="STD-Wirth-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 2004a</LINK> data showed after a median follow up of 6.1 years no significant improvement in overall survival in the hormonal arm compared to surgery only arm (P = 0.92). The bicalutamide study, <LINK REF="STD-McLeod-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McLeod 2005</LINK>, included 4454 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, and reported no improvement in overall survival in both the local (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.26) or the locally advanced (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.39, P = 0.51) subgroups. This study, however, could not be included in the meta-analysis, as the number of events for the treatment and control arms was not reported, rather the total number of events was given and the overall results expressed as hazard ratios.<BR/>The pooled data for five years for the other two studies was not significantly heterogeneous (P = 0.35) yielding an overall OR 1.50 95% CI 0.79 to 2.84 that was not statistically significant, although there was a trend favouring adjuvant hormonal therapy (comparison 5: outcome 1). Similarly, there was no survival advantage at 10 years with adjuvant hormone therapy following prostatectomy (comparison 5: outcome 2).</P>
<P>
<I>Disease-specific survival</I>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Messing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Messing 1999</LINK> reported that at a median follow up of 7.3 years, there was a statistically significant improvement in disease specific survival in favour of the addition of adjuvant hormones with radiotherapy (P = 0.001).</P>
<P>
<I>Disease-free survival</I>
</P>
<P>Three studies with a total of 486 patients were evaluated for disease-free survival (<LINK REF="STD-Messing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Messing 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wirth-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLeod-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McLeod 2005</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Messing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Messing 1999</LINK> data indicated a significant improvement in disease-free survival with adjuvant hormone therapy (P &lt; 0.001). The <LINK REF="STD-Wirth-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 2004a</LINK> study also reported a significant improvement in disease-free survival in the hormonal arm after median follow up of 7.1 years (P = 0.0041). The Early Prostate Cancer Programme (<LINK REF="STD-McLeod-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McLeod 2005</LINK>) reported an improvement in progression-free survival after a median of 7.4 years (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.91, P = 0.004). This result was for a combined group of local and locally advanced patients and was highly influenced by the much better response observed in patients with locally advanced disease. However, this study could not be pooled with the other two because the number of events in the two arms has not been published separately (personal communication with the author to provide these data; awaiting response). Therefore, combining these data for the two remaining studies (heterogeneity P = 0.11) gave an overall OR of 3.73 (95% CI 2.30 to 6.03). The overall effect estimate was highly statistically significant (P &lt; 0.00001) in favour of the hormonal arm (comparison 5: outcome 3). The improvement in disease-free survival extended to 10 years with a similar high statistical significance (P = 0.0009) (comparison 5: outcome 4).<BR/>

<P>Four studies evaluated adjuvant hormones following radiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Bolla-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bolla 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zagars-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Zagars 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLeod-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McLeod 2005</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Bolla-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bolla 2002</LINK> study recruited patients with T1 - T2 tumours of WHO histological grade 3 or T3 and T4N0M0 disease and given adjuvant hormones for a period of 3 years. The <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2005</LINK> RTOG 85-31 trial included patients with lymph node positive disease of all T stages or T3 disease irrespective of lymph node status. Adjuvant hormones were initiated in the last week of radiation therapy and continued indefinitely or until signs of disease progression. The <LINK REF="STD-Zagars-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Zagars 1988</LINK> study recruited patients with stage C (T3 and T4) disease, although bone scans were not performed to exclude metastatic disease.</P>

The <LINK REF="STD-Bolla-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bolla 2002</LINK> study reported a significant improvement in 5-year overall survival of 78% versus 62% (P = 0.0002) for the combined therapy and radiotherapy arms, respectively. <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2005</LINK> reported the 5 and 9-year absolute survival rates as 72% and 62% for those receiving adjuvant treatment and 50% and 38% for those not receiving adjuvant therapy, respectively (P = 0.23). The <LINK REF="STD-Zagars-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Zagars 1988</LINK> study also showed no significant gain in overall survival rates at 5, 10 and 15 years for the adjuvant oestrogen arm (68%, 42% and 25% for the combined arm and 73%, 53% and 33% for the radiotherapy arm alone, P = 0.58). After a median follow up of 7.4 years, the use of adjuvant bicalutamide resulted in a significant improvement in overall survival for the locally advanced patients (HR 0.65, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.84, P = 0.03), but not for the overall population undergoing radiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-McLeod-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McLeod 2005</LINK>). From these four studies, a total of 2844 patients were included in the pooled analysis and survival data were analysed at 5 and 10 years. At both 5 years (comparison 6: outcome 1) and 10 years (comparison 6: outcome 2), the test for overall effect was significantly in favour of adjuvant hormones (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.56, P = 0.007 for 5 years and OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.84, P = 0.003 for 10 years).

<P>
<I>Disease-specific survival</I>

<P>Three studies, including a total of 1392 patients, were pooled for disease-specific survival (<LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bolla-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bolla 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLeod-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McLeod 2005</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Bolla-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bolla 2002</LINK> study reported 5-year disease-specific survival significantly in favour of the adjuvant hormonal arm (94% versus 79%, P = 0.0001). However, the <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2005</LINK> study did not report a significant benefit of adjuvant hormones in terms of disease-specific survival between groups (16% and 22% for the adjuvant and control arms, respectively, at 12 years from randomisation) The EPCP reported that there were fewer deaths in those patients receiving bicalutamide (16.1% versus 24.3%) compared to the standard treatment alone, although this was only evident in patients with locally advanced disease (<LINK REF="STD-McLeod-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McLeod 2005</LINK>). No data were extractable for the whole patient population receiving radiotherapy in this study. On pooling the data for the other two studies, the overall treatment effect was significantly in favour of adjuvant therapy (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.88, P &lt; 0.00001); however, significant heterogeneity was evident (P = 0.01) (comparison 6: outcome 3).</P>
<P>
<I>Disease-free survival</I>

<P>Four studies provided data on disease-free survival for adjuvant hormones with radiotherapy, and included a total of 1474 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Bolla-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bolla 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zagars-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Zagars 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLeod-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McLeod 2005</LINK>). One study reported a 5-year clinical disease-free survival of 74% in the combined treatment group which was significantly better than the 40% in the RT only group (P = 0.0001) (<LINK REF="STD-Bolla-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bolla 2002</LINK>). With a median follow up of 6.5 years for all patients and 9.5 years for living patients, <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2005</LINK> reported a significant improvement in disease-free survival at 5 and 9 years in the adjuvant treatment group compared to RT alone (54% and 10%, respectively versus 33% and 4% P &lt; 0.0001). Additionally, there was a significant improvement in disease-free survival at 5, 10 and 15 years in favour of the adjuvant oestrogen arm (71%, 63% and 63% versus 49%, 43% and 35% for the radiotherapy arm alone, P = 0.008) (<LINK REF="STD-Zagars-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Zagars 1988</LINK>). The EPCP reporting after a follow up of 7.4 years, showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival for the bicalutamide group for patients with locally advanced disease (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.91, P = 0.04) (<LINK REF="STD-McLeod-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McLeod 2005</LINK>). At 5 years the results of four studies with a total of 2844 patients were pooled. The overall OR of 0.91 (95% CI 1.1.6 to 2.23) was significantly in favour of treatment (P &lt; 0.0001) though there was heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.0001). Pooling the 10-year survival data available for two studies with a total of 1059 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Zagars-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Zagars 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2005</LINK>) (heterogeneity P = 0.69) gave an overall OR of 1.96 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.56) and was highly statistically significant (P &lt; 0.00001) in favour of the treatment arm (comparison 6: outcome 4).</P>
<P>
<I>Disease recurrence<BR/>

<BR/>A significant improvement was reported for loco-regional failure (16.4% versus 1.7%, P &lt; 0.0001) and in the incidence of distant metastasis (29.2% versus 9.8%, P &lt; 0.0001), in favour of adjuvant hormone therapy plus radiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Bolla-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bolla 2002</LINK>). Similarly, biochemical control rates at both 5 and 9 years were significantly better for the combined treatment group (54% and 10% versus 33% and 4%, P &lt; 0.0001) (<LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2005</LINK>).

<P>
<B>Side effects/ toxicity of hormonal treatment</B>
</P>
<P>Four studies reporting on neo-adjuvant therapy with prostatectomy gave information on adverse events, but it was not possible to pool the data as specific numbers of patients in the individual arms of the each study were not available (<LINK REF="STD-Klotz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prezioso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prezioso 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soloway-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Soloway 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gleave-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gleave 2001</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Prezioso-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prezioso 2004</LINK> study suggested an increase in adverse events in the neo-adjuvant treatment arm compared to control (17 in the hormonal arm and 5 in the control arm), with the main adverse event being hot flushes. There were two deaths in the hormonal arm, one due to myocardial infarction and the other was of unknown cause. There was no difference in the incidence of deep vein thrombosis between study arms in the <LINK REF="STD-Klotz-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 2003</LINK> study (P = 0.263), and one case per arm of pulmonary embolism; the case in the hormonal arm being the only fatality in the entire study. The most common adverse events in the 101 patients receiving the hormonal treatment were asthenia (n = 24), dyspnoea on exertion (n = 16), hot flushes (n = 10) and depression (n = 7). The frequency of adverse events in the 147 patients receiving neo-adjuvant hormones in the <LINK REF="STD-Soloway-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Soloway 2002</LINK> study were hot flushes (25%), diarrhoea (14%), nausea with or without vomiting (6%) and abnormalities in liver function tests (5%). There were five withdrawals from the androgen deprivation group due to abdominal pain in two, ECG changes in one, angina in one, and myocardial infarction in one.</P>
<P>The fourth study, comparing 3 versus 8 months of neo-adjuvant therapy prior to prostatectomy, reported no fatal adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Gleave-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gleave 2001</LINK>). In addition, there were no differences between the two patient groups in the severity or the causality of the adverse events (P = 0.287 and P = 0.0564, respectively), or for the incidence of increased liver enzymes or diarrhoea (P = 0.691 and P = 0.288, respectively). However, more men in the 8-month treatment group reported new adverse events (4.5 versus 2.9, P &lt; 0.0001) and a higher proportion of hot flushes (87% versus 72%, respectively, P &lt; 0.0001).</P>
<P>Three studies on neo-adjuvant hormone therapy and radiotherapy presented data on adverse events, but again it was not possible to combine these in a meta-analysis due to the lack of extractable data (<LINK REF="STD-Fellows-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fellows 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2003</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Fellows-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fellows 1992</LINK> study, 16% (31 patients) had side effects attributable to hormones with the main adverse event being hot flushes. The <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2001</LINK> study provided hormone compliance information. Ninety-four per cent of 225 patients completed goserelin, of whom 188 (84%) completed flutamide as well. The reasons for terminating flutamide in 23 patients included diarrhoea in 11 patients, hot flushes in three patients and miscellaneous problems such as liver function abnormalities, rash, and nausea in the remaining patients. The <LINK REF="STD-Lamb-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lamb 2003</LINK> study was an acceptability or quality-of-life study in patients receiving maximal androgen blockade in the <LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK> study of 0, 3 or 6 months of neo-adjuvant hormones prior to and concurrent with radiotherapy. This study reported that while nearly all patients completed therapy with goserelin, 27% in the 6-month hormonal arm and 20% in the 3-month arm had to stop flutamide early. This was due to liver function abnormality (17%) and bowel side effects (18%). In addition, of the 36% of patients who were sexually active prior to any therapy, all became inactive whilst on maximal androgen blockade. However, at 12 months post radiotherapy, sexual function was identical in all three groups</P>
<P>It was not possible to pool data for side effects for the studies of adjuvant hormone therapy and prostatectomy as the individual group data were not available for the <LINK REF="STD-Wirth-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 2004a</LINK> dataset. Data from the <LINK REF="STD-Messing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Messing 1999</LINK> study suggested a statistically significant increase in grade 1 and 2 haematological, gastrointestinal, and non-specific, genitourinary side effects (incontinence, frequency and nocturia) and a highly significant increase in hot flushes. The <LINK REF="STD-Wirth-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Wirth 2004a</LINK> study concluded that documented discontinuation occurred twice as frequently in the study arm mainly attributed to adverse events but did not specify exact numbers of patients involved in both groups.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-06-06 09:33:08 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The hormone responsive nature of prostate cancer lends itself to effective treatment with agents that reduce the stimulation of the androgen receptor either by blocking the androgen receptor (mechanism of action of anti-androgens, such as bicalutamide, nilutamide and cyproterone acetate) or by decreasing the levels of circulating male sex hormones (action of the LHRH analogues, such as goserelin and buserelin and orchidectomy). Neo-adjuvant hormones are given to downstage the disease prior to surgical resection of the prostate and to augment cell kill with radiotherapy, though the biological mechanism is uncertain. Several trials included in this review have evaluated these agents both in the adjuvant and neo-adjuvant settings and in relation to radiotherapy and prostatectomy in low risk, intermediate risk and high risk disease. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to pool the results of all the available evidence to assess the full impact of the use of these agents with primary therapy.</P>
<P>In this review intention-to-treat analysis was used to minimise attrition bias, and quality assessment was performed to evaluate internal and external validity of the included studies. However, each of them has its own limitations. Intention-to-treat principle could not be followed if the original studies did not report the number of patients randomised to each treatment group. There is no consensus on the method of quality assessment and the extent to which it should be applied to meta-analyses. It has been shown that the majority of meta-analyses do not incorporate quality assessment as part of the method (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>). In the present review, included studies were assessed for quality using published methods. All included trials were considered to be of sufficient quality to be used for the assessment of neo-adjuvant and adjuvant hormone therapy combined with prostatectomy or radiotherapy. The trials included in this review also enrolled clinically appropriate patients, with the surgical series having a younger median age compared to those treated with radiotherapy. All patients were eligible for definitive therapy, provided they had non-metastatic prostate cancer as assessed by imaging such as bone scans, CT scans, and in the older trials, by chest X-rays and lymph-node mapping. The included studies also reported the primary outcomes of overall and disease-specific survival, and secondary outcomes of disease-free survival, both clinical and biochemical. In addition, the neo-adjuvant surgical series assessed pathological outcomes such as positive surgical margin rates, organ confined rates, pathological downstaging and lymph-node status.</P>
<P>When considering the results of this systematic review, it is important to note inter-trial differences that may contribute to the observed heterogeneity of the results in some cases. These relate to variations of the specific hormonal treatments in the different studies, the duration of adjuvant treatment and timing of treatment with some radiotherapy studies using concurrent hormonal therapy and some studies where hormonal therapy and radiotherapy were not administered concurrently. In addition, there are differences in the baseline population demographics in relation to the disease stage and variation in radiotherapy techniques. There were baseline differences in PSA levels across studies with some studies applying strict criteria on the upper limit of PSA and whilst others having no such restrictions. There are also important differences between trials in the definitions of biochemical disease recurrence, that is PSA progression and variations in the TNM staging system used, as discussed in the results section. Some studies also used the Jewett system to stage their patients. These factors may have contributed to the lack of homogeneity of some studies included in the meta-analysis and will be referred to in the following sections. One widely accepted definition of risk groups is as follows: 'low risk' patients are those with stage T1 to T2a, Gleason score 2 to 6 and PSA &lt; 10; 'intermediate risk' are those with T2b to T3a, Gleason score 7 and PSA 10 to 20; and the 'high risk' group defined as those with &gt; stage T3a, Gleason score &gt; 7 and PSA &gt; 20. These definitions have been used to describe the patient populations in the included studies.</P>
<P>The individual studies of neo-adjuvant hormones and prostatectomy did not show any gain in overall survival, which was confirmed in the meta-analysis. However, neo-adjuvant therapy before prostatectomy led to a significant improvement in positive surgical margin rates, a reduction of positive lymph node involvement, an increase in organ confined rates and pathological downstaging. Although these latter outcomes were of secondary importance to overall survival, the significant benefit achieved with these pathological variables suggests that neo-adjuvant therapy may be useful in attaining local control in non-metastatic prostate cancer. However, seminal vesicle invasion rate, another important parameter of disease invasion, was not affected by neo-adjuvant therapy. Also, there was no significant benefit in disease-free survival, which may suggest that the pathological variables, such as positive margin status, may be a short-term indication of the effectiveness of neo-adjuvant therapy prior to prostatectomy. The discrepancy between disease-free survival and these pathological variables could be due to a number of factors, such as the difficulty in assessing cell architecture for margin status following hormone therapy, the inability of some trials to detect disease progression due to low statistical power, too short a follow-up period, or the inclusion of too many 'low risk' group men in some trials (<LINK REF="REF-Meng-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meng 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is some evidence to indicate that a longer duration of neo-adjuvant therapy prior to radical prostatectomy could provide greater surgical downstaging, with one study, <LINK REF="STD-Gleave-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gleave 2001</LINK>, showing a significant improvement with 8-month neo-adjuvant therapy compared to 3 months. The two studies comparing 3 versus 6 months of neo-adjuvant therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Selli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Selli 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Der-Kwast-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Der Kwast 1999</LINK>) showed a trend towards an improvement in positive surgical margin rates with 6 month therapy. A meta-analysis of evaluable cases of the three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gleave-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gleave 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Selli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Selli 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Der-Kwast-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Van Der Kwast 1999</LINK>) again showed a significant improvement in the positive surgical margin rates in favour of the longer duration treatment (6 or 8 months). The studies examining the effect of different durations of neo-adjuvant hormone therapy did not report survival data. Only one study, <LINK REF="STD-Gleave-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gleave 2001</LINK>, reported a significant increase in incidence of both hot flushes and newly reported adverse events for the longer durations of neo-adjuvant therapy.</P>
<P>The one study reporting neo-adjuvant hormone therapy with radiotherapy did not find a significant improvement in overall survival for the whole patient population studied (<LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2001</LINK>). However, the hormone therapy induced a significant survival benefit in patients with Gleason 2 to 6, and suggests that a short duration of neo-adjuvant hormone treatment should be considered for these patients. There were two other trials that investigated neo-adjuvant treatment with radiotherapy and reported overall survival data; however, they used orchidectomy as the method of hormone manipulation which implies permanent androgen deprivation and were, therefore, not considered neo-adjuvant (<LINK REF="STD-Fellows-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fellows 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Granfors-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Granfors 1998</LINK>). Hormone treatment before radiotherapy also significantly improved clinical and biochemical disease-free survival, although in the latter heterogeneity was observed on pooling, which may possibly relate to differences in hormone sequencing, variations in the patient populations and definitions of biochemical recurrence. (The <LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK> study assessed biochemical failure by the Houston method, which is an increase in PSA of at least 2 ng/mL above the post-treatment nadir measure, defined as the last non-rising measure. The <LINK REF="STD-Laverdiere-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Laverdiere 2004</LINK> study defined PSA failure according to the Vancouver rules, that is two consecutive increases with at least 1 of 1.5 ng/mL or greater. The <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2001</LINK> study reported on biochemical disease free survival as those with PSA &lt; 1.5 and &lt; 4 ng/mL). Disease-free survival may or may not be a surrogate maker of overall survival. However, the benefit attained with neo-adjuvant therapy with radiotherapy provides a significant enhancement of loco-regional control in patients with intermediate to high-risk disease. Six months of neo-adjuvant treatment may be more effective in reducing deaths from prostate cancer and providing local control compared to three months of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Denham-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Denham 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>This systematic review showed that for patients undergoing prostatectomy as primary therapy, the addition of adjuvant hormones did not improve overall survival. The pooled data for the meta-analysis, however, only combined two trials, one of which reported a significant overall survival benefit with adjuvant hormone therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Messing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Messing 1999</LINK>). Adjuvant hormone therapy also showed a significant improvement in disease-specific survival (<LINK REF="STD-Messing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Messing 1999</LINK>), and resulted in a significant improvement in disease-free survival at 5 years, which persisted until 10 years following prostatectomy. The included studies were on patients with intermediate to high-risk disease and these clinical benefits need to be weighed against treatment costs, adverse events and possible quality-of-life differences.</P>
<P>The addition of adjuvant hormones with radiotherapy resulted in a significant improvement in overall survival, disease-specific survival and disease-free survival at 10 years. However, due to heterogeneity, caution should be exercised when considering the pooled estimate of the overall and disease-specific survival data. The heterogeneity in the four studies presenting these data (<LINK REF="STD-Bolla-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bolla 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zagars-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Zagars 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 2005</LINK>) may possibly be due to differences in treatment schedule and method of androgen deprivation. <LINK REF="STD-Zagars-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Zagars 1988</LINK> used oestrogens initially at doses much higher than currently acceptable and did not exclude bone disease by means of bone scan. <LINK REF="STD-Bolla-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bolla 2002</LINK> started total androgen deprivation hormones therapy at the commencement of radiotherapy and continued for 3 years, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2005</LINK> initiated goserelin hormone therapy in the last week of radiotherapy and continued indefinitely. Three studies included moderate to high-risk patients, that is T3 and T4, T1 and T2 with grade 3 or lymph node positive patients (<LINK REF="STD-Bolla-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bolla 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pilepich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pilepich 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zagars-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Zagars 1988</LINK>). In addition, the majority of patients in the EPCP study (<LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 2005</LINK>) had localised disease, but the overall survival benefit was restricted to patients with locally advanced disease. Longer follow-up times may be required to establish a survival advantage in lower risk patients as the number of survival events is fewer and slower in this patient group. <B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>One of the limitations of this review is that most of the studies did not prospectively perform sub-group analysis. This would have enabled analysis of the results by risk groups, thus further allowing physicians and patients to make optimum treatment decisions. Baseline demographic data does, however, provide some information, but this was often insufficient, as the older studies did not stratify patients or give precise estimates on the effectiveness of hormone therapy based on these prognostic subgroups. This review outlined the subgroups for the majority of patient in individual studies for the different categories of treatments (radiotherapy and surgical series and neo-adjuvant versus adjuvant androgen deprivation), fully recognising that this is an imprecise method as most studies had patients of all risk groups. Describing the studies this way does reveal that the majority of patients in the radiotherapy series were in the intermediate and high-risk groups and conversely, patient demographics in the surgical series indicate them to be in the early T1 and T2 stages with low and intermediate-risk grades and PSA scores. It is important that future neo-adjuvant and adjuvant trials in prostate cancer consider patient stratification and data analysis according to risk so that useful clinical information is not missed.</P>
<P>There is now an increasing body of evidence to suggest that hormonal therapy, particularly in the radiotherapy series, is cost effective. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial, protocol 86-10, which evaluated the addition of neo-adjuvant total androgen suppression 2 months before and during radiotherapy, has been subjected to an economic analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Konski-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konski 2005</LINK>). The authors used a Markov model, which models ongoing risk, and Monte Carlo simulations to generate survival distributions. The mean cost for radiotherapy alone was $29,240 associated with an effectiveness of 5.48 quality adjusted life years (QALYs). This compared to radiotherapy plus total androgen suppression of $31,286 and 6.43 QALY. The analysis implied that hormone therapy had a &gt; 80% probability that it was cost-effective. In the adjuvant setting, a cost-analysis of trial RTOG 92-02 of the use of 2 years of androgen suppression with radiotherapy after neo-adjuvant hormonal cytoreduction, treatment was cost effective (90% probability) with gains in QALY (4.13 versus 3.68) (<LINK REF="REF-Konski-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konski 2006</LINK>). Similarly the <LINK REF="STD-Bolla-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bolla 2002</LINK> study has also been subjected to a cost analysis and reported the use of 3 years of adjuvant goserelin has been shown to improve overall survival at an acceptable cost (<LINK REF="REF-Samant-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samant 2003</LINK>). These findings in addition to the wealth of evidence in the metastatic disease setting, suggests that hormonal deprivation therapy used long-term has potential cost benefits.<BR/>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In patients with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer, the use of neo-adjuvant and adjuvant hormone therapies combined with both prostatectomy and radiotherapy, are undoubtedly associated with important clinical benefits. There is a survival advantage with adjuvant hormone therapy combined with radiotherapy in moderate to high risk disease, and an indication of an improvement in disease-specific survival when adjuvant to prostatectomy, and for neo-adjuvant therapy plus radiotherapy in Gleason 2 to 6 patients. Local control is achieved with all therapeutic options which may lead to an improvement in the patients' quality of life. For example, using neo-adjuvant hormone therapy with prostatectomy significantly improved pathological variables (positive surgical margin rates, organ confined rates, downstaging and positive pelvic lymph node rates). In addition, disease-free survival was significantly improved with neo-adjuvant therapy plus radiotherapy, and with adjuvant therapy combined with either primary treatments of radiotherapy or prostatectomy. However, hormone therapy is associated with common, and at times, significant acute and long-term complications such as vasomotor symptoms, impotence, and impairment of cognitive function and increase the risk of osteoporosis. Additionally, hormone therapy will incur cost implications. Therefore, the decision to use neo-adjuvant and adjuvant hormone therapy must be a local one between the patient and clinician (and possibly the policy maker) based on the potential clinical benefits, side effects and cost. The available evidence suggests that the use of long-term hormonal deprivation is a reasonably cost effective method of treatment with gains in QALY scores.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The majority of trials reporting survival data for hormone therapy combined with prostatectomy or radiotherapy, and consequently the number of patients recruited, were small and additional studies are required to confirm the current findings. Future studies should be conducted with primary outcomes of overall and disease-specific survival, disease progression, adverse effects (including long-term consequences of prolonged androgen deprivation) and quality of life. These studies should ideally stratify report outcomes by age, race and tumour risk groups (PSA, histological grade, tumour stage), as the EPCP study has done. </P>
<P>Additional questions remain about whether to use an LHRH analogue as a single agent or to use combined androgen blockade. In addition, the optimal schedule and duration of treatment continues to be the subject of further trials. Another important area of ongoing clinical research is to identify the role of these agents in the brachytherapy setting and IMRT, as well as its role following post-surgical adjuvant radiotherapy. This review, for the sake of clarity, has only included studies looking at either adjuvant or neo-adjuvant therapy, and not where both treatments methods are used in the same patient. Further studies are required to investigate the application of hormone therapy given as both neo-adjuvant and adjuvant treatments and it's incorporation with chemotherapy in early disease. More information is also needed to evaluate these agents in terms of side effects and quality of life, which are lacking in the majority of studies presented in this review. Further cost analyses should be undertaken, in addition to those already published, so that contemporary data are available.</P>
