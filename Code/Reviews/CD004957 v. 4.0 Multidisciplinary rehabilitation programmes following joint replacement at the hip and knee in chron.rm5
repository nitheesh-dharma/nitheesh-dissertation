<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-07 12:32:46 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Total hip and knee joint replacement (THJR, TKJR) procedures are now commonplace, and have become treatments of choice for people with intractable joint pain and disability due to chronic arthropathy who fail conservative management (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2000</LINK>). In 2004, the reported rates (per 100,000 population) for primary hip joint replacement procedures for Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States of America, ranged from 70-150 (primary) and 9-22 (revision), whilst the rates for knee replacement ranged from 62-143 (primary) and 8-13 (revision) (<LINK REF="REF-CJRR-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CJRR 2006</LINK>). These procedures are usually successful, with &lt; 1% failure rate per year (<LINK REF="REF-Monte-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monte 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tankersley-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tankersley 1997</LINK>). When revision surgery is needed, this is usually because of prosthetic loosening, lysis and component wear and tear.</P>
<P>The joint replacement procedures may be undertaken in a number of contexts, including:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>acute injury e.g. fractured neck of femur; </LI>
<LI>chronic arthropathy affecting just one joint or multiple joints, which may be secondary to a variety of conditions including arthritis (degenerative or inflammatory), abnormal development (eg congenital hip dysplasia), or following slipped femoral epiphysis and avascular necrosis.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>For the purposes of this review, we were interested in joint replacement only in the context of chronic arthropathy. </P>
<P>The World Health Organization has developed an International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>) which replaces its earlier classification of Impairment, Disability and Handicap (ICIDH) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1980</LINK>). The ICF defines a common language for describing the impact of disease at different levels.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>'Impairments' are problems with body (anatomical) structures or (physiological) function - the symptoms and signs of disease such as paresis, pain, etc.</LI>
<LI>'Activity limitation' (previously 'disability', <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1980</LINK>) describes the difficulties that a person may have in executing everyday tasks such as self-care.</LI>
<LI>'Restriction in participation' (previously 'handicap', <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1980</LINK>) relates to problems experienced by a person with involvement in societal participation and life situations such as employment or social activities.</LI>
<LI>'Contextual factors' include: </LI>
</UL>
<P>a) 'environmental' factors which make up the physical, social and attitudinal environment in which people live their lives; <BR/>b) 'personal factors' such as gender, race, self-efficacy, coping style, social and educational background, which may affect the person's experience of living with their condition.</P>
<P>Whilst the contextual factors are an important component of the ICF, they are generally not reported in the studies included in this review, as the ICF is predated by most of these trials. Therefore, they will not be addressed further. We have classified outcomes by impairment/disability and participation.</P>
<P>In the context of chronic arthropathy, the person undergoing joint replacement will typically be relieved of the major disabling factor in their life. However, to maximise the benefits of joint replacement, they may require rehabilitation in order to:<BR/>a) prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1998</LINK>) and dislocation (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2000</LINK>); <BR/>b) regain strength and fitness which may have deteriorated as a result of deconditioning and prolonged immobility; and<BR/>c) capitalise on their newfound mobility to regain independence and participation in society.</P>
<P>For many people, especially those with single joint pathology, unidisciplinary interventions (for example physiotherapy alone) may be all that is required. However a multidisciplinary, team-based approach (for example medical, nursing, physiotherapy and occupational therapy) may be required for those with more complex problems (such as multiple joint involvement or co-morbidities, prolonged surgery, post-operative complications); and also for those who are elderly and frail, cognitively impaired or socially isolated. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation will typically start during the inpatient admission, but continuation into the community/home setting may be required in order to address environmental and community integration issues. In Australia, elderly patients with multiple risk factors (such as age, co-morbidities, social set up) are referred for inpatient rehabilitation directly from the acute hospital. Alternative arrangements for medically stable patients can include ambulatory programmes (rehabilitation in the home programme, centre-based therapies), provided the environmental set-up is satisfactory. Practices may vary in different countries.</P>
<P>Other Cochrane reviews have addressed the effects of unidisciplinary therapy and limited interventions following hip or knee joint replacement, including:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>preoperative education<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2004</LINK>); and</LI>
<LI>continuous passive movement (CPM) (<LINK REF="REF-Milne-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milne 2003</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>However, the evidence base for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation in people with hip or knee joint replacement is not yet established. As the pressure on health systems increases, affordable and appropriate healthcare planning is essential, and the use of more expensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation needs to be justified. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>We assessed the evidence for effectiveness of organised multidisciplinary rehabilitation in adults (aged 18 years and above) following hip or knee joint replacement surgery. Specific questions addressed by this review are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Does organised multidisciplinary rehabilitation achieve better outcomes than the absence of such services in people following hip or knee joint replacement? </LI>
<LI>Which models of programmes are effective and in which setting? </LI>
<LI>Which participants benefit most?</LI>
<LI>Which specific outcomes are influenced (eg, activity, participation and quality of life)? </LI>
<LI>Does a greater intensity (time or expertise, or both) of multidisciplinary rehabilitation lead to greater gains? </LI>
<LI>Are there demonstrable cost benefits for multidisciplinary rehabilitation in hip or knee joint replacement? </LI>
</UL>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-11-07 12:32:46 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included all RCTs that applied multidisciplinary rehabilitation following hip or knee joint replacement, providing that they compared the named intervention with some form of control condition. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included trials if the participants were above 18 years of age and had undergone hip and/or knee joint replacement surgery for chronic arthropathy, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, dysplastic or osteochondrotic disease. </P>
<P>Joint replacement procedures included:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>both total and hemi-arthroplasty;</LI>
<LI>primary (first time) joint replacement; </LI>
<LI>secondary (repeat) replacements;</LI>
<LI>all types of prosthesis (metal, ceramic, hybrid). </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>We excluded surgical procedures for acute hip fracture, such as operative fixation (e.g. pins), from this review.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>
<B>
<BR/>Experimental intervention</B>
<BR/>For the purpose of this review, 'multidisciplinary rehabilitation' was defined as a rehabilitation programme delivered by two or more disciplines, and targeted towards improvement at the levels of activity or participation, or both. Rehabilitation programmes could include elements of medical, nursing, physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), psychology and counselling, social work (SW), dietetics, orthotics, recreation and vocational therapy. </P>
<P>We identified various aspects of multidisciplinary rehabilitation as follows.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The 'timing' of multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention, such as 'early' input (24-48 hours post surgery) versus 'late' multidisciplinary treatment (&gt; 48 hours after surgery).</LI>
<LI>The setting of rehabilitation programmes, including:</LI>
</UL>
<P>a) inpatient rehabilitation settings that provide 24-hour care, such as a specialist medical rehabilitation unit or a hospital ward unit (eg, general surgical units, orthopaedic units);<BR/>b) outpatient or day treatment settings, located within the hospital, a community centre/day centre or a specialist rehabilitation environment; <BR/>c) home-based setting in the persons' own home and local community. <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The use of critical pathways (pre-determined structured programmes for participants' recovery during the hospital stay) in joint replacement surgery compared with no pathways, routine care or both.</LI>
<LI>The use of pain management strategies compared with routine care. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>We excluded studies assessing the effect of the following. <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Therapy from a single discipline (physiotherapy), including studies on therapeutic modalities. </LI>
<LI>Programmes that included complementary medicine (yoga, meditation) in the absence of rehabilitation. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>Control intervention</B>
<BR/>For the purpose of this review, we considered the following control conditions. <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>A lower level or different type of intervention, such as 'routinely available local services' or minimal intervention such as 'information only' or 'single session treatment'. </LI>
<LI>Equivalent interventions given in different settings, such as inpatient versus community rehabilitation. </LI>
<LI>Wait list conditions. </LI>
</UL>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>We were interested in the outcomes that reflect the burden of disabling disease on participants, their families and the services that provide for them. We classified the various outcome measures used in the selected studies in this review, based on the ICF (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>). We looked at evidence of improvement at the different levels. </P>
<UL>
<LI>'Impairments' (eg, joint range of motion and muscle weakness). </LI>
<LI>'Activity limitation' (eg, mobility, transfer skills, independence in activities of daily living).</LI>
<LI>'Restriction in participation' (eg, extended activities of daily living, societal re-integration or quality of life).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>The primary outcomes in this review include limitation in impairment and activity/function and secondary outcomes are limitation in participation. 'Other' outcomes for this review include cost of episode of care, length of stay, service utilisation, readmission, mortality rates and carer burden/strain. We also planned to study any adverse effects reported from rehabilitation intervention.</P>
<P>Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> lists the various outcome instruments used, classified under the ICF categories. We also classified outcome measures into those that reflect benefit (improvements in health) and harm (adverse effects on health). It should be noted, however, that some validated measurement scales cross over the boundaries between the concepts of impairment, disability and participation (especially where they predate the publication of the WHO ICF). This occurs especially between the categories of impairment and disability. For example, the Harris Hip Score includes items relating both to impairment and symptoms as well as activity. Therefore, the outcome measures reported at these levels will be grouped together.</P>
<P>Impairment alone is almost never the primary target for multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Instead the focus is on minimising disability and maximising participation. Therefore, studies that reported outcomes only at the level of impairment were not included in this review. </P>
<P>We categorised studies according to length of follow up after baseline (the peri-operative period).<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>'Short term studies' - up to four months. </LI>
<LI>'Medium term studies' - up to six months. </LI>
<LI>'Long term studies' - up to 12 months. </LI>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-11-07 12:32:46 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We sought relevant RCTs in the following: Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, CINAHL, Australian Medical Index, UK NHS National Research Register and citation search using SCISEARCH. We performed all searches up to September 2006. In addition, we searched reference lists of other articles and books and conference proceedings and contacted significant researchers in the field. There were no language restrictions.</P>
<P>The search terms used for MEDLINE are in Appendix 1.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>
<BR/>Study selection </B>
<BR/>Four authors (FK, LN, SG, TH) independently screened all abstracts and titles of studies that were identified by the search strategy for inclusion and appropriateness, based on the selection criteria. Once all potentially appropriate studies had been obtained, the authors evaluated each study independently for inclusion. If necessary, we obtained further information to determine if the trial met the criteria. If no consensus was reached about the possible inclusion/exclusion of any individual study, arbitration was undertaken by the fifth author (LTS). Authors were not masked to the name(s) of the author(s), institution(s) or publication source at any level of the review. </P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction and management</B>
<BR/>Four authors (FK, LN, SG, TH) independently extracted the data from each study that met the inclusion criteria. If insufficient data were available, we then contacted study authors to provide data and clarification. If the data were unavailable or insufficient, the study was reported but not included in the final analysis. We have summarised all studies that met the inclusion criteria in the table 'Characteristics of included studies', including details on design, participants, interventions and outcomes. </P>
<P>
<B>Methodological quality assessment</B>
<BR/>The same authors (FK, LN, SG, TH) assessed the methodological quality of studies included in this review, with any disagreements regarding scoring resolved by consensus. </P>
<P>We undertook the quality appraisal of individual studies using the following methodological quality assessment criteria which incorporated two scales:<BR/>a) the three Jadad criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>): randomisation, double blinding and description of withdrawals and dropouts; and <BR/>b) four items on the criteria list recommended by the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group (CBJMTG) (<LINK REF="REF-Heintjies-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heintjies 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>The scoring system is listed in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. </P>
<P>The following criteria, as recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>) were then further selected to give an overall assessment of quality:<BR/>1) concealment of treatment allocation;<BR/>2) blinding of intervention provider, recipient and outcome assessor;<BR/>3) handling of withdrawals and dropouts.</P>
<P>We assessed studies as being of high or low methodological quality based on whether these criteria had been met. If one or more of the quality criteria were not met, or only partially met or unclear, we considered studies at moderate or high risk of bias, and therefore of low quality.</P>
<P>We also categorised trials on the basis of allocation concealment:<BR/>A: if allocation concealment was adequate; <BR/>B: if there was a small chance of disclosure of concealment or if unclear; <BR/>C: if concealment was inadequate; <BR/>D: if allocation concealment was not attempted or not used as a criterion to assess validity. </P>
<P>We undertook the grading of evidence using the method proposed by Tugwell at the request of the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group (CMSG) (<LINK REF="REF-Tugwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugwell 2004</LINK>)(see Additional <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>We undertook subgroup analysis using setting of rehabilitation intervention, as it provided the most useful information. We separated results for site of joint replacement (hip, knee and both hip and knee replacements). </P>
<P>We found the data to be too heterogenous to perform meta-analyses of all outcome measures. However, we have instead reported data of individual studies in separate forest plots where possible. The heterogeneity of data was further reflected in the clinical relevance tables (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-08" TYPE="TABLE">Table 8</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-09" TYPE="TABLE">Table 9</LINK>). </P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Electronic and manual searches identified 990 titles and abstracts. Of these, we selected 50 studies for closer scrutiny after the first screening review. A handsearch of these articles confirmed inclusion of only five based on the review criteria; we excluded eight studies (and abstracts) for the reasons documented in the table 'Characteristics of excluded studies'. </P>
<P>The main reasons for exclusion were as follows.</P>
<P>1) Multidisciplinary rehabilitation was involved, but was not the test variable (n = 6). Variables included the following limited interventions: <BR/>

</UL>
<P>
<BR/>3) Rehabilitation was unidisciplinary only (n = 37). </P>
<P>We included a total of five RCTs (one with two reports) in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Dowsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dowsey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Munin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shepperd-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shepperd 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siggeirsdottir-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Siggeirsdottir 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2003</LINK>). These studies were heterogeneous with respect to participant characteristics; indication for surgery; the type, duration and setting of multidisciplinary rehabilitation; follow-up duration and evaluation time points; outcome measures and measurement instruments. The methodological quality was also variable, but generally low. We have presented relevant information in the table 'Characteristics of included studies', and further details are provided in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>.</P>
<P>We found no studies addressing pain management or nutritional input after joint replacement surgery that fulfilled the review selection criteria. </P>
<P>The included studies were conducted in four different countries: one each in the UK, Iceland and Australia, and two in the USA. All trials had been published between 1998 and 2005, and were written in the English language. These trials involved a total of 619 participants. </P>
<P>Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dowsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dowsey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Munin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shepperd-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shepperd 1998</LINK>) were short-term studies with outcome points at three to four months from baseline, whilst two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Siggeirsdottir-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Siggeirsdottir 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2003</LINK>) were medium-term studies where participants were followed up for up to six months. No long-term studies were identified.</P>
<P>
<B>Participant characteristics</B>
<BR/>The participants of studies considered in this review included 619 persons (565 completers) with THJR and TKJR. We have presented relevant information in the table 'Characteristics of included studies'. </P>
<UL>
<LI>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dowsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dowsey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Munin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shepperd-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shepperd 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2003</LINK>) (569 participants) included both THJR and TKJR participants with a roughly equal numbers, although the participant breakdown in <LINK REF="STD-Dowsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dowsey 1999</LINK> was not provided.</LI>
<LI>The remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Siggeirsdottir-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Siggeirsdottir 2005</LINK>) (50 participants) included only THJR participants.</LI>
<LI>The indication for joint replacement was specified in only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Munin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Munin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siggeirsdottir-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Siggeirsdottir 2005</LINK>) and included osteoarthritis, which made up the largest proportion of participants, rheumatoid arthritis, primary segmental collapse of femoral head and trauma.</LI>

<B>Age and gender</B>
<BR/>In the two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dowsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dowsey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Munin 1998</LINK>) that compared different aspects of inpatient rehabilitation, mean age of participants ranged from 66 to 73.5 years and the percentage of women from 61% to 90%. </P>
<P>In the three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Shepperd-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shepperd 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siggeirsdottir-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Siggeirsdottir 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2003</LINK>) that compared home rehabilitation with standard hospital care or pre-existing home rehabilitation protocols, the mean participant ages ranged from 68 to 72 years. Just over half the participants were female (59%, 63% and 52% respectively). </P>
<P>
<B>Subject numbers</B>
<BR/>A large number of participants were excluded after randomisation: <LINK REF="STD-Dowsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dowsey 1999</LINK>, 12 out of 175 (7%); <LINK REF="STD-Munin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Munin 1998</LINK>, 15 out of 86 (17%); and <LINK REF="STD-Siggeirsdottir-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Siggeirsdottir 2005</LINK>, nine out of 59 (15%). There was discrepancy in the number of participants reported in the text and tables in <LINK REF="STD-Siggeirsdottir-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Siggeirsdottir 2005</LINK>, and unequal distribution of participant numbers in the intervention and control groups (n = 18 and 11) from one of the two recruiting hospitals. Further, only a small proportion of eligible participants actually participated in studies by <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2003</LINK> (136 out of 228 (60%)) and <LINK REF="STD-Siggeirsdottir-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Siggeirsdottir 2005</LINK> (50 out of 111 (45%)), due to a number of reasons including lack of consent and medical instability. </P>
<P>The five studies were grouped by setting into a) inpatient and b) home-based multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes. There were no trials addressing outpatient centre-based programmes. Where information was available, data were also separated for site of joint replacement.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The summary of key indicators for randomisation, concealed allocation, intention to treat and blinding of outcome assessor appears in the table 'Characteristics of included studies'. The methodological quality description of the five included studies is provided in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>. </P>
<P>We rated all studies as 'low quality' due to the absence of blinding. This included not only lack of participant/therapist blinding, but also outcome assessor blinding, which was of great concern. However, both inpatient trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dowsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dowsey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Munin 1998</LINK>) had adequate concealment of allocation and intention to treat was specified. In the trials relating to home-based rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Shepperd-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shepperd 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Siggeirsdottir-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Siggeirsdottir 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2003</LINK>), only <LINK REF="STD-Shepperd-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shepperd 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Siggeirsdottir-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Siggeirsdottir 2005</LINK> had adequate allocation concealment and only <LINK REF="STD-Shepperd-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shepperd 1998</LINK> specified intention to treat. Only two of the five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dowsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dowsey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shepperd-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shepperd 1998</LINK>) were powered to detect significant changes in outcomes, so there was a risk of type I and II errors.</P>
<P>Three studies also had significant deviations from their methodology protocol. <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Shepperd-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shepperd 1998</LINK>, 14/47 participants (30%) allocated to home care in the TKJR intervention group were unable to take this up, and stayed in hospital due to post-operative complications. </LI>
<LI>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Siggeirsdottir-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Siggeirsdottir 2005</LINK>, there was deviation from the original protocol where participants from another hospital were included due to major reorganisation within the original hospital.</LI>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>We have provided detailed descriptions of the results of individual included studies in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>. </P>
<P>We have described the assimilation of best evidence below for: <BR/>(a) inpatients; and <BR/>(b) home based setting.</P>
<P>None of the included studies addressed outpatient rehabilitation.</P>
<P>Pooling of data for quantitative analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity with respect to participant characteristics; indication for surgery; the type, duration and setting of multidisciplinary rehabilitation; follow-up duration and evaluation time points; outcome measures and measurement instruments. Instead, we conducted synthesis of best evidence using the <LINK REF="REF-Tugwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugwell 2004</LINK> grading system. Finally, quantification of the results of the between-group differences have been provided, where possible, in graphs 01.01-0.1.11, 02.01-02.03, 03.01-03.03 and 04.01-04.13. Between-group differences in the form of weighted mean difference (WMD) and numbers needed to treat to beneft (NNTB) have also been incorporated into the text of the results section where appropriate.</P>

<B>A) Effectiveness of aspects of inpatient multidisciplinary therapy versus control (conventional routine care) </B>
<BR/>Two trials of low quality addressing the efficacy of different aspects of inpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Dowsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dowsey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Munin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Munin 1998</LINK>) recruited a total of 261 participants. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Munin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Munin 1998</LINK>) specifically identified the type of participants which were elderly, frail patients with multiple co-morbidities. Pooling of data was confounded by the fact that the two studies examined different aspects of inpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation: <LINK REF="STD-Dowsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dowsey 1999</LINK> examined the effects of organised care, whilst <LINK REF="STD-Munin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Munin 1998</LINK> examined the effect of early rehabilitation at different time points (<LINK REF="STD-Dowsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dowsey 1999</LINK> three months; <LINK REF="STD-Munin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Munin 1998</LINK> four months). </P>

<LI>At the level of impairment/activity, there is 'silver' level (<LINK REF="REF-Tugwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugwell 2004</LINK>) evidence that early inpatient rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Munin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Munin 1998</LINK>) leads to more rapid attainment of functional milestones as measured by the FIM at day six to ten (although there were no significant differences in FSI at four months), and that organised rehabilitation via a clinical pathway (<LINK REF="STD-Dowsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dowsey 1999</LINK>) leads to earlier ambulation in the short term (three to four months). For FIM transfer, the WMD is 0.5 (95%CI 0.15, 0.85) whilst WMD for FIM ambulation is 1.55 (95%CI 0.96, 2.14) and WMD for FIM stairs is 0.85 (95% CI 0.40, 1.30) (graphs 01.01, 01.02, 01.03).

<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review investigated the effectiveness of organised multidisciplinary rehabilitation in adults following hip or knee joint replacement, based on measures of activities and participation in the ICF (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>), and also on utility and service costs. Because of heterogeneity in the studies identified, it was not possible to pool data statistically. Instead, we performed best evidence synthesis using a qualitative analysis. </P>
<P>In relation to our original objectives:<BR/>
<B>Does organised multidisciplinary rehabilitation achieve better outcomes than the absence of such services in people following hip or knee joint replacement? </B>
<BR/>We identified no studies that provided direct evidence that multidisciplinary rehabilitation following THJR/TKJR achieved better outcomes compared with no treatment. However multidisciplinary rehabilitation versus usual or routine treatment is addressed below.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Which models of programmes are effective and in which setting? Which participants benefit most and which specific outcomes are influenced? <BR/>
</B>We found evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation in both inpatient and home-based settings. There was 'silver' level evidence that early and/or organised inpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation (for all persons following hip or knee replacement, including those who were elderly and those with complex co-morbidities), led to more rapid attainment of functional milestones in the shorter term, as well as fewer post-operative complications, shorter hospital stay and reduced costs. However, there was no evidence that earlier inpatient rehabilitation improved participation. </P>
<P>For home-based multidisciplinary rehabilitation, there was 'silver' level evidence for organised hospital at home care improving QoL (in the medium term) and disability in persons following hip replacement, but there was no such evidence for knee replacement.</P>
<P>The duration of follow up of persons after both hip and knee joint replacement was limited to short and medium term (three to six months) following surgery. It was not possible to determine if gains made by participants in rehabilitation were maintained in the longer term (&gt; 12 months). </P>
<P>
<B>Does a greater intensity (time or expertise, or both) of multidisciplinary rehabilitation lead to greater gains, and are there demonstrable cost benefits for multidisciplinary rehabilitation in hip or knee joint replacement? <BR/>
</B>From this review, it has not been possible to suggest best 'dose' of therapy. Further studies are needed to suggest optimum number, duration and intensity of treatment sessions. </P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Munin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Munin 1998</LINK>) provided 'silver' level evidence for modest cost benefits (equating to approximately $2000) arising from early inpatient rehabilitation. A different study (<LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2003</LINK>) provided the same level of evidence that a limited four-week home rehabilitation programme could reduce the cost of intervention without adversely compromising patient outcomes in terms of functional status or quality of life. However, both this study and the study by <LINK REF="STD-Shepperd-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shepperd 1998</LINK> showed no difference in total reimbursement costs for hospital at home compared with conventional care, so the jury is still out on overall cost effectiveness of these home-based programmes.</P>
<P>
<B>Methodological considerations</B>
<BR/>For the purpose of this review, we categorised individual trials into 'high' or 'low' quality studies based on the Jadad and the CBJMTG methodological criteria, which have been developed to determine the risk of bias. We then graded the level of evidence according to the simple classification described by <LINK REF="REF-Tugwell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugwell 2004</LINK> into 'platinum', 'gold', 'silver' and 'bronze' grades. In the context of multidisciplinary rehabilitation, it has been recognised that it is effectively impossible to blind the service providers or the recipients to the nature of treatment (see below). All of these studies would have rated as low quality in any event. However, it should be possible to blind assessors but, in all five studies, even the assessors were unblinded. The rating system did not allow for differentiation of quality based on any other determinators such as intention to treat or allocation concealment. Alternative approaches, such as that recommended by <LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 2003</LINK>, provide a more comprehensive evaluation of quality indicators, and have been applied in other Cochrane reviews relating to multidisciplinary rehabilitation, but we have utilised the methods applied here at the specific request of the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group, in order to maintain comparability with other reviews in the section.</P>
<P>The strength of findings was limited by the small number of studies and by methodological weaknesses. Only two studies were powered to detect significant changes in outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Dowsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dowsey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shepperd-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shepperd 1998</LINK>), so there was a risk of type I and II errors. Details of the participants and the interventions, especially in the control arm of the trial, were frequently missing and were not obtainable from the authors, despite attempts to contact them. Only one study provided details of unilateral compared with bilateral joint replacements (<LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2003</LINK>). No studies provided details of differential analysis of bilateral versus unilateral joint replacements. Many studies did not provide the clinical indication for joint replacement (<LINK REF="STD-Dowsey-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dowsey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shepperd-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Shepperd 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weaver-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Weaver 2003</LINK>). The outcome measures used in these studies to gauge improvements in function (disability) or participation varied widely. Further, local practices tended to vary in the different countries (Australia, Iceland, UK and USA), making it harder to interpret and compare outcomes. In some studies details of the rehabilitation programmes were insufficient and therefore difficult to standardise.</P>
<P>This review highlights some of the limitations and challenges for randomised controlled trial methodologies in complex interventions such as rehabilitation in the context of chronic arthropathy, which have also been highlighted by previous authors (<LINK REF="REF-Turner_x002d_Stokes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner-Stokes 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whyte-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whyte 2002</LINK>). These include the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Heterogeneity with respect to participants, interventions and outcome measures used. </LI>
<LI>Problems with recruitment, retention and follow up of participants, especially in the control arm of trials. Multi-centre trials may provide larger numbers but often at the expense of increased heterogeneity, with little net benefit. </LI>
<LI>The outcomes measures used in rehabilitation may not be optimal for statistical analysis, as their ordinal nature obscures distribution in the target population. </LI>
<LI>True blinding of participants and care providers in rehabilitation is effectively not possible. Participants often unwittingly volunteer information about their treatment during the course of assessment, and attempts to blind outcome assessor may not be guaranteed.</LI>
<LI>Rehabilitation comprises concurrent complex interventions, which are difficult to quantify (such as goal setting), and depend on the specified interaction between the participant and the clinician. Many of the rehabilitation treatments are interactive and dependent on participant response, which potentially confounds simple division into 'treatment' and 'control' conditions. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>Limitations of this review </B>
<BR/>The assimilation of available evidence was challenging due to the diversity of trials in this review. The authors accept that there may have been a degree of:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>selection bias from the literature search (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 2003</LINK>) (although four authors independently selected the studies for inclusion);</LI>
<LI>publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1998</LINK>) if trials have not been published due to them having small participant numbers and negative results (although authors also sourced unpublished data);</LI>
<LI>reference bias (<LINK REF="REF-Goetzsche-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goetzsche 1987</LINK>) for published studies included in this review. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>The review has taken an inclusive approach to a broad area of clinical practice, and this approach has posed significant challenges for the assessment and assimilation of the available evidence. It may be contended that we have adopted too low a threshold for inclusion of studies of low quality. On the other hand, we believe that the presented synthesis of 'best evidence', based on assessment of methodological quality, has facilitated a helpful comparison of the various studies available. It also allows open acknowledgement of the 'limited evidence' which comes from these poorer (or single) studies, which is nevertheless the best available at the current time. </P>
<P>Our attempt to categorise evidence according to the <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK> ICF posed some methodological problems, since many of the outcome measures used in trials crossed the boundaries between the different levels of the model. However, we still believe that this model is helpful to clarify the experience of people who live with long-term chronic conditions. Future research should evaluate outcome on all levels, including contextual factors.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The evidence presented in this review provides modest support for the recommendation that people following hip or knee joint replacement should be assessed for their need for appropriate rehabilitation intervention. The assessment could be undertaken by any skilled member of the multidisciplinary team, in order to maximise their capacity for independent living and societal participation. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>We identified no studies that provided direct evidence that multidisciplinary rehabilitation following THJR/TKJR achieved better outcomes compared with no treatment. However, taken together, the five trials included in this review provide a certain body of evidence that multidisciplinary rehabilitation can improve the experience of people following joint replacement in terms of both activity and participation. Many questions remain to be answered. Which group of people, following joint replacement, are most likely to require and gain benefit from a multidisciplinary approach? It is clear that home-based rehabilitation is not suitable for all people following joint replacement, so how should we decide who needs treatment in which setting? What is the optimum dose or intensity of rehabilitation, and which professional should be involved? Finally, with spiralling healthcare costs and the increased demand for rehabilitation services, it is important to gather proper evidence with regard to cost-effectiveness of different models and their full economic impact for health services, for people following joint replacement and their families and for society at large.</P>
<P>This review highlights the need for: </P>
<P>1) High quality RCTs, and other designs (including large prospective observation cohort studies) where appropriate, which assess: <BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the effectiveness of specific rehabilitation interventions (and components);</LI>
<LI>the appropriate intensity and settings of therapy;</LI>
<LI>the cost effectiveness of comprehensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes; and</LI>
<LI>the impact of therapy on participants and their families.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>2) Development of appropriate outcome measures, including:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>reliable and valid outcome measures which reflect domains of the ICF;</LI>
<LI>measurement of the effects of rehabilitation over longer periods (over 12 months); </LI>
<LI>incorporation of the perspective of the person following joint replacement, and further evaluation of the participation issues relevant to them (such as return to work, driving, community reintegration, leisure, parenting (or grand-parenting) and psychosocial issues);</LI>
<LI>a consensus on an ICF core set of measurement of outcomes in post- joint replacement trials.</LI>
