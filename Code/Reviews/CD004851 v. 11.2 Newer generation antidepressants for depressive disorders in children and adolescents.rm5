<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-09-26 10:00:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Depression is common in young people and can contribute to a variety of negative outcomes, such as poor academic functioning, difficulties in peer and family relationships, increases in substance use, and both attempted and completed suicide. This review contained 19 trials (with a total of 3353 participants) testing the effectiveness of newer generation antidepressants (these are antidepressants developed and used since tricyclic antidepressants were developed). These include the well-known selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that have an impact primarily on the brain chemical called serotonin, as well as several other newer classes of antidepressants now being used, which aim to target noradrenaline and dopamine as well as serotonin and include selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), norepinephrine dopamine disinhibitors (NDDIs) and tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs)) for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents. Based on 14 of the trials (2490 participants in total), there was evidence that those treated with an antidepressant had lower depression severity scores than those on placebo, however, the size of this difference was small. Based on 17 trials (3229 participants in total), there was evidence of an increased risk (64%) of suicide-related outcomes for those on antidepressants compared with those given placebo. Where rates of adverse events were reported, this was higher for those prescribed an antidepressant. There was no evidence that one particular type of newer generation antidepressant had a larger effect than the others when compared to placebo.</P>
<P>It is unclear how meaningful the results regarding the effectiveness of these medications are in terms of a young person's day-to-day functioning. Children and adolescents with other conditions (such as anxiety, substance use disorder or a conduct disorder) as well as depression, and those at risk of suicide, were often excluded from trials. However, these young people are more representative of the population who present to clinical services, therefore it is not possible to predict how they would respond to antidepressants. There was often insufficient information to judge the quality of the trials accurately. With these limitations, it is difficult to answer questions about the effectiveness and safety of antidepressants for treating depression in children and adolescents. Clinicians need to provide accurate information to children and adolescents, and their families, about the uncertainties regarding the benefits and risks of newer generation antidepressant medication as a treatment option for depression. If a decision to use medication is agreed then fluoxetine might be the medication of first choice given guideline recommendations and, if used, the risk of suicide should be assessed and monitored particularly closely.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-09-26 10:00:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Depressive disorders are common in young people and are associated with significant negative impacts. Newer generation antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are often used, however evidence of their effectiveness in children and adolescents is not clear. Furthermore, there have been warnings against their use in this population due to concerns about increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-12-13 02:28:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the efficacy and adverse outcomes, including definitive suicidal behaviour and suicidal ideation, of newer generation antidepressants compared with placebo in the treatment of depressive disorders in children and adolescents.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-09-26 10:01:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update of the review, we searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to October 2011. The CCDANCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: CENTRAL (the<I> </I>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) (all years), EMBASE (1974 -), MEDLINE (1950 -) and PsycINFO (1967 -). We searched clinical trial registries and pharmaceutical company websites. We checked reference lists of included trials and other reviews, and sent letters to key researchers and the pharmaceutical companies of included trials from January to August 2011.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-09-26 10:00:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cross-over trials and cluster trials comparing a newer generation antidepressant with a placebo in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years old and diagnosed with a depressive disorder were eligible for inclusion. In this update, we amended the selection criteria to include newer generation antidepressants rather than SSRIs only.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-09-26 10:02:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two or three review authors selected the trials, assessed their quality, and extracted trial and outcome data. We used a random-effects meta-analysis. We used risk ratio (RR) to summarise dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) to summarise continuous measures.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-09-26 10:04:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nineteen trials of a range of newer antidepressants compared with placebo, containing 3335 participants, were included. The trials excluded young people at high risk of suicide and many co-morbid conditions and the participants are likely to be less unwell than those seen in clinical practice. We judged none of these trials to be at low risk of bias, with limited information about many aspects of risk of bias, high drop out rates and issues regarding measurement instruments and the clinical usefulness of outcomes, which were often variously defined across trials. Overall, there was evidence that those treated with an antidepressant had lower depression severity scores and higher rates of response/remission than those on placebo. However, the size of these effects was small with a reduction in depression symptoms of 3.51 on a scale from 17 to 113 (14 trials; N = 2490; MD -3.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.55 to -2.47). Remission rates increased from 380 per 1000 to 448 per 1000 for those treated with an antidepressant. There was evidence of an increased risk (58%) of suicide-related outcome for those on antidepressants compared with a placebo (17 trials; N = 3229; RR 1.58; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.45). This equates to an increased risk in a group with a median baseline risk from 25 in 1000 to 40 in 1000. Where rates of adverse events were reported, this was higher for those prescribed an antidepressant. There was no evidence that the magnitude of intervention effects (compared with placebo) were modified by individual drug class.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-09-26 10:05:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caution is required in interpreting the results given the methodological limitations of the included trials in terms of internal and external validity. Further, the size and clinical meaningfulness of statistically significant results are uncertain. However, given the risks of untreated depression in terms of completed suicide and impacts on functioning, if a decision to use medication is agreed, then fluoxetine might be the medication of first choice given guideline recommendations. Clinicians need to keep in mind that there is evidence of an increased risk of suicide-related outcomes in those treated with antidepressant medications.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-09-26 10:00:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Depressive disorders are common in young people (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pine-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pine 1998</LINK>) and are diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or International Classification of Diseases (ICD) criteria, usually by a clinician conducting a structured or semi-structured diagnostic interview. The core features of depressive disorder include persistent low mood, loss of enjoyment in once pleasurable activities, and a negative view of ones self, the future and others. These features are generally similar in children, adolescents and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Carlson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marttunen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marttunen 1998</LINK>). The DSM includes criteria changes for children and adolescents such as the presence of irritability as an alternative to a depressed mood for this age group (<LINK REF="REF-Angold-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angold 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Essau-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Essau 1999</LINK>). Generally, anhedonia and psychomotor retardation are less common in the younger age group where clinical phenotypes can be indistinct with presentations including an admixture of anxiety, depressive and somatic symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Axelson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Axelson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rivas_x002d_Vasquez--2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivas-Vasquez 2004</LINK>). Low self esteem, concentration and thinking problems, and behaviour difficulties are more frequent (<LINK REF="REF-Carlson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlson 1988</LINK>). In adolescents the presentation of a depressive disorder may include substance abuse, antisocial behaviour, social withdrawal and academic failure (<LINK REF="REF-Masi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masi 1998</LINK>) with suicide attempts and ideation also common in adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Marttunen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marttunen 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prevalence estimates are higher in studies with a six to 12 rather than three-month time frame, with meta-analysis of prevalence estimates across different time points giving estimates of 2.8% (standard error (SE) 0.5%) for children, and 5.7% (SE 0.3%) for adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Costello-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costello 2006</LINK>). Life-time estimates range between 15% and 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Birmaher-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birmaher 1996</LINK>). Incidence rates (rate of new diagnoses during a particular time period) range from 3.3% to 7.8% over a year for major depressive disorder (MDD) (<LINK REF="REF-Garrison-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garrison 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewinsohn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewinsohn 1998</LINK>).The length of a depressive episode is often greater than 12 months: about 50% of children and adolescents remain clinically depressed at 12 months, and 20% to 40% at 24 months (<LINK REF="REF-Birmaher-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birmaher 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harrington-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrington 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kovacs-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovacs 1984</LINK>). Between 30% and 70% of cases have recurrences within five years, and many of these develop episodes into adult life (<LINK REF="REF-Fombonne-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fombonne 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fombonne-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fombonne 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewinsohn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewinsohn 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richmond-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richmond 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weissman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissman 1999</LINK>). In the longer term, those children and adolescents who develop a recurrent or chronic disorder extending into adulthood are likely to suffer considerable disability and impairment, high rates of co-morbid disorders with poor academic functioning, difficulties in peer and family relationships, increases in substance use, and attempted and completed suicide (<LINK REF="REF-Brent-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brent 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ebmeier-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebmeier 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fleming-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleming 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harrington-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrington 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewinsohn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewinsohn 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rao-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 1995</LINK>). The publication of the Global Burden of Disease (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1996</LINK>) included adolescents aged 15 to 18 years of age and showed depression as the fourth most important disease in the estimation of disease burden.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-09-26 10:00:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall there are relatively few long-term studies on depressive disorders in children and adolescents. Despite what is known about its prevalence and impacts, there is relatively little evidence for effective treatments or their impact on prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>). While a range of psychotherapies are effective (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>), adolescents' response to psychotherapies may be weaker than adults (<LINK REF="REF-Cuijpers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuijpers 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gloaguen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gloaguen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weisz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisz 2006</LINK>) and overall more research is required (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have not been shown to be an effective pharmacological treatment for depressive disorder in young people (<LINK REF="REF-Hazell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weller-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weller 2000</LINK>). Newer generation antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have been increasingly used in recent decades (<LINK REF="REF-Vitiello-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vitiello 2006</LINK>), with initial studies showing they were well tolerated (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1988</LINK>). However, concerns about the increased risk of suicide and suicide attempt on SSRIs were first raised in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Healy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Healy 2003</LINK>). Meta-analyses examining the risks of suicide-related behaviour and suicidal ideation combined (<LINK REF="REF-Hammad-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammad 2006</LINK>) or separately (<LINK REF="REF-Dubicka-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubicka 2006</LINK>) have shown a consistent and modest increased risk of suicide for those taking SSRIs compared with placebo. Although debate about this issue is ongoing (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Goodyer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodyer 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hetrick-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hetrick 2010</LINK>), the evidence for such risks has lead to action by regulatory bodies. The Committee on Safety of Medicines, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-CSM-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSM 2004</LINK>), the European Medicines Agency (<LINK REF="REF-EMEA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMEA 2005</LINK>) and the Food and Drug Administration (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2004</LINK>) have cautioned practitioners in the use of SSRIs in children and adolescents, including an FDA 'black box' warning label issued 14 September 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition to SSRIs, several other classes of antidepressants are now being used, including selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), norepinephrine dopamine disinhibitors (NDDIs) and tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs). SSRIs are sometimes referred to as 'second generation' antidepressants, and these newer additional classes are sometimes referred to as 'third generation' antidepressants. Rather than being a homogenous group based on mechanisms of action, however, third generation antidepressants are classed together because they are modified versions of first and second generation antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Olver-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olver 2001</LINK>). Given the use of these classes of antidepressants, this updated version of the review includes these and throughout the review, second and third generation antidepressants are referred to as 'newer generation' antidepressants.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-09-26 10:00:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antidepressant medication has evolved over the past 50 years. Until recently, a widely held belief was that dysfunction in serotonergic neurons and their targets may underlie depressive symptomatology (<LINK REF="REF-van-Praag-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Praag 1987</LINK>). The dopaminergic system has also been implicated, given its association with reward and appetitive motivation, whereby depression is characterised by a diminished ability to experience pleasure. Serotonin does have modulatory effects on dopamine, either increasing or decreasing its activity depending on the concomitant action of other neurotransmitters and the receptor subtype it is acting on.</P>
<P>SSRIs cause an initial inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptimine, or 5-HT) (<LINK REF="REF-Lenox-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lenox 2008</LINK>), but while this effect occurs within hours of taking the medication, the clinical effects are not evident for some weeks. This suggests it may be the downstream effects of reuptake inhibition on gene expression and receptor regulation that are chiefly responsible for the clinical effects of SSRIs (<LINK REF="REF-Castren-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castren 2005</LINK>). SSRIs also affect other neurotransmitters, including noradrenaline and dopamine (<LINK REF="REF-Healy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Healy 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>A third generation of antidepressants target the noradrenaline and dopamine systems to a greater degree than the SSRIs, though most also have an effect on the serotonergic system (<LINK REF="REF-Healy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Healy 1997</LINK>). There is significant interplay between the monoaminergic systems, rendering efforts to reduce antidepressant action to their effects on a single system simplistic.</P>
<P>This review refers to 'newer generation antidepressants' which encompasses both SSRIs and third generation antidepressant medication. It is unlikely that even within class these antidepressants will have similar effectiveness; similar to the multi-treatments meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009</LINK> we have pooled all individual compounds (rather than pooling within class) in order to look at whether the effect of newer antidepressants is modifiable by individual compound type (but we cannot assess comparative effectiveness given this is not a multi-treatments meta-analysis).</P>

<P>The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists, in response to the initial black box warnings, expressed concern about a stand that will deprive young people of effective treatment for a condition that carries with it considerable morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Brent-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brent 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Findling-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Findling 2004</LINK>). Similarly, reviews examining the risks and benefits of antidepressants, most commonly SSRIs, consistently highlight the potentially serious consequences of untreated depression in children and adolescents. While modest treatment benefits have been shown for fluoxetine in children and adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Hetrick-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hetrick 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whittington-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittington 2004</LINK>), there is contention about the effectiveness of other newer generation antidepressants. This review updates the previous version of the review to include not only SSRIs but newer antidepressants, to ensure information about all antidepressants is available and attempts to investigate issues of effectiveness and risk for children and adolescents with depression treated with these newer generation antidepressants.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-09-26 10:00:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This update of the review aims to investigate not only the effects of SSRIs (as in the previous version) but also the effects of newer generation antidepressants compared with placebo, and factors which may modify the effects, in children and adolescents with a diagnosed depressive disorder. Specific objectives are to:</P>
<OL>
<LI>estimate the pooled effect of newer generation antidepressants on depression, function and adverse outcomes and whether this effect is modified by drug and age (children versus adolescents);</LI>
<LI>estimate the effect of each newer generation antidepressant, compared with placebo, on depression, function and adverse outcomes.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Results from this review do not address questions of comparative effectiveness of each of the newer generation drugs. However, in a future review we plan to undertake a multiple-treatments meta-analysis comparing the effectiveness of each individual drug which meets the scope of the current review.</P>

<P>
<B>1. Efficacy outcomes </B>
</P>
<P>1.1 Depression symptom severity (clinician-rated) using the Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS-R). This outcome was chosen on the basis of a hierarchy of rating scales based on psychometric properties and appropriateness for use with children and adolescents and for consistency of use across trials (the most commonly used tool) (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). The CDRS-R was adapted for children and adolescents from the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), a tool validated and commonly used in adult populations (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 2001</LINK>). Both the CDRS-R and HAM-D have good reliability and validity (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 2001</LINK>). The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was also based on the HAM-D but designed to better assess sensitivity to change. However, it was not designed specifically for children and adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 2001</LINK>)</P>
<P>1.2. Remission or response as defined by trialists. 'Remission' and 'response' are commonly defined by dichotomising a continuous measure of clinician-rated depression symptoms. The labelling of remission and response varied across trials, with the labelling being different even although the cut-point was the same. For consistency across trials, we chose the most commonly reported cut-point, which was generally referred to as 'remission' (CDRS-R &#8804; 28). When 'remission' was not reported, we used 'response' if available (we have used last observation carried forward (LOCF) data in the first instance (see <LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK>) so that if remission was only available from observed case (OC) data but response data were available from LOCF data, we have used response data). The outcome represents some measure of improvement, but there are difficulties in interpretation because of the inconsistencies in scales and cut-points (<LINK REF="REF-Hetrick-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hetrick 2010</LINK>)<I>.</I>
</P>
<P>We have chosen to include both continuous and dichotomised measures of clinician-rated depression symptoms (outcomes 1.1 and 1.2/1.3 respectively), since there are advantages and disadvantages to each. Responder analyses (based on the dichotomised continuous outcomes) are well known to be problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Kieser-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kieser 2004</LINK>), with arbitrariness in the choice of cut-point, loss of power resulting from the dichotomisation (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2006</LINK>) and difficulties in interpretation (as outlined above). However, synthesising continuous outcomes is not without its difficulties. The scales used to measure depression symptoms vary across trials; there is inconsistency in the analytical methods employed (e.g. analyses of change scores, regression models), which can preclude the use of the standardised mean difference; and there are also interpretational difficulties.</P>
<P>1.4 Depression symptom severity - self rated (on standardised, validated, reliable depression rating scales). The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)/Childrens Depression Inventory (CDI) were the most commonly used across trials and ranked the highest in the hierarchy (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>), therefore we meta-analysed this outcome. Results based on other scales are reported in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>1.5 Functioning (on standardised, validated, reliable global functioning rating scales). The Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) was the most commonly used and, therefore, meta-analysis was based on this outcome. Results based on other scales are reported in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.</P>

Suicide-related outcomes </B>- where possible data based on the definitions used in the FDA review using the Columbia Classification system (<LINK REF="REF-Hammad-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammad 2004</LINK>) have been chosen, again to maximise consistency across trials.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-09-26 10:00:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we measured treatment effects using risk ratios (RR) (e.g. response rates and adverse effects). In the original version of this review, a post hoc decision was made not to calculate number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) and number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) primarily because these effect measures have undesirable statistical properties and can be difficult to interpret (<LINK REF="REF-Julious-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Julious 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wisloff-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wisloff 2011</LINK>). Instead, in our <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, we present estimates of risk difference, in addition to risk ratios, to aid interpretation, for a range of control group rates (lowest, highest and median rate derived from the placebo groups).</P>
<P>For each drug, we estimated the risk ratio of experiencing adverse events (where a count of any adverse event was reported). However, given inconsistencies in data collection of these events between trials, the risk ratios may not be comparable between drugs; therefore, information about adverse events is also presented in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes (such as clinician-rated depression symptom severity), we have used the mean difference (MD). In the majority of trials, multiple linear regression models had been fitted, and &#8216;adjusted&#8217; estimates of treatment effects from these models were reported (often as least square means or least square mean differences). These models adjusted for varying factors such as age, sex, investigator site and baseline of the outcome (details available from the review authors). We were not able to use the standardised mean difference (SMD) where the same outcome was measured across trials, but using a different scale because there was inconsistency in the analytical methods employed (e.g. analyses of final values, change scores and regression models).</P>
<P>We presented data that could not be meta-analysed, such as information on co-morbidity, and treatment effects for trials that have used different scales than our chosen scale, in tables.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2012-09-26 10:00:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were no trials with more than one intervention arm compared with the placebo group. In future updates, if this occurs, we will compare data from each arm with the placebo group. We will divide the sample size in the placebo arm by the number of intervention arms included in the meta-analysis to preclude multiple counting of trial participants. While this approach offers some solution, it does not completely account for the correlation arising from using the same set of participants in the placebo comparison group (Chapter 16, <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>No cross-over trials were included, but if they are located in future updates, if the appropriate data for a paired t-test analysis is not available and cannot be obtained from trial authors, we will impute missing statistics (e.g. missing standard deviation, correlation) using data available from other trials included within the meta-analysis, or trials outside the meta-analysis (Chapter 16, <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). We will use sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the pooled treatment effect to assumptions made regarding missing statistics.</P>
<P>If cluster-RCTs are included in future updates, which have not appropriately adjusted for the correlation between participants within clusters, we will contact trial authors to obtain an estimate of the intra-cluster correlation (ICC), or imputed using estimates from the other included trials or from similar external trials. We will inflate the trial standard errors (Chapter 16 <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2012-10-08 23:56:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">

We also searched the pharmaceutical company websites for additional data on included trials.</P>
<P>Most trials used the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method of data imputation for the majority of outcomes, that is, the last observed value for a participant lost to follow-up is assigned as the follow-up value. We chose to pool LOCF data (rather than mix LOCF and OC data).</P>
<P>The observed case remission/response data were sought since we planned to investigate the effect of missing data using the "
informative missingness odds ratios
" (IMOR) framework (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). However, only a few trials reported observed case data for this outcome (paroxetine trials, sertraline trials, one trial of citalopram and one small trial of fluoxetine) and we were unsuccessful in obtaining observed case data for the other trials. We have undertaken sensitivity analysis using OC data where available. Estimates of treatment effect based on either LOCF or OC data can result in serious bias (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In some trials, least squares means and their standard errors were reported from regression models by treatment group, but no contrast between groups was reported. For these trials, we estimated the variance of the treatment effect by summing the square of the standard errors in each treatment group. There may be some inaccuracy in this approach when there is imbalance in the covariates being adjusted for.</P>

<P>We investigated the potential for small-study effects using funnel plots and contour-enhanced funnel plots. Contour-enhanced funnel plots aid in determining if funnel plot asymmetry is due to publication bias or other factors (<LINK REF="REF-Peters-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2011</LINK>). The outcomes 'remission/response' and suicide-related behaviour were chosen since they were available for the majority of included trials.

<P>We pooled estimates of treatment effect using inverse variance weighting, using a random-effects model. DerSimonian and Laird&#8217;s method of moments estimator was used to estimate between-trial variance (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>). We made the decision to use a random-effects model since there was expected clinical diversity in the antidepressant medications, given their differing actions on various monoaminergic systems. Where trials did not report data suitable for meta-analysis, treatment estimates or raw data (as appropriate for each outcome) for each individual study are reported in additional tables.</P>
<P>We judged randomised trials to be at a low risk of bias if they met the following criteria: a low risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and assessors, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. We summarised the risk of bias across the trials in the text of the review. As part of the sensitivity analyses, we present meta-analyses of trials that are judged to be at a low risk of bias for the outcomes depression symptom severity (CDRS-R), remission/response and suicide-related outcome.</P>

<P>We undertook a subgroup analysis based on the individual compounds to examine if the effect of newer generation antidepressants was modified by individual drug. Clinically, these drugs are used individually, with clinicians often trying to make a decision about which one is best to use for a particular individual.</P>
<P>There is evidence that children and adolescents may respond differently to pharmacological intervention, e.g. oral tricyclic antidepressants versus placebo significantly reduce symptoms in adolescents but not in children (<LINK REF="REF-Hazell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazell 2002</LINK>). For this reason we conducted subgroup analyses by age, where children and adolescents were defined as those aged approximately 6 to 12 and 13 to 18 years respectively (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). When estimates of treatment effect were not presented for children and adolescents separately, we created another subgroup which contained both children and adolescents.</P>
<P>In the first version of the review, we had planned a priori to undertake subgroup analyses based on depressive disorder (major versus dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder not otherwise specified and 'double depression'), sex and co-morbidity. However, due to limited data, we did not carry out analyses on these subgroups, nor was it possible in this update.</P>

<P>In the original review, we did not carry out pre-planned sensitivity analyses based on pharmaceutical funding (financial support of trials by pharmaceutical companies has been shown to influence trial results (<LINK REF="REF-Schott-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schott 2010</LINK>)) and inclusion criteria (clinical diagnosis versus depression rating scales) since the majority of trials were pharmaceutically funded, and no trials used rating scales as inclusion criteria. We did not undertake a pre-planned sensitivity analysis based on attrition rates since there were reasonably high attrition rates in all included RCTs (19% to 38%, <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>For this version of the review, we undertook sensitivity analyses based on the assessment of risk of bias in the trials (see <LINK TAG="DATA_SYNTHESIS" TYPE="SECTION">Data synthesis</LINK>), whereby trials deemed to be at a high risk of bias were excluded from the analysis.</P>
<P>We undertook sensitivity analysis based on methods of imputation for missing data used by trial authors such that we substituted LOCF data for OC data for the outcome 'remission/response'.</P>
<P>Finally, given the inclusion in this review of third generation antidepressants that have a different proposed mechanism of action from SSRIs, we have undertaken sensitivity analysis on the basis of drug class, excluding third generation antidepressants from the overall pooled analysis.</P>

<P>Twelve trials were included in the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Hetrick-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hetrick 2007</LINK>), with data extracted from 10 trials and pooled in one or more meta-analyses. As our inclusion criteria have been expanded to include newer classes of antidepressants, four trials excluded from the original review have been included in this version of the review (<LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2007-Trial-1" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2007 Trial 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2007-Trial-2" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2007 Trial 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mirtazapine-Trial-1" TYPE="STUDY">Mirtazapine Trial 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mirtazapine-Trial-2" TYPE="STUDY">Mirtazapine Trial 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this update, 530 trials were retrieved in the search, of which 408 were excluded on the basis of title and abstract. We attempted to retrieve 122 full-text articles for full inspection. Forty publications could not be located (the majority of these were conference proceedings that had not been subsequently published). Of the 82 that were obtained, 64 were either already included trials or were secondary publications from already included trials (35 of these were for <LINK REF="STD-TADS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">TADS 2004</LINK> and are not listed under the main reference for this trial). Seven new trials were included, four of which are ongoing trials (<LINK REF="STD-Duloxetine-NCT00849693" TYPE="STUDY">Duloxetine NCT00849693</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duloxetine-NCT00849901" TYPE="STUDY">Duloxetine NCT00849901</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glod-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Glod 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solvay-NCT00353028" TYPE="STUDY">Solvay NCT00353028</LINK>), leaving a total of 19 trials included in this updated version of the review (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). In addition, seven studies were newly excluded (see <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>The three trials newly included from the updated search include:</P>
<P>A new trial on fluoxetine (<LINK REF="STD-Almeida_x002d_Montes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Almeida-Montes 2005</LINK>). This trial was published in Spanish and data extracted by a colleague who speaks Spanish, with additional data sought via this colleague.</P>
<P>A new trial of escitalopram (<LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2009</LINK>) and a new trial of paroxetine (<LINK REF="STD-Paroxetine-Trial-1" TYPE="STUDY">Paroxetine Trial 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>For the included trials, we had retrieved additional reports during preparation of the original review, including the web-based report of the Medicines and Healthcare Product Regulatory Agency (MHRA), summarising the majority of clinical trials on SSRIs for major depressive disorder in children and adolescents at the time. When we wrote to trial authors for additional data during preparation of the original review, in many cases trial authors did not have access to any additional data.

For one paroxetine trial (<LINK REF="STD-Paroxetine-Trial-1" TYPE="STUDY">Paroxetine Trial 1</LINK>) we only had access to a brief trial report from this website. We had also accessed trial reports published online by Forest Laboratories for escitalopram and citalopram and for this update located the report for a newly located trial of escitalopram. Eli Lilly provided additional data for a trial on fluoxetine (<LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2002</LINK>) during preparation of the original review. For this update, the trial authors for this trial and for <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 1997</LINK> were able to provide additional data in response to our requests. For this update we accessed trial reports of venlafaxine from CCDAN who had accessed them from Pfizer.</P>

Of those trials that reported on the percentage of young people who were experiencing a first episode of depression (12 trials), the rates varied from 42.7% to 95% in the intervention group and 42.8% to 95% in the placebo group. The length of the current episode was reported variously in 10 trials and ranged from approximately 15 weeks to 108 weeks in the intervention group and 14 to 100 weeks in the placebo group, with the majority of trials reporting episode lengths of over 35 weeks.</P>
<P>Seven trials provided no detail about the co-morbid conditions of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Almeida_x002d_Montes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Almeida-Montes 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mirtazapine-Trial-1-_x0026_-2" TYPE="STUDY">Mirtazapine Trial 1 &amp; 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paroxetine-Trial-1" TYPE="STUDY">Paroxetine Trial 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simeon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Simeon 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Von-Knorring-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Von Knorring 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Wagner-Trial-1_x0026_2-_x0028_2003_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner Trial 1&amp;2 (2003)</LINK> provided data for sertraline and placebo groups combined for both trials combined. In this trial the co-morbid conditions that were most common (&gt; 5%) were anxiety, phobic disorder, adjustment reaction and ODD.</P>
<P>Five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Emslie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Keller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TADS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">TADS 2004</LINK>) provided data on the number of young people who had any co-morbid condition with rates very variable across trials (<LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2009</LINK> having the lowest rates), ranging from 12.9% to 85.4% in the intervention arms and 16.6% to 77.1% in the placebo arms (see <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>).</P>
<P>In eight trials the percentage of young people experiencing various different types of co-morbid conditions was provided and has been presented in <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Clinician-rated depression symptom severity</HEADING>
<P>Depression symptom severity was measured in a variety of ways, including:</P>
<P>1. The CDRS-R (<LINK REF="STD-Emslie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2007-Trial-1" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2007 Trial 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2007-Trial-2" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2007 Trial 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mirtazapine-Trial-1-_x0026_-2" TYPE="STUDY">Mirtazapine Trial 1 &amp; 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paroxetine-Trial-1" TYPE="STUDY">Paroxetine Trial 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TADS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">TADS 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagner-Trial-1_x0026_2-_x0028_2003_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner Trial 1&amp;2 (2003)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS-R) (<LINK REF="REF-Poznanski-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poznanski 1984</LINK>) was adapted for children and adolescents from the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and assesses 17 symptom areas. The first 14 items are rated on the basis of responses to interview questions by the child or an adult informant who knows the child well and are rated for the past two weeks and currently. The remaining three symptom areas (depressed facial affect, listless speech and hypoactivity) are rated by the clinician on the basis of the child's non verbal behaviour in the room. Each symptom is graded on a five or seven-point scale. For items 1 to 14 the highest ratings from the child, parent or other caretaker are taken as the <I>item</I> scores. The total score, or CDRS-R score, is the sum of all 17 item scores and has a range of 17 to 113. In samples studied in the development of the scale (<LINK REF="REF-Poznanski-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poznanski 1996</LINK>) mean CDRS-R T scores (standardised scores) were 71, 58 and 53 for those with a depressive disorder (based on DSM-III criteria), other psychiatric disorder (outpatient) and no disorder respectively. This scale is used widely, has adequate internal reliability, good test-retest reliability, good to excellent inter-rater reliability and is sensitive to treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2002</LINK>). We chose this measure for clinician-rated depressive symptom severity.</P>
<P>2. K-SADS (<LINK REF="STD-Von-Knorring-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Von Knorring 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Keller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berard-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Berard 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children, Present Episode Version (K-SADS-P) (<LINK REF="REF-Chambers-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 1985</LINK>) depression module has nine items on an ordinal scale, four of which consist of two to three sub-items. Each of the items or sub-items is rated from zero to either four or six with higher numbers corresponding to greater severity. The score range is 9 to 56. The various items rated are for the last two weeks in order to enable diagnosis according to DSM-IV criteria. It has reasonable reliability but is not often used to assess treatment outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 2001</LINK>). Data based on the KSADS are reported in an additional table but not included in meta-analysis.</P>
<P>3. The HAM-D was used in the Simeon trial. <LINK REF="STD-Almeida_x002d_Montes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Almeida-Montes 2005</LINK> used both the HAM-D and the Depression Self Rating Scale (DSRS)
 (the later was translated into Spanish)
.</P>
<P>The Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1960</LINK>) consists of 17 multiple choice questions each of which is numerically scored on a scale of zero to two or four. The score can range from 0 to 42 with a higher score indicating more severe depression. The various items refer to depressive disorder severity over the last week. Reliability is reported as excellent with trials suggesting sensitivity to treatment effects although further research is required (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2002</LINK>). There were no data for this outcome.</P>
<P>4. The MADRS was also used in <LINK REF="STD-Berard-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Berard 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Von-Knorring-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Von Knorring 2006</LINK>. The continuous data based on this measure was not meta-analysed. However, the dichotomised measure of this scale indicating response was meta-analysed (see below).</P>
<P>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 1979</LINK>) was also based on the HAM-D and is a clinician-rated scale that assesses depressive disorder symptoms in the last week or the last three days. This scale is less commonly used compared to other depression rating scales. It consists of 10 items covering apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts and suicidal thoughts. Each of these items is scored between 0 and 6 based on severity. The possible range of scores is 0 to 60 with a higher score indicating more severe depression. This scale was specifically designed to assess the effect of treatment, but its psychometric properties have not been specifically examined in adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The CGI was also used in many trials, though not as a continuous measure of symptom severity outcome; rather it was often used to establish 'response'.</P>
<P>The Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>) is a clinician-rated seven-point scale that assesses global improvement from baseline to the current state. The scale is:</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Response/remission</HEADING>
<P>Remission was measured in a variety of ways both across and within trials; few trials used diagnostic interviews to establish remission. More often it was defined by the trial authors as a level of improvement in depression symptoms on clinician-rated scales. The scale and the cut-point used to define this level of improvement varied between trials. Response was reported in all trials, however, again the scale used and the cut-point was variously defined between trials and usually, but not always, was of a smaller magnitude compared to remission. Therefore, as stated in the methods, for this version of the review, we have used remission in the first instance, but response if remission was not available. We have used LOCF data for the primary analysis of this outcome, and in one case this meant using response data rather than remission data (<LINK REF="STD-Wagner-Trial-1_x0026_2-_x0028_2003_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner Trial 1&amp;2 (2003)</LINK>). In one trial OC data based on response was all that was available and we have used this (<LINK REF="STD-Almeida_x002d_Montes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Almeida-Montes 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A large number of trials reported remission based on CDRS-R &#8804; 28 (<LINK REF="STD-Emslie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2006</LINK> (for total population); <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TADS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">TADS 2004</LINK>). Two trials used this cut-point definition but labelled it 'response' (<LINK REF="STD-Wagner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner 2006</LINK>). Data from <LINK REF="STD-Von-Knorring-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Von Knorring 2006</LINK> were based on what the trial authors called "remission", defined as a MADRS score of 12 or less. Data from <LINK REF="STD-Berard-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Berard 2006</LINK> were based on what they called "response", defined as &#8805; 50% reduction in baseline MADRS scores, and data from <LINK REF="STD-Keller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Keller 2001</LINK> were based on what they called "response", defined as HAM-D &#8804; 8. Similarly, data from <LINK REF="STD-Almeida_x002d_Montes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Almeida-Montes 2005</LINK> were based on what they called "response", defined &#8805; 50% reduction in

HAM-D score.

The data from <LINK REF="STD-Paroxetine-Trial-1" TYPE="STUDY">Paroxetine Trial 1</LINK> were based on what they call "response" defined as a CGI score of 1 or 2 (much improved or very much improved). The paper publication of the sertraline trials (<LINK REF="STD-Wagner-Trial-1_x0026_2-_x0028_2003_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner Trial 1&amp;2 (2003)</LINK>) did not include remission, however the MHRA reported these data using a definition of those who no longer met DSM-IV criteria for MDD; however because these MHRA data were only OC data, we have used response data defined as &#8805; 40% reduction in baseline CDRS-R scores. <LINK REF="STD-Simeon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Simeon 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mirtazapine-Trial-1-_x0026_-2" TYPE="STUDY">Mirtazapine Trial 1 &amp; 2</LINK> did not provide any data for this outcome.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Self rated depression symptom severity</HEADING>
<P>Self rated depression symptom severity was measured in four trials. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Berard-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Berard 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Von-Knorring-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Von Knorring 2006</LINK>) used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1961</LINK>); one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Emslie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 1997</LINK>) used the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) (<LINK REF="REF-Kovacs-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovacs 1992</LINK>) for child-aged participants and the BDI (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1961</LINK>) for adolescents and combined these into one score; and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-TADS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">TADS 2004</LINK>) used the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS) (<LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>The BDI (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 1961</LINK>) is the first and most widely used self rated tool to assess depression severity, consisting of 21 items of which there are four item choices related to how the respondent has felt in the last week. The range of possible scores is from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating worse depression severity. The tool was developed for adults (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 2001</LINK>). The CDI (<LINK REF="REF-Kovacs-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovacs 1992</LINK>) was based on the BDI but specifically developed for children aged seven years and older and has been frequently used in younger adolescents. It has 27 items, with the first 18 very similar to the BDI, and there are three response options for each item. The range of possible scores is 0 to 54, with higher scores indicating greater severity (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 2001</LINK>). The RADS (<LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 1986</LINK>) was developed for adolescents aged 13 to 18 years. It has 30 items with four response options per item to gauge the current severity of symptoms of depression with the range of possible scores from 30 to 120 (higher scores indicating greater severity) (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>The Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) (<LINK REF="REF-Shaffer-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaffer 1985</LINK>) measures a child's current general functioning and is completed by the clinician. The range is from 1 to 100 with a score of 1 to 10 indicating a need for constant supervision and a 90 to 100 indicating superior functioning. The CGAS has adequate reliability and is sensitive to change (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>) measure is a clinician-rated scale that assesses the patient's current level of functioning. Scores range from 1 to 90 (90 indicates good functioning in all areas). There are few trials of its psychometric properties in child and adolescent populations; however, a recent review suggests it is likely to be reliable when used in research given the training and motivation of raters (<LINK REF="REF-Schorre-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schorre 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Autonomous Functioning Checklist (AFC) (<LINK REF="REF-Sigafoos-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sigafoos 1988</LINK>) is completed by the parent, and assesses the child's autonomy in performing daily activities. It consists of 78 questions grouped into four categories; 22 questions on self and family care; 20 questions on management; 16 questions on recreational activities; and 20 questions on social and vocational activities. The first three categories are rated on an ordinal scale ranging from 0 ("does not do") to 4 ("does every time there is an opportunity"). While the last categories consist of "yes" (coded 1) and "no" (coded 0) questions. A total score and a sub-score for each of the four categories are calculated, with higher values indicating a greater degree of autonomy. There has been little psychometric investigation of this measure.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Suicide-related outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Suicide-related outcomes were classified and reported in various ways in each of the trials. As described in the methods section, a post hoc decision was made in the first version of this review to use the data provided in an FDA report (<LINK REF="REF-Hammad-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammad 2004</LINK>) in order to overcome inconsistent reporting of these outcomes across trial reports.</P>
<P>The process of the FDA in establishing the rate of suicide-related outcomes for each trial was based on the following process. A group of 10 suicidology experts were assembled by Columbia University (led by Dr Kelly Posner). Suicide-related outcomes were defined after careful deliberation by this expert panel as including 'definitive suicidal behaviour/ideation' (pg 8, <LINK REF="REF-Hammad-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammad 2004</LINK>) and where more than one event was recorded for an individual, the most severe event was used. The group of experts reviewed all of the suicide-related adverse events, all serious adverse events and all accidental injuries identified by the sponsors of SSRI trials. There was some discrepancy between the sponsors' classifications and the expert panel classification (with 22 new events added, and 26 old events removed). Overall there were no completed suicides in any of the trials. The report highlighted the important point that none of these trials had adequate power for safety analysis.</P>
<P>For this version of the review we have again extracted suicide-related outcomes from trials of depressive disorders from the FDA report (<LINK REF="REF-Hammad-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammad 2004</LINK>) where they were available. Where the FDA did not include data for trials included in our review, we included data from the trial report (for <LINK REF="STD-TADS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">TADS 2004</LINK> data were extracted from the <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2006</LINK> report where it is stated that rates are based on a reanalysis by Columbia Group using the Columbia-Classification Algorithm for Suicidal Assessment); <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2009</LINK> states their data are based on an increase in suicidal ideation and behaviour on the Modified Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (MC-SSRS), a clinician-rated instrument; <LINK REF="STD-Wagner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner 2006</LINK> states that "potential suicide-related events were identified" and describes these in the results as adverse events, which is not equivalent to the data based on the Columbia Classification; for the mirtazapine trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mirtazapine-Trial-1-_x0026_-2" TYPE="STUDY">Mirtazapine Trial 1 &amp; 2</LINK>), the MHRA report gave a description of events stating there was one case of suicidal ideation in the mirtazapine group (both trials combined) and one case of self mutilation in the placebo group (both trials combined). The data for <LINK REF="STD-Paroxetine-Trial-1" TYPE="STUDY">Paroxetine Trial 1</LINK> were suicidal ideation reported as an adverse event. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Almeida_x002d_Montes-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Almeida-Montes 2005</LINK> did not provide data for this outcome.</P>
<P>We have also included, in this version of the review, suicidal ideation as a continuous outcome, which was measured by the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 1987</LINK>) in both trials in which this instrument was used (<LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TADS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">TADS 2004</LINK>).</P>

These are all individual patient parallel-group randomised trials. The two duloxetine and fluvoxamine (<LINK REF="STD-Solvay-NCT00353028" TYPE="STUDY">Solvay NCT00353028</LINK>) trials are multicentre; it is unclear whether <LINK REF="STD-Glod-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Glod 2004</LINK> is a single site or multicentre trial.</P>
<P>The duloxetine (SNRI) trials include two arms of duloxetine, one a flexible dose and one fixed, as well as a fluoxetine arm and a placebo arm all delivered for 10 weeks. These trials include children and adolescents treated in an outpatient setting with MDD according to DSM-IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>) with additional inclusion criteria including a CDRS-R score of &#8805; 45 and a CGI score of &#8805; 4. The trials exclude participants with psychotic features or disorder, substance use or dependence, eating disorders, pervasive developmental disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, a history of bipolar disorder, and those with first degree relatives with bipolar disorder. Those who had made a significant suicide attempt within one year of screening or were currently at risk of suicide in the opinion of the investigator were excluded. It is unclear how long the screening for inclusion takes or whether there is a placebo lead-in phase. There appears to be a continuation period for those on duloxetine with a 36-week follow-up. The CDRS-R is used as the measure of clinician-rated depression symptoms.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Glod-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Glod 2004</LINK> trial, published as a conference abstract, includes three arms: citalopram (SSRI), bupropion (NDRI) and placebo, delivered for eight weeks. It is unclear whether flexible or fixed dosing is used. The trials include adolescents treated in an outpatient setting with MDD according to DSM-IV (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>) with no additional inclusion criteria stated. It is unclear what the screening procedure for trial entry was, or whether there was a placebo lead-in. In addition, it was unclear what psychiatric conditions were excluded or whether those with suicide risk were excluded. The conference abstract did provide some information on the first 18 young people randomised into the trial. Their mean age was 15.5; six were males and 12 females and their baseline level of depression symptom severity was 20.3 on the HAM-D. Few other details were provided.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Solvay-NCT00353028" TYPE="STUDY">Solvay NCT00353028</LINK> trial undertaken in Japan includes two arms: fluvoxamine maleate (flexible dose) (SSRI) and placebo delivered for 38 weeks. Flexible dosing was used (25 mg to 150 mg). The trials include children and adolescents with MDD diagnosed using the Japanese Version of the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression (JSIGH-D) (minimum total score of 18 on the JSIGH-D). An additional inclusion criteria was weight within the standard weight. Exclusion criteria were a predominant psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia, or previously been treated with fluvoxamine maleate.</P>

There were no reports on the success of blinding in any of the trials, and the possibility of clinicians or patients guessing the nature of the intervention from side effects was not discussed. Given outcomes were based on ratings by participants and clinicians, this could be an important omission, although the updated CONSORT guidelines highlight that asking participants or healthcare providers what intervention they received as a test of blinding at the end of the trial is confounded because usually by this stage they know what intervention they received (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>There is some evidence of reporting bias in some of the trials, though this is difficult to assess in most trials, since it was not possible to obtain the trial protocol. The trial report by <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2002</LINK> emphasises CDRS-R scores and remission rates rather than response rate, even although response rate was specified as the primary outcome in the methods section. Additionally, the cut-off used for remission rate differed from that stated in the methods section. <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 1997</LINK> reports outcomes at five weeks rather than at the completion of the trial. In a letter to the editor, <LINK REF="STD-Keller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Keller 2001</LINK> was criticised for changing the definition of response post data analysis to a cut-off that showed treatment effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Jureidini-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jureidini 2003</LINK>). In response, <LINK REF="STD-Keller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Keller 2001</LINK> changed their claim of finding a significant effect to stating that the findings showed a strong signal for efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Jureidini-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jureidini 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keller 2003</LINK>).

For one trial of paroxetine there is no publication except a brief pharmaceutical company trial report.

<P>We judged all trials to be at a high risk of bias, precluding a sensitivity analysis investigating how trials at a high risk of bias modify the pooled treatment effect.</P>
<P>The pooled treatment effect was not modified in a clinically important way with the removal of the antidepressant class SNRI (venlafaxine) (sensitivity analysis pooled treatment effect: RR 1.46; 95% CI 1.00 to 2.12).</P>
<P>Two trials of adolescents only (<LINK REF="STD-TADS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">TADS 2004</LINK> (fluoxetine; N = 221) and <LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2009</LINK> (escitalopram; N = 311)) measured suicidal ideation on the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire self report measure and showed no statistically significant evidence of effect on suicidal ideation for those taking an antidepressant compared with placebo (N = 532; MD 0.70; 95% CI -1.50 to 2.91) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). From the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) report, it was stated that <LINK REF="STD-Wagner-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wagner 2004</LINK> (child and adolescent) showed that citalopram was superior to placebo in reducing suicidal ideation based on item 13 of the CDRS-R; however, the report did not provide an estimate of the effect or measure of precision. Likewise, the MHRA report stated that the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Von-Knorring-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Von Knorring 2006</LINK> (adolescents only) showed that those taking citalopram had a slightly greater improvement in suicidal ideation than placebo, based on item nine of the K-SADS-P.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-09 00:11:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We cannot make any comment on the comparative efficacy of individual antidepressant compounds. However, based on our meta-analyses, there was no evidence that the magnitude of intervention effects (compared with placebo) was modified by individual drug class. Pooled results showed some evidence that depression symptoms were reduced and that remission/response rates were higher in those taking a newer generation antidepressant compared to placebo. The clinical importance of these effects is unclear. Overall, the reduction in depression symptoms was relatively small at 3.51 (on a scale with a range from 17 to 113) (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>) and remission rates overall increased from 380 per 1000 (based on the median risk in the placebo group at post intervention) to 448 per 1000 (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Even for those drugs that had consistent evidence of efficacy across more than one outcome (fluoxetine and escitalopram), the reduction in average scores was 5.63 lower for those taking fluoxetine and 2.67 lower for those on escitalopram compared with those on placebo. <LINK REF="REF-Poznanski-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poznanski 1996</LINK> found a difference of 25 points on the CDRS-R scale between a clinically referred depressed group (n = 60) and a non clinical group (n = 223), and a difference of 19 points between clinically referred groups with (n = 60) and without depressive disorder (n = 18) (<LINK REF="REF-Poznanski-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poznanski 1996</LINK>, pg 53). There was also a relatively small effect on functioning with those receiving fluoxetine and escitalopram having a score on average 3.08 higher and 2.28 points higher respectively than placebo on the CGAS (range 0 to 100). For fluoxetine, remission rates overall increased from 214 per 1000 (based on the median risk in the placebo groups at post intervention) to 315 per 1000 (a difference of 101 with 95% confidence interval (CI) from 6 more to 231 more). While significantly more young people recover if on fluoxetine, the remission rates are relatively low overall indicating many young people do not experience a clinically meaningful reduction in symptoms. Methodological issues including large attrition rates and inappropriate outcome measurement, with the associated potential for selective reporting, make it difficult to draw conclusions about the clinical benefit.</P>
<P>In addition, the efficacy results need to be balanced with evidence about adverse outcomes. Over all drugs, the risk of a suicide-related outcome for those taking antidepressants was 58% (95% CI 2%
 to 245%) higher compared to those taking placebo. This equates to an increased of risk in a group with a median baseline risk from 25 in 1000 to 40 in 1000 (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). There was some variability in the risk of suicide-related outcomes across the drugs (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 22%; 95% CI 0% to 58%), but this was not statistically significantly different. Suicidal ideation was only measured in two trials with no effect of antidepressant treatment evident. Adverse events were greater for those taking an antidepressant, and there was no effect of antidepressant on the rate of trial completion.</P>
<P>There were few data available to investigate whether age modified the intervention effect. There was no evidence from the available data that age modified the effects of antidepressant medication. The evidence of the effectiveness of antidepressants for children was inconsistent, with a small overall reduction in depression symptoms (3.18) and remission rates in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2002</LINK>) of 44% for those receiving fluoxetine compared to 18% for those receiving placebo and in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2006</LINK>) 69% for those receiving escitalopram and 52% for those receiving placebo. For adolescents, there was consistent evidence across both these outcomes of antidepressants compared with placebo. However, the same cautions apply in terms of methodological considerations and the size of the effects.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-09-26 10:00:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review, to our knowledge, we have presented data on efficacy and adverse outcomes, including suicide-related outcomes, from all published and unpublished trials examining the use of newer antidepressants for child and adolescent depressive disorder. Despite attempts to contact all trial authors, as well as pharmaceutical companies responsible for funding the included trials, there are many instances of missing data in terms of effect estimates. In two cases there is very limited reporting of trials by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with publication in peer-reviewed journals not yet available (<LINK REF="STD-Mirtazapine-Trial-1-_x0026_-2" TYPE="STUDY">Mirtazapine Trial 1 &amp; 2</LINK>). Likewise the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Simeon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Simeon 1990</LINK>, which was stopped early, has never been published. We were unable to obtain any further report of the trial <LINK REF="STD-Glod-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Glod 2004</LINK>, the preliminary findings of which were published in a conference abstract.</P>
<P>The comparator group has an impact on the size of the effect and, in this case, the size of the effect in the placebo groups in these trials has been commented on (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Jureidini-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jureidini 2004</LINK>) and authors of the included trial reports themselves have commented, suggesting, for example, that this may be to do with the large amount of contact trial participants receive. Trials consistently include regular (often weekly) assessments and in a significant number of trials some sort of supportive contact or therapy was allowed. The interaction between participants and trial investigators was seldom standardised, as shown in a trial specifically investigating this issue, and while this interaction is typical of what takes place in real world clinical encounters, it impacts in an unknown way on the detection of differences between the active drug and placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Dunlop-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunlop 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The characteristics of the participants also impact on the intervention effect. It is possible, for example, that the effect shown in the fluoxetine trials may be due to exclusion of placebo responders in the lead-in time to the start of the trial. The placebo remission rate was higher in trials of other compounds and has previously been cited as a cause for concern regarding the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (<LINK REF="REF-Newman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 2004</LINK>). Again, it is notable that in the trials of fluoxetine the attrition rate was consistently higher in the placebo group compared with the fluoxetine group. There were generally very high attrition rates in all of the trials and it is unclear what effect this has on treatment estimates.</P>
<P>The young people in the trials are not likely to be representative of clinical populations typically seen in public child and adolescent mental health services as most trials included recruitment using advertisement, excluded many comorbid disorders, and in many trials excluded those who responded to placebo in the lead-in stage of the trial. Also excluded were those at risk of suicide despite suicide-related behaviours and comorbidity being significant features of clinically referred young people with depressive disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Birmaher-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birmaher 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kovacs-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovacs 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marttunen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marttunen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petersen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 1993</LINK>). The baseline severity of young people included was in the moderately severely ill range, with a large proportion of included participants experiencing their first episode of depression (although in many cases this first episode was of a long duration). The effectiveness of newer generation antidepressants in young people with more severe disorders and complex presentations, including comorbid conditions and suicide risk, is therefore unknown.</P>

<P>There was limited information on the conduct of trials in relation to allocation concealment, blinding and compliance. Blinding is an issue when clinician-rated scales are the main outcome, particularly in the context of an inactive placebo where it may be possible to guess the assigned treatment group given side and other physiological effects likely in this group (<LINK REF="REF-Moncrieff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moncrieff 2004</LINK>). In most cases the write-up simply indicated that the trial was 'double-blind', some stating that the placebo and medication capsules were identical and some stating that clinicians or trial personnel and participants were blinded. Only one trial specifically stated that outcome assessors were blinded.</P>
<P>The issue of reporting bias is important. <LINK REF="REF-Kirsch-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirsch 2008</LINK> highlight in their meta-analysis of all trials of antidepressants submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that effect sizes are smaller when unpublished studies are included and <LINK REF="REF-Turner-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2008</LINK> showed that whether and how trials of antidepressants were published depended on the outcome of the trial. We located several trials that have not been fully reported or published at all. It is also worth noting that in many cases we were unable to obtain the required data from the published paper but had to contact authors or the pharmaceutical company. Reporting bias within the published reports of included trials was difficult to assess given the conduct of a trial can be obscured in the write-up for publication. Full and explicit reporting of changes in outcome definition was only undertaken by one investigator, however the primary outcome was reported and findings discussed (<LINK REF="STD-Emslie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jureidini-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jureidini 2004</LINK>). The possibility of reporting bias was highlighted in a letter to the editor regarding post hoc alterations of response definitions in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Keller-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Keller 2001</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Jureidini-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jureidini 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>What level of improvement constitutes a meaningful clinical outcome is uncertain given response and remission were defined and reported variously both within and across trials, with the noted possibility of alteration of this definition, and the possibility of reporting bias as a result.</P>
<P>There was evidence of inappropriate methods of imputation with trialists often using last observation carried forward data (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2009</LINK>). It was often the case that some randomised patients were not included in the final analysis.</P>
<P>The majority of trials were pharmaceutically funded. Two of the four fluoxetine trials were not pharmaceutically funded (<LINK REF="STD-Emslie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TADS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">TADS 2004</LINK>) (the TADS trial had an unrestricted education grant from Eli Lily). Research has shown that across different health fields, pharmaceutically funded studies are more likely to have results favouring the pharmaceutical company's product (<LINK REF="REF-Lexchin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lexchin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sismondo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sismondo 2008</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measurement issues</HEADING>
<P>A standard definition of remission or response would have been ideal; however, to calculate this individual patient data would have been necessary. Further, given a diagnosis of major depressive disorder on DSM criteria was an entry criterion for most of the trials, this may be considered the most desirable outcome measure.</P>
<P>Additionally, given symptom improvement or resolution does not necessarily correlate with improvements in functioning (see <LINK REF="REF-Winters-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winters 2005</LINK> for a review), the latter would seem a more clinically important patient outcome to collect. However, this was inconsistently measured and reported on scales that often did not have established psychometric properties. In trials that used the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) (an adaptation of the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) used in adults), there was some evidence that functioning was improved for those on an antidepressant compared with placebo. Self report data may also tap an outcome that is meaningful to the young person, however, few individual trials reported this.</P>
<P>The trials are designed only to examine the short-term effects of antidepressant medication, however, this does not preclude the possibility that the effectiveness of treatment is only apparent over a longer period of time. Long-term follow-up would be required to assess this.</P>

<P>It should be noted that the review process included collection of data from various sources. There were more complete data for the trials on paroxetine due to publication of trial reports by SmithKline Beecham on the internet. Details of aspects of trial methodology were relatively brief even in this case. Information and data from other trials were taken variously from scientific journal publications, from the MHRA data and, in some cases, obtained directly from trial authors and pharmaceutical companies.</P>
<P>We were unable to obtain a large number of potentially relevant publications to screen for inclusion. The majority of these were conference proceedings and there is some evidence that such data are often not published and that publication is associated with positive results (<LINK REF="REF-Sherer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherer 2007</LINK>). However, funnel plots for the outcomes remission and suicide-related behaviour were not suggestive of small-study effects and, moreover, the contour-enhanced funnel plots did not indicate that statistically significant results were more likely to be reported.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-09-26 11:26:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The issue of the efficacy of antidepressants and the associated suicide risk has been the topic of much research, review and debate in the literature.</P>
<P>Healy was one of the first to publish regarding the possibility of an increased risk of suicide associated with SSRIs (<LINK REF="REF-Healy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Healy 2003</LINK>). Since then, observational studies have highlighted an association between antidepressant use and suicide risk in adolescents. For example, <LINK REF="REF-Olfson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olfson 2006</LINK> showed an association between use of antidepressants and suicide attempt in children and adolescents and <LINK REF="REF-Simon-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2006b</LINK> showed a greater risk of suicide attempt that resulted in hospitalisation for children and adolescents compared with adults.</P>
<P>Data on risk of suicide for children and adolescents have also come from meta-analyses based on trial data submitted to the FDA (<LINK REF="REF-Hammad-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammad 2006</LINK>) and the Committee on Safety in Medicines in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Dubicka-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubicka 2006</LINK>) that show similar results to our review. These findings have more recently been extended to young adults (18 to 25-year olds) (<LINK REF="REF-Stone-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2009</LINK>). Additionally, <LINK REF="REF-Dubicka-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubicka 2006</LINK> analysed these data by type of suicide-related outcome showing suicidal ideation in 1.2% of those on SSRIs compared with 0.8% on placebo (odds ratio (OR) 1.45; 95% CI 0.54 to 3.88), self harm in 3.3% of those on SSRIs versus 2.6% on placebo (OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.70 to 2.97) and attempts in 1.9% of those on an SSRI versus 1.2% on placebo (OR 1.70; 95% CI 0.76 to 3.81) (<LINK REF="REF-Dubicka-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubicka 2006</LINK>). Another review (<LINK REF="REF-Bridge-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridge 2007</LINK>) calculated the risk difference for suicide-related behaviours for antidepressant versus placebo for major depressive disorder (MDD) (13 trials), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (six trials) and non OCD anxiety disorders (six trials). The risk difference for suicide-related behaviours was not statistically significant for MDD alone, although the risk ratio was 1.6; 95% CI 1.0 to 2.7 (<LINK REF="REF-Bridge-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridge 2007</LINK>). The risk difference calculated by <LINK REF="REF-Bridge-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridge 2007</LINK> was 1% compared with a risk difference of 1.5% based on risk ratio (assuming a median baseline risk) calculated in this review.</P>
<P>Counter to this evidence showing an increase in suicide-related behaviours, several arguments have been mounted.</P>
<P>Firstly, observational and ecological studies have shown no increased suicide risk related to antidepressant use. For example, observational studies by <LINK REF="REF-Valuck-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valuck 2004</LINK> (a retrospective cohort study) and <LINK REF="REF-Sondergard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sondergard 2006</LINK> (a register-linkage study) showed no statistically significant increases in suicide attempt (hazard ratio (HR) 1.43; 95% CI 0.89 to 2.82) and completed suicide (RR 4.47; 95% CI 0.95 to 20.96) (respectively) for children and adolescents taking antidepressants. Two reviews of studies investigating this link highlighted that observational studies have not shown a strong association between antidepressants and suicide risk (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Isacsson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isacsson 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Hall-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2006</LINK> highlighted that observational studies have tended to show that those at increased risk of suicide were more likely to be prescribed an antidepressant (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2006</LINK>) and therefore the association between antidepressant use and adolescent suicide-related behaviours may be more likely to be explained by severity of depression, and not caused by the antidepressant (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2006</LINK>). However, issues of potential confounding bias arising in observational studies are minimised in trials where, on average, those in the intervention and control groups are comparable in both measured and unmeasured confounders.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Isacsson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isacsson 2010</LINK> have highlighted that the majority of ecological studies have shown that suicide mortality has decreased when SSRI use has increased in various counties or regions (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2006</LINK>). However, these studies either have not included children and adolescents or analysed this age group separately, with the exception of <LINK REF="REF-Olfson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olfson 2003</LINK> in the US. <LINK REF="REF-Olfson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olfson 2003</LINK> showed that increasing use of antidepressants was associated with a decreased suicide rate. A subsequent study using US and Dutch data showed a decrease in SSRI prescriptions associated with an increased suicide rate in both countries (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbons-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbons 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are shortcomings to these types of ecological studies, which have been discussed in the debate in this area. It is commonly acknowledged that ecological studies are not able to establish a causal link. For example, it could be that there are lower suicide rates in countries with less stigma associated with seeking intervention for mental health disorders, where antidepressant prescriptions rates are therefore higher (<LINK REF="REF-Gunnell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunnell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2006</LINK>). Ecological studies have focused on short time periods, for example, <LINK REF="REF-Healy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Healy 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Reseland-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reseland 2008</LINK> contend that ecological studies have omitted data from the 1960s and 1970s when suicide rates climbed despite the largest increase in antidepressant use seen in the last few decades; <LINK REF="REF-Safer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safer 2007</LINK> similarly argues that time periods prior to the introduction of SSRIs have not been included when drops in suicide rates were observed. Another issue of ecological studies is that the relationships observed between variables at the aggregated level may not be the same as those observed at the individual level. An example of this is the possibility that increased use of antidepressants may be due to chronic users not new users, whose risk of treatment-induced suicide is less (<LINK REF="REF-Reseland-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reseland 2008</LINK>). There are issues of confounding, for example fluctuations in suicide rates may be due to cultural and religious factors (<LINK REF="REF-De-Leo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Leo 2002</LINK>). Further, there is the issue of redefinition of the outcome over time. For example, reanalysis of data on suicide rates, antidepressant sales and autopsy in Nordic countries highlighted the possibility that observed decreases in suicide rates may be due to falling autopsy rates, and an associated increased in the rate of deaths from unspecified causes (<LINK REF="REF-Reseland-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reseland 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, the observation of increased suicide rates associated with a decrease in the rate of SSRI prescriptions may be because the recent censure of SSRIs has resulted in pessimism about being able to provide effective treatment. This may have caused both a decrease in help seeking and a disinclination to diagnose depressive disorders, supported by data showing decreased rates of diagnosis for child and adolescent depression in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Libby-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Libby 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The fact that there were no reports of completed suicide in a total sample of 2240 young people has been highlighted. However, suicide is a rare event and much larger sample sizes with longer follow-up would be needed to assess the risk fully. <LINK REF="REF-Healy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Healy 2009</LINK> cautions that it is more accurate to state that no suicides were recorded and notes that large loss to follow-up makes it possible that suicides did occur. Research suggests that the best predictor of eventual suicide completion is previous suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour so that an increase in rates of these outcomes may increase the risk of future suicide completion (<LINK REF="REF-Andrews-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brent-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brent 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brent-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brent 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewinsohn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewinsohn 1996</LINK>). The trials included in our review and others do not provide long enough follow-up to determine whether short-term increased risk of suicide-related outcomes is subsequently followed by a longer-term risk reduction. An increase in risk followed by a steadily decreasing risk has been shown within one month of starting antidepressant use in one trial of adults (<LINK REF="REF-Jick-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jick 2004</LINK>). Data on timing of suicidal risk has been analysed from the <LINK REF="STD-TADS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">TADS 2004</LINK> trial and showed that there was no decrease in risk after one month as seen in adult data, again meaning it is unclear if there is a longer-term risk reduction.</P>
<P>In all reviews the rates of suicide-related behaviour are much lower than reports of suicidal ideation and behaviour in adolescents from the community. In some population-based studies suicidal ideation is reported by as many as 12% to 23% of young people and suicide attempts by 4% to 8% of adolescents aged 13 to 18 years (<LINK REF="REF-AHRG-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRG 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grunbaum-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grunbaum 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewinsohn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewinsohn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sawyer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sawyer 2001</LINK>). This could be explained by exclusion of those at risk of suicide from all but two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Emslie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Emslie 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Von-Knorring-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Von Knorring 2006</LINK>). Most trials also excluded those with many co-morbid conditions. Co-morbidity is related to an increased risk of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Andrews-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Asarnow-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asarnow 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brent-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brent 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Esposito-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esposito 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kovacs-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovacs 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaffer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaffer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetzler-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetzler 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The findings regarding an increased risk of suicide-related behaviours need to be balanced with concerns regarding the risk of untreated depression and the need to balance benefits and harms (<LINK REF="REF-AACAP-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">AACAP 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ebmeier-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebmeier 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several reviews of the efficacy of SSRIs in children and adolescents with depression have been published. Earlier reviews based conclusions on narrative summaries of individual trial results (<LINK REF="REF-Brent-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brent 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cheung-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wagner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wagner 2005</LINK>) not meta-analyses. Of these, the conclusions of <LINK REF="REF-Cheung-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 2005</LINK> are the most conservative, stating data are limited, commenting specifically on the inappropriateness of the outcomes used and cautioning clinicians to consider the use of SSRIs carefully.</P>
<P>A number of meta-analyses have been also published. In earlier meta-analyses <LINK REF="REF-Jureidini-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jureidini 2004</LINK> highlighted methodological problems, particularly regarding reporting, and concluded cautiously that there is only a small benefit of SSRIs that should be balanced with the risks. In contrast <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2004</LINK> concluded SSRIs are an effective treatment for adolescent depression based on data published up to that point. In the same year, a review by <LINK REF="REF-Whittington-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittington 2004</LINK> highlighted the change in risk-benefit profile when unpublished data were included; their inclusion resulted in a favourable risk-benefit profile only for fluoxetine, with a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 6 (95% CI 4 to 15) for remission, and 5 (95% CI 4 to 13) for response. More recently, <LINK REF="REF-Tsapakis-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsapakis 2008</LINK> has published a systematic review including meta-analyses of any antidepressant (including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), SSRIs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and new antidepressants) for children and adolescents up to the age of 20 with a depressive disorder. The authors' conclusions were cautious, highlighting limited efficacy, particularly for children and in studies that combine adolescents and children. They found little appreciable difference between different types of antidepressants, however, suggesting that fluoxetine may be more effective, especially for adolescents. Similar to our findings, they questioned the appropriateness of outcome measures and noted that the young people included in trials may not be representative of more classic 'adult major depression' and may be less severe that young people typically seen in clinical practice.</P>
<P>In a meta-analysis of antidepressants for all age groups, <LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2008</LINK> questioned the appropriateness of outcome measures used and highlighted issues related to selective and distorted reporting and interpretation, calling into the question the effectiveness of antidepressants even in adult populations.</P>
<P>The results of our review present a dilemma for those treating young people with depressive disorders. While overall the reduction in depression symptoms is statistically significant, there are questions about the clinical effectiveness. The trials are of young people not representative of those typically presenting for treatment in clinics and furthermore they had some significant methodological shortcomings, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Potential benefit must be balanced with the finding that SSRIs are associated with a statistically significant increased risk of suicide-related behaviour (a combination of suicidal ideation and definitive suicidal behaviour). Much debate on this matter has taken place, with variable views.</P>
<P>While there is a lack of power to adequately examine rare events such as suicide-related outcomes in trials, meta-analysis offers a method for obtaining reliable evidence for these rare outcomes across trials. Given a lack of consistent measurement of various aspects of suicide risk, the clinical implications of the findings are still somewhat unclear.</P>
<P>It is unknown how children and adolescents with a depressive disorder and co-morbid conditions, who are at risk of suicide (i.e. those more typical of the young people who present at health services), would respond to SSRIs. Overall, the data regarding the benefits of SSRIs for child and adolescent depression are far from compelling while the information on the risks is limited.</P>
<P>Clinically, it must be kept in mind that there are significant risks in not treating depressive disorder, which has an increased risk of suicide completion, as well as impacts on academic and social functioning (<LINK REF="REF-Brent-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brent 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ebmeier-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebmeier 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fleming-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleming 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewinsohn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewinsohn 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rao-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 1995</LINK>).</P>

<P>The evidence for the effectiveness of newer generation antidepressants compared with placebo in the treatment of depressive disorder in children and adolescents is not compelling; the overall effects of antidepressants compared with placebo were not modified by drug. The methodological shortcomings of the trials make it difficult to interpret outcome data on the efficacy of newer generation antidepressant medications. This is a particularly unsatisfactory since large numbers of children and adolescents have participated in trials, and we are still unable to answer the important clinical question of whether antidepressant medications are effective in treating depressive disorders. The search for treatments that reliably lead to good clinical outcomes must continue.</P>
<P>Even when there is evidence that newer generation antidepressants reduce depression symptom severity, it is unclear whether the difference in effect between antidepressants and placebo reflects a difference that is of clinical importance to patients. As trials have largely been done in children and adolescents with no co-morbid conditions and with no significant suicidal ideation, it is unclear how children and adolescents with more serious difficulties and those at risk of suicide would respond. There is evidence to suggest an increased risk of suicide-related behaviours (combined suicidal ideation and definitive suicidal behaviour) in those treated with antidepressant medication, but the importance of this is unclear as is the association between antidepressant medication and suicide completion. Untreated depressive disorder is associated with the risk of completed suicide and impacts on academic and social functioning.</P>
<P>For clinicians, the results of the review may mean that the threshold of severity for treatment of a depressive disorder with antidepressant medication is raised. Clinicians should make every effort to present the information on the potential benefits and risks of SSRIs, including the risks of untreated depression, and together with the child or adolescent and their family, consider the various options for treatment. This should include consideration of psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy and other non medication options. The risk of suicide should be assessed and, if medication is used, this should be monitored particularly closely. If a decision to use medication is agreed, then fluoxetine might be considered given it is recommended as first-line medication in guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-McDermott-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDermott 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>), although based on this review no definitive recommendations can potentially be made until the comparative effectiveness of individual drugs is examined in a multiple-treatment meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Given the evidence does not clearly answer questions about the effectiveness and harms of newer generation antidepressants, there is a need for further research.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-09-26 10:00:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is clear from the results that we need more effective treatments for depressive disorders in young people. The debate about efficacy and risk of suicide illustrates that there is no one clearly effective treatment. Young people with a depressive disorder who present for treatment are likely to be different to those in the included trials in this review; moreover those presenting for treatment in clinical services are heterogenous. Trials should include young people more typical of those presenting to clinical services and allow analysis of different subgroups of these young people. This may be an important avenue of new research, for example, there may be a genetic underpinning to medication responsiveness.</P>
<P>Trials that are undertaken should address the methodological shortcomings identified in this review, including adequate blinding, particularly of outcome assessors, consistent definition and use of clinically important outcomes and longer-term follow-up.</P>
<P>Within the context of the currently available trial data, individual patient data meta-analyses may be useful in examining whether the effect of treatment differs in particular subgroups.</P>
<P>In the meantime, given clinicians require guidance in terms of which individual antidepressant medication to use, in order to more robustly examine the comparative efficacy of these compounds, a multiple-treatment meta-analysis should be undertaken.</P>

<P>Inclusion criteria have changed for this version of the review and now include all 'second and third' or newer antidepressant compounds. Additionally, sub-syndromal depression was not included.</P>
<P>We have added as an objective the aim to look at effectiveness by drug type; this analysis was undertaken in the first review but not explicitly described in the objectives.</P>
<P>Analysis has been reorganised such that there is not a separate meta-analysis for each antidepressant compound, rather, these have become one of two subgroup analyses.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2012-09-25 13:50:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where different depression symptom severity rating scales were used, for the purpose of pooling results, we chose the single best available outcome measure according to a hierarchy based on psychometric properties and appropriateness for use with children and adolescents. The hierarchy has been updated since the first publication of the review and is based on the reviews of Hazell and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Hazell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hazell 2002</LINK>), Petti (<LINK REF="REF-Petti-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petti 1985</LINK>) and Brooks and Kutchers (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 2001</LINK>). We also took into consideration the most commonly used tools in the trials included in the original Cochrane review by Hetrick and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Hetrick-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hetrick 2007</LINK>). Finally, in this version of the review, we have also included self rated depression symptom severity tools and separated the hierarchy according to whether the tool is clinician or self rated. The hierarchy is as follows:</P>

<P>(Note: The CDRS-R was adapted for children and adolescents from the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), a tool validated and commonly used in adult populations (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 2001</LINK>). Both the CDRS-R and HAM-D have good reliability and validity. The MADRS was also based on the HAM-D but designed to better assess sensitivity to change. It was not designed specifically for children and adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 2001</LINK>).</P>
