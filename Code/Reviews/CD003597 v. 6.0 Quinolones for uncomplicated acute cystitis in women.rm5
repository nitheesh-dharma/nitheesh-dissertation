<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>There is no evidence of difference in clinical and microbiological efficacy of quinolones for uncomplicated acute cystitis in women, but there is some evidence of differences in occurrence and range of adverse reactions.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Urinary tract infection (UTI) refers to the presence of a certain threshold number of bacteria in the urine. Bacterial cystitis (bacteria in the bladder, also called acute cystitis) can occur in men and women and the signs and symptoms include dysuria (pain on passing urine), frequency, cloudy urine, occasionally haematuria (blood in the urine), and is often associated with pyuria (high urine white blood cell count). There is an additional important distinction between complicated and uncomplicated UTI. Complicated UTIs are those associated with fever and/or back pain (indicating kidney infection), UTIs in men, UTIs associated with indwelling or intermittent urinary catheters, obstructive uropathy (any changes in the urinary tract due to obstruction), vesicoureteric reflux (urine travels from the bladder back up toward the kidneys) and other urological abnormalities. These types of infections require more intensive treatment. Uncomplicated acute cystitis is the most prevalent form of uncomplicated UTI in women. Quinolones are recommended as the drugs of choice for acute cystitis in regions where the level of resistance to other antimicrobials namely co-trimoxazole is high. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate which quinolone is most effective in treating uncomplicated acute cystitis and to also investigate safety and how well they are tolerated. Eleven studies (7535 women) were identified. No two studies compared the same quinolones. We found no significant differences in clinical or microbiological efficacy between quinolones. Several adverse events were reported in the individual studies. These included photosensitivity, insomnia, skin adverse events, central nervous system adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal to treatment. We were unable to determine which quinolone would be the safest or the most tolerated due to the lack of head-to-head data.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Uncomplicated acute cystitis is one of the most common bacterial infections in adults. The percentage of women who have at least one episode of acute cystitis is estimated to be between 40% to 50%.

Any adverse event, adverse events causing withdrawal, skin adverse events, photosensitivity reactions were more common for lomefloxacin when compared to norfloxacin. Any adverse event, adverse drug reactions, CNS adverse events were more common for ofloxacin when compared to ciprofloxacin. CNS adverse events and insomnia were more often reported for rufloxacin when compared to pefloxacin. Adverse drug reactions occurred frequently for ofloxacin than levofloxacin. Insomnia was reported more frequently for enoxacin than ciprofloxacin.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-15 10:47:46 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common with an estimated annual global incidence of at least 250 million cases, and are costly to both patients and healthcare funding systems (<LINK REF="REF-Ronald-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ronald 2001</LINK>). Uncomplicated infections account for the greatest number of UTIs. The distinction between uncomplicated and complicated UTIs is important because of implications regarding pre- and post-treatment evaluation, type and duration of antimicrobial regimens and extent of evaluation of the urinary tract (<LINK REF="REF-Bacheller-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacheller 1997</LINK>). Acute cystitis is the most prevalent form of uncomplicated UTI. In the USA over seven million cases of acute cystitis are registered each year, equating to approximately one billion US dollars (<LINK REF="REF-Schappert-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schappert 1994</LINK>). The percentage of women who have at least one episode of acute cystitis is estimated to be between 40% to 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Kunin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunin 1994</LINK>). The organisms most often responsible for UTIs are the gram-negative bacteria of group Enterobacteriaceae. <I>Escherichia coli</I> (<I>E. coli)</I> causes approximately 80% of UTIs and <I>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</I> is the second most common pathogen, particularly in young women (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Factors that should be considered in selecting drugs for the treatment of uncomplicated acute cystitis include the antimicrobial activity (broad or narrow) of the agent, pharmacokinetics favouring wider dosing intervals, the prevalence of resistance in local urinary pathogens, the duration of adequate urinary antimicrobial levels, the effect on the faecal and vaginal flora, the potential for undesirable side effects and the cost of the treatment regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Hooton-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooton 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hooton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooton 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neu-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neu 1992</LINK>). People with acute cystitis are usually treated as outpatients and therefore tolerance and antimicrobial safety need to be carefully considered. Adverse reactions may result in non-compliance, administration of another drug and, in some cases, hospitalisation. These factors lead to cost increases and reduction in quality of life. Antimicrobials with proven efficacy in acute cystitis are co-trimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, quinolones (including fluoroquinolones) and fosfomycin trometamol (<LINK REF="REF-Naber-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naber 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naber-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naber 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warren-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 1999</LINK>). Increased resistance to co-trimoxazole however, may reduce its effectiveness in the treatment of uncomplicated acute cystitis as there has been shown to be a correlation between resistance and eradication of <I>E. coli </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Minassian-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minassian 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>Quinolones have good activity against <I>E. coli</I>, achieve high urinary concentrations and have minimal effect on the natural vaginal protective flora (lactobacilli and anaerobes) (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1999</LINK>). Once or twice-daily dose regimens may be used for administering these antimicrobials, providing the possibility of enhanced compliance. In addition, urinary pathogen resistance is rarer for quinolones when compared with co-trimoxazole. Treatment regimens for quinolones include single dose, three- or seven-day schedules, however single dose regimen is not considered suitable because of fewer cures and increased recurrence rates (<LINK REF="REF-Norrby-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norrby 1990a</LINK>). A seven-day course has greater potential for side effects, is more expensive and has not been shown to have an improved therapeutic effect. The short (three-day) course appears to offer the best combination of efficacy and decreased risk of side effects and toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recent reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Echols-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Echols 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warren-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 1999</LINK>) have focused on the microbiological efficacy and factors influencing therapy outcomes of several different antimicrobials. But no author studied the adverse reactions of quinolones. <LINK REF="REF-Hooton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooton 1997</LINK> suggested that clinically significant differences in safety and tolerance may exist among different quinolones.</P>
<P>The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerance of different quinolones for the treatment of uncomplicated acute cystitis in women.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-15 10:07:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute cystitis is one of the most common illnesses for which antibiotics are prescribed in primary care. Specifically, the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) as a first-line agent for uncomplicated cystitis is recommended only in areas where TMP-SMX resistance prevalence is 10% to 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 1999</LINK>). In areas where resistance to TMP-SMX exceeds this rate, alternative agents need to be considered such as quinolones. We identified 11 RCTs reporting clinical and microbiological outcomes in patients with uncomplicated acute cystitis treated with differing quinolones.</P>
<P>The results of any systematic review are totally dependent on obtaining a reasonable number of high quality studies. The methodological quality of all studies was relatively high. Ten of 11 studies had an adequate method of allocation concealment, 10/11 studies were double blinded (blinding of patients and outcome assessors) and one the outcome assessors were blinded. All studies showed results for bacteriological cure rate and clinically important outcomes such as cure of symptoms. Adverse events were described in 10 studies. Criteria for the diagnosis of uncomplicated acute cystitis was well described in all studies.</P>
<P>The lower age limit was 18 years in all studies, however the upper age limits varied from 55 (<LINK REF="STD-Richard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 2000</LINK>) to 75 years (<LINK REF="STD-Jardin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jardin 1995</LINK>). In three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Iravani-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Iravani 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iravani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Iravani 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCarty-1999" TYPE="STUDY">McCarty 1999</LINK>) the upper age limit was not specified. Taking into account that in postmenopausal women UTIs, including acute cystitis, occur more frequently, the differences in premenopausal-to-postmenopausal women ratio may be a source of heterogeneity. It was impossible to do a subgroup analysis of postmenopausal women.</P>
<P>Another possible source of heterogeneity between studies is the different handling of patients with organisms resistant to the study drugs. In five studies such patients were excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Henry-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iravani-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Iravani 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iravani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Iravani 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jardin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Jardin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 2000</LINK>), in two studies they were not excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Neringer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Neringer 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richard-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 2002</LINK>) and in the remaining four studies there was no information provided. However the number of patients excluded due to the above mentioned reason was not high.</P>
<P>Which quinolone/s should be used for uncomplicated acute cystitis? None of the eleven studies comparing different quinolones showed significant advantages for any drugs with respect to clinical or bacteriological outcomes. Significant differences were found in the occurrence of adverse drug reactions. Differences in the safety and tolerability of quinolones are well recognized. For example, temafloxacin was withdrawn from use in June 1992, and the use of trovafloxacin was restricted to the management of only serious infections in June 1999. The safety profiles of these two drugs represent significant divergence from those of other agents in this class. Due to such difference in safety profiles, quinolones cannot be considered interchangeable or of equal safety.</P>
<P>We found more frequent occurrences of:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Photosensitivity reactions when using sparfloxacin versus ofloxacin.</LI>
<LI>Any adverse event, adverse events causing withdrawal, skin adverse events, photosensitivity reactions when using lomefloxacin versus norfloxacin.</LI>
<LI>Any adverse event, adverse reactions, CNS adverse events when using ofloxacin versus ciprofloxacin</LI>
<LI>CNS adverse events, insomnia when using rufloxacin compared to pefloxacin</LI>
<LI>Adverse drug reactions when using ofloxacin versus levofloxacin</LI>
<LI>Insomnia when using fleroxacin versus ciprofloxacin.</LI>
</UL>
<P>However as no two studies compared the same quinolones, we were unable to determine which quinolone should be used for uncomplicated acute cystitis in women.</P>

<P>The following implications for practice concerning management of uncomplicated acute cystitis in women with quinolones have been identified:</P>
<UL>
<LI>There are no significant differences in efficacy between different comparable quinolones for uncomplicated acute cystitis.</LI>
<LI>Some quinolones have significantly lower rate of adverse drug reactions (events) than others.</LI>

</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further RCTs are required to determine the benefits and harms of quinolones for uncomplicated acute cystitis in women. Safety data are important outcomes and should be reported for in all studies comparing quinolones. </P>
