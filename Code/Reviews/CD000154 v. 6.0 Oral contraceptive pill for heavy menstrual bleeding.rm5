<P>Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common cause for referral to gynaecologists in countries like the UK. It is a debilitating social and health condition, and it can result in anaemia. The oral contraceptive pill can provide control of the menstrual cycle and a thinner endometrium (the lining of the uterus shed during menstruation). The review showed that the pill reduced menstrual blood loss, but there are not enough data to determine its value in comparison with other drugs.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) is a benign yet debilitating social and health condition. Treatments prescribed in order to reduce excessive menstrual blood loss include prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, antifibrinolytics, the oral contraceptive pill and other hormones. The combined oral contraceptive pill (OCP) is claimed to have a variety of beneficial, inducing a regular shedding of a thinner endometrium and inhibiting ovulation thus having the effect of treating menorrhagia and providing contraception.</P>

</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-08-03 16:00:46 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (search dates: Oct 1996, May 2002, June 2004, April 2006 and June 2009) for all publications which describe randomised trials of OCP for the treatment of menorrhagia. This register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, the hand searching of 20 relevant journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled comparisons of OCP versus other medical therapies, placebo or no treatment for the treatment of menorrhagia. Women of reproductive years with regular heavy periods, measured either objectively or subjectively and greater than, or equal to, two months follow up.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>All assessments of trial quality and data extraction were performed unblinded by at least two reviewers. Only one trial of 45 women met the inclusion criteria and none were excluded. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-10 12:41:09 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>As the trial used a cross-over design, only data from the first treatment period (cycles three and four) were analysed. The results from all the three mefenamic acid groups were combined. There was no significant difference in menstrual blood loss (MBL) between those women treated with the OCP and danazol, mefenamic acid or naproxen.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>One small study found no significant difference between groups treated with OCP, mefenamic acid, low dose danazol or naproxen. Overall, the evidence from the one study is not sufficient to adequately assess the effectiveness of OCP. </P>
<P>This review was unable to achieve its stated objectives because of the paucity of the data.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-10 12:36:50 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-08-10 12:36:50 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>Heavy menstrual bleeding is a benign yet debilitating social and health condition. This concern with abnormal menstruation is especially a problem of the twentieth century. Previously, late menarche, early menopause, prolonged periods of childbearing and lactational amenorrhoea reduced the number of menses experienced by women in their lifetime. The reduction of family size, by the widespread use of contraception and sterilisation has resulted in an approximate tenfold increase in the number of periods that women experience in their reproductive life (<LINK REF="REF-Short-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Short 1976</LINK>). Also, modern contraceptive practices and the widespread use of sterilisation mean that many women will not have experienced a spontaneous menstrual cycle for around ten years prior to and during their childbearing years.</P>
<P>Many methods have been used to measure menstrual blood loss but the presently preferred technique involves the determination of the concentration of haemoglobin in menstrual fluid by its conversion to alkaline haematin (<LINK REF="REF-Hallberg-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallberg 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newton-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newton 1977</LINK>). This method is not normally available except for research purposes, so the clinician has to rely on the patient's account of the heaviness of her bleeding and clinical examination (<LINK REF="REF-Chimbira-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chimbira 1980</LINK>). Patient's self-reports have been shown to be inaccurate indicators of menstrual blood loss in a number of studies in which subjective and objective assessments were compared (<LINK REF="REF-Hallberg-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallberg 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chimbira-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chimbira 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1977</LINK>). The widely accepted clinical definition of menorrhagia is blood loss of 80ml or more per period. This figure is derived from population studies which have shown that the average blood loss is between 30 and 40 ml, and 90% of women have blood losses of less than 80 ml (<LINK REF="REF-Hallberg-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallberg 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cole-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1971</LINK>). In a United Kingdom national survey, 31% of women described their blood loss as heavy (<LINK REF="REF-MORI-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">MORI 1990</LINK>). However many women who seek treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding do not actually have greater losses than average (<LINK REF="REF-Hallberg-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallberg 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fraser-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1977</LINK>). In one population based study in Scandinavia, 26% of those with losses well within the normal range (below 60 ml) considered their periods heavy, whilst 40% of those with objectively heavy losses (over 80 ml) considered their periods to be moderate or light (<LINK REF="REF-Hallberg-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallberg 1966</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another way of determining an upper limit of normal for menstrual blood loss is to relate the menstrual blood loss to various haematological indices. Excessive menstrual bleeding is the commonest cause of iron deficiency in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1980</LINK>), affecting 20 to 25% of the fertile female population (<LINK REF="REF-Rybo-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rybo 1966</LINK>) and 1.6 million women will have either iron storage deficiency or actual anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Fairhurst-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fairhurst 1977</LINK>). It can be calculated that on a normal western diet a state of negative iron balance will occur if the menstrual blood loss exceeds about 50-60 ml per month (<LINK REF="REF-Rybo-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rybo 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1982</LINK>) and indeed 67% of women whose loss is greater than 80 ml have actual anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Hallberg-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallberg 1966</LINK>). The incidence of anaemia significantly increases when losses exceed 80 ml (<LINK REF="REF-Hallberg-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hallberg 1966</LINK>), though blood may only contribute two to 82% of this fluid (<LINK REF="REF-Fraser-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 1985</LINK>). On the basis of these findings, the upper limit of normal appears to lie between 60 and 80 ml and losses in excess of 80 ml can be considered pathological.</P>
<P>The size of the problem is expressed by the number of women who seek medical advice for menstrual dysfunction. In one centre in the United Kingdom, 38.3% of referrals to consultant gynaecologists were for menstrual dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1992</LINK>), and 30% of these referrals were for menorrhagia (<LINK REF="REF-Cameron-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cameron 1990</LINK>). This accounts for 12% of all gynaecological referrals (<LINK REF="REF-Bradlow-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradlow 1992</LINK>). In addition, 5% of women aged 30 to 49 consult their general practitioner each year for menorrhagia (<LINK REF="REF-Peto-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peto 1993</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-08-03 16:03:49 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>A range of medical therapies are prescribed in order to reduce excessive menstrual blood loss, including prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, antifibrinolytics, the oral contraceptive pill and other hormones. Objective data has shown that, at least in the short term, considerable reduction in the volume of the menses is achievable. The choice of drug depends upon its appropriateness and likely acceptability to an individual (<LINK REF="REF-Mishell-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishell 1982</LINK>). The combined oral contraceptive pill (OCP) is claimed to have a variety of beneficial effects other than being a highly reliable method of birth control. </P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-08-03 16:04:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>When taken in a cyclical fashion the combined oral contraceptive pill induces regular shedding of a thinner endometrium and inhibits ovulation. Using this method, good cycle control can be achieved and, together with the provision of contraception, this makes OCP a most acceptable longer term therapy for some women with menorrhagia.</P>

<P>Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1991</LINK>) was identified, and fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the review. The trial used a cross-over design with subjects being randomised into three groups, and then randomised into two further groups. Treatments given were mefenamic acid, naproxen, low dose danazol and a combined oral monophasic contraceptive pill. The trial was relatively small with only 45 women being randomised and seven dropped out before completion of the study. The duration of treatment was eight cycles, with each treatment period being two cycles.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-08-10 12:41:14 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>As the trial used a cross-over design, only data from the first treatment period (cycles three and four) were analysed. The results from all three mefenamic acid groups (n=20) were combined to increase the power of the study. The other treatment groups all contained six participants. Individual participant data were obtained for all the treatment and control cycles.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference between reduction in blood loss (measured objectively) at two months in those women treated with the oral contraceptive pill and danazol (WMD 19.27, CI -24.47 to 63.01), OCP and mefenamic acid (WMD 12.53 CI -22.47 to 47.53) or OCP and naproxen (WMD 8.37 CI -27.31 to 44.05). It is worth noting that one third (12 out of 38) of the trial participants did not have the accepted threshold for treatment (MBL less than 60 mls).</P>
<P>Data on side effects were not collected because it included both periods of the study, not just the first treatment period prior to crossover.</P>
<P>The trial did find an overall reduction in menstrual blood loss of 43% in women taking OCP, although the numbers were small (n=6).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-04 11:11:33 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>In this review one randomised controlled trial of combined oral contraceptive pill for the treatment of menorrhagia versus mefenamic acid, naproxen and danazol was identified (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1991</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-08-10 12:37:22 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>The only outcome of interest measured in the study was objective menstrual blood loss. The objective measurement of blood loss by the Alkaline Haematin method is difficult and is not easily used in routine practice. In future, it may be preferable to develop simpler methods for the objective assessment of menorrhagia, such as pictorial blood loss assessment charts to permit large scale comparative studies of treatment as well as better routine clinical evaluation. Subjective blood loss was measured in the trial, but women were asked to compare the two treatments they received. Therefore, since all data in this review were analysed from a single treatment before the cross-over, these data were unable to be used.<BR/>
<BR/>The comparative efficacy of OCP with naproxen, danazol and mefenamic acid was assessed and no significant differences between treatment groups found. There are other known treatments for menorrhagia (such as antifibrinolytic agents) which were not included in the comparison.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of OCP compared to no treatment or placebo was not assessed in this study. However, study investigators did compare the overall effectiveness of the four treatments throughout the entire eight cycles with the baseline measurements. Highly significant reductions in blood loss were found at the end of the study in the oral contraceptive group (43%, P=&lt;0.001), the low dose danazol group (49%, P = 0.006), and in two of the MFA groups (38%, P=0.002 and 39%, p&lt;0.001). The comparative efficacy of all of the treatments should be confirmed by including placebo or no treatment arms in future trials.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-08-04 11:13:44 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>This review was unable to achieve its stated objectives because of the paucity of the data. The cross-over trial only recruited 45 women. A cost effectiveness analysis has not been undertaken because of low numbers. When new information becomes available this will be addressed.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-08-04 11:16:09 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-08-05 06:18:26 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The one small study identified (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1991</LINK>) found no significant difference between groups treated with OCP, mefenamic acid, low dose danazol or naproxen. Thus, at this stage, the effectiveness of OCP as compared with the above treatments, cannot be distinguished. Overall, the evidence from the one study identified (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1991</LINK>) is not sufficient to adequately assess the effectiveness of OCP for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-05 06:18:34 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Placebo controlled randomised controlled trials with adequate patient numbers, duration of at least three to six cycles and adequate follow up are required to establish whether or not the oral contraceptive pill is an effective treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding.</P>
