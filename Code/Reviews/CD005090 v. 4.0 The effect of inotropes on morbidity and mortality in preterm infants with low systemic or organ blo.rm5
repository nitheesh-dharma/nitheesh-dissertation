<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-11 12:43:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Low systemic blood flow is common in extremely premature infants and has been associated with brain and intestinal injury, death and developmental impairment. It is unclear what is the best strategy to prevent or treat this. The usual strategy for supporting the cardiovascular system of the preterm infant is to treat infants with low blood pressure with agents (inotropes) aimed at increasing blood pressure. However, many of infants with low blood flow have normal blood pressure. One trial was found that examined the effect of inotropes in infants with low systemic blood flow. The trial found that many infants failed to respond to the two commonly used inotropes (dobutamine and dopamine) and neither was better at improving outcomes of very preterm babies. Further research is needed to determine the best strategy for preventing or treating low systemic or organ blood flow in these very immature babies.</P>

<P>No new studies were found in updated search. No studies that compared an inotrope to no treatment in preterm infants with low SBF were found. One study compared dobutamine versus dopamine in preterm infants with low SVC flow. The study was of adequate methodology. No significant difference was reported in mortality to discharge, PIVH, grade 3 or 4 PIVH or NEC. At three years, there was no significant difference in cerebral palsy, deafness, developmental quotient &gt; 2 sd below norm or combined disability. Surviving infants treated with dobutamine had a significantly higher development quotient. There was no significant difference in death or disability at the latest time reported (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.66, 1.38). For secondary outcomes, there was no significant difference in periventricular leucomalacia, renal impairment, pulmonary haemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity or CLD at 36 weeks. There was no significant difference in treatment failure. Dobutamine produced a significantly greater increase in SVC flow at the highest dose reached, whereas dopamine produced a significantly greater increase in mean BP.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>In preterm infants with low systemic blood flow, there is some evidence that dobutamine is better than dopamine at increasing and maintaining systemic blood flow. The only eligible trial did not demonstrate any consistent differences in clinical outcomes. However, this study was not sufficiently powered to prove or disprove effects on clinical outcomes. It is unclear what is the most effective strategy for improving the cardiovascular status of immature infants in the first day. Further trials are needed to determine effective strategies for preventing and improving low systemic and organ blood flow. </P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-05-25 11:47:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cardiovascular interventions have most frequently been given to preterm infants on the basis of hypotension, poor peripheral tissue perfusion as measured by increased capillary refill time, or evidence of a developing acidosis or renal impairment. Commonly used criteria for hypotension and cardiovascular intervention have included a mean blood pressure (BP) &#8804; 30 mm Hg, which was associated with increased mortality and cerebral injury in a cohort study (<LINK REF="REF-Miall_x002d_Allen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miall-Allen 1987</LINK>). Other studies have defined hypotension as below the range (usually the 10<SUP>th</SUP> centile) seen in population studies of preterm infants. A commonly used bedside approximation of the 10<SUP>th</SUP> centile is a mean BP less than the gestational age in weeks or a systolic BP &#8804; 40 mmHg (<LINK REF="REF-Subhedar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subhedar 2003</LINK>). However, there are several substantial limitations to using hypotension as the criteria for cardiovascular support in preterm infants. There is a poor correlation between BP and systemic blood flow (SBF) in the first days after birth (<LINK REF="REF-Kluckow-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluckow 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2004a</LINK>). This is because BP is the product of blood flow and systemic vascular resistance. Using hypotension as a criteria for cardiovascular intervention in the first day after birth results in a considerable delay in treatment of many infants, with many infants with low SBF not receiving treatment for many hours or missing treatment altogether (<LINK REF="REF-Kluckow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluckow 2000</LINK>). Infants who have persisting inotrope requirements because of hypotension after the first days after birth frequently have normal or high SBF pointing to low systemic vascular resistance as the problem. Finally, studies of cardiovascular support in preterm infants that have used hypotension as the criterion for treatment and correction of hypotension as the goal of treatment are yet to demonstrate any improvements in morbidity or mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Subhedar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subhedar 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Low systemic and/or organ blood flow occurs in a variety of situations in preterm infants including extremely preterm infants in the first day after birth (<LINK REF="REF-Kluckow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluckow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osborn-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Osborn 2002a</LINK>), infants with perinatal asphyxia, severe respiratory problems and pulmonary hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1996</LINK>), sepsis or necrotising enterocolitis. Low SBF is common in the first day after birth and is associated with decreasing gestation, mechanical ventilation, a large diameter ductus arteriosus, high pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances (<LINK REF="REF-Kluckow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluckow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osborn-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Osborn 2002a</LINK>) and poor myocardial contractility (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2002b</LINK>). Normally, SBF is measured using echocardiographic measurements of ventricular outputs. However, in the first day after birth, large shunts across the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale are common and result in the ventricular outputs overestimating SBF by up to 100% (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1996</LINK>). Alternatives include using echocardiography to measure ventricular inputs such as superior vena cava (SVC) flow (<LINK REF="REF-Kluckow-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluckow 2000b</LINK>) or using techniques such as near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) or xenon clearance to measure organ blood flows, particularly cerebral blood flow. In analyses adjusted for potential perinatal confounders, low SVC (<LINK REF="REF-Kluckow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluckow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osborn-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Osborn 2002a</LINK>) and low cerebral blood flows (<LINK REF="REF-Meek-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meek 1999</LINK>) in the first day after birth have been independently shown to precede intraventricular haemorrhage in preterm infants. Infants with early low SVC flows are also at increased risk of low urine output and hyperkalaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Kluckow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluckow 2001</LINK>), mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Osborn-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Osborn 2002a</LINK>) and poor neurodevelopmental outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Hunt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt 2001</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-05-25 11:48:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Strategies that have been used to provide cardiovascular support to preterm infants have included the use of volume expansion (see Cochrane reviews: <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2004c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2001</LINK>), inotropes, nitric oxide and corticosteroids. Most studies comparing these interventions enrolled infants with hypotension, not with documented low systemic or organ blood flow. This review will focus on the use of inotropes to provide cardiovascular support for infants with demonstrated low systemic and/or organ blood flows. Inotropes used in preterm infants have included dopamine, dobutamine, isoprenaline (isoproterenol), adrenaline (epinephrine), noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and milrinone.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-05-25 11:48:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In selecting an inotrope for treatment in preterm infants, it is likely to be important to consider the underlying pathophysiology of the cardiovascular compromise as well as the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the inotrope (for reviews see <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seri-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seri 2001</LINK>). Dopamine at low doses stimulates dopamine and beta-adrenergic receptors with little effect on vascular resistance and increases in organ blood flows. At high doses (above 10 &#956;g/kg/min), alpha-adrenergic effects occur resulting in increases in both pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance and BP. Dobutamine produces predominately beta-adrenergic effects with resulting inotropy and a reduction in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance. Isoprenaline is almost purely a beta-agonist and has a pronounced chronotropic effect and produces pulmonary and systemic vasodilatation. There have been concerns regarding its potential to increase myocardial oxygen consumption. Adrenaline has both alpha and beta adrenergic effects, with beta adrenergic effects predominating at lower doses, producing increases in cardiac output, but alpha effects becoming important at high doses resulting in substantial increases in systemic vascular resistance and reduction in cardiac outputs. Pulmonary vascular resistance is increased to a lesser extent. Noradrenaline has both alpha and beta effects with alpha effects predominant and resulting in an increase in vascular resistance. Milrinone, a selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is inotropic and a vasodilator (an 'inodilator'). It is used in infants undergoing cardiac surgery to treat of prevent low cardiac output syndrome associated with poor myocardial contractility, a situation similar to the low SBF that occurs in extremely preterm infants in the first day after birth.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-05-25 11:46:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary outcomes of this review that might be expected to be improved by the treatment of low SBF with inotropes are those that have been strongly associated with low SBF in the preterm infant, including mortality, late PIVH and subsequent neurodevelopmental disability including motor impairments and cerebral palsy. There is some data to support necrotising enterocolitis being associated with low SBF (<LINK REF="STD-Osborn-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Osborn 2002a</LINK>). Secondary outcomes for which there is evidence of association include renal impairments and hyperkalaemia. There are no data to date associating periventricular white matter injury with low SBF.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-04-06 00:39:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The single small study included in this review enrolled preterm infants on the basis of a surrogate for low systemic blood flow (SVC flow) that is not confounded by shunts across the adapting heart, had adequate randomisation and allocation concealment, and blinded treatment and measurement. The study was designed and powered to explore haemodynamic rather than clinical outcomes. However, there are several observations that can be made from this study. Infants treated with dopamine had a significantly greater increase in mean BP at both 10 and 20 &#956;g/kg/min, but little change in SVC flow or RVO. Infants treated with dobutamine had little change in mean BP, but had a significantly greater increase in SVC flow at the highest dose reached with trends to increased SVC flow at both 10 and 20 &#956;g/kg/min. However, treatment failure (defined as failure to increase and maintain normal SVC flows) was substantial on either inotrope, with 40% of the all babies enrolled not improving or maintaining SVC flow within the normal range. No consistent differences were reported in neonatal morbidity (including renal impairment, PIVH, periventricular leucomalacia or necrotising enterocolitis) that we hypothesised may be affected by interventions aimed at improving blood flow. There was no significant difference in mortality or combined death and disability at the latest time measured, although infants treated with dobutamine had significantly higher Griffiths quotients at three years. It is possible that the additional infants who survived in the dopamine group did so with impaired development. </P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-04-06 00:38:46 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several methodological issues affect the interpretation of the only study eligible for this review. Most infants enrolled were immature, ventilated preterm infants. However, infants with asphyxia and sepsis were not excluded. The applicability to infants with different reasons for cardiovascular compromise is unclear. All infants were given volume expansion prior to inotrope randomisation. Infants who failed to maintain SVC flow on the highest dose of inotrope crossed over to the other inotrope, so that a substantial proportion of infants were exposed to both inotropes. Cerebral and other organ blood flows were not measured. The dose of inotropes used included relatively high dose dopamine (20 &#956;g/kg/min). This is a dose that some authors may caution using due to the substantial alpha effects that produce substantial increases in vascular resistance. However, it is within the dose range commonly reported in trials (<LINK REF="REF-Subhedar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subhedar 2003</LINK>). In addition, dopamine is usually titrated to achieve a BP above the minimally accepted pressure on gestation or birth weight criteria, a strategy that was not used in this study.</P>
<P>The inclusion of a single small study enrolling infants in the first day precludes strong conclusions to be made about the use of inotropes in preterm infants. No trial was found that compared inotrope use to another strategy of cardiovascular support in preterm infants with low systemic or organ blood flows. The only comparison able to be made was for dobutamine versus dopamine. </P>
<P>The findings of this review suggest that further research is needed to determine the most effective strategies for providing cardiovascular support for extremely premature infants. Independent research groups considering replicating the trial included in this review should consider using another agent (e.g. low dose adrenaline) in infants who fail to respond to inotrope rather than a blinded crossover to the other agent. The trial should be adequately powered to detect important clinical differences. A trial comparing a strategy of targeting infants with hypotension with dopamine versus targeting infants with low SBF with dobutamine is needed. An alternative strategy that needs evaluation includes one aimed at preventing low SBF. Given that low SBF is associated with high systemic vascular resistance and poor myocardial contractility, researchers conducting trials aimed at preventing low SBF should consider using inotropes that have the potential to lower systemic vascular resistance and improve myocardial contractility, such as dobutamine or milrinone. Future trials should measure the effects of interventions on systemic and organ blood flows using validated measures. Doppler velocity indices of flow are not validated measures of actual organ blood flows. Ventricular outputs have been validated as measures of SBF after the first day, but are confounded by shunts across the adapting heart in the first day. Superior vena cava flow has been validated clinically as a surrogate measure of SBF in the first day. NIRS and xenon measurements are also potential techniques for determining the effect of cardiovascular interventions on organ blood flows in preterm infants.</P>

<P>It is unclear from this study and previous reviews of inotropes for treatment of hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-Subhedar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subhedar 2003</LINK>) what the optimal strategy is for improving the cardiovascular status of the immature infant. Dopamine has been reported to lead to greater increases in BP in hypotensive infants (<LINK REF="REF-Subhedar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subhedar 2003</LINK>) and infants with low SBF (<LINK REF="STD-Osborn-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Osborn 2002a</LINK>), but dobutamine increased SBF better than dopamine in infants with low SBF (<LINK REF="STD-Osborn-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Osborn 2002a</LINK>). Neither inotrope has been shown to consistently improve any clinical outcome when given for hypotension or low SBF, and many infants with initial low SBF fail to maintain flows on either inotrope. </P>
</AGREEMENT>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There were no eligible studies that compared use of an inotrope to no treatment in preterm infants with low SBF. In preterm infants with low SBF, there is some evidence that dobutamine is better than dopamine at increasing and maintaining SBF. The only eligible trial did not demonstrate any consistent differences in clinical outcomes. However, this study was not sufficiently powered to prove or disprove effects on clinical outcomes. It is unclear what is the most effective strategy for improving the cardiovascular status of immature infants in the first day. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further trials are needed to determine effective strategies for preventing and improving low systemic and organ blood flows in the first day after birth in extremely immature infants. A trial comparing a strategy of treating hypotension with dopamine versus treating low SBF with dobutamine in preterm infants in the first day is warranted. </P>
