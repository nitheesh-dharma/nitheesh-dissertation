<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-03-07 11:58:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of giving extra oxygen to pregnant women during planned caesarean section under epidural or spinal anaesthesia. (Epidural anaesthesia is when a drug is injected into the epidural space of the spinal cord; spinal anaesthesia is when a local anaesthetic is injected into the subarachnoid space).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Oxygen was routinely given to pregnant women to provide an extra supply for the foetus in order for the foetus to cope with any unplanned loss of oxygen during or after the birth. Previous studies have shown that giving extra oxygen provided better oxygenation for the mother and foetus in terms of oxygen saturation (a measure of how much oxygen the blood is carrying), PaO<SUB>2 </SUB>(oxygen pressure in the blood) and pH (a measure of acidity or alkalinity). However, clear evidence of foetal clinical outcomes have not been obtained.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to November 2014.We reran the search in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE in February 2016. We found one potential new study of interest which was added to the list of &#8216;Studies awaiting Classification'. This study will be incorporated into the formal review findings when we next update the review.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This updated Cochrane review included 11 studies involving 753 participants. The studies compared maternal (mother) and neonatal (foetal) outcomes when pregnant women received extra oxygen versus room air. Oxygen was given to the women in different ways (at any flow rate or concentration via any oxygen delivery device).</P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
</P>
<P>Overall, the results of this updated review reach the same conclusions as the original published review. None of the 11 included trials reported maternal desaturation. No differences were noted in routine measures of foetal wellbeing (Apgar scores) when mothers who received extra oxygen were compared with those who did not. The pregnant women receiving extra oxygen in comparison with room air had significantly higher oxygen saturation (three trials) and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (five trials), as well as a significantly higher partial pressure of oxygen in both the umbilical artery and the umbilical vein (eight and 11 trials, respectively). Two trials reported higher markers of free radicals (perhaps indicating stress from excess oxygen) in mothers and foetuses when extra oxygen was given, but this is of no clinical significance Overall, we found no convincing evidence that giving oxygen in this situation is either beneficial or harmful for either the mother or the foetus.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>None of the 11 studies focused on maternal changes in oxygen saturation (defined as maternal saturation less than 90%). We graded the quality of evidence as low for the primary outcome (Apgar scores), and very low for the secondary outcomes (maternal oxygen saturation; partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, the umbilical artery and the umbilical vein). The reasons for our grading were risk of bias and inconsistency of the results.</P>

<P>Supplementary oxygen is routinely administered to low-risk pregnant women during an elective caesarean section under regional anaesthesia; however, maternal and foetal outcomes have not been well established. This is an update of a review first published in 2013.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-08-26 12:18:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The primary objective was to determine whether supplementary oxygen given to low-risk term pregnant women undergoing elective caesarean section under regional anaesthesia can prevent maternal and neonatal desaturation. The secondary objective was to compare the mean values of maternal and neonatal blood gas levels between mothers who received supplementary oxygen and those who did not (control group).</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-03-07 11:58:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, issue 11), MEDLINE (1948 to November 2014) and EMBASE (1980 to November 2014). The original search was first performed in February 2012. We reran the search in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE in February 2016.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-03-07 11:58:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We found one new included study in this updated version. In total, our updated review includes 11 trials (with 753 participants). The low quality of evidence showed no significant differences in average Apgar scores at one minute (N = six trials, 519 participants; 95% confidence (CI) -0.16 to 0.31, P = 0.53) and at five minutes (N = six trials, 519 participants; 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06, P = 0.98). None of the 11 trials reported maternal desaturation. The very low quality of evidence showed that in comparison to room air, women in labour receiving supplementary oxygen had higher maternal oxygen saturation (N = three trials, 209 participants), maternal PaO<SUB>2</SUB> (oxygen pressure in the blood; N = six trials, 241 participants), UaPO<SUB>2</SUB> (foetal umbilical arterial blood; N = eight trials, 504 participants; 95% CI 1.8 to 4.9, P &lt; 0.0001) and UvPO<SUB>2</SUB> (foetal umbilical venous blood; N = 10 trials, 683 participants). There was high heterogeneity among these outcomes. A subgroup analysis showed no significant difference in UaPO<SUB>2</SUB> between the two intervention groups in low-risk studies, whereas the high-risk studies showed a benefit for the neonatal oxygen group.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-03-07 11:58:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Overall, we found no convincing evidence that giving supplementary oxygen to healthy term pregnant women during elective caesarean section under regional anaesthesia is either beneficial or harmful for either the mother or the foetus' short-term clinical outcome as assessed by Apgar scores. Although, there were significant higher maternal and neonatal blood gas values and markers of free radicals when extra oxygen was given, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the low grade quality of the evidence.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-03-07 11:58:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-03-07 11:58:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>During caesarean section, the primary responsibility of anaesthetists and obstetricians is the safety and wellbeing of both mother and baby. Spinal anaesthesia has been recommended for a caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Riley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riley 1995</LINK>), but may lead to impaired maternal respiratory function and hypotension, resulting in impaired maternal-foetal gas exchange (<LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1996</LINK>). Other factors, such as unanticipated prolonged uterine incision-to-delivery (UD) intervals may also compromise placental circulation and cause a reduction in foetal oxygen content (<LINK REF="REF-Jordan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 2002</LINK>). However, the optimal intrauterine foetal arterial oxygen content before delivery during a routine caesarean section is not known. </P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-03-07 11:58:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Many pregnant women are empirically given supplemental oxygen intraoperatively (<LINK REF="REF-Stone-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2002</LINK>), at least until the delivery of the baby. This is done theoretically to provide hyperoxygenation to the foetus to enable it to better tolerate any unforeseen intranatal and postnatal oxygen deprivation.</P>
<P>Several factors may affect the transfer of oxygen from mother to baby (<LINK REF="REF-Parer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parer 2002</LINK>). Foetal haemoglobin has a higher oxygen affinity than that of the mother to promote extraction of oxygen from maternal oxygenated haemoglobin across the placenta. The normal range for neonatal haemoglobin is high compared with that for maternal blood (approximately 14 to 24 g/dL). An increase in oxygen delivered to the mother may not give rise to a clinically relevant increase in the foetal blood oxygen content (<LINK REF="REF-Bassel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassel 1995</LINK>). Blood carries oxygen to the foetus largely through oxygen binding with haemoglobin. If the saturation of haemoglobin (SaO<SUB>2</SUB>) with oxygen in the blood is greater than 97%, increasing oxygen tension (PaO<SUB>2</SUB>) to increase the amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood will make only a minimal difference (<LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1996</LINK>). Healthy women about to give birth frequently have SaO<SUB>2</SUB> levels greater than 96% while breathing air (<LINK REF="REF-Blackburn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackburn 2003</LINK>). Therefore, it might be expected that oxygen administration in routine practice would be unlikely to improve delivery of oxygen to the baby (<LINK REF="REF-Bassel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassel 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>In many units, supplemental oxygen is commonly administered to women through a face mask (<LINK REF="STD-Cogliano-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cogliano 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crosby-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Crosby 1992</LINK>). However, some women complain that when a face mask is applied, they feel claustrophobic, have difficulty getting enough air and are unable to communicate. <LINK REF="STD-Cogliano-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cogliano 2002</LINK> found that nasal cannulae were more acceptable to women. Oxygen is typically delivered at two to five litres per minute, resulting in an inspired oxygen concentration of approximately 30% to 40% through the nasal cannula (<LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The benefit of administering supplemental oxygen to healthy, low-risk pregnant women during an elective caesarean section under regional anaesthesia is controversial (<LINK REF="STD-Backe-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Backe 2002</LINK>). The partial pressure of oxygen in foetal umbilical arterial (UaPO<SUB>2</SUB>) and umbilical venous (UvPO<SUB>2</SUB>) blood increases when maternal-inspired oxygen levels are increased (FIO<SUB>2</SUB>). Foetal oxygen partial pressure approaches a plateau when maternal arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO<SUB>2</SUB>) is increased beyond 300 mm Hg during a caesarean section performed with the patient under general anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Baraka-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baraka 1970</LINK>); however, <LINK REF="STD-Ramanathan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ramanathan 1982</LINK> reported that UvPO<SUB>2</SUB> was improved when the mother's fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO<SUB>2</SUB>) was between 0.47 and 1 during caesarean section performed with the mother under epidural anaesthesia.</P>
<P>In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Kelly-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 1996</LINK> found that administration of 35% oxygen did not alter maternal PaO<SUB>2</SUB> nor foetal UvPO<SUB>2</SUB> during a caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia. Although 60% supplemental oxygen modestly increases maternal PaO<SUB>2</SUB> and foetal UvPO<SUB>2</SUB>, Apgar scores were similar in neonates born to hyperoxic (the condition of having higher than normal level of oxygen) or normoxic (the condition of having a normal level of oxygen) mothers (<LINK REF="STD-Adenekan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Adenekan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Khaw 2002</LINK>). However, Apgar scores are not a specific marker for asphyxia and can demonstrate only moderate to severe hypoxic brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Hogan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogan 2007</LINK>). Nevertheless, one-minute Apgar scores greater than seven generally predict good neonatal outcomes. Markers of free radical activity may represent another indicator for unfavourable neonatal outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Khaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Khaw 2002</LINK> demonstrated that increased free radical activity in both mother and baby was associated with exposure times as short as 10 minutes to FIO<SUB>2</SUB> of 0.6.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-06-18 10:13:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Administration of oxygen to the mother during caesarean section may increase the oxygen reserve of the foetus, resulting in protection from the adverse consequences of a prolonged interval from the interruption of oxygen supply from the umbilical artery to the establishment of effective ventilation in the newborn baby.</P>
<P>A prolonged uterine incision-to-delivery (UD) interval greater than 180 seconds has been associated with worsening neonatal acid-base status and lower Apgar scores (<LINK REF="REF-Datta-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Datta 1981</LINK>). More recent data show that with prolonged UD intervals, neonatal acid-base status, oxygenation and Apgar scores were no worse in cases where mothers were not given supplemental oxygen; specifically, administration of 60% oxygen to women about to give birth with prolonged UD intervals did not increase umbilical venous oxygen content (<LINK REF="STD-Khaw-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Khaw 2004</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-02-17 09:18:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although oxygen supplementation for otherwise healthy women undergoing uncomplicated caesarean section is a simple and apparently safe procedure, in some settings medical oxygen may be in short supply. Under these circumstances, the unnecessary use of oxygen for some patients may jeopardize the health outcomes of other patients if oxygen supplies are inadequate to meet their needs. In addition, oxygen is a potentially toxic substance and could conceivably present a risk to both foetus and neonate.</P>
<P>For these reasons, it is important to establish whether health benefits may be derived from the use of oxygen for this purpose. This review evaluated the effect of supplementary oxygen given to low-risk term pregnant women undergoing elective caesarean section under regional anaesthesia.</P>

<I>Note on subgroup analyses.</I> We had planned to investigate the effects of different oxygen concentrations, different oxygen flow rates, and different oxygen devices on outcomes where appropriate. Because of the wide variation in oxygen delivery methods used, subgroup analysis was possible only for different oxygen concentrations, and only after some assumptions were made. For trials where the delivered percentage of oxygen was not specified (<LINK REF="STD-Adenekan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Adenekan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cogliano-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Cogliano 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gunaydin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gunaydin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1992</LINK>), we calculated the estimated oxygen concentration from the device and flow rates, as described in <LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1991</LINK>.

Because of differences in unit of measurement, we only pooled six of the included trials (519 participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Adenekan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Adenekan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gunaydin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gunaydin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Khaw 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khaw-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Khaw 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palacio-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Palacio 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1980</LINK>). None of the trials included in this review reported the second primary outcome, the proportion of maternal participants with desaturation. Data were available for eight out of nine secondary outcomes. Quality of the evidence was low for the primary outcomes and very low for the secondary outcomes. The reasons for our grading were that only two of the 11 included trials were at low risk of bias across all domains, and there were unexplained high levels of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="STD-Khaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Khaw 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khaw-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Khaw 2004</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-10-15 15:48:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We are confident that our search strategy obtained all available updated studies.</P>
<P>This review found no data related to one of our primary outcomes (maternal desaturation) but did confirm that Apgar scores are not significantly improved at one or five minutes after delivery when supplemental oxygen is administered. Thus, although the data are incomplete for important clinical outcomes, no evidence suggested clear benefit derived from oxygen administration.</P>
<P>The results of this review are applicable to pregnant women who have uncomplicated pregnancies with a normal UD interval. It is not known whether oxygen supplementation would be of benefit to pregnant women with complicated caesarean sections or a long UD interval.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-03-07 11:58:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We found the overall quality of evidence being low for the one primary outcome that was reported, and very low for the secondary outcomes, due to risk of bias and inconsistency of the results.</P>
<P>There was substantial heterogeneity across the studied effects. It is plausible that heterogeneity may be due to differences in intervention (different oxygen concentration, flow rates, delivery devices, and duration of administration); and variations in blood gases measurement (methods of analysis and calibration, time delay between drawing of samples and measurement).</P>
<P>Because of the wide variation in oxygen delivery methods used in the included trials, we performed only a subgroup analysis using oxygen concentration with a cutoff value of 60% to assess the impact of the intervention. Moreover, the desaturation withdrawal criteria may have an impact on the results because six of the trials did not mention the withdrawal criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Adenekan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Adenekan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gunaydin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gunaydin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramanathan-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ramanathan 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Young 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1992</LINK>), and in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Khaw-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Khaw 2004</LINK>), the investigators stated that participants would be withdrawn and excluded from the analysis if desaturation occurred.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-03-04 15:57:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We adhered closely to our protocol which outlined our procedures for minimizing bias in the review (<LINK REF="REF-Chatmongkolchart-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chatmongkolchart 2006</LINK>): these included independent screening for trial inclusion, data extraction and assessment of risk of bias by two review authors. With assistance from the Cochrane Anaesthesia, Critical and Emergency Group&#8217;s Trials Search Co-ordinator, we conducted a thorough search strategy, and believe we have identified all relevant trials.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-03-07 11:58:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>This review showed no convincing evidence that giving supplementary oxygen given to healthy term pregnant women during elective caesarean section under regional anaesthesia is either beneficial or harmful for either the mother or the foetus clinically. No differences were noted in foetus' short-term clinical outcome (Apgar scores) when mothers who received extra oxygen were compared with those who did not.</P>
<P>Our review may different from other studies or reviews in neonatal welfare assessment. We chose Apgar scores because it was used routinely. Other studies may use neonatal acid-base status or other neurological assessment. In studying of oxidative stress, we included only participants who were undergoing elective caesarean section, but other studies may also include participants who were undergoing emergency caesarean section.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-03-04 16:40:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is low GRADE evidence that administration of supplementary oxygen in healthy, uncomplicated term pregnant women undergoing an elective caesarean section, under regional anaesthesia yields no difference in Apgar scores, even though oxygen levels for both mother and foetus were higher. There are insufficient studies to determine the clinical relevance of adverse effects of maternal hyperoxygenation to pregnant women or neonates.</P>
<P>There is very low GRADE evidence, due to risk of bias and inconsistency of the effect estimates, that findings should be interpreted with caution.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-03-04 15:57:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The low and very low quality of evidence and the inconsistency in trials requires careful planning of future RCTs, which should aim to standardize several issues, including methodological quality, the use of less variable oxygen delivery equipment, confirmation of the oxygen concentration delivered to participants, and long-term clinical endpoints.</P>
<P>Further research is required to identify one of the primary outcomes (the proportion of maternal desaturation) and clarify the clinical effect of maternal hyperoxia on the foetus, and any association between oxygen levels and clinical outcomes, such as neurological disorders and growth retardation.</P>
