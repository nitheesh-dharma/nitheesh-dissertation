<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-02-18 14:40:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Glaucoma involves a loss of vision that may be associated with raised pressure inside the eye. When glaucoma is diagnosed, it is common to try to reduce that pressure with medical, laser or surgical procedures (trabeculectomy). Surgery does not immediately restore vision, and may involve extra vision loss in the short term. Drugs can be used to modify wound healing to improve the likelihood of the success of surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>This is a summary of a Cochrane review that looked at the effect of using one of these drugs, 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). We gathered evidence from 12 trials involving 1319 participants. The evidence is current to July 2013.</P>
<P>
<B>5-FU injections after glaucoma surgery</B>
<BR/>For patients who have never had eye surgery before, 5-FU injections after surgery can slightly reduce the pressure in the eye after one year and also the risk of having more surgery in the first year.</P>
<P>For patients having both cataract surgery and glaucoma surgery at the same time, no difference has been detected between injections and no injections.</P>
<P>Some people are at higher risk of having problems following trabeculectomy, for instance people that have had previous surgery on the eye. For this group, the 5-FU injections can reduce the pressure in the eye a little and also reduce the risk of having more surgery in the first year.</P>
<P>
<B>Low-dose 5-FU injections after glaucoma surgery</B>
<BR/>Only one study has investigated the effect of using lower than normal doses in the injections. No benefit was found when compared to a control group who had no injections.</P>
<P>
<B>5-FU during surgery</B>
<BR/>If 5-Fluorouracil was applied to the eye during the surgery, there was less chance of having to have more surgery within the year and the pressure in the eye was also reduced slightly at one year.</P>
<P>
<B>Side effects and complications of 5-FU during or after surgery</B>
<BR/>Complications such as damage to cells at the front of the eye or a leak from the wound seem more common when 5-FU is used.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
<BR/>The methodological quality of the trials was not high in general. In many of the studies that contributed to the evidence about 5-FU after glaucoma surgery the researchers were aware of whether the participant had received the dummy injection or the 5-FU injection. This may have introduced bias into the results. Importantly the only study contributing information about low dose 5-FU was of low methodological quality so our conclusions on low dose 5-FU must be cautious.</P>
<P>The studies that contributed evidence about 5-FU during surgery was largely very good, the studies were designed and reported to a standard we would expect of modern trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
<BR/>We concluded that the main benefit is for people at high risk of problems. There may be a smaller benefit for people at low risk of problems if 5-FU is given either as injections after surgery or during the operation. However, 5-FU was found to increase the risk of serious complications and so may not be worthwhile for the small benefit gained.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-19 11:42:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Trabeculectomy is performed as a treatment for many types of glaucoma in an attempt to lower the intraocular pressure. The surgery involves creating a channel through the sclera, through which intraocular fluid can leave the eye. If scar tissue blocks the exit of the surgically created channel, intraocular pressure rises and the operation fails. Antimetabolites such as 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) are used to inhibit wound healing to prevent the conjunctiva scarring down on to the sclera. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2000, and previously updated in 2009.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-11-19 11:36:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of both intraoperative application and postoperative injections of 5-FU in eyes of people undergoing surgery for glaucoma at one year.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-12-24 19:26:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2013, Issue 6), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2013), the <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials (<I>m</I>RCT) (<A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com/">www.controlled-trials.com</A>), ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en">www.who.int/ictrp/search/en</A>). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 25 July 2013. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and the Science Citation Index and contacted investigators and experts for details of additional relevant trials.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-11-19 11:36:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised trials of intraoperative application and postoperative 5-FU injections compared with placebo or no treatment in trabeculectomy for glaucoma.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-11-19 11:36:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We contacted trial investigators for missing information. Data were summarised using risk ratio (RR), Peto odds ratio and mean difference, as appropriate.</P>
<P>The participants were divided into three separate subgroup populations (high risk of failure, combined surgery and primary trabeculectomy) and the interventions were divided into three subgroups of 5-FU injections (intraoperative, regular dose postoperative and low dose postoperative). The low dose was defined as a total dose less than 19 mg.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-18 14:34:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Twelve trials, which randomised 1319 participants, were included in the review. As far as can be determined from the trial reports, the methodological quality of the trials was not high, including a high risk of detection bias in many. Of note, only one study reported low-dose postoperative 5-FU and this paper was at high risk of reporting bias.</P>
<P>Not all studies reported population characteristics, of those that did mean age ranged from 61 to 75 years. 83% of participants were white and 40% were male. All studies were a minimum of one year long.</P>
<P>A significant reduction in surgical failure in the first year after trabeculectomy was detected in eyes at high risk of failure and those undergoing surgery for the first time receiving regular-dose 5-FU postoperative injections (RR 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.68 and 0.21, 0.06 to 0.68, respectively). No surgical failures were detected in studies assessing combined surgery. No difference was detected in the low-dose postoperative 5-FU injection group in patients undergoing primary trabeculectomy (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.24). Peroperative 5-FU in patients undergoing primary trabeculectomy significantly reduced risk of failure (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.88). This translates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 4.1 for the high risk of failure patients, and 5.0 for primary trabeculectomy patients receiving postoperative 5-FU.</P>
<P>Intraocular pressure was also reduced in the primary trabeculectomy group receiving intraoperative 5-FU (mean difference (MD) -1.04, 95% CI -1.65 to -0.43) and regular-dose postoperative 5-FU (MD -4.67, 95% CI -6.60 to -2.73). No significant change occurred in the primary trabeculectomy group receiving low-dose postoperative 5-FU (MD -0.50, 95% CI -2.96 to 1.96). Intraocular pressure was particularly reduced in the high risk of failure population receiving regular-dose postoperative 5-FU (MD -16.30, 95% CI -18.63 to -13.97). No difference was detected in the combined surgery population receiving regular-dose postoperative 5-FU (MD -1.02, 95% CI -2.40 to 0.37).</P>
<P>Whilst no evidence was found of an increased risk of serious sight-threatening complications, other complications are more common after 5-FU injections. None of the trials reported on the participants' perspective of care.</P>
<P>The quality of evidence varied between subgroups and outcomes, most notably the evidence for combined surgery and low-dose postoperative 5-FU was found to be very low using GRADE. The combined surgery postoperative 5-FU subgroup because no surgical failures have been reported and the sample size is small (n = 118), and the low-dose postoperative 5-FU group because of the small sample size (n = 76) and high risk of bias of the only contributing study.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-26 12:19:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Postoperative injections of 5-FU are now rarely used as part of routine packages of postoperative care but are increasingly used on an ad hoc basis. This presumably reflects an aspect of the treatment that is unacceptable to both patients and doctors. None of the trials reported on the participants' perspective of care, which constitutes a serious omission for an invasive treatment such as this.</P>
<P>The small but statistically significant reduction in surgical failures and intraocular pressure at one year in the primary trabeculectomy group and high-risk group must be weighed against the increased risk of complications and patient preference.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-12-24 18:40:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-12-24 18:39:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) was established as a treatment for glaucoma more than 100 years ago. The lack of evidence that lowering IOP is effective in preventing continued loss of visual function in glaucoma documented by the first systematic review on eye health (<LINK REF="REF-Rossetti-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossetti 1993</LINK>), led to several definitive studies - the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (<LINK REF="REF-Kass-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kass 2002</LINK>), the European Glaucoma Prevention Study (<LINK REF="REF-Miglior-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miglior 2005</LINK>), and the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial Group (<LINK REF="REF-Heijl-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heijl 2002</LINK>). These, and subsequent systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Maier-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maier 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vass-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vass 2007</LINK>), provide evidence that lowering IOP can prevent ocular hypertension and reduce the risk of progression of glaucoma. A review by Burr et al. comparing medical with surgical treatment was inconclusive but the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines published in 2009 recommend initial treatment with topical medications (<LINK REF="REF-Burr-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burr 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>). However, if more than two medications are insufficient to control the pressure and prevent progression, then trabeculectomy augmented by antimetabolites is recommended though the augmentation itself is not specified (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trabeculectomy offers no immediate improvement in vision and indeed is often associated with the loss of some detailed vision in the short term. This usually recovers, although in some people there may be a small but permanent reduction in the visual potential of the operated eye. Glaucoma surgery of this type can be conducted under local or general anaesthesia as a day case procedure, but practice varies widely according to local resources and access to follow-up care.</P>
<P>The operation involves separating the conjunctiva from the sclera by making an incision at the junction of the cornea and the sclera (on the part of the eye normally hidden under the upper eyelid), to form a conjunctival flap that is folded back to expose the underlying sclera. A half-thickness incision is made into the sclera (usually 4 x 4 mm) at the corneo-scleral junction. The half-thickness scleral flap is raised towards the limbus and a small section of the sclera under the flap is removed (sclerostomy) allowing aqueous to leave the anterior chamber of the eye. The scleral flap is repositioned and loosely sutured. The flap guards the sclerostomy, preventing excessive egress of aqueous, which could result in hypotony (a very soft eye). Finally, the conjunctiva is replaced. Aqueous passes through the sclera and collects under the conjunctiva as a bleb. Fluid in the bleb is absorbed by capillaries and lymphatics within the conjunctiva, or evaporates across the conjunctiva. Final IOP is determined by many factors including the size of the bleb, the thickness of the conjunctiva and how adherent the conjunctiva around the bleb is to the sclera. If the conjunctiva overlying the operation site scars down onto the scleral flap then no aqueous can leave the eye, resulting in the return of raised IOP. </P>
<P>Optimum success rates for trabeculectomy are achieved when the eye has not been exposed to previous interventions, either surgical or medical (<LINK REF="REF-Lavin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavin 1990</LINK>). Risk factors for failure of trabeculectomy to control IOP include previous exposure to topical medication (especially sympathomimetic agents such as adrenaline), previous surgical manipulation of the conjunctiva or other injury. Age is inversely related to risk, and being of black African ethnic origin is thought by some surgeons to be a risk factor (<LINK REF="REF-Broadway-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broadway 1994</LINK>). Other risk factors for failure of first-time trabeculectomy include diabetic status, a diagnosis of pigmentary glaucoma, grade of surgeon, position of traction suture, technique of local anaesthetic and IOP at listing (<LINK REF="REF-Edmunds-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmunds 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-11-19 11:43:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is an antimetabolite that can be applied during or after surgery to prevent the conjunctiva scarring down onto the sclera. Peroperative (intraoperative) 5-FU is usually administered to the sclera before or after the half-thickness scleral flap incision is made often using sponges soaked in the 5-FU solution applied for between two and five minutes. There is some variation in the technique used to deliver 5-FU. Postoperative 5-FU is administered as subconjunctival injections, the dose and regimen varies widely.</P>
<P>The patient's experience of glaucoma surgery is not thought to be influenced by the intraoperative use of antimetabolites, although this has not been formally assessed. The addition of a regimen of postoperative injections will significantly affect the patient's experience in terms of numbers of visits and sustained discomfort or pain from the injections.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-11-19 11:53:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The investigation of the use of agents to modify the wound-healing process began in the early 1980s with work on 5-FU and Mitomycin C beginning almost simultaneously in different parts of the world. 5-FU is a pyrimidine analogue antimetabolite that blocks deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis through the inhibition of thymidylate synthesis. In vitro experiments on these agents are summarised by <LINK REF="REF-Blumenkranz-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumenkranz 1984</LINK>. The first successful animal model demonstrating the effectiveness of 5-FU in bleb formation in the owl monkey was also reported in 1984 (<LINK REF="REF-Gressel-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gressel 1984</LINK>). The same group published the findings of a pilot study in humans of the use of 5-FU in glaucoma filtering surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Heuer-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heuer 1984</LINK>). Shortly thereafter, the Fluorouracil Filtering Surgery Study Group (FFSSG) was established and the first large-scale randomised controlled trial initiated (<LINK REF="REF-FFSSG-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">FFSSG 1992</LINK>). Subsequent laboratory research indicated that a single intraoperative application of 5-FU might be sufficient to control postoperative proliferation of scar tissue at the drainage site (<LINK REF="REF-Khaw-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khaw 1992</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-12-24 18:40:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>There have been no systematic reviews undertaken to summarise the totality of the evidence of the effectiveness of 5-FU. Skuta and Parrish reviewed the role of agents in the modification of wound healing in 1987 in which numerous reports, almost all uncontrolled case series, of outcomes of different drainage techniques in different populations were summarised (<LINK REF="REF-Skuta-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skuta 1987</LINK>). Parrish's editorial in 1992 called for more randomised controlled trials on the use of antimetabolites in filtering surgery in order to answer important questions on who should and should not receive these agents (<LINK REF="REF-Parrish-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parrish 1992</LINK>). In reviewing combined glaucoma and cataract surgery in a perspectives article, Shields suggested that antimetabolites might be useful in improving the success of this procedure but again called for more evidence of effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Shields-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 1993</LINK>). A more recent editorial raised valid concerns that the widespread use of antimetabolites in glaucoma surgery had the potential to do as much harm as good and urged caution (<LINK REF="REF-Higginbotham-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higginbotham 1996</LINK>). However, Chen's survey in the US and Japan revealed wide variation in practice reflecting the underlying uncertainty over the indications for their usage (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since this review was originally published, a number of randomised controlled trials have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of this method of application. Consequently the scope of this review was expanded to include intraoperative application of 5-FU as a subgroup in the 2013 update. Clinicians now prefer the intraoperative application of agents for the modification of wound healing and routine postoperative injections of 5-FU are now rarely used. They are, however, used by some people on an ad hoc basis if there are signs of imminent failure of the drainage procedure.</P>
<P>Postoperative injections of 5-FU were the first of a planned series of reviews on the use of antimetabolites in glaucoma surgery. We have now divided the reviews according to the intervention tested as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Postoperative 5-FU injections versus control; intraoperative 5-FU versus control; indirect comparison of postoperative and intraoperative 5-FU in the absence of any head-to-head comparisons.</LI>
<LI>Intraoperative Mitomycin C versus control (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkins 2005</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Intraoperative Mitomycin C versus postoperative or intraoperative 5-FU.</LI>
</OL>
<P>This review assessed the effects of postoperative 5-FU injections compared with control and intraoperative 5-FU versus control. Peroperative 5-FU was planned as a separate review initially but, in 2012, we decided that it should be included in the postoperative review to create an overall review of 5-FU use with trabeculectomy.</P>

<P>The original electronic searches revealed more than 70 studies. Two trials were excluded because reported follow-up was less than 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Hennis-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hennis 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lamba-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lamba 1996</LINK>). A further three trials were found not to meet the inclusion criteria when the full report was assessed, and were, therefore, excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Hefetz-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hefetz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oh-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Oh 1994</LINK>). Seven randomised controlled trials met the review inclusion criteria. Scanning the reference lists of the reports revealed one further study (<LINK REF="STD-Loftfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Loftfield 1991</LINK>), which was published only as an abstract. As attempts to contact the authors were fruitless and no further information could be obtained about the study, <LINK REF="STD-Loftfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Loftfield 1991</LINK> was excluded from the review's analysis. However, we have reported the complications described by <LINK REF="STD-Loftfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Loftfield 1991</LINK> below because of the paucity of other research at low-doses of 5-FU and to highlight the risk of complications at lower doses. One further trial was identified in the update search in 2001 (<LINK REF="STD-Chaudhry-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chaudhry 2000</LINK>). Contact with the authors of identified trials and with researchers who are active in the field did not identify any further relevant studies.</P>
<P>Communication with practitioners in 2005 revealed an abstract in the proceedings of the American Academy of Ophthalmology (<LINK REF="STD-Baez-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Baez 1993</LINK>). The abstract reported a trial in which 72 patients undergoing combined cataract and trabeculectomy were randomised to receive postoperative 5-FU or nothing. The abstract reported no difference in outcome with increased adverse events in the intervention arm. We have been unable to find a subsequent published report of this trial and our attempts to contact the authors have been unsuccessful and it has, therefore, been excluded. <LINK REF="STD-Buzarovska-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Buzarovska 2005</LINK> was also identified in 2005 but it did not randomise patients and so was excluded. <LINK REF="STD-Gandolfi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gandolfi 1997</LINK> was excluded because it matched participants undergoing combined cataract and trabeculectomy before randomisation.</P>
<P>An updated search was done in October 2008, which yielded a further 90 reports of studies. The Trials Search Co-ordinator scanned the search results and removed any references that were not relevant to the scope of the review. The search did not identify any references that met the inclusion criteria for the review.</P>
<P>With the revision of the review in 2013, we included trials that used 5-FU both intraoperatively and postoperatively. We redesigned and re-ran the searches to reflect the change in the scope of the review and have included a PRISMA flow diagram showing the amended status of the review (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). There are currently 12 included studies in the review and 13 excluded studies.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-16 17:29:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The mean risk of failure was reduced by application of 5-FU in all methods of administration and all subgroups except the combined surgery subgroup. However, reduction in risk is small and of questionable clinical significance in the regular-dose postoperative injection primary trabeculectomy group and the intraoperative group. Furthermore, in the low-dose group the CIs were so wide as to make this reduction non-significant.</P>
<P>People with pre-existing risk factors for surgical complications had the greatest reduction in IOP following surgery, although only one study contributed to these data. Regular-dose postoperative 5-FU reduced IOP more than control in high-risk patients, the mean difference was -16.30 (CI -18.63 to -13.97) while in the primary trabeculectomy group the difference was smaller -4.67 (CI -6.60 to -2.74).</P>
<P>There is no apparent effect of 5-FU at regular dosages in people undergoing combined cataract extraction and trabeculectomy. The most likely reason for this is that the underlying risk of failure is lower in this group. Much larger samples would be required to show an effect if present and is, therefore, not excluded by these results. Because the levels of IOP were generally lower preoperatively, it is possible that the effect of 5-FU has been missed because of an excessively high IOP cut-off for failure definition. This is illustrated in <LINK REF="STD-Gandolfi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gandolfi 1997</LINK>, where according to the global criteria of success (IOP less than 22 mm Hg), there was no difference between groups, but when a lower cut-off in IOP is applied (15 mm Hg) a difference between the groups appears. However, <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Grady-1993" TYPE="STUDY">O'Grady 1993</LINK> stratified participants into those whose pressures were over 21 mm Hg preoperatively and those whose pressures were less than 22 mm Hg (n = 30 and 44, respectively). Although the mean IOP was slightly higher in the previously hypertensive group, there was still no difference between intervention and control groups in either stratum.</P>
<P>It is perhaps not surprising that the effectiveness of 5-FU injections is at the expense of an increased risk of complications, particularly for corneal epithelial damage, wound leak and shallow anterior chamber. However, permanent sight-threatening complications, such as expulsive haemorrhage (which occurred more often in the 'high risk of failure' eyes recruited to <LINK REF="STD-FFSSG-1989" TYPE="STUDY">FFSSG 1989</LINK> than in the other studies) or endophthalmitis (reported in a patient in the control arm at two years follow up in <LINK REF="STD-Donoso-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Donoso 1998</LINK>) do not appear to occur more frequently in 5-FU-treated eyes. Hypotonous maculopathy is a serious but not necessarily sight-threatening complication once it has resolved. Only two trials reported this complication - <LINK REF="STD-Goldenfeld-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Goldenfeld 1994</LINK>, in the regular dose primary trabeculectomy group with one event in the 5-FU group; and <LINK REF="STD-Loftfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Loftfield 1991</LINK>, in the lower-dose primary group. However, the <LINK REF="STD-Loftfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Loftfield 1991</LINK> criteria and definitions are not described in the abstract report. <LINK REF="STD-Chaudhry-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chaudhry 2000</LINK> described new complications including cataract that occur with greater frequency following 5-FU injections. Subsequent surgery to deal with the cataract may jeopardise the success of the filtering procedure.</P>
<P>There were variations in dose, frequency and site of 5-FU injections between the trials included in this review that may have an impact on the comparisons. By separating the studies into regular- and low-dose interventions, a possible dose-response effect is detectable, although the CIs were mutually inclusive. This dose response was not assessed statistically as only one study contributed to the low-dose data. From the data available, a mean of three injections or fewer did not appear to impact on failure rates while a mean of five injections was successful in participants with an elevated risk of failure and those undergoing primary surgery. However, at higher doses there was no consistent pattern. The <LINK REF="STD-FFSSG-1989" TYPE="STUDY">FFSSG 1989</LINK> study used the highest total dose of 5-FU (105 mg) but did not see lower failure rates than other studies using doses between 25 mg and 30 mg (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).The intraoperative dose did not seem to affect the outcomes, although this was not formally analysed.</P>
<P>Peroperative application of 5-FU to the sclerectomy site showed a lower effects on the relative risk of failure after primary trabeculectomy when compared with regular-dose postoperative 5-FU injections in the same population. The difference between regular dose intraoperative and postoperative 5-FU was not statistically significant however (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). Similarly, the mean reduction in IOP was less at 1.0 mm Hg compared with 4.6 mm Hg in primary trabeculectomy having the full postoperative dose, which was statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>People undergoing an initial drainage procedure have a much lower risk of failure when compared with the high-risk group and complications, though rare, can be unpleasant and serious. Use of 5-FU injections, therefore, needs to be carefully considered in the primary trabeculectomy group and an individual's risk of failure needs careful assessment before a decision is made to use them. The patient and surgeon alike need to have made a balanced assessment of risk and benefit.</P>
<P>It is the largest Moorflo trial (<LINK REF="STD-Khaw-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Khaw 2002</LINK>) that demonstrates a large and statistically risk reduction in terms of failure, however the lack of significance of all the other intraoperative trials reduces to overall estimate of effect to be almost compatible with none when pooled (lower confidence interval of -0.03). This trial remains unpublished though it is likely to be published soon. A possible explanation for differences in these studies that is hard to quantify is the effect of postoperative needling, which was allowed though to differing protocols in the Moorflo and Singapore studies. However, masking will have prevented any bias in the likelihood of receiving needling in the treatment and placebo arms.</P>

<P>A notable omission from all the trials was any attempt to report the participants' perception of their treatment. Such an invasive and potentially unpleasant treatment would need a powerful additional therapeutic benefit to balance the repeated trauma of postoperative subconjunctival injections and the inconvenience and expense of frequent returns to the hospital or a prolonged inpatient stay. The additional discomfort caused by ocular surface damage is another important consideration.</P>
<P>A problem with randomised controlled trials is that they are rarely large enough to examine the occurrence of rare but important adverse events. Case reports exist highlighting complications following trabeculectomy using postoperative 5-FU injections. They include hypotony (<LINK REF="REF-Kee-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kee 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stamper-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamper 1992</LINK>), and ocular surface problems (<LINK REF="REF-Knapp-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knapp 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peterson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stank-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stank 1990</LINK>). One retrospective review highlighted a late onset bleb-related endophthalmitis rate of 3% over two years in trabeculectomies performed superiorly (<LINK REF="REF-Wolner-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolner 1991</LINK>). A discussion of expulsive haemorrhage in the FFSSG participants found a strong association between haemorrhage and the difference between preoperative and postoperative IOP (<LINK REF="REF-FFSSG-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">FFSSG 1992</LINK>). No association was shown with the use of 5-FU.</P>
<P>This systematic review fails to inform adequately about the occurrence of important but rare complications of this adjuvant to surgery, which may be for a number of reasons including:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>variable definitions of complications - definitions can be very subjective and are often not described even where criteria could be helpful, for example, maximum IOP criterion when defining hypotony. Only one paper gives a definition of hypotony (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1994</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>variable operative technique - a surgeon who prefers to tightly close his/her scleral flap is less likely to have a shallow postoperative anterior chamber, even if this is thought to increase the chances of having too high a postoperative IOP;</LI>

In the presence of such concern, emphasis on the evidence of effectiveness must be cautious, as it is possible that systematic bias in the studies has led to overestimation of effect, especially since the largest trial, <LINK REF="STD-FFSSG-1989" TYPE="STUDY">FFSSG 1989</LINK>, was terminated prematurely. Our main difficulty is as a result of the limited information in the trial reports. We may be clearer about the quality of the evidence presented in this review with feedback from the trialists. As review authors, we faced a dilemma with regard to the inclusion or exclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Loftfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Loftfield 1991</LINK>, which appears never to have been published in full or in peer-reviewed literature. It seems to contain important information about the effects of 5-FU at a low dose, as well as important adverse event rates. However, there is insufficient information to judge this study's quality and, therefore, caution must be exercised in the interpretation of the results. Consequently, we have reported the findings but not included them in the analysis. Efforts to contact the authors of this study were unsuccessful. It is possible that, due to mainly negative findings, <LINK REF="STD-Loftfield-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Loftfield 1991</LINK> was not published thus contributing to publication bias in the literature.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-09-13 17:08:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The literature searching process did not limit findings by language or date and included electronic searches, handsearches and personal communications. It is unlikely that we missed any relevant randomised controlled trials. However, it is possible that relevant trials have been missed if they have not been indexed. We did not assess reporting bias using funnel plots because of insufficient results; however, we did identify studies that had not been fully published and peer reviewed.</P>
<P>None of the authors of this systematic review have been involved in trials of 5-FU.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-11-19 11:53:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-11-19 11:53:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review suggest that regular-dose postoperative 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) injections are of benefit to eyes at high risk of failure and those undergoing the primary trabeculectomy. There has been a shift in current practice to favour the use of intraoperative Mitomycin C in these patients, which may be associated with a greater risk of severe complications.</P>
<P>This review provides no good evidence to justify the routine use of postoperative 5-FU injections in people undergoing combined cataract extraction and trabeculectomy. This may be a reflection of problems with the studies themselves or the way in which they were reported.</P>
<P>Although 5-FU injections improve the prognosis for success in primary trabeculectomy, the absolute risk difference is smaller than in high-risk eyes and the threat of serious complications is real. Again, systematic biases may have led to overestimation of effect. Thus, routine use should be discouraged and, if used, the patient must be made well aware of the trade-off between risk and benefit.</P>
<P>Peroperative 5-FU is of less certain effectiveness though it appears to reduce the risk of failure and intraocular pressure (IOP) to a much lesser degree than postoperative injections of 5-FU but this latter must be much less acceptable to patients.</P>
<P>The poor quality of much of the presented evidence from the older trials means that interpretation must be cautious.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-11-19 11:53:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further trials on this postoperative injections of 5-FU may not be warranted because it has been largely superseded by newer methods of controlling wound healing such as intraoperative Mitomycin C. However, some important messages emerge from the review. There is a need to include patient-orientated outcomes, particularly where a treatment is so invasive. Outcomes relevant to the patient's continuing visual acuity and visual field are needed. These parameters have been included in some studies but they need to be included consistently across studies in a way that facilitates pooling of data. Since the introduction of the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>), it is likely that journal editors will insist on more complete reporting of randomised controlled trials, which should facilitate the review process. There is also a need to evaluate current practice in the form of ad hoc usage of injections of 5-FU in the postoperative period.</P>
<P>A possible advantage to postoperative injections over intraoperative 5-FU among primary trabeculectomy patients was identified through indirect comparison and post-hoc analysis. This may warrant further investigation in head-to-head trials.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2013-11-21 15:17:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has evolved over many years. The comparison of different doses was planned from the beginning although the findings from <LINK REF="STD-Chaudhry-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chaudhry 2000</LINK> was not added until 2001. None of the analysis has changed, it has been conducted as planned.</P>
<P>This 2013 update's major change is the inclusion of intraoperative 5-FU application in the review. This was initially planned as a separate review by <LINK REF="REF-Abdul-Karim-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdul Karim 2008</LINK> but was included in this review for simplicity.</P>
<P>In earlier versions of the review, two authors independently assessed trial methodological quality using a quality scale described in a previous version of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1997</LINK>). Guidance on assessment of study quality has changed and this review has altered the assessment of studies in accordance with Chapters 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This includes risk of bias assessment and 'Summary of findings' tables including the GRADE system of evaluating study quality. To reflect the move to a more systematic method of assessing bias and the higher expectations for modern study design, it was felt that the addition of a sensitivity analysis assessing the inclusion of high and unclear risk of bias studies would be appropriate.</P>
