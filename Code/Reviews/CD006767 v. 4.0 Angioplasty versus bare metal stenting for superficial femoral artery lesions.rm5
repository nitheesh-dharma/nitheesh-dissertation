<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-05-23 16:24:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intermittent claudication is pain in the leg that is brought on by walking and which is relieved by rest. The pain is a result of insufficient blood flow to the muscles of the leg due to narrowing of the arteries by atherosclerosis. People who have narrowing of the main artery in the thigh, the superficial femoral artery, and intermittent claudication which severely restricts their quality of life or causes dangerous tissue changes in the leg may undergo a procedure known as angioplasty to widen this narrowing. This procedure involves passing a balloon into the narrowed segment and inflating the balloon to push the artery open. In addition to this, a cylindrical piece of metal mesh called a stent may be inserted at the site where the artery has been pushed open with the aim of holding the narrowing open in the future. While stents work well in the arteries of the heart and in other arteries, it is not clear whether adding stents following angioplasty to narrowings of the superficial femoral artery gives any benefit to the patient.</P>
<P>We identified 11 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1387 participants. Their average age was 69 years and all trials included men and women. The participants were randomised to have either balloon angioplasty alone or balloon angioplasty with stent placement. At two years, blood flowing through the narrowing in the arteries was no greater in participants with a stent inserted than in those without. There was a small improvement in the distance that the participants with a stent could walk up to one year later. However, when asked about their quality of life there was no improvement, whether a stent was placed or not, up to one year later. There were differences in the included trials; in some trials people with narrowings in other leg arteries were included. There were also differences between trials in the blood thinning drugs given after stent placement, which may change results, as these agents are important in keeping stents working in other parts of the body. These factors led us to the conclusion that there is a small benefit to adding a stent when performing balloon angioplasty for people in whom balloon angioplasty fails. However, there is insufficient evidence to support this approach as routine practice for everyone and future trials should examine whether subgroups of patients may benefit from stenting.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-05-23 16:24:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We include three new studies in this update, making a total of 11 included trials with 1387 participants. The average age was 69 years and all trials included men and women. Participants were followed for up to two years. There was an improvement in primary duplex patency at six and 12 months in participants treated with PTA plus stent over lesions treated with PTA alone (six months: odds ratio (OR) 2.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 7.18, P = 0.02, six studies, 578 participants; 12 months: OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.10, P = 0.04, nine studies, 858 participants). This was lost by 24 months (P = 0.06). There was a significant angiographic patency benefit at six months (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.49 to 4.17, P = 0.0005, four studies, 329 participants) which was lost by 12 months (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.00, P = 0.24, five studies, 384 participants). Ankle brachial index (ABI) and treadmill walking distance showed no improvement at 12 months (P = 0.49 and P = 0.57 respectively) between participants treated with PTA alone or PTA with stent insertion. Three trials (660 participants) reported quality of life, which showed no significant difference between participants treated with PTA alone or PTA with stent insertion at any time interval. Antiplatelet therapy protocols and inclusion criteria regarding affected arteries between trials showed marked heterogeneity.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-05-23 16:24:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although there was a short-term gain in primary patency there was no sustained benefit from primary stenting of lesions of the superficial femoral artery in addition to angioplasty. Future trials should focus on quality of life for claudication and limb salvage for critical ischaemia.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-03-31 11:28:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Lower limb peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common, important manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis. It occurs in 3% to 10% of the population, increasing to 15% to 20% in people over 70 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Selvin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selvin 2004</LINK>). The most common site of PAD is the superficial femoral artery (SFA) (<LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 1991</LINK>). While most people with PAD are asymptomatic, many have intermittent claudication, chronic critical limb ischaemia or acute critical limb ischaemia. As a result, PAD significantly impairs quality of life and is the most common cause of lower limb amputation in the western world. Successful treatment of PAD is therefore of the utmost importance.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-12-08 15:14:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Superficial femoral artery disease may be treated by a number of modalities depending on the length of lesion. Exercise therapy and best medical therapy are the best suggested methods of initial therapy for people with claudication (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>), while rest pain and tissue loss is treated more aggressively with early intervention. For lesions less than 10 cm long in symptomatic patients, the most common treatment is currently percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with or without the use of stents. While PTA can result in initial technical success rates of more than 95%, late clinical failure remains an important concern.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-05-23 16:24:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The recognition that treatment for PAD varies by centre has led to the creation of continually updated international guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norgren-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norgren 2007</LINK>). These guidelines currently recommend the use of PTA as a primary treatment in SFA lesions less than 10 cm long with stenting for acute primary failure. However, recent randomised control trials have results conflicting with these recommendations and, in some cases, with one another (<LINK REF="STD-Vienna-Absolute-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna Absolute Trial</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zdanowski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zdanowski 1999</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2014-05-23 16:24:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The angioplasty or stent insertion had to have been performed percutaneously or though a limited groin incision. The treatment had to have been primary unless angioplasty failed and stenting was then performed as part of the primary procedure. We noted antiplatelet therapy preceding and following intervention. We did not consider drug-eluting balloons, stents and stent grafts.</P>
<P>We did not consider uncommon percutaneous interventions such as atherectomy. Secondary and primary assisted patency rates were only considered as aims in some trials, and we therefore did not include them.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-05-23 16:24:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The major finding of this analysis was that lesions of the superficial femoral artery treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with stent insertion show a small, statistically significant short-term improvement in primary patency over lesions treated with PTA alone (six trials, 578 participants). This effect is most prominent at six months and diminishes with time. A similar but smaller effect is seen for ankle brachial index (ABI) (one trial, 104 participants), while we observed a more pronounced improvement in treadmill walking distance in participants with PTA with stent insertion at six months (one trial, 104 participants), but not at 12 months (two trials, 240 participants) and 24 months (one trial, 98 participants). Quality of life, however, showed no significant difference between participants treated with PTA alone or PTA with stent insertion at any time interval. Intermittent claudication was the predominant symptom treated.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-05-26 11:43:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Heterogeneity between trial outcomes means that while a large number of participants were available, overall some analyses contain small numbers of studies and therefore few participants. These analyses should be interpreted with caution. The Chi test for heterogeneity for ABI was P &lt; 0.00001 at 12 months, and was P &lt; 0.00001 for treadmill walking distance at 12 months. In each case, the <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-Absolute-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna Absolute Trial</LINK> reports higher values than the other studies, although the reasons for this are unclear. These results must therefore also be interpreted with caution. The <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-Absolute-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna Absolute Trial</LINK> found strongly in favour of PTA and stenting and had a relatively large number of participants. This study therefore contributed a large weight towards analyses in which it was included, and is the main reason many forest plots show significance towards PTA and stenting. Nevertheless, the other large RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Cejna-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cejna 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FAST-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">FAST Trial</LINK>) which showed no difference between groups were included in the primary outcome measure analyses: duplex and angiographic patency, with <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-Absolute-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna Absolute Trial</LINK>. It is notable that at 12 months the inclusion of data from <LINK REF="STD-Becquemin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Becquemin 2003</LINK> produces a non-significant difference between PTA and PTA with stenting for angiographic patency. The finding in favour of stenting for primary duplex patency at 24 months does not include as many studies as at six and 12 months, and is so small that the inclusion of a small amount of data from another study could cause the overall difference to be statistically non-significant.</P>
<P>Although <LINK REF="STD-Grenacher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grenacher 2004</LINK> reports primary duplex patency, the numbers of participants at each time interval is unclear. For this reason we could not include the results in the meta-analyses. The inclusion of these data would diminish the difference between PTA and PTA with stenting and may have made the 12-month difference non-significant. We did not include secondary and primary assisted patency rates as outcome measures due to the differences in reporting between trials.</P>
<P>No trial reported data in a way that allowed results to be separated by Rutherford/Fontaine stages or by chronic (claudicants) and critical ischaemia. This might have been useful, as differences between these groups may be present. No trial was powered in this way, so even if subgroup results were reported their validity would have been questionable.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-05-26 09:52:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six trials used nitinol stents (<LINK REF="STD-Dick-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dick 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FAST-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">FAST Trial</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RESILIENT" TYPE="STUDY">RESILIENT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SUPER-study" TYPE="STUDY">SUPER study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-Absolute-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna Absolute Trial</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zdanowski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zdanowski 1999</LINK>), while the other trials used stainless steel. There is speculation that nitinol stents may perform differently to stainless steel, although this is not apparent in these data. Indeed, two trials (<LINK REF="STD-FAST-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">FAST Trial</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-Absolute-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna Absolute Trial</LINK>) used nitinol stents with similar participant numbers and procedural protocols, but showed differing outcomes. The reasons for this are unclear, but one obvious difference between these trials was the antiplatelet therapy protocol used. In the <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-Absolute-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna Absolute Trial</LINK> clopidogrel is used for long-term anticoagulation, whereas aspirin is used in both <LINK REF="STD-Cejna-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cejna 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-FAST-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">FAST Trial</LINK>. Additionally, <LINK REF="STD-Cejna-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cejna 2001</LINK> excluded participants with ipsilateral iliac artery disease, whereas in the <LINK REF="STD-FAST-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">FAST Trial</LINK> and the <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-Absolute-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna Absolute Trial</LINK> the authors treated ipsilateral iliac disease with angioplasty and then included the participant in the trial. Medication is thus a major confounding factor between trials, especially the use of clopidogrel which is known to be associated with improved stent patency in coronary artery stents (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Becquemin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Becquemin 2003</LINK> specifically states that 'bailout' stenting was performed in 15% of participants in the PTA-alone arm, and it is unclear whether these participants were included in the PTA arm for analysis at 12 months. The <LINK REF="STD-FAST-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">FAST Trial</LINK> excluded PTA participants requiring a bailout stent. The fate of such participants in the other trials was unclear. This is another potential source of bias, as in <LINK REF="STD-Becquemin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Becquemin 2003</LINK> a significant difference may be present if the participants undergoing bailout stenting were subsequently included in the stent arm, or excluded from the trial. <LINK REF="STD-RESILIENT" TYPE="STUDY">RESILIENT</LINK> provided high participant numbers but cross-over to stent implantation in the angioplasty arm was high (40%), complicating data analysis.</P>
<P>Trials sponsored by device companies are statistically more likely to produce results in favour of the device (here stents) being tested (<LINK REF="REF-Lundh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Djulbegovic-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Djulbegovic 2013</LINK>). This was true of many of the trials included in this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Becquemin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Becquemin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cejna-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cejna 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FAST-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">FAST Trial</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grenacher-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grenacher 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grimm-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Grimm 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RESILIENT" TYPE="STUDY">RESILIENT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SUPER-study" TYPE="STUDY">SUPER study</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vienna-Absolute-Trial" TYPE="STUDY">Vienna Absolute Trial</LINK>) and therefore may bias outcomes in favour of stents.</P>
<P>Reviewing the acceptability and quality of the evidence, it is therefore difficult to accept that the differences found between the PTA alone and PTA with stenting groups are of clinical relevance.</P>

<P>The current trial data indicate that there is a small short-term patency benefit for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with stenting over PTA alone for treating lesions of the superficial femoral artery. However, the magnitude of the benefit is small and inconsistent. Protocols varied between trials, and the benefit may be limited to people with superficial femoral artery (SFA) disease subsequently treated with long-term clopidogrel. Haemodynamic findings are often used to assess the success of angioplasty and stent insertion. Importantly however, clinical findings, especially quality of life, is not significantly improved by this treatment strategy.</P>
<P>Many of these trials predominantly used claudicants for intervention. Current best evidence shows that exercise therapy is more useful than angioplasty for sustained improvements in quality of life and walking distance as the initial treatment of claudication (<LINK REF="REF-Frans-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frans 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mazari-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazari 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2008</LINK>). The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) therefore recommends supervised exercise therapy as the first-line treatment (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>). In this context, measures of angiographic or duplex patency can be misleading, as they do not equate to the most important outcomes for the patient: walking distance and quality of life. Small improvements in short-term patency using stents are also expensive from a health economics point of view. The current evidence base does not support the use of routine stent insertion following PTA for treatment of lesions of the SFA.</P>

<P>A trial with quality of life, perceived and actual walking differences, and survival with intact limb would have more clinically useful endpoints than measures of primary patency.</P>
<P>The effect of antiplatelet therapy on PTA and stenting of SFA lesions needs to be properly investigated in a randomised controlled trial. Consideration should also be given to including a non-intervention control group and two-year outcomes in the evaluation of new SFA stents. As only subgroups of participants may benefit from stenting, trials should be of sufficient size to allow for heterogeneity in, for example, concurrent lesions (often a finding in clinical practice) and severity of disease, and should offer at least a two-year follow-up.</P>
