<P>Too little evidence to show whether continuous oxygen therapy for pregnant women benefits babies in the womb who are smaller than expected.</P>
<P>Babies who receive too little oxygen from their mother's blood can grow more slowly than expected before birth (impaired fetal growth). With extreme lack of oxygen, the baby can die in the womb. Sometimes, it may be suggested that the mother breathe extra oxygen through a face mask 24 hours daily (oxygen therapy) until the baby's birth. The review of trials found that there is too little evidence to show whether the baby's growth improves when women have continuous oxygen therapy from mid-pregnancy until the baby's birth. There is some evidence that fewer babies may die, although further research is needed.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-07-03 16:02:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Impaired fetal growth is the failure of a newborn to achieve its genetically determined growth potential, which may cause death as well as short or long-term childhood morbidity. It has been reported that 3% to 10% of neonates are small for corresponding gestational age and an estimated 30% of this is due to impaired fetal growth. The remaining 70% is due to constitutional factors such as maternal ethnicity, parity, weight and height (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1998</LINK>). The condition occurs with limited flow of nutrients and/or oxygen from mother to fetus as a result of fetal causes (e.g. chromosomal abnormalities, congenital malformations), placental factors (e.g. small placenta), or maternal factors (e.g. malnutrition, vascular/renal disease, drugs or other metabolic conditions) (<LINK REF="REF-Resnik-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnik 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Ultrasound evaluation of the fetus by measuring the abdominal circumference, head circumference, length of upper leg and interpreting these using standardised formulae allows the clinician to estimate the fetal weight, to relate this to the gestational age and to follow the growth progress. Ultrasound evaluation also allows to some extent to estimate the timing and the cause of the impairment. Symmetrical growth of the fetus is generally due to early problems such as chromosomal abnormalities, drugs, chemical agents or infection. Asymmetric growth usually results from inadequacy of substrates the fetus needs particularly later in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Resnik-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnik 2002</LINK>). In low-income settings where early pregnancy ultrasound is not available, fetal growth can be monitored by serial symphysis fundus measurements. However, there is no proven effective treatment that can be applied once growth impairment is diagnosed. In general, when no apparent congenital abnormality exists, management is conservative, involving frequent growth measurements, recommending smoking cessation if the mother smokes, and early delivery when the fetus is thought be mature enough to survive outside the womb. </P>
<P>The outcomes of impaired growth are variable and usually related to the specific cause. For example, if the growth impairment is due to chromosomal anomalies or congenital abnormalities, the fetus is more at risk of a perinatal death. Other short-term outcomes may be moderate to mild metabolic problems (hypoglycemia, polycythemia, meconium aspiration, etc.) due to the chronic oxygen and nutrient deprivation. Depending on the severity and the duration of the condition, long-term outcomes may differ from normal to small decreases in IQ to an increased risk of cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Bernstein-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernstein 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fetal growth impairment is characterised by hypoxaemia, hypoglycaemia and various other metabolic derangements. Findings from uncontrolled studies using cordocentesis suggested that fetal hypoxaemia could be corrected with maternal oxygen therapy and led to the hypothesis that perinatal outcome might also be improved (<LINK REF="REF-Nicolaides-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolaides 1987</LINK>). The suggested technique is to give the mother oxygen by mask, continuously (24 hours/day) until delivery. Besides being an uncomfortable treatment with potential psychosocial adverse effects for women, there is concern about possible toxic effects (pulmonary dysfunction) of prolonged maternal hyperoxygenation for the mother (<LINK REF="STD-Johanson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Johanson 1995</LINK>). </P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Three trials conducted in Italy (<LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1992</LINK>), South Africa (<LINK REF="STD-Johanson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Johanson 1995</LINK>) and UK and South Africa (<LINK REF="STD-Lindow-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lindow 2002</LINK>) have been included in this review. Ninety-four women were included in these trials.</P>
<P>There are two reports by Battaglia and colleagues published in 1992 (<LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1992</LINK>) and 1994 (<LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1994</LINK>). It is unclear whether the two reports refer to two studies or separate publication of subgroups from one study. In neither report was any detailed description of random allocation and power calculation given. The first report (<LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1992</LINK>) includes 36 women with 'intrauterine growth retardation' and the second (<LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1994</LINK>) 38 women with 'mild intrauterine growth retardation'. Both studies have also been conducted at similar periods. Attempts have been made to get clarification from the first author but no contact could be made. The second trial is therefore excluded until further information becomes available (<LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>In Battaglia et al (<LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1992</LINK>) the control group received bedrest and antihypertensive therapy if indicated. Bedrest was the standard therapy in the control group in <LINK REF="STD-Johanson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Johanson 1995</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Lindow-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lindow 2002</LINK> was double-blind and control group received humidified air under the same conditions as the treatment group (8 litres per minute giving a 40% concentration via a face mask 24 hours per day). Oxygen groups received 55% (<LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1992</LINK>) or 40% (<LINK REF="STD-Johanson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Johanson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindow-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lindow 2002</LINK>) humidified oxygen at 8 litres per minute by face mask, 24 hours per day.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Battaglia et al (<LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1992</LINK>) do not specify the method of 'randomly assigning' women with impaired fetal growth to an oxygenation and to a control group. They do not state whether outcomes were assessed blind to group allocation. The rates of perinatal mortality may have been influenced by the fact that four of the control group fetuses who died were 25 to 26 weeks at enrolment, whereas the most immature fetus in the oxygenation group was 27.5 weeks. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Johanson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Johanson 1995</LINK> used sealed opaque envelopes to conceal allocation but outcome assessments were not blinded. Results were not analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. One baby was dead in the bedrest group after birth. This case was excluded from the analysis. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lindow-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lindow 2002</LINK> is reported as a double-blind trial. Randomization was made using opaque sealed envelopes and stratified into two groups according to gestational weeks. The two groups received the interventions from uniform coloured gas cylinders marked as either 'a' or 'b' although it is not clear whether they were identical. In order not to reveal the allocated group, arterial blood gas tensions were not measured. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-07-03 16:02:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Perinatal mortality was statistically significantly lower in the oxygen group (n = 46) (risk ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.81) compared to control group (n = 48) which was consistent across all three trials.</P>
<P>The time from diagnosis to delivery was (mean ± SE) 10.1 ± 3.5 versus 9 ± 3.1 days (<LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1992</LINK>), 17 versus 22 days (SE of the means are not available) (<LINK REF="STD-Johanson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Johanson 1995</LINK>) and 12.8 ± 2.2 versus 10.4 ± 2.0 days (<LINK REF="STD-Lindow-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lindow 2002</LINK>) in the oxygen and control groups respectively. In all studies birthweights were higher in the oxygen group.</P>
<P>No significant side-effects or adverse outcomes have been reported.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Maternal hyperoxygenation was suggested initially as a treatment for impaired fetal growth on the basis of uncontrolled trials. The three randomized trials reviewed here are consistent with respect to reduction in perinatal mortality which is a substantive outcome. However, both the Johanson (<LINK REF="STD-Johanson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Johanson 1995</LINK>) and Battaglia (<LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Battaglia-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Battaglia 1994</LINK>) studies have methodological problems. Not using a placebo may influence the timing of interventions and introduce bias. Both studies had greater gestational ages of fetuses in the oxygen groups which can explain the differences in perinatal mortality. The reason for this may be selection bias (unlikely in the <LINK REF="STD-Johanson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Johanson 1995</LINK> study) or an alpha error due to small sample size. The <LINK REF="STD-Lindow-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lindow 2002</LINK> study is the only double-blind study, but has limited power to detect a significant benefit due to the small sample size. </P>
<P>Bearing in mind the methodological problems, the small number of women included, and the potential for harm against the possibility of reduction in perinatal mortality indicated in all three trials, there is good justification for investigating oxygen therapy further in the context of well-designed controlled trials.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In view of the methodological limitations and the small sample sizes of the trials identified so far, the use of maternal oxygenation should await the results of further trials, particularly in view of the suggestion from some studies that oxygen therapy may reduce uterine blood flow (<LINK REF="STD-Tervila-1973a" TYPE="STUDY">Tervila 1973a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tervila-1973b" TYPE="STUDY">Tervila 1973b</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further trials on maternal oxygen therapy seem to be justified. These will need to have adequate sample sizes with realistic estimates of effects on substantive outcomes and therefore, will most probably require multicentre collaboration.</P>

<P>This is a randomized controlled trial of maternal hyperoxygenation in women with healthy pregnancies and healthy fetuses. The objective was to assess the reactivity of the fetal pulmonary circulation to 5 minutes of 60% oxygen at 20 to 26 weeks and 31 to 36 weeks of pregnancy. 20 women in each period were randomly allocated to oxygen or room air. Doppler measurements were taken at baseline and after oxygenation (or room air administration) in the 2 groups. The authors found that the fetal pulmonary circulation is more responsive to oxygenation later in pregnancy. All changes returned to baseline when oxygenation was discontinued.</P>
