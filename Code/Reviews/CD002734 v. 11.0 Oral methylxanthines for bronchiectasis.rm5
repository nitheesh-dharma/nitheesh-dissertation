<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Bronchiectasis is a lung condition that usually develops after a series of lung problems (such as childhood infections, lung structure problems, tuberculosis, and cystic fibrosis). Mucus (phlegm) collects in the lungs, causing discomfort and infections. Muscle spasms can also narrow the airways (passages to the lungs), causing breathing problems. Drugs to relax the muscles in the airways can help. Methyl-xanthine drugs (such as caffeine, theophylline and aminophylline) can affect the muscles, and are sometimes used for other lung diseases. They can have adverse effects. The review found there are no trials of the use of methyl-xanthines for people with bronchiectasis.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-03-09 09:02:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Bronchiectasis is a condition characterised by abnormal permanent dilation of the bronchi with bronchial wall thickening, chronic inflammation, recurrent infection and abnormal mucociliary clearance. The abnormal mucociliary clearance leads to stagnation of secretions and recurrent infection or colonisation with bacteria, particularly with staphylococcal, pseudomonas and haemophilus species. </P>
<P>The disease is characterised by chronic cough and sputum production (often purulent) and haemoptysis is not uncommon. There is usually airflow obstruction, breathlessness and in more severe cases respiratory failure. Bronchiectasis is caused by several different processes including severe pneumonia, foreign body aspiration, tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis, immunoglobulin deficiency and immotile cilia syndromes. Cystic fibrosis can cause a severe form of bronchiectasis but will not be covered in this review. </P>
<P>The mainstays of treatment are currently physiotherapy, antibiotics and bronchodilators. The xanthine group of drugs includes theophylline and aminophylline. They have well established roles in the treatment of airflow obstruction in both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Their mechanism of action has been proposed to be phosphodiesterase inhibition, although in vivo intracellular concentrations are too low for this to be the sole action. It has also been proposed that additional actions may include improving strength and effectiveness of respiratory muscles and T-lymphocyte mediated anti-inflammatory activity.</P>
<P>The use of xanthines in adults is suggested at step three of the British Thoracic Society's guidelines for asthma, although on a world wide basis they are used even earlier. In COPD they are recommended for severe airflow obstruction, where symptoms persist despite inhaled bronchodilators. Although bronchiectasis is characterised by airflow obstruction, the role of xanthines in this disease is not well established.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of oral xanthine therapy in bronchiectasis in adults.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2010-03-09 09:02:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Trials were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, and handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. All records in the Specialised Register coded as 'bronchiectasis' were searched using the following terms:</P>
<P>theo* or aminophyllin* or xanthin* or *methyl-xanthin* or *methylxanthin* or doxofyllin* or caffeine* or *phyllin*</P>
<P>Initial searches were conducted in July 1999. Subsequent update searches were carried out on annual basis. The most recent search was run in March 2010.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The intention of the review was to examine randomised control trials comparing xanthines to placebo and other forms of treatment and extract the necessary data. Bibliographies were searched to reveal other relevant RCTs. Manufacturers of xanthines were contacted for relevant information on studies in their own databases. </P>
<P>Papers were retrieved and assessed by two reviewers (KS and MG). None met the inclusion criteria for the review.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>In spite of exhaustive searching for randomised control trials, only seven references were identified from the searches conducted for the review. All seven articles were excluded after careful scrutiny (see Excluded Studies section) and therefore no data was available for analysis. An update search carried out in March 2007 did not identify any additional studies relevant to the review. </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Methyl-xanthines have a well established role in airflow obstruction associated with asthma and COPD. As an extrapolation of this they have also been used in bronchiectasis. One recent excluded study assessed the combination of a macrolide and theophylline in the treatment of bronchiectasis, in which symptomatic improvement was reported (<LINK REF="STD-Ming-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ming 2005</LINK>). No placebo control was reported in this study, and the combination of two potentially active therapies without a monocomponent comparator does not provide reliable data on the use of theophylline in this population. Studies are required which compare active therapies with a placebo, or which provide some reliable basis of comparing the additive effect of a xanthine to usual therapy. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In the absence of any data we cannot support or refute the practice of using methyl-xanthines in bronchiectasis. Physicians may well continue to use this treatment on an empirical or trial basis but will wish to be aware that the practice is not evidence based.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further work is required to establish if this group of drugs has any role in the therapy of bronchiectasis. Studies should assess xanthine agents in such a way as to enable rigorous assessment of their effects, either with a placebo control or in addition to usual care. </P>
