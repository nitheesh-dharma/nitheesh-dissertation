<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Metabolic control (glycaemic control, that is long-term blood glucose levels as measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)) often deteriorates during puberty in children with type 1 diabetes possibly due to the development of insulin resistance (insulin does not work effectively in the tissues anymore) and this creates a great need for alternative therapeutic strategies in those patients. We searched for randomised controlled trials of good quality that studied the effects of metformin added to insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus in adolescents on glycaemic control, insulin sensitivity, health-related quality of life, side-effects as well as effects on body weight, serum lipids and insulin dose.<BR/>Only two trials (60 participants, three months treatment) could be included. Both studies suggested that metformin plus insulin treatment lowered HbA1c somewhat more than placebo plus insulin. Improvement in insulin sensitivity, body weight or serum lipids were not seen in either study. However, one study showed a small decrease in insulin dosage by 10%. Side effects were mainly gastrointestinal upset in both studies and hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) in one study. There was no information on health-related quality of life, costs, morbidity or mortality in either study.<BR/>

<P>Only two trials (60 participants) investigating the effect of metformin added to insulin therapy for three months in adolescents with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes could be included. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the clinical and methodological heterogeneity of data. Both studies suggested that metformin treatment lowered glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in adolescents with type 1 diabetes and poor metabolic control. Improvements in insulin sensitivity, body composition or serum lipids were not documented in either study, however, one study showed a decrease in insulin dosage by 10%. Adverse effects were mainly gastrointestinal in both studies and hypoglycaemia in one study. No data on health-related quality of life, all-cause mortality or morbidity are currently available.</P>

<P>There is some evidence suggesting improvement of metabolic control in poorly controlled adolescents with type 1 diabetes, on addition of metformin to insulin therapy.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-04 16:35:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (see 'About', 'Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs)'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main glossary in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<P>Metabolic control often deteriorates during puberty in children with type 1 diabetes. Puberty is associated with marked insulin resistance. Moreover, weight gain is prevalent in adolescents with type 1 diabetes after attainment of final height, which might further impair insulin sensitivity. Insulin dosages are often increased to overcome the resistance to insulin, but the metabolic control, however, often deteriorates during the later stages of pubertal development (<LINK REF="REF-Mortensen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mortensen 1998</LINK>). Other factors contributing to insulin resistance in adolescents with type 1 diabetes are the increase of sex steroids in this period, the hyperglycaemia associated with noncompliance (<LINK REF="REF-Yki_x002d_Jarvinen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yki-Jarvinen 1997</LINK>), as well as the disturbance of the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) to growth hormone (GH) axis, leading to elevated GH levels (<LINK REF="REF-Halldin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halldin 1998</LINK>), resulting in impaired peripheral insulin sensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-Caprio-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caprio 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yki_x002d_Jarvinen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yki-Jarvinen 1997</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-04 16:31:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Pubertal changes create a great need for alternative therapeutic strategies in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. One possibility, to accommodate for these changes, is the addition of a drug that improves insulin sensitivity. A candidate for this is metformin, the effect of which regarding insulin sensitivity has been documented (<LINK REF="STD-Sarnblad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarnblad 2003</LINK>). Metformin belongs to the biguanides class (<LINK REF="REF-Saenz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saenz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2005</LINK>). It has been proposed that metformin might increase insulin sensitivity in the liver by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis and thereby reducing hepatic glucose production (<LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 2003</LINK>). It has also been proposed that metformin decreases fatty acid oxidation and intestinal glucose absorption, but the contributions of these effects to the total antihyperglycaemic action is considered to be small (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2002</LINK>). Metformin also seems to increase peripheral insulin sensitivity by enhancing glucose uptake in the muscle (<LINK REF="STD-Sarnblad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarnblad 2003</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>The reported side effects of metformin are: hypoglycaemia, lactic acidosis, poor compliance and gastrointestinal upset (<LINK REF="REF-Gin-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gin 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarnblad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarnblad 2003</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2002</LINK>) debated the appropriateness of metformin use for people with type 1 diabetes; given the potential for coexisting lactic acidosis and diabetic ketoacidosis, and that the minimal reduction of daily insulin requirements, does not equal the risk of severe hypoglycaemia. Furthermore, it is likely that the incidence of hypoglycaemia is much greater if more aggressive metabolic targets are applied. Despite the failure to observe diabetic ketoacidosis, the limited number and short period of observation do not permit the conclusion that metformin is safe in ketosis-prone diabetic individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2002</LINK>). Therefore, the question of safety of metformin use in type 1 diabetes is still questionable (<LINK REF="REF-Aldasouqi--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aldasouqi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Faichney-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faichney 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Misbin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Misbin 1998</LINK>).</P>

</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-11-04 16:31:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Metformin has mainly been used in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and several studies have shown beneficial effects on body weight, blood lipid levels and metabolic control (<LINK REF="REF-Howlet-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howlet 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehnert-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehnert 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKDPS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKDPS 1998</LINK>). Moreover, randomised controlled trials with metformin, in adolescents with type 2 diabetes, noted an improvement in fasting plasma glucose (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2002</LINK>). Similarly, studies done in type 1 diabetes, demonstrated different combinations of the following: reduction of glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), increased insulin sensitivity, decreased dosage of insulin, decreased body mass index (BMI) and improvement of lipid profile (<LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarnblad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarnblad 2003</LINK>). The insulin-sparing effect during metformin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes has been reported to be around 25% (<LINK REF="REF-Golay-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golay 1995</LINK>). It is reasonable to speculate that the main effect of metformin in adolescents with type 1 diabetes is associated with improved peripheral insulin sensitivity. This is in contrast to patients with type 2 diabetes, where the effect is mainly mediated by decreased hepatic glucose output (<LINK REF="REF-Hundal-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hundal 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-04 18:20:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>In adolescents with type 1 diabetes, insulin resistance likely plays a role in the deterioration of metabolic control seen in this age group (<LINK REF="STD-Sarnblad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarnblad 2003</LINK>). In the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), adolescents achieved HbA1c levels that were on average 1% higher than in adults in both the conventional and intensive treatment groups, despite receiving more insulin (units per kilogram body weight) and having increased weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-DCCT-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">DCCT 1994</LINK>). This triad of high HbA1c, high insulin dosage, and weight gain suggests that the insulin administered was less effective in maintaining glycaemic control in the adolescent cohort. Therefore, oral agents used to treat type 2 diabetes may be a useful adjunctive therapy in individuals with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2002</LINK>). The biguanide, metformin, acts primarily by decreasing hepatic glucose output, but also affects insulin sensitivity. Both mechanisms may benefit the insulin-resistant individual with type 1 diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Sarnblad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarnblad 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In type 1 diabetes, addition of metformin to insulin therapy has been assessed in a few trials involving few patients or in uncontrolled studies of short duration (<LINK REF="REF-Gin-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gin 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Janssen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janssen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pagno-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagno 1983</LINK>). These studies suggested a mean reduction in insulin resistance of 25% with a variation of 20% to 40%. Several other studies were reviewed by Daniel and Hagmeyer (<LINK REF="REF-Daniel-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daniel 1997</LINK>); most of them, however, were conducted before the introduction of HbA1c with small samples of mainly adult patients. Thus, the clinical interest of metformin in the treatment of type 1 diabetes has remained questionable. One study (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2002</LINK>) showed that a small subset of type 1 diabetic patients benefited in terms of insulin dose reduction when metformin was added to insulin, however, questions about long-term safety and efficacy in this patient population remained unanswered. Moreover, there have been conflicting reports from studies in adolescents with type 1 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Desmangles-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desmangles 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarnblad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarnblad 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walravens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Walravens 2000</LINK>). The benefit was transient in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Walravens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Walravens 2000</LINK>) and negative in another (<LINK REF="REF-Desmangles-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desmangles 2000</LINK>). The main drawback of these studies was the small sample size, and the lack of reporting on long-term benefit and safety of adjunctive therapy in many of them. No systematic reviews are available up to date to summarize the evidence about metformin addition to insulin therapy in this cohort.<BR/>

Such quality was assessed using the criteria set out by Jadad and Schultz (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schultz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 1995</LINK>) as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systemic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Possible disagreement was resolved by consensus. Interrater agreement for the key quality indicator (concealment of allocation) was planned to be calculated using the kappa statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1960</LINK>).</P>
<P>The following criteria were used:<BR/>(1) minimization of selection bias: a) Was the randomisation procedure adequate? b) Was the allocation concealment adequate?<BR/>(2) minimization of performance bias: Were the patients and people administering the treatment blind to the intervention?<BR/>(3) Minimization of attrition bias: a) Were withdrawals and drop-outs described completely? b) Was analysis by intention-to-treat?<BR/>(4) Minimization of detection bias: Were measures objective (glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HB A1c), mortality) or were outcome assessors blind to the intervention?<BR/>Based on these criteria, studies were subdivided into one of the following three categories:<BR/>A - all quality criteria met: low risk of bias.<BR/>B - one or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate risk of bias.<BR/>C - one or more criteria not met: high risk of bias.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-11-04 16:50:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>We expected both event (dichotomous) data and continuous data.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we extracted numbers of participants experiencing an outcome and total number of participants randomised in each study arm. Dichotomous outcome data (for example side effects of metformin (yes/no)) were planned to be expressed as odds ratios (OR) or relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, the risk difference (RD) was intended to be calculated as well as the number needed to treat (NNT), taking into account baseline differences and time.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous outcomes, means and standard deviations of the initial and final readings in each arm were extracted together with details of change if available. Change of a measure was calculated from baseline to the end of the study with a minimum duration of the intervention of three months. Continuous outcomes (for example metabolic control as measured by HbA1c, insulin dose, serum lipids, body mass index, insulin sensitivity) were planned to be expressed and calculated, as weighted mean differences of the change between treatment and control groups with 95% CI.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2008-11-04 16:51:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Authors were contacted to provide relevant missing data, if feasible, and the impact of missing data was planned to be discussed. Missing data were planned to be quantified and characterised as pre-randomisation, immediately post-randomisation or drop-out during the intervention period. Evaluation of important numerical data such as screened, eligible and randomised patients as well as intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) population were carefully performed. Attrition rates, for example drop-outs, losses to follow-up and withdrawals were investigated. Issues of last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF), ITT and PP was planned to be critically appraised and compared to specification of primary outcome parameters.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-04 16:52:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>In the event of substantial clinical or methodological or statistical heterogeneity, study results were not combined by means of meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was planned to be identified by visual inspection of the forest plots, by using a standard &#967;<SUP>2</SUP>-test and a significance level of &#945; = 0.1, in view of the low power of such tests. Heterogeneity was intended to be specifically examined with I<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>), where I<SUP>2</SUP>-values of 50% and more indicated a substantial level of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).

There were no significant differences between the groups in either of the two clamps. Neither the M/I-values nor the M-values were significantly different between the groups at baseline or after three months. The M-values were unchanged in both groups. M/I, however, increased significantly in the metformin group during the study (P &lt; 0.05), but was unchanged in the placebo group.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-04 18:09:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>In this systematic review, we found some evidence that metformin added to insulin therapy in adolescents with poorly controlled diabetes can lead to better glycaemic control, demonstrated by significantly decreased glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in the two included studies and by decreased fasting blood glucose in the <LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 2003</LINK> study. However, there was no significant change in peripheral insulin sensitivity in both studies three months following the addition of metformin. The evidence related to side-effects was conflicting. The metformin group experienced more side effects compared to the placebo group in the <LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 2003</LINK> study in the form of hypoglycaemia and gastrointestinal upset, while the opposite was demonstrated by the <LINK REF="STD-Sarnblad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarnblad 2003</LINK> study with less side-effects in metformin compared to the placebo group. There was no significant effect on body mass index or serum lipids in either study. There were no data on healt-related quality of life, costs, all-cause or disease-specific mortality or morbidity in either study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effect on glycaemic control</HEADING>
<P>There is evidence from both studies, that addition of metformin improves metabolic control in the form of decrease of HbA1c, while decrease of blood glucose was evident in only one study. This improvement may have been attributable to the direct impact of metformin on peripheral tissues, but more likely was secondary to the effects on decreased hepatic glucose output (<LINK REF="REF-Hundal-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hundal 2000</LINK>). However, both trials were of short duration and it is the long-term glycaemic control that should be monitored and is actually more important in clinical practice.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effect on peripheral insulin sensitivity</HEADING>
<P>Puberty is associated with marked insulin resistance, mainly affecting peripheral glucose utilisation and to a less extent fat metabolism. Insulin dosages are often increased to overcome the resistance to insulin, but the metabolic control, however, often deteriorates during the later stages of pubertal development. It has been proposed that metformin might increase insulin sensitivity in the liver by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis and thereby reducing hepatic glucose production (<LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 2003</LINK>). It may also decrease fatty acid oxidation and intestinal glucose absorption as well as enhance glucose uptake in the muscle (<LINK REF="STD-Sarnblad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarnblad 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, both studies, included in this review, failed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect of metformin therapy on peripheral insulin sensitivity. <LINK REF="STD-Sarnblad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarnblad 2003</LINK> used the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp technique. They estimated the peripheral glucose uptake but not the hepatic glucose production and found an improved glucose uptake in the patients treated with metformin but not in the placebo group. They also observed that more insulin-resistant patients benefited most from metformin treatment, as there was an association between initial M/I and both change in HbA1c and change in insulin sensitivity. These results emphasise that metformin effect on peripheral insulin sensitivity seems to be of importance for the obtained metabolic effect in insulin-resistant adolescents with type 1 diabetes, although simultaneous effects on hepatic glucose production can not be excluded.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 2003</LINK> used the frequently sampled i.v. glucose tolerance test, which was originally designed for participants with residual pancreatic insulin secretion. Although they used an insulin-modified test, they experienced major methodological problems and their patients were not kept normoglycaemic overnight. Fasting blood glucose levels were thus negatively correlated to insulin sensitivity (SI), and glucose levels tended to increase during the end of the test resulting in a false high SI. The SD in the study population was much wider than anticipated and likely was related to difficulties in calculating SI in this population by the MINMOD analysis method (<LINK REF="REF-Bergman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergman 1989</LINK>). Ambient glucose at the start of the study correlated with SI; thus, for this test to be improved upon in type 1 diabetes, strict stabilization of blood glucose at the onset may be necessary. Further work to determine the most appropriate modifications of this technique in type 1 diabetes may make it a more reliable tool in this setting.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effect on insulin dose</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 2003</LINK> reported a significant reduction in mean daily insulin dose after three months of metformin therapy ( -0.14 (0.1), P = 0.01). The insulin-sparing effect during metformin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes has been reported to be around 25% in previous studies probably due to the improvement of peripheral insulin sensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-Gin-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gin 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Janssen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janssen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pagno-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagno 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>On the contrary, <LINK REF="STD-Sarnblad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sarnblad 2003</LINK> did not find any reduced need for insulin three months after metformin therapy. This might be explained by the fact that the population was selected from adolescents with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes. A reduction of the insulin dosage was not the primary goal of the study. On the other hand, if the study had been longer and the effect on metabolic control sustained, effects on the daily dosage of insulin, might have been observed.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-11-04 18:16:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>As far as we are aware of, no systematic review has been done with an exclusive focus on the value of addition of metformin to insulin therapy in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. One of the main strengths of this review is the rigourness and completeness of the search. However, it is remarkable that only two trials were retrieved by comprehensive searching (MEDLINE, EMBASE, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, databases of ongoing trials as well as by hand searching) which emphasizes the deficiency of RCTs in this area. Second, the a-priori decision to include randomised trials only with a duration of at least three months ensured a minimum level of quality, and at the same time, the relevance of the review to guide clinical practice. Third, we assessed many different outcomes in the review which enables the readers to judge by themselves what matters most for their own particular question. Finally, we think that the tables and the extensive provision of all outcome data and information related to quality and heterogeneity, makes the review transparent.</P>
<P>It is clear that the main limitations are the missing and unclear data about the two trials. Corresponding authors were contacted via emails but no further data were submitted up-to-date. The heterogeneity of the studies hampered the performance of meta-analysis, so we could not confirm the beneficial effects of metformin therapy on improvement of insulin sensitivity, decrease of insulin dose or ensure the safety of the tested drug regimen. Even the analysis of the effect on glycaemic control has to be interpreted with caution since the measurements of glycosylated haemoglobin were not standardised among studies and reference ranges demonstrated distinct dissimilarities.<BR/>Moreover, many patient-oriented outcomes like health-related quality of life or diabetes complications and mortality were never investigated in high-quality randomised clinical trials and so these important primary outcomes could not be assessed in this review.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-04 18:18:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Use of metformin, along with insulin therapy, has been studied less frequently in type 1 than in type 2 diabetes, but insulin-sparing effects of metformin have been observed (<LINK REF="REF-Gin-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gin 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Golay-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golay 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Janssen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janssen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pagno-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagno 1983</LINK>). Most of these studies have been small (<LINK REF="REF-Gin-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gin 1982</LINK>), were uncontrolled (<LINK REF="REF-Janssen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janssen 1991</LINK>), or were cross-over trials of short duration (<LINK REF="REF-Pagno-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagno 1983</LINK>). Even in one previous trial involving the administration of insulin by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), the duration of treatment was only three weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Bending-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bending 1987</LINK>), and during this period, insulin resistance was not modified. Pagno et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Pagno-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagno 1983</LINK>) showed the most marked reduction in insulin resistance in type 1diabetic patients using large doses of metformin (850 mg three times a day). However, the 25% reduction in insulin resistance observed during 24-h euglycaemic clamp did not really correspond to insulin needs in clinical practice. In one study (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2002</LINK>), the maximum effect of metformin in reducing insulin resistane was not seen until after four months of treatment, followed thereafter by a stabilization period. In contrast, previous studies showed that the insulin sparing effect in type 1 diabetes occurred after a few days (<LINK REF="REF-Coscelli-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coscelli 1984</LINK>) or a few weeks of metformin use (<LINK REF="REF-Janssen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janssen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pagno-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pagno 1983</LINK>). Preliminary results of two studies examining metformin treatment in teens with type 1 diabetes have been presented (<LINK REF="REF-Desmangles-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desmangles 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walravens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Walravens 2000</LINK>). The first, an open-label, randomized study of five adolescents taking 500 to 1000 mg metformin daily found no improvement in HbA1c or a decrease in insulin dosage after six months (<LINK REF="REF-Desmangles-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desmangles 2000</LINK>). This study was limited because it was small, uncontrolled, and used low metformin dosages. The second was a larger randomised controlled trial, with metformin administered as 500 mg twice daily for six months in 80 adolescents with poor metabolic control and type 1 diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Walravens-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Walravens 2000</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Metformin added to insulin therapy might be used in clinical practice in adolescents with type 1 diabetes who are poorly controlled and show evidence of insulin resistance, taking into consideration the side effects of metformin therapy while balancing the benefits and harms of therapy for individual patients.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-04 18:19:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Bernd Richter">
<P>Metformin represents a novel adjunctive therapy worthy of further investigation, that may improve metabolic control in teens with type 1 diabetes. Further, larger studies, carried out over longer time periods, are recommended to document the long-term safety and efficacy of this regimen. Health-related quality of life, costs, all-cause and disease-specific mortality and morbidity are important patient-oriented outcomes that should be reported in future studies to guide clinical practice.</P>
