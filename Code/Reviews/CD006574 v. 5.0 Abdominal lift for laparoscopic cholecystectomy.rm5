<P>Two publications (a full text article and a conference abstract) may be two different randomised trials. We did not receive a reply from the authors on our e-mail sent in February 2007 and July 2013. Only one of the reports contain information that can be used for analysis. So, whether these are two reports of the same trial or two different trials does not affect the meta-analysis in any way. For the purpose of this review, we considered them to be two reports of the same trial.</P>

<P>Conclusions partially changed. In the previous version of the review, we did not recommend abdominal wall lift over pneumoperitoneum but mentioned that it was probably safe. While we continue to recommend that abdominal wall lift cannot be preferred over pneumoperitoneum in those at low anaesthetic risk, we have revised our conclusion regarding the safety. We now believe that the safety of abdominal wall lift has not been established and so should be considered only in the trial setting. Our conclusions have been revised from the previous version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2008</LINK>) because of the updated version of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), which has resulted in a better understanding of the interpretation of evidence..</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-01 05:58:33 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Key-hole removal of the gallbladder (laparoscopic cholecystectomy) is currently the preferred treatment for people with symptoms related to gallstones in the gallbladder. This is generally performed by distending the tummy (abdomen) using carbon dioxide gas (pneumoperitoneum) so that there is adequate space for instruments and to visualise the structures within the abdomen. This enables the surgeons to identify and divide the appropriate structures. However, distending the abdominal wall can result in various physiological changes that affect the functioning of the heart or lungs. These changes are more pronounced at higher pressures of the gas used to distend the abdomen. They are generally tolerated well in people with a low risk of anaesthetic problems. However, those with pre-existing illnesses may not tolerate this distension of the abdomen well. So, an alternate method of enabling the surgeons to visualise the structures in the abdomen and to use instruments by lifting up the abdominal wall using special devices (abdominal wall lift) has been suggested for people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We reviewed all the relevant information from randomised trials (a type of study which provides the best information on whether one treatment is better than the other, if conducted properly) in the literature to find out if abdominal wall lift is better than distending the abdomen using carbon dioxide gas. We adopted methods to identify all the possible studies and used methods that decrease the errors in data collection.</P>
<P>
<B>Abdominal wall lift with pneumoperitoneum versus pneumoperitoneum</B>
<BR/>A total of 130 participants (all with low anaesthetic risk) were included in five trials which compared abdominal wall lift combined with very low pressure pneumoperitoneum and standard pneumoperitoneum. All five trials had a high risk of bias (introducing the possibility of overestimating benefits or underestimating the harms of abdominal wall lift). No-one died as a result of surgery. There was no significant difference in the rate of serious complications related to the surgery. None of the trials reported quality of life, the proportion of people discharged as laparoscopic cholecystectomy day-patients, or pain between four and eight hours after the operation. None required conversion of key-hole surgery to an open operation using a larger incision. There was no significant difference in the operating time between the two groups.</P>
<P>
<B>Abdominal wall lift versus pneumoperitoneum</B>
<BR/>A total of 774 participants (the majority with low anaesthetic risk) who underwent planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy were included in 18 trials which compared abdominal wall lift and standard pneumoperitoneum. All the trials had a high risk of bias. No-one died as a result of the surgery. There was no significant difference in the rate of serious complications related to surgery. None of the trials reported quality of life or pain between four and eight hours after the operation. There was no significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events, the proportion of people who underwent an open operation using a larger incision, or the proportion discharged on the same day of surgery. The operating time was about seven minutes longer on average if the operation was performed using abdominal wall lift rather than pneumoperitoneum.</P>
<P>In summary, abdominal wall lift does not seem to offer an advantage over pneumoperitoneum in any of the patient-oriented outcomes for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in people with low anaesthetic risk. Abdominal wall lift may increase costs by increasing the operating time. Hence it cannot be recommended routinely. The safety of abdominal wall lift is yet to be established. More randomised clinical trials on the topic are needed since the possibility of arriving at erroneous conclusions due to bias and due to the play of chance was high because of the design of the trials. Future trials should include people at high risk during anaesthesia. Furthermore, such trials should employ blinded assessments of outcome measures.</P>

<P>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (key-hole removal of the gallbladder) is now the most often used method for treatment of symptomatic gallstones. Several cardiopulmonary changes (decreased cardiac output, pulmonary compliance, and increased peak airway pressure) occur during pneumoperitoneum, which is now introduced to allow laparoscopic cholecystectomy. These cardiopulmonary changes may not be tolerated in individuals with poor cardiopulmonary reserve.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-29 06:01:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>For abdominal wall lift with pneumoperitoneum versus pneumoperitoneum, a total of 130 participants (all with low anaesthetic risk) scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised in five trials to abdominal wall lift with pneumoperitoneum (n = 53) versus pneumoperitoneum only (n = 52). One trial which included 25 people did not state the number of participants in each group. All five trials had a high risk of bias. There was no mortality or conversion to open cholecystectomy in any of the participants in the trials that reported these outcomes. There was no significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events between the two groups (two trials; 2/29 events (0.069 events per person) versus 2/29 events (0.069 events per person); rate ratio 1.00; 95% CI 0.17 to 5.77). None of the trials reported quality of life, the proportion of people discharged as day-patient laparoscopic cholecystectomies, or pain between four and eight hours after the operation. There was no significant difference in the operating time between the two groups (four trials; 53 participants versus 54 participants; 13.39 minutes longer (95% CI 2.73 less to 29.51 minutes longer) in the abdominal wall lift with pneumoperitoneum group and 100 minutes in the pneumoperitoneum group).</P>
<P>For abdominal wall lift versus pneumoperitoneum, a total of 774 participants (the majority with low anaesthetic risk) scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised in 18 trials to abdominal wall lift without pneumoperitoneum (n = 332) versus pneumoperitoneum (n = 358). One trial which included 84 people did not state the number in each group. All the trials had a high risk of bias. There was no mortality in any of the trials that reported this outcome. There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants with serious adverse events (six trials; 5/172 (weighted proportion 2.4%) versus 2/171 (1.2%); RR 2.01; 95% CI 0.52 to 7.80). There was no significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events between the two groups (three trials; 5/99 events (weighted number of events per person = 0.346 events) versus 2/99 events (0.020 events per person); rate ratio 1.73; 95% CI 0.35 to 8.61). None of the trials reported quality of life or pain between four and eight hours after the operation. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who underwent conversion to open cholecystectomy (11 trials; 5/225 (weighted proportion 2.3%) versus 7/235 (3.0%); RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.26 to 2.21). The operating time was significantly longer in the abdominal wall lift group than in the pneumoperitoneum group (16 trials; 6.87 minutes longer (95% CI 4.74 minutes to 9.00 minutes longer) in the abdominal wall lift group versus 75 minutes in the pneumoperitoneum group). There was no significant difference in the proportion of people discharged as laparoscopic cholecystectomy day-patients (two trials; 15/31 (weighted proportion 48.5%) versus 9/31 (29%); RR 1.67; 95% CI 0.85 to 3.26).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-04-23 15:08:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>About 10% to 15% of the adult western population have gallstones (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00f8_rgensen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jørgensen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NIH-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muhrbeck-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muhrbeck 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halldestam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halldestam 2004</LINK>). Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic in a year (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halldestam-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halldestam 2004</LINK>). More than half a million cholecystectomies (removal of the gallbladder) are performed per year in the United States alone (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1992</LINK>). Regional differences exist in the cholecystectomy rates (Mjäland 1998). Laparoscopic (key-hole) cholecystectomy is now the preferred method of cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fullarton-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fullarton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bakken-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakken 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keus 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Traditionally, one of the first steps in laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the creation of pneumoperitoneum (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1993</LINK>) using carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) applied through a Veress needle (<LINK REF="STD-Andersson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Andersson 2003</LINK>) or through a port (hole) (<LINK REF="STD-Galizia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Galizia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alijani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alijani 2004</LINK>) in the abdominal wall. The created pneumoperitoneum helps in the visualisation and manipulation of instruments inside the abdominal cavity. However, the increased intra-abdominal pressure due to the pneumoperitoneum causes several cardiopulmonary changes. The increased intra-abdominal pressure also increases the absorption of CO&#8322; (causing hypercapnia and acidosis), which has to be avoided by hyperventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Henny-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henny 2005</LINK>). The increased intra-abdominal pressure pushes the diaphragm upwards decreasing the pulmonary compliance (<LINK REF="STD-Alijani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alijani 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henny-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henny 2005</LINK>) and increasing the peak airway pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Galizia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Galizia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alijani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alijani 2004</LINK>). Pneumoperitoneum also increases the systemic vascular resistance (<LINK REF="STD-Galizia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Galizia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mertens-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mertens 2004</LINK>) and pulmonary vascular resistance (<LINK REF="STD-Galizia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Galizia 2001</LINK>). CO&#8322; pneumoperitoneum predisposes the patient to cardiac arrhythmias (<LINK REF="STD-Egawa-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Egawa 2006</LINK>). During the early phase of pneumoperitoneum, there is a decrease in heart rate (<LINK REF="STD-Alijani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alijani 2004</LINK>) and a reduction in cardiac output (<LINK REF="STD-Galizia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Galizia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alijani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alijani 2004</LINK>) as a result of decreased venous return (<LINK REF="REF-Neudecker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neudecker 2002</LINK>). While these cardiopulmonary changes may be tolerated by healthy adults with adequate cardiopulmonary reserve, people with cardiopulmonary disease may not tolerate these cardiopulmonary changes well. About 17% of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy have an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status (<LINK REF="REF-ASA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASA 2013</LINK>) of III or IV (<LINK REF="REF-Giger-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giger 2006</LINK>). Lower pressures of pneumoperitoneum have been used to decrease the cardiopulmonary changes and have been considered in a different review (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy--2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2009</LINK>). Helium insufflation is an alternative to CO&#8322; insufflation (<LINK REF="REF-Neuhaus-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuhaus 2001</LINK>) and has been reported to have little or no effect on pulmonary function in pigs (<LINK REF="REF-Junghans-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Junghans 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Abdominal wall lift has been suggested as an alternative for pneumoperitoneum. The lift uses a special device (for example, Laparolift (<LINK REF="STD-Egawa-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Egawa 2006</LINK>) or Laparo-tensor (<LINK REF="STD-Alijani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alijani 2004</LINK>)) introduced through a port in the abdominal wall. Randomised clinical trials have shown that abdominal lift causes fewer cardiopulmonary changes than CO&#8322; pneumoperitoneum (<LINK REF="STD-Galizia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Galizia 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alijani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alijani 2004</LINK>). People undergoing abdominal wall lift were shown to have better mental recovery than the conventional pneumoperitoneum group during the early postoperative period after taking into account the type and duration of anaesthesia, analgesia, and the end-tidal CO&#8322; (<LINK REF="STD-Alijani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alijani 2004</LINK>). However, physical retraction of the abdominal wall causes more abdominal pain than laparoscopy using pneumoperitoneum (<LINK REF="REF-Casati-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Casati 1997</LINK>). Abdominal wall lift has also been criticised for providing poor exposure that may necessitate cross-over to pneumoperitoneum (<LINK REF="STD-Vezakis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vezakis 1999</LINK>), at which time a leak-proof seal is difficult to achieve (<LINK REF="STD-Vezakis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vezakis 1999</LINK>), or additional ports for adequate exposure (<LINK REF="STD-Vezakis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vezakis 1999</LINK>).</P>

Due to the risk of biased overestimation of intervention effects in randomised trials with inadequate risk of bias domains (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lundh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savovic-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovic 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savovic-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovic 2012b</LINK>), we looked at the influence of these domains on the results.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical methods</HEADING>
<P>We performed the meta-analyses according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Module (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2013</LINK>). We used the software package Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) if there were two or more trials for an outcome. For continuous variables, we calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) (for outcomes such as quality of life where different scales might have been used) with the 95% CI. For count outcomes such as serious adverse events, we calculated the rate ratio (RaR). For all the outcomes a P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant, even if this included only one trial. We used a random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-DeMets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 1987</LINK>) for meta-analysis in the presence of two or more trials included under the outcomes. In the case of discrepancy between the two models, we have reported both results; otherwise we have reported the results of the fixed-effect model. Statistical heterogeneity was explored by the Chi² test with significance set at a P value of 0.10, and the amount of heterogeneity was measured by the I² statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis (<LINK REF="REF-Newell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newell 1992</LINK>) whenever possible using the good outcome and poor outcome scenarios. Otherwise, we adopted the 'available-patient analysis' (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We did not impute any data for the post-randomisation drop-outs for any of the continuous outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trial sequential analysis</HEADING>
<P>We used the trial sequential analysis to control for random errors due to sparse data and repetitive testing of the accumulating data for the primary outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-CTU-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTU 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2011</LINK>). We added the trials according to the year of publication, and if more than one trial was published in a year, add the trials in alphabetical order according to the last name of the first author. We planned to construct the trial sequential monitoring boundaries on the basis of the required information size (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>We applied trial sequential analysis (<LINK REF="REF-CTU-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CTU 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2011</LINK>) using a required sample size calculated from an alpha error of 0.05, a beta error of 0.20, a control group proportion obtained from the results, and a relative risk reduction of 20% for binary outcomes with two or more trials to determine whether more trials are necessary on this topic (if the trial sequential monitoring boundary and the required information size is reached or the futility zone is crossed, then more trials are unnecessary) (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2010</LINK>). For operating time, the required sample size was calculated from an alpha error of 0.05, a beta error of 0.20, the variance estimated from the meta-analysis results of low risk of bias trials, and a minimal clinically relevant difference of 15 minutes. For pain scores, we planned to use a minimal clinically relevant difference of 1 cm with the other parameters being the same as operating time. It is not possible to perform trial sequential analysis for rate ratios or standardised mean difference and so we did not perform trial sequential analysis for rate of serious adverse events and quality of life.</P>

<P>There was no mortality in either group in the two trials that reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Meijer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meijer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alijani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alijani 2004</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Since there was no mortality in either group, we were unable to use the control group proportion for the calculation of the required information size of the trial sequential analysis. Instead, we used a proportion of 0.2% in the control group based on data from approximately 30,000 patients included in a database in Switzerland (<LINK REF="REF-Giger-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giger 2011</LINK>). The proportion of information accrued was only 0.02% of the diversity-adjusted required information size and so the trial sequential monitoring boundaries were not drawn (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). The cumulative Z-curve does not cross the conventional statistical boundaries.</P>

<P>None of the participants required conversion to open cholecystectomy in the two trials that reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Meijer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meijer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alijani-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alijani 2004</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Since there was no conversion to open cholecystectomy in either group, we were unable to use the control group proportion for the calculation of the required information size of the trial sequential analysis. Instead, we used a proportion of 5% in the control group based on data from approximately 500,000 patients included in a database in USA (<LINK REF="REF-Livingston-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Livingston 2004</LINK>). The proportion of information accrued was only 0.43% of the diversity-adjusted required information size and so the trial sequential monitoring boundaries were not drawn (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).

There was no significant difference in the groups when the random-effects model was adopted (MD 13.39 minutes; 95% CI -2.73 minutes to 29.51 minutes). Trial sequential analysis of operating time showed that the cumulative Z-curve does not cross the trial sequential monitoring boundaries suggesting that the observed differences could be due to random error and that more trials are necessary to conclude that laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed by abdominal wall lift with pneumoperitoneum takes longer operating time than that performed with pneumoperitoneum (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<B>Abdominal wall lift without pneumoperitoneum versus pneumoperitoneum</B>
<BR/>For the comparison abdominal wall lift without pneumoperitoneum versus pneumoperitoneum, we performed a trial sequential analysis (TSA) only for the proportion of people with serious adverse events. The trial sequential analysis showed that the information fraction was too small to draw any definite conclusions. We performed trial sequential analysis using the proportion with serious adverse events in the control group (Pc) of 1.2%, a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 20%, an alpha error of 0.05, a beta error of 0.20, and a diversity (D) (ie, D²) of 0%. The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) is 58,231 patients and with only 341 patients randomised, we have only obtained 0.59% of the required information size. The TSA programme does not show the required information size or the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. The horizontal dashed lines are equivalent to a two-sided P value of 0.05 (<LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-08-08 20:37:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>The abdominal wall lift was introduced to laparoscopic surgery primarily as a method to reduce the cardiopulmonary changes which are seen with a carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum. The previous version of this systematic review suggested that abdominal wall lift is associated with fewer cardiopulmonary changes during surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2008</LINK>). We assessed whether the reduction in these cardiopulmonary changes translates to any significant advantages to the patients or healthcare funders. Based on the evidence from this review, there does not appear to be any benefit in performing abdominal wall lift with or without pneumoperitoneum<B> </B>compared to carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum.</P>
<P>There was no mortality in any of the trials that reported this outcome. Mortality is a rare event in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Peri-operative complications were reported in only eight of the 24 included trials. Peri-operative cardiopulmonary complications were rare during or after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the trials that reported the complications. Based on the decreased cardiopulmonary changes with abdominal lift (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2008</LINK>), it is unlikely that abdominal wall lift results in greater morbidity due to cardiopulmonary complications. The main issue in abdominal wall lift is adequate visualisation of the structures so that the surgery can be performed safely. There is some weak evidence that the operating time was longer in the abdominal wall lift group compared to pneumoperitoneum. This could be related to the poor exposure or the time required to establish the exposure. In the absence of this information, it is difficult to comment upon the reason for the increased operating time, but one cannot rule out poor exposure which can be potentially detrimental to the patient. As mentioned earlier, only a third of the trials reported on the safety of abdominal wall lift. There have been no larger cohort studies or case-control studies that show potential advantages of abdominal wall lift over pneumoperitoneum with regards to complications. However, the majority of the participants included in this review had low anaesthetic risk. This review is therefore applicable only to people at low anaesthetic risk.</P>
<P>Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. Quality of life is an important patient-oriented outcome and is one of the ways that the cost effectiveness of an intervention is assessed. In the absence of such information, it is not possible to determine whether one intervention is more cost-effective than another. This information is particularly important for state-funded health systems in light of the fact that there is weak evidence that the operating time is longer in those undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy using the abdominal wall lift method.</P>
<P>There were no significant differences in the other important outcomes that are of interest to patients and healthcare funders, such as conversion to open cholecystectomy and the proportion discharged as laparoscopic cholecystectomy day-patients.</P>
<P>Pain between four and eight hours post-procedure is an important outcome from the patient and healthcare funder perspectives. Pain is one of the important reasons for failed day-patient laparoscopic cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2008b</LINK>). None of the trials reported this outcome. Future trials should include such outcomes.</P>
<P>In such a situation where the safety of the procedure has not been established completely, with no major advantages over the standard practice, we are unable to recommend abdominal wall lift. In the previous version of the review we did not recommend abdominal wall lift over pneumoperitoneum but mentioned that it was probably safe. While we continue to recommend that abdominal wall lift cannot be preferred over pneumoperitoneum in those at low anaesthetic risk, we have revised our conclusion regarding the safety. We now believe that the safety of abdominal wall lift has not been established and so should be considered only in the trial setting. Our conclusions have been revised from the previous version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Gurusamy-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gurusamy 2008</LINK>) because of the updated version of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), which has resulted in a better understanding of the interpretation of evidence.</P>

<P>Abdominal wall lift with or without pneumoperitoneum<B> </B>does not seem to be beneficial compared to pneumoperitoneum in any of the patient-oriented or healthcare funder outcomes in low anaesthetic risk people.

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-04-23 16:15:20 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Kurinchi S Gurusamy">
<P>Future randomised clinical trials with low risk of bias and sufficient sample size are necessary to compare abdominal wall lift with or without pneumoperitoneum versus pneumoperitoneum alone.<BR/>
<BR/>The role of laparoscopic cholecystectomy using abdominal wall lift as an alternative to pneumoperitoneum and to open cholecystectomy in those with severe systemic disease (ASA III and ASA IV) also needs further assessment.<BR/>
<BR/>Trials need to be conducted and reported according to the CONSORT statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>) (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boutron-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutron 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>).

<B>Trial sequential analysis of mortality (abdominal wall lift with pneumoperitoneum versus pneumoperitoneum)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 352,564 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 0.2%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing a total of 397 patients in seven trials, only 0.12% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 13,493 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 5%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing a total of 58 patients in two trials, only 0.43% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of operating time (abdominal wall lift with pneumoperitoneum versus pneumoperitoneum)</B>
<BR/>Trial sequential analysis of operating time showing that the cumulative Z-curve crosses the conventional boundary after the third trial. However, the cumulative Z-curve does not cross the trial sequential monitoring boundaries (inward sloping red lines). The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was 505 participants based on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of 15 minutes, a variance (VAR) of 1875.28, an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 48.17%. After accruing 107 participants in four trials, the information fraction was too small (21.18%) to draw the futility area. The results suggest that the observed statistical significance favouring pneumoperitoneum may be due to random error and that more trials are necessary to conclude that laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed by abdominal wall lift with pneumoperitoneum takes longer operating time than that performed with pneumoperitoneum.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of mortality (abdominal wall lift without pneumoperitoneum versus pneumoperitoneum)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 352,564 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 0.2%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing a total of 393 patients in seven trials, only 0.11% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of serious adverse events (abdominal wall lift without pneumoperitoneum versus pneumoperitoneum)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 58,231 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 1.2%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing a total of 343 patients in six trials, only 0.59% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 22,911 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 3%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 0%. To account for zero event groups, a continuity correction of 0.01 was used in the calculation of the cumulative Z-curve (blue line). After accruing a total of 560 participants in 11 trials, only 2.01% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of operating time (abdominal wall lift without pneumoperitoneum versus pneumoperitoneum)</B>
<BR/>Trial sequential analysis of operating time showing that the cumulative Z-curve crosses the trial sequential monitoring boundary after the tenth trial. The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was 304 participants based on a minimal relevant difference (MIRD) of 15 minutes, a variance (VAR) of 384.2, an alpha (a) of 5%, a beta (b) of 20%, and a diversity (D<SUP>2</SUP>) of 82.29%. The results are compatible with significantly higher operating time in the abdominal wall lift group compared with pneumoperitoneum group without risk of random errors.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis of proportion discharged as day-patient laparoscopic cholecystectomy (abdominal wall lift without pneumoperitoneum versus pneumoperitoneum)</B>
<BR/>The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) was calculated to 13,293 patients, based on the proportion of patients in the control group with the outcome of 29.0%, a relative risk reduction of 20%, an alpha of 5%, a beta of 20%, and a diversity of 86.45%. After accruing a total of 62 patients in two trials, only 0.47% of the DARIS has been reached. Accordingly, the trial sequential analysis does not show the required information size and the trial sequential monitoring boundaries. As shown, the conventional boundaries have also not been crossed by the cumulative Z-curve (blue line).</P>
