<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-07-20 12:15:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women who have had a previous preterm birth are at increased risk of having another premature birth. Babies who are born before the 37th week of pregnancy, and particularly those born before the 34th week, are at greater risk of suffering problems at birth and of disability in childhood. 'Specialised' antenatal clinics have been suggested for women at high risk of a preterm birth as a way of improving health outcomes for the women and their infants. This review of three randomised controlled trials involving 3400 women in the USA found that there was no reduction in the number of preterm births in women attending specialised antenatal clinics. The results were difficult to interpret, as the trials were conducted in slightly different ways and offered slightly different care. The trials were all conducted in the 1980s, before the introduction of many of the screening tests currently offered in specialised antenatal clinics such as ultrasound assessment of cervical length. There was no information available on the effect of specialised antenatal care on maternal wellbeing or long-term outcome.</P>

<P>We included three trials with 3400 women, all carried out in the USA. All focused on specialised clinics for women at high risk of preterm birth. Gestational age at delivery, preterm delivery, or both were primary outcomes in all studies. The interventions in the three trials differed.</P>
<P>Overall there was very little data on our prespecified outcomes. For most outcomes a single study provided data, hence there was not the statistical power to detect any possible differences between groups. There was no clear evidence that specialised antenatal clinics reduce the number of preterm births.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-01-24 15:44:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Specialised antenatal clinics are now an accepted part of care in many settings, and carrying out further randomised trials may not be possible. Any future research in this area should include psychological outcomes and should focus on which aspects of service provision are preferred by women. Such research could underpin further service development in this area.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-07-25 13:19:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-07-20 19:23:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm birth occurs in up to 6% to 10% of all births and is associated with perinatal mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Lumley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lumley 2003</LINK>). Nearly half of all preterm births are due to preterm labour. Preterm birth is associated with emotional and economic costs to both the family and society (<LINK REF="REF-Petrou-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrou 2001</LINK>). Once congenital anomalies are excluded, preterm birth is responsible for the majority of neonatal deaths and is the major cause of disability in childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Hack-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hack 1999</LINK>). The majority of mortality and morbidity occurs with extremely preterm birth (defined as birth before 28 weeks' gestation). However, whilst the incidence of death and long-term handicap is relatively low in those born after 32 weeks, they make up over 80% of all preterm deliveries and therefore this group of infants has a significant impact upon the burden that preterm birth makes on public health (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2000</LINK>). Despite research over the past few decades, no decrease in the incidence of preterm birth has occurred, although there have been improved survival and outcomes for premature infants.</P>
<P>Amongst the risk factors for preterm birth, previous preterm delivery is a strong predictor and the earlier the birth the more likely it is to be repeated at the same gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 1984</LINK>). Other risk factors include cervical weakness, cervical trauma, and stress (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Bastawissi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Bastawissi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iams-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iams 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruis 2003</LINK>). Specialised clinics for women with a history of spontaneous preterm delivery have been advocated, with non-randomised cohort data suggesting improved perinatal outcomes with the provision of intensive antenatal education, continuity of carer and individualised care (<LINK REF="REF-Bienstock-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bienstock 2001</LINK>). Such specialised clinics may also see women with previous preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, previous late miscarriage (16 weeks 0 days to 23 weeks 6 days of gestation), or prior cervical surgery. Prediction of risk may utilise ultrasound assessment of cervical length and the presence of fetal fibronectin in cervico-vaginal secretions. The package of care offered in such clinics may include promising prophylactic interventions for labour prevention including progesterone, clindamycin or cervical cerclage (<LINK REF="REF-Althuisius-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Althuisius 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Da-Fonesca-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Da Fonesca 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ugwumadu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ugwumadu 2003</LINK>). However, stress has been associated with enhanced risk of preterm delivery and there is evidence that, whilst some pregnant women welcome referral to a specialist clinic during pregnancy, others experience it as unsettling (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to assess, using the best available evidence, the value of such specialised antenatal clinics for women with a pregnancy at high risk of preterm birth when compared with 'standard' antenatal clinic attendance. The primary outcomes relate to maternal and neonatal morbidity, and maternal and perinatal mortality. In women with multiple pregnancy, who have an increased risk of premature delivery, specialised clinics have been advocated in an attempt to improve perinatal outcomes. The value of specialised antenatal care for women with a multiple pregnancy when compared with 'standard' antenatal care is the subject of a different Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2007</LINK>).</P>

We adjusted the standard error for results from this study<I> </I>using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). No estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) was provided for this trial and so we used a published ICC from another trial of antenatal care (<LINK REF="REF-Piaggio-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piaggio 2001</LINK>). As we used an ICC from another source, we have conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. Where we identified both cluster-randomised and individually-randomised trials examining the same outcomes, we synthesised the relevant information. We considered it reasonable to combine the results from both, provided that there was little heterogeneity between the study designs, and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit was considered to be unlikely.</P>

In updates of the review, if more data are added, we will carry out sensitivity analysis excluding data from studies (or for particular outcomes) where there are high levels of missing data.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we have carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and analysed all participants in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial is the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<P>All three included trials were carried out in the USA. All trials focused on specialised clinics for women at high risk of preterm birth, and gestational age at delivery, preterm delivery, or both, were primary outcomes in all studies. The interventions in the three trials differed slightly. In a study in Ohio (<LINK REF="STD-Iams-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Iams 1989</LINK>), women attended clinics and had cervical examinations weekly between 20 and 36 weeks' gestation and were advised on the signs and symptoms of labour onset. In the Pennsylvania trial (<LINK REF="STD-Main-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Main 1989</LINK>), women attended weekly or twice-weekly clinics from 22 weeks' gestation; and again women were educated on the early signs of labour and had cervical assessment. In the <LINK REF="STD-West-Los-Angeles-1994" TYPE="STUDY">West Los Angeles 1994</LINK> trial, clinics rather than women were randomised (five experimental clinics and three control). Women attending experimental clinics had fortnightly visits and had three classes on preterm birth prevention. In addition, in a nested study, women were randomised to one of four secondary interventions (bed rest, psychosocial support, oral progestin or a placebo). Participants in both experimental and control clinics received psychosocial and nutritional screening and were offered crisis intervention.

<P>Blinding women and care providers to treatment group is difficult to achieve with an intervention involving different models of care. Women would be aware of their more frequent attendance and so would clinic staff.

This study also examined additional interventions, and within the nested study in experimental clinics, it would be difficult to blind women and staff to these additional interventions (e.g. bed rest) although one of the four groups received a placebo. It is not clear whether lack of blinding represents a serious source of bias in these studies.</P>

For this outcome, we carried out a sensitivity analysis whereby, for the cluster-randomised trial, we used the upper 95% CI for the ICC (most conservative value); in this analysis, while the weight of the cluster-randomised trial was reduced, this adjustment made very little difference to results (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.11 (adjusted data, inverse variance method <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK> )).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Costs of care and process variables</HEADING>

However, in one of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-West-Los-Angeles-1994" TYPE="STUDY">West Los Angeles 1994</LINK>), a sub-sample of approximately 10% of the total sample only was included in the cost-analysis (280/2705 women). Further, in this study there was no adjustment for cluster design effect and in the data and analyses tables we have therefore presented unadjusted data for cost outcomes.</P>
<P>When data from the <LINK REF="STD-Main-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Main 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-West-Los-Angeles-1994" TYPE="STUDY">West Los Angeles 1994</LINK> studies were pooled there was no significant evidence that specialised clinics and routine management differed in terms of the total cost of care for women (<LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>).</P>
<P>The cost of newborn infant care was examined in the <LINK REF="STD-West-Los-Angeles-1994" TYPE="STUDY">West Los Angeles 1994</LINK> trial and appeared to be reduced in infants of women attending the experimental clinics compared with controls. However, results were not simple to interpret. The authors suggest that the cost difference was due to a combination of fewer preterm births in the experimental group, a lower relative rate of delivery at less than 32 weeks' gestation, and lower mean costs for infants of comparable gestations (<LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>). They did not comment on what interventions were required by babies in the different groups or whether the two groups had different rates of steroid administration which may have impacted on neonatal condition at delivery.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-06-20 09:21:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall there was very little data on our pre-specified outcomes. For most outcomes a single study provided data, hence there may have been insufficient statistical power to detect any possible differences between groups. There was no clear evidence that specialised antenatal clinics reduce the number of preterm births. Perinatal death was reported in only one of the included studies and there was no evidence of a significant difference between groups. .</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-06-20 09:27:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Interpreting the findings of this review is not straightforward. Preterm birth is a multi-factorial disorder and hence a complex intervention such as a package of antenatal care is a logical solution to preventing its recurrence. The antenatal care needs to be aimed at managing diverse contributing factors such nutritional deficiencies, smoking cessation, dental hygiene, infection, cervical weakness, pro-thrombotic tendency, psycho-social stress and excessive uterine contractility. The review includes only three trials, which tackled potential contributing factors to varying degrees, and the same outcomes were not reported for all trials. Furthermore, the three trials varied in the nature of the services provided as part of the specialised antenatal clinic. Two studies included repeat digital cervical assessment (RDCA) in the treatment arm (<LINK REF="STD-Iams-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Iams 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Main-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Main 1989</LINK>I). Whilst there is no evidence that RCDA is effective as a routine intervention in the antenatal clinic as a screening test for the risk of preterm birth in average risk pregnancies, it has not been thoroughly evaluated as a component of a complex intervention such as a specialist antenatal clinic, targeting preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 2010</LINK>). This makes interpretation of our results more difficult. In addition, the trials were all conducted in the 1980s prior to the introduction of many of the screening tests currently offered in specialised antenatal clinics e.g. fetal fibronectin testing and ultrasound assessment of cervical length. There is clear evidence that antenatal steroids improve neonatal survival and reduce neonatal morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>), hence the ability to accurately predict preterm labour in a specialised clinic would ensure that women received the steroids prior to delivery. The problem is that at present the current predictive tests (cervical length monitoring and fetal fibronectin) are not sufficiently specific to make them cost effective (<LINK REF="REF-Honest-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honest 2009</LINK>).  <BR/>

<P>Since the publication of the trials included in this review (1989 to 1994) there have been further meta-analyses of trials of individual treatments that were effective at preventing preterm birth: progesterone (<LINK REF="REF-Barros-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barros 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Honest-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honest 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rode-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rode 2009</LINK>); smoking cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Barros-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barros 2010</LINK>); eradication of asymptomatic bacteriuria (<LINK REF="REF-Iams-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iams 2010</LINK>); appropriate use of cerclage (<LINK REF="REF-Iams-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iams 2010</LINK>I); and calcium supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 2010</LINK>). Implementation of evidence from clinical trials is notoriously slow and incomplete (<LINK REF="REF-Bodribb-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodribb 2010</LINK>). Hence, it may be that a future trial of specialised antenatal clinic would show evidence of benefit because of improved implementation of these interventions that have been more recently shown to be effective.    </P>
<P>Importantly, it is not known whether preventing preterm birth reduces neonatal morbidity and mortality as it may be that retaining a fetus in an unfavourable intrauterine environment has a detrimental effect on in utero development.  Hence, any future trials need to report both short and long-term neonatal outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Kenyon-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenyon 2008</LINK>). </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-03-08 11:23:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>As specialised antenatal clinics for women with a pregnancy at high risk of preterm delivery are now an accepted part of antenatal services in many areas, it will be difficult to carry out further randomised studies. However, the trials included in the review included no information on psychological outcomes for women. Some studies have suggested that whilst some pregnant women welcome referral to a specialist clinic during pregnancy, others experience it as unsettling (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2006</LINK>). Any future research in this area should examine which aspects of service provision are preferred by women. Such research could underpin further service development in this area.<BR/>
