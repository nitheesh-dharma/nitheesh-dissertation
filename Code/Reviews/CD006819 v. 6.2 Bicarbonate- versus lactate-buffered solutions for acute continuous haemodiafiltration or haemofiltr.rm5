<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-01-19 16:07:31 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>People with acute kidney injury (AKI) have serious loss of kidney function and are unable to rid wastes from the body in urine. People with AKI need dialysis (haemofiltration) which requires use of buffered solutions (dialysates) to rid waste from their blood. Different dialysates can have various effects on the balance of blood chemistry. Maintaining balanced blood chemistry helps to reduce risks of heart, blood circulation and blood pressure problems. We assessed the benefits and harms of bicarbonate-buffered solutions and lactate-buffered solutions by analysing results from four randomised controlled studies that together involved 171 participants. The evidence was flawed by study design and reporting problems, and the small number of people in the studies. Based on limited evidence from one study (117 participants), we found that people treated with bicarbonate-buffered solutions may experience fewer heart and blood circulation problems and high blood pressure events. The studies did not include enough evidence to make recommendations about the use of these solutions.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-02-04 16:03:19 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a severe loss of kidney function that results in patients' inability to appropriately excrete nitrogenous wastes and creatinine. Continuous haemodiafiltration (HDF) or haemofiltration (HF) are commonly used renal replacement therapies for people with AKI. Buffered dialysates and solutions used in HDF or HF have varying effects on acid-base physiology and several electrolytes. The benefits and harms of bicarbonate- versus lactate-buffered HDF or HF solutions for treating patients with AKI remain unclear.</P>

<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-RCTs that reported comparisons of bicarbonate-buffered solutions with lactate-buffered solutions for AKI were selected for inclusion irrespective of publication status or language.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-01-02 14:32:27 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently assessed titles and abstracts, and where necessary the full text of studies, to determine which satisfied our inclusion criteria. Data were extracted by two authors who independently assessed studies for eligibility and quality using a standardised data extraction form. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-02-04 16:03:19 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>We identified four studies (171 patients) that met our inclusion criteria. Overall, study quality was suboptimal. There were significant reporting omissions related to methodological issues and potential harms. Outcome measures were not defined or reported adequately. The studies were small and lacked follow-up phases.</P>
<P>Serum lactate levels were significantly lower in patients treated with bicarbonate-buffered solutions (4 studies, 171 participants: MD -1.09 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.30 to -0.87; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). There were no differences in mortality (3 studies, 163 participants: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.15; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%); serum bicarbonate levels (3 studies, 163 participants: MD 0.27 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.45 to 1.99; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 78%), serum creatinine (2 studies, 137 participants: MD -22.81 µmol/L, 95% CI -129.61 to 83.99; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 73%), serum base excess (3 studies, 145 participants: MD 0.80, 95% CI -0.91 to 2.50; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 38%), serum pH (4 studies, 171 participants: MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.03; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 70%) or carbon dioxide partial pressure (3 studies, 151 participants: MD -1.04, 95% CI -3.84 to 1.76; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 83%). A single study reported fewer cardiovascular events (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.79), higher mean arterial pressure (10.25 mm Hg, 95% CI 6.68 to 13.82) and less hypotensive events (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.75) in patients receiving bicarbonate-buffered solutions. One study reported no significant difference in central venous pressure (MD 2.00 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O, 95% CI -0.7 to, 4.77). Total length of hospital and ICU stay and relapse were not reported by any of the included studies.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-02-04 16:03:19 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>There were no significant different between bicarbonate- and lactate-buffered solutions for mortality, serum bicarbonate levels, serum creatinine, serum base excess, serum pH, carbon dioxide partial pressure, central venous pressure and serum electrolytes. Patients treated with bicarbonate-buffered solutions may experience fewer cardiovascular events, lower serum lactate levels, higher mean arterial pressure and less hypotensive events. With the exception of mortality, we were not able to assess the main primary outcomes of this review - length of time in ICU, total length of hospital stay and relapse.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-01-19 11:35:01 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex disorder for which there is currently no globally accepted definition. For this review we defined AKI diagnosis as: an abrupt (within 48 hours) reduction in kidney function marked by an absolute increase in serum creatinine (SCr) &#8805; 0.3 mg/dL (&#8805; 26.4 &#956;mol/L); a percentage increase in SCr of &#8805; 50% (1.5-fold increase from baseline); and reduction in urine output (documented oliguria of &lt; 0.5 mL/kg/h for more than six hours) (<LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thadhani-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thadhani 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>AKI is often associated with electrolyte disturbances and loss of fluid homeostasis and causes can be categorised broadly as prerenal, postrenal and intrinsic renal (<LINK REF="REF-Lamiere-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamiere 2005</LINK>). Prerenal AKI results from decreased blood supply to the kidneys (<LINK REF="REF-Santacruz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santacruz 1996</LINK>); postrenal AKI is caused by urinary tract obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Liano-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liano 1996</LINK>); and intrarenal AKI results from direct kidney injury (<LINK REF="REF-Needham-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Needham 2005</LINK>). AKI is present in 1% to 5% of patients at hospital admission (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufman 1991</LINK>) and affects 15% to 20% of patients in intensive care units (ICU); reported mortality rates range from 50% to 70% in these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Albright-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albright 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singri-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singri 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thadhani-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thadhani 1996</LINK>). Infection and cardiorespiratory complications are the most common causes of death among patients with AKI (<LINK REF="REF-Needham-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Needham 2005</LINK>). Mortality rates have been relatively static over the past few decades despite significant advances in supportive care. Lack of improvement in mortality rates may be more apparent than real because it is currently common for patients to be older and have more pre-existing chronic health problems than previously (<LINK REF="REF-Jaber-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaber 2004</LINK>). The long-term effects of AKI are indistinct and controversial because of the diverse (and in many cases multiple) causes of the disease and the paucity of long-term follow-up studies. However, the view that kidney recovery is complete is simplistic, and progressive kidney dysfunction after severe AKI is commonly observed. AKI is irreversible in 5% of patients, but in elderly people the proportion is as high as 16% (<LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 1996</LINK>). Recent reports in children suggest that residual damage after AKI develops into progressive kidney failure by adolescence or early adulthood (<LINK REF="REF-Bhandari-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhandari 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lamiere-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamiere 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Polito-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polito 1998</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-01-19 16:59:29 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Haemofiltration (HF) and haemodiafiltration (HDF) are renal replacement therapy methods. HDF combines both haemodialysis and HF. Haemodialysis is an extremely efficient method of removing low molecular weight toxins, while HF is more efficient at the removal of higher molecular weight toxins. With HF dialysate solution is not used, instead positive pressure drives water and dissolved toxins across the filter membrane from the blood side to the filtrate compartment. In haemodialysis, solutes and water are cleared from patients&#8217; blood by movement across a semi-permeable membrane. It has been suggested that HF and HDF may reduce the frequency and severity of intradialytic and post-dialytic adverse symptoms and may be more effective than haemodialysis in the removal of high molecular weight molecules (<LINK REF="REF-Rabindranath-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabindranath 2006</LINK>). HDF and HF use different replacement fluids to influence the acid-base values, dialysate solutions can be a lactate- or bicarbonate-based buffer (<LINK REF="STD-Kierdorf-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kierdorf 1995</LINK>). If patients with reduced lactate metabolism (e.g. concomitant severe liver failure, after liver transplantation or in lactic acidosis), bicarbonate-buffered solutions should be used. In nearly all other cases of critically ill patients with AKI, lactate-buffered solutions may be used as well as bicarbonate solutions (<LINK REF="REF-Kierdorf-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kierdorf 1999</LINK>). Therefore, different compositions of the buffers may be used in different patients.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-02-04 16:03:19 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>HDF and HF appear to have a significant and variable impact on the concentration of several electrolytes and acid-base balance (<LINK REF="STD-Heering-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heering 1999</LINK>), which is likely in part, to depend on the composition of the dialysate. HD and HF solutions are used as buffers to correct acidosis (<LINK REF="REF-Macias-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macias 1996</LINK>). HDF and HF are the most efficient blood purification method and characterised by using external substitution fluid provided as a sterile solution and can remove a wide spectrum of solutes of different molecular weights (<LINK REF="REF-Ledebo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ledebo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ledebo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ledebo 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nagaoka-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagaoka 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woods-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2000</LINK>). In Europe and Australia the dominant commercially available dialysates are either lactate-buffered or bicarbonate-buffered (<LINK REF="STD-Tan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2003</LINK>), with a similar situation in China (<LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2000</LINK>). Bicarbonate-buffered solutions were developed as an outcome from the introduction of two-chambered bag systems that separate calcium and magnesium from bicarbonate. These systems have been shown to improve peritoneal cell function (<LINK REF="REF-Dratwa-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dratwa 2003</LINK>). Before bicarbonate-buffered solutions were introduced, lactate-buffered solutions had been used as the standard dialysate solution. Lactate-buffered solutions can be converted to bicarbonate by using a pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme mostly in liver and muscle tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Uchino-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uchino 2005</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-01-08 14:49:07 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Various buffered dialysate solutions are likely to have different effects on acid-base physiology and several electrolytes, and these differences may affect electrolyte mass balance (<LINK REF="STD-Tan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2003</LINK>). To help avoid unnecessary investigations or interventions it is important that clinicians be aware of any differences attributable to buffered dialysates when unexplained changes in serum electrolyte concentrations occur over time in people undergoing continuous RRT (CRRT). The effectiveness and safety of lactate-buffered and bicarbonate-buffered solutions need to be reviewed and critically appraised to inform current practice.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-02-04 16:03:19 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-02-04 16:03:19 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>There were no significant different between bicarbonate- and lactate-buffered solutions for mortality, serum bicarbonate levels, SCr, serum base excess, serum pH, carbon dioxide partial pressure, central venous pressure and serum electrolytes. Patients treated with bicarbonate-buffered solutions may experience fewer cardiovascular events, lower serum lactate levels, higher mean arterial pressure and less hypotensive events. With the exception of mortality, we were not able to assess the main primary outcomes of this review - length of time in ICU, total length of hospital stay and relapse.</P>
<P>Overall, there was insufficient evidence to support a clinical advantage for either bicarbonate- or lactate-buffered solutions for acute continuous HDF or HF.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-01-19 16:51:40 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>We planned to include all patients (adults or children) with AKI, regardless of gender, severity of AKI or age, however only older patients were included. <LINK REF="STD-Tan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2003</LINK> included participants with severe AKI and the other studies did not report the type of patients enrolled. Therefore, these findings might not apply to the patient with severe AKI or children. Three studies were conducted in ICUs (<LINK REF="STD-Barenbrock-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Barenbrock 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zimmerman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zimmerman 1999</LINK>); one study did not report the setting. While we did not limit the language all studies were reported in English, which might limit the applicability of this review. We were unable to address all of the objectives of this review, because the results were based on only four studies (too small a sample to detect relevant differences between effects of treatment). Not all the studies reported our outcomes, in particular our primary outcomes (mortality, length of time in ICU, total length of hospital stay and relapse). Therefore, any further studies conducted in this area must be well-designed RCTs which assess these outcomes.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-01-19 16:52:20 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>The quality of the evidence was not high, because randomisation methods and sequence generation were either poorly reported or absent, blinding was not reported, allocation concealment was poorly administered and reported, assessment of selective outcome reporting could not be undertaken because of the lack of information reported in the studies. We were not able to obtain further data from the study authors (<LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK>). The number of patients enrolled in the four studies was very small, and the results of these four studies may be influenced by potential biases (the four eligible studies included only 171 patients), and the use of the cross-over design. Many of the excluded studies did not employ random allocation of participants, whilst others did not use a prospective design. Future research should seek to address these methodological limitations in large, multi-centre RCTs.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-01-19 16:52:28 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Our systematic review had some limitations. First, none of the studies in our systematic review reported data on cost-effectiveness of bicarbonate- versus lactate-buffered solutions for acute continuous HDF or HF. Second, there were only four studies that could be included in the analysis, which reduces the evaluation power and increases the possibility of publication bias. Third, it is possible that we have not identified all the relevant studies from computerised searching. Fourth, we acknowledge that our results may have been affected by the quality of study, blinding process, and other procedures. Fifth, this review may suffer from reporting bias, as we found no measurable data on most of the main outcomes and adverse events. Sixth, publication bias probably existed, although we did not assess this in detail because of the small numbers of studies that could be pooled.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-19 10:31:13 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>There are no other systematic reviews on this subject, our review provides evidence derived from four studies, the results of the individual studies and the pooled analysis are similar. Our results for the main outcome, mortality, is similar to the findings from the included studies; further research is still needed.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-01-19 16:53:20 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-01-19 16:53:14 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>Evidence from the included studies indicated that bicarbonate-buffered dialysis solutions reduced SCr levels and serum lactate levels were lower, however they did not provided any advantages in terms of mortality, serum bicarbonate, serum base excess, serum pH, pCO<SUB>2</SUB>, or serum electrolytes. Bicarbonate-buffered dialysis solutions reduced cardiovascular complications and hypotensive events; however these results were only reported by one small study.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-01-19 16:53:20 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle Willis">
<P>This review analyses based on the four small studies. There is a need for large, well-designed RCTs that compare the effects of bicarbonate- versus lactate-buffered solutions for patients with AKI. Economic analyses that build on patients' values are also required to enable clinicians to individualise optimal treatment. Pragmatic clinical outcome measures, such as mortality, ICU and total hospital lengths of stay, cost, and adverse outcomes should be considered by future researchers. Based on the quality issues of included studies such as allocation concealment, blinding and long-term follow-up are required to enable evaluation of the risks and benefits of interventions in focus. Good reporting of study methodology and outcomes that conform to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement should be adopted by future researchers (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2010</LINK>).</P>
