<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-06-12 12:07:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>This review aimed to examine whether specialist paediatric home-based nursing services for children with acute and chronic illnesses reduce the number of hospital admissions and length of stay, enhance health care in the community and reduce stress for families at the time of their child's illness. It is an update of our original review published in 2006. We found seven relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of total of 840 children aged from birth to 18 years with acute and/or chronic illnesses receiving either specialist home-based nursing services or conventional health care. The outcomes included use of health care services, physical and mental health, satisfaction, adverse health outcomes and costs. We decided not to combine the results of these RCTs because of the variety in types of services provided, types of participants and the outcome measures used. The results of individual RCTs show improved satisfaction with home-based care with no adverse impact on physical health outcomes for children. There is some evidence that specialist home-based nursing services reduce the length of hospital stay; however, there is no evidence that it leads to a reduction in use of hospital services. Further trials are required, measuring health, satisfaction, service use and long-term costs.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-06-12 12:03:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We searched the following databases in February 2012: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2012 Issue 2, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Sociological Abstracts. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. No language restrictions were applied.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-05-28 10:28:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of children from birth to age 18 years with acute or chronic illnesses allocated to specialist home-based nursing services compared with conventional health care. Outcomes included utilisation of health care, physical and mental health, satisfaction, adverse health outcomes and costs.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-05-28 10:28:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Two review authors extracted data from the studies independently and resolved any discrepancies by recourse to a third author. Meta-analysis was not appropriate because of the clinical diversity of the studies and the lack of common outcome measures.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-12 12:06:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>We screened 4226 titles to yield seven RCTs with a total of 840 participants. Participants, interventions and outcomes were diverse. No significant differences were reported in health outcomes; two studies reported a reduction in the hospital stay with no difference in the hospital readmission rates. Three studies reported a reduction in parental anxiety and improvement in child behaviours was reported in three studies. Overall increased parental satisfaction was reported in three studies. Also, better parental coping and family functioning was reported in one study. By contrast, one study each reported no impact on parental burden of care or on functional status of children. Home care was reported as more costly for service providers with substantial cost savings for the family in two studies, while one study revealed no significant cost benefits for the family.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-05-28 10:29:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Current research does not provide supporting evidence for a reduction in access to hospital services or a reduction in hospital readmission rate for children with acute and chronic illnesses using specialist home-based nursing services; however, the only summary finding across a few studies was that there is a significant decrease in length of hospitalisation. The preliminary results show no adverse impact on physical health outcomes and a number of papers reported improved satisfaction with home-based care. Further trials are required, measuring health, satisfaction, service utilisation and long-term costs.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-12 12:11:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-05-31 17:59:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The illness of a child leading to hospitalisation is a stressful event for the family (<LINK REF="REF-Kai-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kai 1996</LINK>). It can be distressing for children, as in some emergency departments they may be separated from their families and the security of their own home (<LINK REF="REF-Farquahar-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farquahar 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lenihan-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lenihan 1985</LINK>). While not every child who presents to a hospital is admitted (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2000</LINK>), many such children spend several hours in the emergency department (ED) while being observed or assessed (<LINK REF="REF-Browne-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browne 1996</LINK>); in addition, children may wait while their carers are provided with education on how to manage the child's illness.</P>
<P>Children presenting at EDs frequently have a non-urgent problem (<LINK REF="REF-Bowling-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowling 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halfon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halfon 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Worsley-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worsley 1985</LINK>) and no usual care provider (<LINK REF="REF-Beebe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beebe 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grover-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grover 1994</LINK>). Many parents take their child to an ED seeking reassurance (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2000</LINK>). These presentations, and subsequent admissions, may provide opportunities to give carers the confidence to support and care for their child, as well as to provide education about the disease process and its management. Admission of children is not always determined by the severity of their illness; it can also be influenced by previous medical consultations for the illness as well as parental expectations that the child will not be discharged from the ED (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the current era, the necessity to explore alternative models of service delivery such as home-based nursing services has become more important, based on increasing survival of children with complex conditions, and also as it has become more feasible to provide high-technology interventions at home (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2012</LINK>). Thus, there is a shift towards parents being more responsible for complex care for children children with chronic illnesses in the home settings with educational as well as clinical management support.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-05-28 10:31:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The need to reduce hospital admission rates and shorten the length of hospital stay has prompted the development of specialist home-based nursing services for children with acute and chronic illnesses. The home-based nursing care substitutes for acute hospital review and/or admission by providing clinical review, support, education and management of the acutely or chronically unwell child in their own home. If the child requires it, they are provided with streamlined access to hospital services. It has been postulated that these services have the potential to reduce the number of hospital admissions (<LINK REF="REF-Meates-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meates 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1986</LINK>), to reduce the length of stay (<LINK REF="REF-Meates-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meates 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whiting-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whiting 1997</LINK>) and to facilitate early discharge by providing a continuum of care from the hospital into the home (<LINK REF="REF-Meates-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meates 1997</LINK>). They also provide opportunities to enhance primary care in the community through liaison with general practitioners (GPs) and through links with other community-based health services (<LINK REF="REF-Fradd-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fradd 1994</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-06-12 12:11:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>The development of specialist home-based nursing services for children with acute and chronic illnesses has been determined by local circumstance and enthusiastic individuals rather than strategic planning based on evidence (<LINK REF="REF-While-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">While 2000</LINK>), resulting in a diverse range of service models. Much of the literature comprises accounts of service development (<LINK REF="REF-Box-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Box 1993</LINK>) or descriptive studies of parent or professional views (<LINK REF="REF-Madigan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madigan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sartain-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sartain 2001</LINK>). Literature related to the safety of models of care is limited (<LINK REF="REF-McConnochie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McConnochie 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Montalto-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montalto 1998</LINK>) and concerns are rapidly increasing about the impact of changes in delivery and financing mechanisms on quality of care (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 1994</LINK>). Empirical data are needed about the effects of specialist home-based nursing services for children with acute and chronic illnesses, to explore the strengths and weaknesses of different service models, as well as general efficacy.</P>
<P>The literature search for this review was completed in 2005 prior to its first publication (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2006</LINK>). Subsequently, a systematic review was published in the UK about international evidence for the effectiveness and costs of paediatric home care. The <LINK REF="REF-Parker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2012</LINK> review was produced because there had not been a substantial growth in this kind of service despite advocacy by policy makers and professionals over the past few decades. We have conducted this update on a similar basis, to explore the available international evidence regarding specialist home-based nursing services for children and adolescents.</P>

<P>The original review included five studies. The search was run again from August 2005 until February 2012. A total of 2570 new titles were screened and 152 duplicates were identified. Of the 2418 titles screened, 2347 were not relevant to the review. We read the remaining 71 articles to obtain further information and only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tie-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tie 2009</LINK>) were suitable for inclusion, giving a total of seven studies in this update.

<P>Please see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table for more detailed information.</P>
<P>The number of participants in the seven included studies ranged from 29 (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2006</LINK>) to 399 (<LINK REF="STD-Sartain-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sartain 2001</LINK>). The total number of participants across all the included studies was 840. Participants in these studies ranged from three months of age through to 17 years of age. Specialist home-based nursing outreach services were provided as an intervention in each study. However, studies differed in respect of the qualifications of the nurses and their availability, including hours of service and number of visits. This is detailed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, 'Characteristics of Interventions'. No two studies examined the same intervention. In addition, treatments and outcomes varied considerably. Included studies broadly fell under the following categories.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study design</HEADING>
<P>Five trials used parallel study designs while two had a cross-over study design. Participants were allocated to the intervention versus usual posthospitalisation care in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Burke-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1984</LINK>) and to traditional inpatient care in the other three (<LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sartain-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sartain 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tie-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tie 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Strawczynski-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Strawczynski 1973</LINK> was a cross-over study with participants spending a year in each of the intervention and control (hospital care) groups. Another cross-over study was <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2006</LINK>, with participants receiving each of hospital (standard care) or home (intervention) chemotherapy alternately over a period of six months in succession.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions for children with acute paediatric illnesses</HEADING>
<P>There were only two studies that evaluated home-based nursing intervention for children with acute illnesses. <LINK REF="STD-Sartain-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sartain 2001</LINK> focused on children with acute paediatric illness with breathing difficulty, diarrhoea and vomiting or fever. The intervention, home care, was defined as clinical nursing care in a patient's own home, as an alternative to hospital admission. Treatment in this study was between one and four home visits per day, with the number of days and visits determined by health professionals in conjunction with parents. This study examined readmission rates and length of stay data as outcomes. The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Tie-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tie 2009</LINK>) compared home oxygen therapy with traditional inpatient hospital care for children with acute bronchiolitis. The children in the home care group continued with oxygen therapy at home following initial hospitalisation and were supported by the nurse home visiting programme accompanied by parental education. The outcomes assessed were readmission to hospital within seven days of discharge home and the total duration of hospitalisation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions for children with a range of chronic conditions</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stein-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1984</LINK> examined home care provided to children with chronic conditions through traditional clinics, inpatient units or a home care office. The minimum package was an initial assessment, one home visit and one monthly contact thereafter for at least six months. Involvement in home care was reassessed every six months by the treating staff. This study measured outcomes related to psychological adjustment and functional status.</P>
<P>Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Burke-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1997</LINK>) examined a community-based stress-point intervention provided by nursing staff to children with chronic illness. The intervention began two weeks before a planned hospital admission and continued until two weeks postdischarge. This study collected data throughout the intervention period using various scales to assess outcomes including stress and behavioural responses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions for children with newly diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK> examined home-based care provided by nursing staff over an extended period to newly diagnosed diabetic children, as an alternative to inpatient care. Nursing staff initially provided twice-daily home visits in the first few days after diagnosis, with transition to diminishing visits or phone calls to the family over two weeks, but remained available to the family for telephone contact for the next 24 months. This study focused on outcomes of diabetic management including metabolic control and diabetes-related adverse events.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions for children with chronic haematological illnesses</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Strawczynski-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Strawczynski 1973</LINK> defined home care as the availability of access to a 24-hour nursing service to treat acute bleeds at home or at school for children with haemophilia, as soon as possible after they occurred. It did not report on the number of days or visits for individual children. This study reported the number of bleeds and reduction in procrastination time for haemophilia as its outcomes.</P>
<P>Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2006</LINK>) compared a hospital-based and a home-based programme for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Some of the chemotherapy treatment was delivered by the hospital pharmacy to children's homes and was then administered by a trained nurse from a community health service agency. The option of contacting a hospital oncology nurse was available to parents as required. The study outcomes were child's quality of life, the burden on parental caregivers, adverse effects and costs.</P>

<P>Meta-analysis was not appropriate in this review because of the range of outcome measures being reported. In addition, interventions were diverse and complex involving multidisciplinary teams, different hours of service and variable inclusion of educational components (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Participants were also diverse: some had chronic illnesses such as diabetes, haemophilia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), and others had an acute presentation. Results are therefore presented as a written summary of individual studies only, without data synthesis.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK> reported that there was no difference between both groups in the mean days spent in the intensive care unit at diagnosis. However, mean hospital inpatient stay was lower with home-based care (2.2 +/- 1.6 nights, 70 total) compared to hospital-based care (4.7 +/- 1.6 nights, 147 total). The use of services while hospitalised was lower for the home-based group, logistically because of shorter initial hospital stay. However, they did report that children receiving home care used more diabetes nursing hours during the 24-month period, 58.9 hours per child compared with 17.3 hours for standard care (P value and significance not stated), which implies that the intervention required more intensive nursing support.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of main results</HEADING>
<P>Two studies of children with acute paediatric illnesses (<LINK REF="STD-Sartain-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sartain 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tie-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tie 2009</LINK>) reported a statistically significant reduction in the duration of hospital stay, with no significant difference in readmission rates </P>
<P>A variety of assessment tools were used in the studies included in this review to measure the functional impact or quality of life. <LINK REF="STD-Burke-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1997</LINK> found that home-care parents postintervention had better coping skills, family functioning and a reduction in anxiety than those in the traditional care group. No differences in child behaviour were reported in either group. A similar finding of no significant differences in child behaviour was reported in two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2006</LINK>) which used Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) for the assessment. A reduction in parental anxiety was noted in two other studies, with <LINK REF="STD-Burke-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stein-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1984</LINK> reporting an improvement in mental health symptoms for mothers in the study group. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Strawczynski-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Strawczynski 1973</LINK>) reported better school attendance in the home-care children. <LINK REF="STD-Stein-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1984</LINK> did not detect any significant impact of the intervention on the functional status of the participating children; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2006</LINK> reported that neither home or hospital location for treatment affected the parental burden of care. Overall, parental satisfaction with the home-based nursing care was reported in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sartain-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sartain 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strawczynski-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Strawczynski 1973</LINK>) which included semi-structured parental interviews.</P>
<P>Cost effectiveness was not comprehensively addressed by any of the included studies. Three studies presented limited cost data. <LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK> suggested that the financial cost to the hospital of providing the home-based care programme may cost more than the hospital-based care, but suggested that there are substantial cost savings for the family from the home-care programme. This view was supported by <LINK REF="STD-Sartain-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sartain 2001</LINK>, who presented qualitative data on cost savings for families in the home-care programme versus increased expenditure for families in the hospital-care group. Interestingly, <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2006</LINK> did not find any difference in family costs from a societal perspective in either home- or hospital-based treatment groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</HEADING>
<P>There was wide clinical diversity between studies due to differences in participants, disease or condition requiring care, interventions and outcomes measured. There was also variation in the statistical methods used by studies. For these reasons, we did not conduct meta-analyses, which should be taken into consideration when drawing conclusions from this review. Few benefits of home-based nursing care were evident in the included studies. However, current studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sartain-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sartain 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2006</LINK>) do not take into account the original set-up costs of traditional inpatient services, or the long-term cost savings for children and families achieved by a less disruptive model of care. Further research is required that examines the long-term costs to both service providers and families before an economic rationalisation of home care can be attempted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review included seven randomised controlled trials with 840 participants ranging from three months to 17 years. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Burke-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1997</LINK>) blinded participants and personnel while only two blinded the process of outcome assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Burke-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dougherty-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dougherty 1998</LINK>). The risks of performance and detection bias should be considered when interpreting results of the relevant studies. Also, some studies have a limited sample size which impacts on the statistical power of the study.</P>

<P>The findings of reduction of hospital stay and hospital readmission rates with home-based nursing care are consistent with some findings from the previously published literature (<LINK REF="REF-Meates-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meates 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whiting-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whiting 1997</LINK>). A recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2012</LINK>) on the paediatric home care services reported some evidence of reduced burden and costs for families, particularly in relation to acute admission avoidance. This is consistent with some of the cost-effectiveness findings in the studies included in this review. A mixed-methods study based in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Spiers-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spiers 2012</LINK> ) enumerates the diversity and complexity as well as variable clinical coverage of the service delivery models which are categorised as 'care closer to home'. This is consistent with the diverse clinical settings of the included studies in this review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-06-03 19:58:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>This systematic review has demonstrated a limited evidence base for home care programmes, with few randomised controlled trials undertaken, clinical and methodological heterogeneity between trials that have been completed. At present, there is insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of specialist paediatric nurse home visiting for acute and chronic illnesses in reducing hospital admissions and Emergency Department utilisation. However, there is suggestive evidence that home care programmes may lead to greater parent satisfaction, improved quality of life and a reduction in the length of hospital stay. The cost effectiveness of these programmes is still to be determined.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-05-28 12:10:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Additional randomised controlled trials are required to examine home care programmes for children with acute and chronic illnesses across the full age range of birth to 18 years. Adequate sample sizes must be used to generate the statistical power to detect differences between the intervention and control groups. Clinically relevant outcomes need to be defined for utilisation of Emergency Departments and length of hospital stay; physical health determinants; mental health determinants; and satisfaction measures. It would be useful if there were a standardised and consistent method of measuring these clinically relevant outcomes across studies, in particular, a definition of readmission to hospital and a standardised questionnaire for measuring parental satisfaction. While data for disease-specific diagnostic groupings would be the ideal, in reality ambulatory care programmes are usually set up in local populations to address a range of acute and chronic conditions. These include, but are not limited to, ambulatory sensitive conditions such as asthma and gastroenteritis.</P>
<P>Currently there are no data to support comprehensive costings for home care programmes from the perspective of a health organisation and the family. Complete evaluation of home care programmes requires estimation of both direct costs to healthcare providers and indirect costs to the child and their family, as well as to society. While healthcare provider costs may be readily assessable, the indirect costs of time off work, loss of earnings and childcare expenses must also be considered. The recently published systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2012</LINK>) on this topic refers to the need for additional high-quality research and collection of good-quality service level data with details about effects on the health economy. It also mentions that the evidence for paediatric home-based services continues to grow slowly.</P>
