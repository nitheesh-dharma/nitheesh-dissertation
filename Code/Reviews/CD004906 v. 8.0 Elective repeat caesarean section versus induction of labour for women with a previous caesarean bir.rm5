<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>When clinicians believe that intervention is needed in a pregnancy, which is the better option for a pregnant woman who has had one or more previous caesarean births - a planned caesarean section (a &#8216;repeat elective caesarean section&#8217;) or planned induction of labour?</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Risks and benefits are known to occur with a repeat elective caesarean section and with planned induction of labour. However, we don&#8217;t know whether evidence indicates that we can expect better outcomes with one form of care over the other. Studies done so far have had strong potential for bias, which means that results may not be reliable.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We looked for randomised trials that compared outcomes in mothers and babies when an elective repeat caesarean section was planned and when induction of labour was planned. We found no trials of this type.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>Caregivers and women faced with making a decision about labour and birth after a previous caesarean section cannot be informed by randomised trial evidence. A woman should discuss with her caregivers the benefits and risks of both courses of action. She and her caregivers should come to a shared decision for action that is based on the woman&#8217;s wishes and priorities.</P>

<P>When a woman has had a previous caesarean birth and requires induction of labour for a subsequent pregnancy, two options are available for her care: an elective repeat caesarean and planned induction of labour. Although risks and benefits are associated with both elective repeat caesarean birth and planned induction of labour, current sources of information are limited to non-randomised cohort studies, and studies designed in this way have significant potential for bias.

<BODY MODIFIED="2017-07-21 11:10:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-21 11:10:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-06-26 11:55:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Caesarean section is commonly performed, and reported rates of this operation vary across the world. A World Health Organization global survey of 150 countries reported that in 2014, 18.6% of births were by caesarean section, and that Latin American and Caribbean regions report a rate of 40.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Betran-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Betran 2016</LINK>). Data from 121 countries revealed a trend towards increasing rates, with the average worldwide rate of caesarean section increasing almost threefold (from 6.7% to 19.1%) between 1990 and 2014. Some countries have had particularly steep rises, for example, Egypt reported an increase from 4.6% to more than 50% over this period (<LINK REF="REF-Betran-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Betran 2016</LINK>). National studies have revealed that in developed countries, more than a quarter of births are performed by caesarean section: caesarean section accounts for 25.5% of births in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-HSCIC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">HSCIC 2013</LINK>), 28.8% in Ireland (<LINK REF="REF-ESRI-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESRI 2013</LINK>), 31.6% in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-AIHW-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">AIHW 2013</LINK>), and 32.8% in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2013</LINK>). The number of women undergoing caesarean section varies within countries, and overall rates may not reveal the disparity between urban and rural areas, and between different social and economic groups; although rates of caesarean section have not increased in low-resource settings such as sub-Saharan Africa, some private hospitals in Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay have reported rates over 50% for several years (<LINK REF="REF-Villar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The benefits and harms of both elective repeat caesarean birth and vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) for women who have had a previous caesarean birth are discussed more fully in the Cochrane Review, "Planned elective repeat caesarean section versus planned vaginal birth for women with a previous caesarean birth" (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>For women with a prior caesarean birth, who require birth before the onset of spontaneous labour for a subsequent pregnancy, it is unclear whether labour should be induced, or whether a repeat elective caesarean should be performed. A survey of practice that asked Australian and New Zealand obstetricians about their willingness to offer induction of labour for a subsequent pregnancy in women with a previous caesarean birth (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2003</LINK>) revealed that Induction of labour was an acceptable option, with 68% of respondents preferring this option to caesarean section. However, in the circumstance of 'post-term' pregnancy, willingness to proceed with induction of labour fell to 54%.</P>
<P>Benefits and harms are associated with both forms of care. This review will specifically consider the benefits and harms of elective repeat caesarean birth and induction of labour for a subsequent pregnancy in women with a previous caesarean birth. In addition to concerns associated with elective repeat caesarean birth and VBAC (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2013</LINK>), more specific worries are related to induction of labour in the presence of a scarred uterus. In particular, the risk of uterine scar rupture (whereby the previous caesarean scar breaks down) may be increased by induction of labour, and this event can be life-threatening for both the woman and her baby.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-07-21 11:07:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pregnant women planning birth following a previous caesarean birth may plan an elective repeat caesarean birth or VBAC.</P>
<P>Repeat elective caesarean birth is associated with increased risk of complications such as bleeding, need for blood transfusion, infection, damage to the bladder and bowel, and clots in the veins of the legs (called 'deep venous thrombosis'). As the number of caesarean births for an individual woman increases, so does the difficulty involved in performing surgery owing to adhesions and risk of damage to bladder or bowel at the time of surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2011</LINK>). Subsequent pregnancies may present difficulties in conceiving or problems with the placenta where the placenta develops over the scar on the uterus (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2011</LINK>), increasing the risk that the placenta may form partially or completely over the internal opening of the uterus, called placenta praevia. Occasionally, the placenta may continue to develop into the muscle wall of the uterus (placenta accreta or placenta percreta). These complications may cause difficulties at birth and increase the risk of excessive bleeding. Babies born by caesarean may develop breathing difficulties (called 'transient tachypnoea of the newborn') and may need to spend time in a special care nursery - usually for a short duration with full recovery. Occasionally, a baby may develop more serious breathing problems (called 'respiratory distress syndrome') and may need extra oxygen, assistance with breathing, and a longer stay in the nursery. Risks of neonatal complications vary according to the use of general anaesthesia and the age at which the baby is born (<LINK REF="REF-Hook-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hook 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrison-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vaginal birth after previous caesarean birth is associated with decreased maternal morbidity and decreased risk of complications in subsequent pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2010</LINK>), whilst fulfilling the desire of some women to experience vaginal birth. However, women with prior uterine surgery, including caesarean birth, are at increased risk of uterine scar rupture, which can occur before labour or during VBAC. Whilst uncommon, this potentially serious event can be life-threatening for the woman and for her baby. The decision to plan for a vaginal birth is further complicated when labour does not commence spontaneously and medical induction is required.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-07-21 11:10:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A large retrospective population-based review assessed the risk of uterine scar rupture in more than 20,000 women with a prior caesarean that occurred between 1987 and 1996 (<LINK REF="REF-Lyndon_x002d_Rochelle-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lyndon-Rochelle 2001</LINK>). Uterine scar rupture occurred at a birth rate of 4.5 per 1000 women (91 of 20,095 women). Review authors compared risk of scar rupture for women who did not labour and had an elective repeat caesarean section, for women whose labour commenced spontaneously, and for women whose labour was induced. For women whose labour was induced, review authors further considered risks associated with prostaglandin induction agents and with 'non-prostaglandin' methods of induction (e.g. oxytocin infusion). Women with no labour who had an elective repeat caesarean birth acted as the control group and had an incidence of uterine rupture of 1.6 per 1000 women (11 of 6980 women). The incidence of uterine rupture was 5.2 per 1000 women for whom onset of labour occurred spontaneously (56 of 10,789 women), and it increased to 7.7 per 1000 women for whom labour was induced without prostaglandins (15 of 1960 women) and 24.5 per 1000 women for whom labour was induced with prostaglandins (9 of 366 women). When compared with women who did not labour and had an elective repeat caesarean birth, risk of uterine rupture was increased when labour occurred spontaneously (risk ratio (RR) 3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8 to 6.0), when labour was induced without prostaglandins (RR 4.9, 95% CI 2.4 to 9.7), and when labour was induced with prostaglandins (RR 15.6, 95% CI 8.1 to 30.0). The 2001 review did not specifically address risks associated with different types of prostaglandin agents (e.g. prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), misoprostol).</P>
<P>In a large National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) study, use of prostaglandin-based medication to induce labour was associated with a non-significant increase in risk of uterine rupture when compared with mechanical methods of labour induction (such as use of a Foley catheter) (<LINK REF="REF-Landon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landon 2004</LINK>). In this study, risk of uterine rupture was 140 per 10,000 inductions with prostaglandins compared with 89 per 10,000 inductions with use of a Foley catheter to dilate the cervix (<LINK REF="REF-Landon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landon 2004</LINK>). However, a large retrospective study from Scotland that assessed more than 36,000 women with a prior caesarean birth, of whom 4600 underwent induction of labour with prostaglandins, reported increased risk of uterine rupture leading to perinatal death associated with use of prostaglandin agents (4.5 per 10,000 non-induced labours vs 11 per 10,000 labours induced with prostaglandins) (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2004</LINK>). It remains unclear whether the reported risk of uterine rupture related to use of prostaglandins reflects medication-induced changes in the connective tissue of the uterine scar, or whether it is a marker of an unfavourable cervix (<LINK REF="REF-Bujold-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bujold 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kayani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kayani 2005</LINK>), which in itself is a predictor of adverse outcomes associated with a trial of labour in women attempting VBAC (<LINK REF="REF-Kayani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kayani 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Landon-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landon 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Controversy also surrounds use of oxytocin to induce and augment labour in women with a scarred uterus. The NICHD study suggests increased risk of uterine rupture associated with use of oxytocin (from 36 per 10,000 women without oxytocin to 87 per 10,000 women with oxytocin) (<LINK REF="REF-Landon-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landon 2005</LINK>). However, whether this increased risk is confined to women undergoing induction of labour, or whether the risk extends to women undergoing augmentation of labour, remains unclear.</P>
<P>Administration of prostaglandins or intravenous oxytocin is contraindicated in women with a previous caesarean section, according to manufacturers' guidelines for both products. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released a committee opinion related to induction of labour after caesarean birth and risk of uterine scar rupture, which stated that use of prostaglandins in this setting is to be "discouraged" (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2002</LINK>). Despite this, prostaglandins have been used widely to induce labour in women with an unfavourable cervix who have a scarred uterus. In an Australian survey of practice, almost two thirds of obstetricians revealed reluctance to use vaginal prostaglandins, whereas 80% conveyed willingness to use oxytocin (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2003</LINK>). In a Canadian survey of practice, 25% of obstetricians indicated willingness to use prostaglandins for induction of labour in women with a previous caesarean birth (<LINK REF="REF-Brill-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brill 2003</LINK>).</P>

<A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEpro</A> Guideline Development Tool will be used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=z1706151057154187349469444508289&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-RevMan-2014">RevMan 2014</A>) to create &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; tables. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes will be produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-07-21 11:10:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified no randomised controlled trials assessing benefits and harms of elective repeat caesarean section versus induction of labour for women with a previous caesarean birth.</P>
<P>In the absence of data of sufficient quality on which to base clinical decisions, uncertainty persists about the relative benefits and harms of induction of labour, as well as the safety of various agents used to induce labour in women with a previous caesarean birth. A recent meta-analysis examining the efficacy and safety of different methods used for induction of labour revealed that many trials examining prostaglandins excluded women who had had a previous caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2016</LINK>). Although the manufacturers of both vaginal prostaglandins and intravenous oxytocin list in their product guidelines the presence of a uterine scar as a contraindication to use, these products are widely used to induce labour in women with an unfavourable cervix who have had a previous caesarean section. In Australia and New Zealand, almost two thirds of obstetricians are reluctant to use vaginal prostaglandins, whereas 80% indicate willingness to use oxytocin (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Available prospective information regarding the safety of induction of labour is limited, and larger studies powered to detect differences in maternal and infant morbidity and mortality are required if this question is to be addressed satisfactorily. However, questions related to the benefits and harms of induction of labour versus elective repeat caesarean section should be considered in the wider context of the benefits and harms of both elective repeat caesarean section and vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) for women with a previous caesarean birth.</P>
<P>Prospective randomised studies should compare the benefits and harms of planned induction of labour versus planned repeat elective caesarean section for women with a scarred uterus who require induction of labour for a subsequent pregnancy. Until these questions have been answered, clinicians must exercise caution when using agents to induce labour in women with a prior caesarean birth.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-06-20 17:05:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The practices of elective repeat caesarean section and planned induction of labour for women with a prior caesarean birth are associated with benefits and harms. However, evidence showing the magnitude of these benefits and harms has been drawn from non-randomised studies, which are associated with potential bias. Therefore, results and conclusions available in the literature must be interpreted with caution.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-06-20 17:06:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Available non-randomised studies of elective repeat caesarean section and planned induction of labour for women with a previous caesarean birth have provided limited insight into the potential benefits and harms associated with both forms of care. Randomised controlled trials are required to provide reliable evidence regarding the benefits and harms of both elective repeat caesarean section and planned induction of labour for women with a previous caesarean birth, and trial findings should be considered in the wider context of benefits and harms associated with both elective repeat caesarean section and planned vaginal birth after caesarean section.</P>
