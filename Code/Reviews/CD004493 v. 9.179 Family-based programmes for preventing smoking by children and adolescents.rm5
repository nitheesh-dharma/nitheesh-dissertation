<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-01-28 16:52:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question:</B> This review asks whether family interventions can influence children and adolescents not to smoke, compared to no-intervention controls or as an add-on to a school intervention. We particularly focused on children who had never smoked.</P>
<P>
<B>Background:</B> Preventing children from starting to smoke is important to avoid a lifetime of addiction, poor health, and social and economic consequences<B>. </B>Family members influence whether children and adolescents smoke. We wanted to know if there is enough evidence to justify funding interventions in families to prevent children starting smoking.</P>
<P>
<B>Last search:</B> April 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Study Characteristics:</B> We identified 27 trials; 23 in the USA and one each in Australia, India, the Netherlands, and Norway. The focus varied amongst the studies. Fifteen trials focused on substance use prevention: six focused only on tobacco prevention; one focused on alcohol; one on general substance abuse; three on tobacco, alcohol and marijuana; two on alcohol and tobacco; and two on tobacco and cardiovascular health. Two trials focused on HIV and unsafe sex prevention. Ten trials focused on family functioning, child development and modifying adolescent behaviour. Duration of follow-up after the intervention was very varied, ranging from 6 months to over 15 years for the studies which intervened with mothers of very young children.</P>
<P>
<B>Key Results: </B>Nine trials provided data to compare a family tobacco intervention to no intervention on future smoking behaviour for those who did not smoke at the start of the study. We could not include data from a further eight trials. The results showed a significant benefit of family-based interventions over the control comparison on preventing experimentation with or taking up regular smoking. Our estimate suggested that family interventions could reduce the number of adolescents who tried smoking at all by between 16 and 32%.</P>
<P>Two trials provided data to compare a combined family plus school intervention to a school intervention and also favoured the family-based intervention. The estimate suggested that the addition of a family intervention might reduce the onset of smoking by between 4 and 25%. We could not include data from a further five trials.</P>
<P>Our interpretation is that the common feature of the effective interventions was encouraging authoritative parenting (which is usually defined as showing strong interest in and care for the adolescent, often with rule setting). This is different from authoritarian parenting (do as I say) or neglectful or unsupervised parenting.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the Evidence:</B> Because most of the randomised controlled trials included in the review did not report their methods in sufficient detail to be confident that the results were not biased, we judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate, which means that the estimate of effect is uncertain.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions: </B>There is moderate quality evidence that family-based interventions can prevent children and adolescents from starting to smoke. Intensive programs may be more likely to be successful than those of lower intensity. There is also evidence to suggest that adding a family-based component to a school intervention may be effective. As the interventions and settings in the review differed considerably, it is important that family-based programmes continue to be evaluated.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-01-28 16:50:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched 14 electronic bibliographic databases, including the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialized register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL unpublished material, and key articles' reference lists. We performed free-text internet searches and targeted searches of appropriate websites, and hand-searched key journals not available electronically. We consulted authors and experts in the field. The most recent search was 3 April 2014. There were no date or language limitations.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-01-28 09:44:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions with children (aged 5-12) or adolescents (aged 13-18) and families to deter tobacco use. The primary outcome was the effect of the intervention on the smoking status of children who reported no use of tobacco at baseline. Included trials had to report outcomes measured at least six months from the start of the intervention.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-01-16 03:17:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We reviewed all potentially relevant citations and retrieved the full text to determine whether the study was an RCT and matched our inclusion criteria. Two authors independently extracted study data for each RCT and assessed them for risk of bias. We pooled risk ratios using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-28 17:07:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-seven RCTs were included. The interventions were very heterogeneous in the components of the family intervention, the other risk behaviours targeted alongside tobacco, the age of children at baseline and the length of follow-up. Two interventions were tested by two RCTs, one was tested by three RCTs and the remaining 20 distinct interventions were tested only by one RCT. Twenty-three interventions were tested in the USA, two in Europe, one in Australia and one in India.</P>
<P>The control conditions fell into two main groups: no intervention or usual care; or school-based interventions provided to all participants. These two groups of studies were considered separately.</P>
<P>Most studies had a judgement of 'unclear' for at least one risk of bias criteria, so the quality of evidence was downgraded to moderate. Although there was heterogeneity between studies there was little evidence of statistical heterogeneity in the results. We were unable to extract data from all studies in a format that allowed inclusion in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>There was moderate quality evidence family-based interventions had a positive impact on preventing smoking when compared to a no intervention control. Nine studies (4810 participants) reporting smoking uptake amongst baseline non-smokers could be pooled, but eight studies with about 5000 participants could not be pooled because of insufficient data. The pooled estimate detected a significant reduction in smoking behaviour in the intervention arms (risk ratio [RR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68 to 0.84). Most of these studies used intensive interventions. Estimates for the medium and low intensity subgroups were similar but confidence intervals were wide. Two studies in which some of the 4487 participants already had smoking experience at baseline did not detect evidence of effect (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.17).</P>
<P>Eight RCTs compared a combined family plus school intervention to a school intervention only. Of the three studies with data, two RCTS with outcomes for 2301 baseline never smokers detected evidence of an effect (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.96) and one study with data for 1096 participants not restricted to never users at baseline also detected a benefit (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.94). The other five studies with about 18,500 participants did not report data in a format allowing meta-analysis. One RCT also compared a family intervention to a school 'good behaviour' intervention and did not detect a difference between the two types of programme (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.38, n = 388).</P>
<P>No studies identified any adverse effects of intervention.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-01-28 16:51:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is moderate quality evidence to suggest that family-based interventions can have a positive effect on preventing children and adolescents from starting to smoke. There were more studies of high intensity programmes compared to a control group receiving no intervention, than there were for other compairsons. The evidence is therefore strongest for high intensity programmes used independently of school interventions. Programmes typically addressed family functioning, and were introduced when children were between 11 and 14 years old. Based on this moderate quality evidence a family intervention might reduce uptake or experimentation with smoking by between 16 and 32%. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously because effect estimates could not include data from all studies. Our interpretation is that the common feature of the effective high intensity interventions was encouraging authoritative parenting (which is usually defined as showing strong interest in and care for the adolescent, often with rule setting). This is different from authoritarian parenting (do as I say) or neglectful or unsupervised parenting.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-01-28 16:52:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tobacco use is the main preventable cause of death and disease worldwide, and the five million deaths annually attributable to tobacco use are predicted to increase to eight million annually by 2030 (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2009</LINK>). Smoking in adolescence continues to rise in many countries, with 23% of American high school students smoking in 2000, up from 18.5% in 1991 (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2000</LINK>). Adult smoking begins in adolescence: in US studies 89% of adult smokers began regular tobacco use by the age of 18 (<LINK REF="REF-Bricker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bricker 2003</LINK>). If poorer countries follow the trajectory of the more affluent countries, it is to be expected that 20% to 30% of 13 to 15 year olds may smoke, depending on the culture of the country and the activities of the tobacco companies (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2009</LINK>). Intervening to prevent smoking uptake during adolescence is critical to slowing or halting the trend towards increased tobacco-related illness (<LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of reviews, surveys and cohort studies have identified three broad classes of influences for smoking in adolescence: individual characteristics (e.g. gender, concerns with body weight, attitudes to smoking), family factors (parental smoking, number of smokers in the family, parental permissiveness and approval) and peer-group or friends (number who smoke, academic expectations by friends) (<LINK REF="REF-Mayhew-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayhew 2000</LINK>). Ethnicity (<LINK REF="REF-Proescholdbell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proescholdbell 2000</LINK>), levels of affluence (<LINK REF="REF-Jarvis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvis 1997</LINK>) and level of education also affect smoking, with tertiary education being associated with lower rates of smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Chassin-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chassin 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chassin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chassin 1996</LINK>). In a long-term cohort study, <LINK REF="REF-Jarvis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvis 1997</LINK> found that as adolescent smokers moved into young adulthood they were more likely to quit if they assumed adult responsibilities such as marriage and employment.</P>
<P>Parental behaviour also emerges as a significant determinant of adolescent smoking in a number of studies (<LINK REF="REF-Mounts-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mounts 2002</LINK>). A cohort study nested within the Hutchinson Smoking Prevention Project (<LINK REF="REF-Bricker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bricker 2003</LINK>) found that the children of parents who had never smoked were the least likely to smoke (odds reduced by 71% compared with both parents currently smoking), while children of parents who had quit smoking also had reduced odds of smoking themselves (reduced by 39%). Several studies reported that parental advice not to smoke or explicit disapproval of smoking could be effective in young teens (<LINK REF="REF-Eisner-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisner 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huver-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huver 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krosnick-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krosnick 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newman 1989</LINK>) and in unmarried pregnant teenagers (<LINK REF="REF-Hussey-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hussey 1992</LINK>). Parenting style and parental restrictions on smoking at home also appeared to have an impact, with permissive home policies increasing the likelihood of experimentation, while authoritative parenting (combining demanding and responsive management of children's behaviour) was the least likely to prompt uptake of smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Proescholdbell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proescholdbell 2000</LINK>). The influence of friends and peers has also been shown to be associated with smoking behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Krosnick-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krosnick 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simons_x002d_Morton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simons-Morton 2002</LINK>), but smoking uptake is negatively related to perceived social competence and parental monitoring. Smoking is associated with other risk behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-DuRant-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">DuRant 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are some non-modifiable family characteristics that affect the likelihood of smoking. Living in an intact two-parent family is associated with less smoking by children (<LINK REF="REF-Botvin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Botvin 1993</LINK>: <LINK REF="REF-Covey-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Covey 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Isohanni-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isohanni 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1991</LINK>) while parental socio-economic status and education are generally inversely correlated with children's smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Tyas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyas 1998</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="REF-Darling-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darling 2003</LINK> has pointed out that the focus of the literature on predicting the risk of adolescent smoking (which is a continuous process of change) from stable family characteristics such as structure may be one reason why understanding of the developmental processes involved in tobacco initiation is limited.</P>
<P>Further background and theoretical issues concerning adolescent smoking initiation are covered in a companion review of school-based interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2013</LINK>). A Cochrane review of smoking prevention for Indigenous youth identified only two RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2012</LINK>). There are also Cochrane reviews of community interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2011</LINK>) and mentoring to prevent adolescents smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>Interventions with children and family members intended to deter starting to use tobacco. Those with school- or community-based components were included provided the effect of the family-based intervention could clearly be measured and separated from the wider school- or community-based interventions.

The family-based intervention could include any components to change parenting behaviour, parental or sibling smoking behaviour, or family communication and interaction.</P>

<P>Any measure of smoking behaviour was considered. Studies may use different measures of tobacco use, either frequency (monthly, weekly, daily), or the number of cigarettes smoked, or an index constructed from multiple measures. These measures attempt to capture the trajectories of smoking uptake in which there is a progression from initial experimentation (e.g., once a month in a younger child) to becoming a regular smoker. Not all experimenters make the transition to regular smoking, and interventions that reduce the likelihood of progression may be as useful as those that deter any experimentation. Previous reviews have noted that few studies use biochemical validation (by saliva thiocyanate or cotinine or expired air carbon monoxide levels) of self-reported tobacco use for inclusion, and we did not require such validation here but recorded its use.</P>

<P>Studies were independently assessed by RET, BCT, PB, and DLL for sources of bias that the Cochrane Collaboration Reviewers' Handbook identifies as potential threats to validity.</P>
<P>We also assessed three statistical criteria:</P>
<UL>
<LI>A reported power calculation with attainment of the desired sample size. If a non-significant result is obtained it may be due either to inadequate sample size or a be a true negative result.</LI>
<LI>The statistical analysis was deemed appropriate to the unit of randomisation for the family intervention. Intra-class correlations (ICCs) in smoking behaviour vary by group, school grade, frequency of smoking, gender, ethnicity, and time of school year. ICCs typically inflate the required sample size, and failure to take account of these may lead to inadequate sample size and the risk of drawing false negative conclusions (Type II error) (<LINK REF="REF-Dielman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dielman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1998</LINK>). We considered statistical analysis to be appropriate if the analysis used the same unit as randomisation (for example, if the family intervention was delivered at the level of the school then the school was the unit of analysis), or if other methods were used to account for cluster effects, such as multi-level modelling.</LI>

<P>Data were extracted from randomised controlled trials that reported smoking prevention (number or percentage of non-smoking children at baseline that remained non-smokers at follow-up) and a minimum follow-up time of six months. The outcomes used were the proportion prevented from smoking and we used the longest available follow-up time for the analysis and computed risk ratios. Adjusted risk ratios from cluster-randomised trials were obtained directly from those trials that reported them. If there is a large degree of heterogeneity in study design, type of outcome measure and statistical reporting, quantitative synthesis is not appropriate. Where trials could be pooled we estimated the effects using a fixed effect (Mantel-Haenszel) model.</P>

<P>Twenty-seven trials met the inclusion criteria, of which 12 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 15 were cluster RCTs (C-RCTs). We identified eight new trials for this update. Full details of included studies are given in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. We excluded three previously included studies; <LINK REF="STD-Knutsen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Knutsen 1991</LINK> was excluded as there were no baseline smoking data for children; <LINK REF="STD-Nutbeam-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Nutbeam 1993</LINK> was excluded as it was not possible to evaluate the minimal family intervention separately from the school intervention in which it is included; and <LINK REF="STD-Salminen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Salminen 2005</LINK> was excluded as, on closer examination, allocation was not randomised. Including these three, we now list 76 excluded studies, details of which can be found in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>Twenty-three trials were conducted in the USA and one each in Australia, India, the Netherlands, and Norway.</P>
<P>All RCTs tested a family intervention, though the interventions were heterogeneous. The Family Resource Center intervention was tested in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Connell-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Connell 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Fosco-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Fosco 2013</LINK>), the Smoke-Free Kids programme was also tested in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hiemstra-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Hiemstra 2014</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2006</LINK>), and the Strengthening Families Program (SFP 10-14) was tested in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Spoth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Spoth 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Spoth-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Spoth 2002</LINK> and a short version by <LINK REF="STD-Riesch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Riesch 2012</LINK>). Twenty other interventions were each tested by only one RCT. Interventions typically addressed family functioning in order to prevent multiple risky behaviours including tobacco use and substance abuse. A smaller number focused on tobacco alone, and two (<LINK REF="STD-Prado-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prado 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2003</LINK>) primarily addressed HIV and unsafe sex but assessed tobacco use outcomes. Nineteen studies had a control group which offered either no intervention, usual care, or a very minimal intervention such as a leaflet, or used a control that targeted different risk behaviours. Eight studies tested a family intervention as an adjunct to a school-based prevention programme offered to both intervention and control groups.</P>
<P>In addition to heterogeneity of intervention design, focus, and comparator condition there was also variation in the length of follow-up, ranging from 6 months to 29 years. Key features of the studies are summarised in the following two tables. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> lists studies that compared a family intervention to no intervention, and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> shows studies that tested a family intervention as an adjunct to a school intervention.</P>

Only one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Dishion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dishion 1995</LINK>) did not control for clustering, and as the ICCs for the three trials which provided them were zero, we did not apply any correction to <LINK REF="STD-Dishion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dishion 1995</LINK>. All other trials involved individual interventions with parents or youth and correction for clustering was not required. Ten studies reported good adherence to training (where relevant) and adherence to intervention, 13 reported intermediate levels and four had no evidence about adherence, or evidence of minimal adherence (fidelity and adherence summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). We were unable to extract data from thirteen study reports in a format that could be included in meta-analysis.</P>
<P>We grouped the studies according to the intensity of the family component into three levels of intensity. In the descriptions below, the studies contributed to the comparison between a family intervention and a non intervention or usual care control, unless noted otherwise.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(a) High Intensity</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Connell-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Connell 2007</LINK> compared: (1) the provision of a Family Resource Center in schools with (a) brief consultations with parents; (b) telephone consultations; (c) feedback to parents on their children's behaviour at school; (d) access to videotapes and books; (e) the SHAPe Curriculum for students with 6 lessons (school success, health decisions, building positive peer groups, cycle of respect, coping with stress and anger, and solving problems peacefully), and (2) the Family Resource Center + Family Check Up (interviews exploring parent concerns, assessment including videotaping the family at home, feedback by the therapist using motivational interviewing strategies and exploring interventional services the family could use, which were delivered over two years by therapists). This study could not be included in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Cullen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cullen 1996</LINK> tested the effect of 20-30 minute interviews (four annually in the 1st year and two annually for the next four years) by a general practitioner with new mothers to enhance self-worth, self-acceptance, foster gentle physical interaction with her child, and adopt a positive attitude to modifying her child's behaviour. Children were followed up as adolescents or young adults.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dishion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dishion 1995</LINK> tested "alternative strategies to reduce escalation in problem behaviours among high-risk young adolescents." Strategeis were to "target parents' use of effective and non-coercive family management practices (parent focus) and young adolescent's self-regulation and competence in family and peer environments (teen focus)." Parent sessions focused on four key skills: monitoring; positive reinforcement; limit setting and problem solving. Twelve 90-minute counselling sessions based on scripted materials and videotapes were tested in four formats: (1) Parent focus: the parent's family management practices and communication skills (monitoring, positive reinforcement, limit setting, and problem solving, with discussion of home practices and demonstration of the skills, with exercises, role-plays, and discussions); (2) Teen focus: teen self-regulation and pro-social behaviour in parental and peer environments (self-monitoring and tracking, pro-social goal setting, developing peer environments supportive of pro-social behaviour; setting limits with friends and problem solving and communication skills with parents and peers); (3) combined parent and teen intervention and (4) self directed change (the six newsletters and five brief videos that accompanied the parent- and teen-interventions). Interventions 1-3 were classified as high intensity. Results could not be included in a meta-analysis</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Forman-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Forman 1990</LINK> compared (1) a school intervention (10 session small groups with Botvin's Life Skills Training), and (2) the school intervention + a parent intervention (parents participated in five weekly two-hour sessions to teach parents the coping skills their children were learning in the student groups, teach parents behaviour management skills, and develop a small group support system for parents to encourage each other to take positive, constructive action regarding their adolescents). This study of a family intervention as adjunct to a school intervention could not be included in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fosco-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Fosco 2013</LINK> compared (1) use of Family Resource Center in schools to (2) control (no intervention). A parent consultant was trained in the Family Check-Up model to facilitate collaboration with parents, identify youth at risk, and refer at-risk students for counselling. At risk adolescents and families participated in three motivational interviewing sessions to identify family strengths and weaknesses, motivate parents to improve parenting, and to engage in intervention services. Feedback about assessment results provided opportunity to select interventions tailored to unique needs of each family.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Guilamo_x002d_Ramos-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Guilamo-Ramos 2010</LINK> compared (1) the Project Towards No Tobacco Use (TNT) risk reduction smoking intervention (10 modules modified for inner city schools and two face-to-face sessions of 2.5 hours each addressing: effective listening and tobacco information; course and consequences of tobacco use; self esteem; being true to oneself; changing negative thoughts; effective communication; assertiveness and refusal skills; advertising and social activism), and (2) the "Linking Lives" intervention (consisting of: "Raising Smoke-Free Kids" (manual of nine short modules, two tobacco-related homework assignments for parents to use with adolescent); two one-day sessions (Day 1 discussed module topics, concept parents could make a difference in their adolescent's tobacco-related behaviour, strategies for effective communication, topics parents might consider discussing in their conversations with their adolescents and the importance of setting limits; Day 2 consisted of two tobacco-related homework assignments on consequences of smoking and ways to resist peer pressure)). Mothers received two booster calls one and six months after the intervention. This study contributes to the analysis of family interventions used as adjuncts to school interventions.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Haggerty-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Haggerty 2007</LINK> compared two formats (self-administered with telephone facilitator support, and a parent and adolescent format) for a seven session "Parents Who Care" programme and control (no treatment). The seven chapters of the workbook were: Relating to your teen; Risks: Identifying and reducing them; Protection: Bonding with your teen to strengthen resilience; Tools: Working with your family to solve problems; Involvement: Allowing everyone to contribute; Policies: Setting family policies on health and safety issues and Supervision: Supervising without invading. In each session parents and adolescents watched a video, practised skills separately and then as families and were asked to continue practice at home.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Olds-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Olds 1998</LINK> provided for infants (1) free sensory and developmental screening performed at 12 and 24 months, with referrals for further evaluation and treatment where necessary, and (2) the same assessments and nurse home visits (nurses taught positive health-related behaviours, competent care of the child, and personal development for the mother including family planning, educational achievement, and return to the workforce). Children's smoking was assessed at age 15 years. This study could not be included in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pierce-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pierce 2008</LINK> tested the Parenting to Prevent Problem Behaviors Project, including a self-help manual (with 12 chapters including building positive behaviours, setting effective limits and relationship building) and a lay facilitator to help participants to work through the manual who followed a computer-assisted structured counselling script using motivational interviewing and searched the internet and study library for answers to parents' problems. Previously researched information sheets were sent to parents electronically or by mail, and there was a computer-assisted structured counselling protocol for parents who needed additional help to implement best practices.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Prado-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prado 2007</LINK> assessed whether providing an intervention to focus on and strengthen Hispanic family-centred values was required for a substance, sexual behaviour and HIV risk intervention to be effective. He compared: (1) an intervention to improve family functioning to reduce substance use and unsafe sexual behaviour (the Familias Unidas intervention to increase parental involvement, positive parenting and family support in Hispanic families (high intensity) combined with PATH [Parent pre-adolescent training for HIV prevention]); (2) PATH and an intervention unrelated to parenting (English language lessons); and (3) PATH and a different intervention unrelated to parenting (American Heart Assocation programme).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Riesch-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Riesch 2012</LINK> tested a short version of the Strengthening Families Program (SFP 10-14 ), during which a youth and parent attended the seven-week, two-hour-per-week programme with videotapes and discussions. This study could not be included in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Spoth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Spoth 2001</LINK> compared two family interventions: (1) the full length SFP 10-14, now renamed ISF (six two-hour session and one one-hour sessions); (2) the Preparing for the Drug-Free Years Program (five two-hour sessions) and (3) a control group which received mailed information. The two family interventions are shown separately in the analysis, dividing the control group to avoid double counting</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Spoth-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Spoth 2002</LINK> tested the SFP programme of seven one-hour weekly sessions for parents and children to strengthen parental skills in nurturing, setting limits and communication about substances and strengthen children's prosocial and peer resistance skills, and four booster sessions offered one year later. All study participants received the Life Skills Training (LST) intervention at school, so this contributes to the analysis of family interventions used as adjuncts to school intervention.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Storr-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 2002</LINK> compared: (1) the Classroom-Centered (CC) Intervention (language and mathematics curricula enhanced to encourage skills in critical thinking, composition, listening and comprehension, whole-class strategies to encourage problem solving by children in group contexts, decrease aggressive behaviour, and encourage time on task, strategies for children not performing adequately; plus teams of children received points for good behaviour and lost points for behaviours such as starting fights - the points could be exchanged for classroom activities, game periods and stickers), and (2) the Family-School Partnership (FSP) intervention (consisting of multiple components: (a) the 'Parents on Your Side Program' trained teachers to communicate with parents and build partnerships, with a three-day workshop, training manual and follow-up supervisory visits; (b) weekly home-school learning and communicating activities and (c) nine workshops for parents (first two workshops to establish an effective and enduring parent-staff relationship and facilitate children's learning and behaviour; next five workshops focused on effective disciplinary strategies). This was classified as high intensity for the amount of contact, but there was no description of the amount of tobacco-focused content. The FSP intervention was also compared to a usual curriculum condition, which is used as the comparator in the family versus no intervention analysis.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-28 17:07:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We divided studies into two groups. The first group evaluated family-based interventions used on their own, compared to a no-intervention control. The second group evaluated family-based interventions used as adjuncts to school-based prevention interventions; these were compared to school-based interventions alone. Pooling nine trials with baseline never-smokers (six trials used a high, one a medium and two a low intensity intervention) found fewer participants in the intervention arms began smoking than those in no-intervention control groups. Pooling two trials with baseline never-smokers comparing a family intervention plus a school intervention to a school intervention alone (one high and one low intensity) found fewer participants in the combined arms began smoking than those only receiving the school-based programmes. No study reported any possible harms from the interventions.</P>
<P>Thus, there was moderate quality evidence of benefit for family interventions used on their own, and when used as adjuncts to school interventions. For stand alone interventions, a family intervention might reduce new smoking behaviour, including experimenting or trying 'just a puff', by between 16 and 32%. Based on an average prevalence of new smoking across study control groups of 230 per 1000 this would translate to a reduction to between 156 and 193 per 1000 with the intervention (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). However, the prevalence of new smoking that occurred by the time of follow-up differed across studies and the absolute effect of an intervention would depend on the setting. For interventions used as adjuncts to school programmes the estimated benefit would be a reduction in new smoking behaviour of between 4 and 25%. Based on the same assumed control group rate of 230 per 1000 this would translate to a reduction in new behaviour to between 172 and 221 per 1000 from the addition of a family component to a school intervention (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The common feature of the effective high intensity interventions was encouraging authoritative parenting (interest in and care for the adolescent, often with rule setting). <LINK REF="STD-Cullen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cullen 1996</LINK> used 12 visits by a general practitioner with new mothers to enhance self-worth, self-acceptance, foster gentle physical interaction with her child, and adopt a positive attitude to modifying her child's behaviour. <LINK REF="STD-Fosco-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Fosco 2013</LINK> provided a Family Resource Center in schools and a consultant used motivational interviewing to identify family strengths and weaknesses, motivate parents to improve parenting and engage in intervention services tailored to the unique needs of each family. <LINK REF="STD-Haggerty-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Haggerty 2007</LINK> provided telephone facilitator support as parents and teens worked through a workbook to identify risks and reduce them, bond with the teen, solve family problems, set family policies and supervise without invading. <LINK REF="STD-Prado-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Prado 2007</LINK> provided an intervention to strengthen Hispanic family-centred values and increase parental involvement, positive parenting and family support. <LINK REF="STD-Spoth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Spoth 2001</LINK> provided sessions for parents and children to strengthen parental skills in nurturing, setting limits and communication about substances, and strengthen children's prosocial and peer resistance skills. <LINK REF="STD-Storr-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 2002</LINK> provided workshops to facilitate children's learning and behaviour and focus on effective disciplinary strategies. In a medium intensity intervention <LINK REF="STD-Bauman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bauman 2001</LINK> sent Family Matters booklets to parents and a health educator telephoned a parent, encouraged the participation of all family members in the programme and answered questions.</P>
<P>The common feature of the effective high intensity interventions used as adjuncts to school interventions was again encouraging authoritative parenting. <LINK REF="STD-Guilamo_x002d_Ramos-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Guilamo-Ramos 2010</LINK> encouraged parents to think they could make a difference in their adolescent's tobacco-related behaviour, including strategies for effective communication, topics parents might consider discussing in their conversations with their adolescents, the importance of setting limits, and ways to resist peer pressure. <LINK REF="STD-Spoth-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Spoth 2002</LINK> encouraged parents to strengthen their skills in nurturing, setting limits and communicating about substances, and strengthen their children's prosocial and peer resistance skills. The classroom intervention in <LINK REF="STD-J_x00f8_sendal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jøsendal 1998</LINK> focused on personal freedom, the freedom to choose, freedom from addiction, and making one's own decisions and the low intensity family component focused on teachers involving parents in discussions and students signing non-smoking contracts.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-01-28 17:04:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The key purpose of the review is to assess whether interventions in families prevent adolescent smoking, and we did find 27 trials that addressed this question. However, only half (fourteen) were meta-analysable. Twelve of the 13 that were not meta-analysable found no significant results. The evidence is predominantly from the USA (23 trials), two from Europe, one from India and one from Austaalia. The evidence is thus mainly from one country on one continent. One trial studied children as young as five, and most trials focused on adolescents aged 11-18. Few studies analysed data separately by gender. We were unable to test whether socio-economic characteristics may have confounded the results, as there were too few studies and details within the studies to determine whether the effects of the intervention were related to socio-economic characteristics. However, randomisation should have prevented differential confounding.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-01-28 17:04:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review identified twenty seven studies RCTs involving over 36,000 participants. Many studies were rated as unclear for most risk of bias domains. For this reason we downgraded the quality of evidence for all outcomes to moderate. Only 14 of the studies had outcomes reported in a way that could be extracted for meta-analysis, and these studies only included about a third of the participants. All but one of the non-meta-analysable studies reported non significant effects on tobacco use, but the direction of effect favoured the intervention arm in all cases that gave data. However it is possible that this group of studies had smaller effects than those includable in the meta-analysis. Although there multiple possible sources of heterogeneity there was little evidence of statistical heterogeneity. Most studies had point estimates indicative of small benefits of interventions.</P>
<P>A limitation may have been combining interventions with differing aims (e.g., tobacco compared to bicycle helmet, gun and seatbelt safety) and that these unrelated aims caused 'noise' which masked the basic message to prevent smoking. It is possible that some of the combination studies might have shown larger effects if they had limited themselves to a strong tobacco intervention.</P>
<P>Unrecorded co-interventions may have occurred during the study, reducing the apparent effect of the family intervention. Possible co-interventions could include other mandated school anti-smoking programmes, social marketing campaigns using mass media, restriction of smoking locations, enforcement of legislation to prohibit the sale and supply of tobacco to those under 18, increasing taxation and cost of cigarettes, and changes in tobacco promotion by tobacco companies. Another possible confounder was the selection of schools because the teachers were enthusiastic, and although the schools may later have been randomised (as in <LINK REF="STD-Biglan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Biglan 1987</LINK>) the co-intervention of teacher enthusiasm could augment the effect of the school component. Most of the studies do not report co-interventions, and if these operated effectively during the study an incremental effect of the family intervention may not have been perceptible.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-28 17:04:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are no other systematic reviews focusing on family interventions to prevent smoking. A systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Petrie-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrie 2007</LINK>) identified 16 RCTs, three controlled before and after (CBA) studies and one controlled trial about parenting programmes to prevent tobacco, alcohol or drugs misuse by children under 18 years. They included only seven of the RCTs we identified (<LINK REF="STD-Bauman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bauman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forman-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Forman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-J_x00f8_sendal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jøsendal 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spoth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Spoth 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spoth-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Spoth 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Storr-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Storr 2002</LINK>), and our review excluded four of the RCTs they included (<LINK REF="STD-Lochman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lochman 2002</LINK> (because there was no tobacco intervention) and <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Perry-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Severson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Severson 1991</LINK> (because the effects of the family intervention could not be separated from those of the school intervention). The authors did not conduct a meta-analysis, but concluded that parenting programmes can be effective in preventing substance use, and noted that more research is needed in this area. A U.S. Preventive Services Task Service review of primary care interventions to prevent adolescent smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Patnode-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patnode 2012</LINK>) identified some of the family RCTs we identified, and concluded that behaviour-based prevention interventions could prevent smoking; these findings are not directly comparable with ours due to the wide range of behavioural interventions considered. In general, although parents are important in influencing smoking by children and adolescents, most interventions have focused directly on youth in schools (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2013</LINK>) and there are fewer RCTs of family interventions. This may reflect the difficulties of conducting interventions in families.</P>
<P>Previous literature reviews that have not focused on trials have identified the contribution of family, individual and social factors in adolescent smoking, and have also identified several problems in studying how families influence adolescent smoking. <LINK REF="REF-Darling-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darling 2003</LINK> noted three problems in identifying the causes of adolescent smoking: the transitional nature of adolescent smoking, the multiple forms of family structure and influences, and the relationship of families to other developmental processes. <LINK REF="REF-Avenevoli-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avenevoli 2003</LINK> identified 87 studies of the relationship between adolescent and parental or sibling smoking, of which 43 assessed smoking by both parents and siblings. Most studies were of US Caucasian students. The studies lacked standardized instruments, did not measure important confounding and mediating variables (smoking-specific socialization practices, and the influences of parents on their children's health beliefs, choice of peers, susceptibility to peer pressure, values, and association with peers who smoke), and used cross-sectional designs. Avenevoli was able to identify only five methodologically rigorous studies, and noted that when effects of parental smoking are found the odds ratios are generally less than 2.0, and the effects are often eliminated when other variables are included in models. Most studies of siblings predict current and life-time smoking by adolescents. <LINK REF="REF-Mayhew-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayhew 2000</LINK> identified 11 cross-sectional studies and found that adolescent smoking was associated with individual factors (male, Caucasian, positive attitudes to smoking, concerns with body weight, affect regulation, and cigarette availability); family factors (number of family members who smoke, perceptions of parental permissiveness and approval of smoking); and the number of friends in the adolescent's network who smoked, but these cross-sectional studies are methodologically weak in assessing a developmental process. Mayhew identified 19 prospective studies which aggregated the experimenting, regular and established smokers into one group and identified individual factors (number of cigarette offers, beliefs about the positive functions of smoking, minimization of risks, intentions to smoke, tolerance for deviance and drug use, and high estimates of smoking prevalence); family factors (parents and siblings who smoked, and the level of parental involvement and support); and non-family factors (number of friends who smoked, approval of smoking by friends, low academic expectations by friends, and a commitment to part-time work while in school). Nine prospective studies that identified discrete stages of smoking found that smoking by parents, family, and best friend, and school performance were factors that predicted moving from non-smoking to experimenting; and positive intentions to smoke and lack of commitment not to smoke were related to the transitions between non-smoking and experimenting and experimenting and regular use. Seven developmental studies which specifically tried to study the development of smoking stages found that for individual factors positive attitudes to smoking predicted high initial rates of smoking and faster rates of smoking; high estimates of the prevalence of tobacco use and alcohol use predicted the transition from trying to experimenting; and marijuana use predicted transitions from non-smoking to trying, trying to experimenting, and experimenting to regular use. For family factors, having parents who smoked predicted the transition from non-smoking to experimenting, and parental divorce predicted the transition from non-smoking to regular smoking. For non-family factors the number of peers who smoked predicted the transitions from never to trying and from trying to experimenting. <LINK REF="REF-Tyas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyas 1998</LINK> found that adolescent smokers who begin at younger ages are more likely to become regular smokers and less likely to quit; parental indifference, lack of supervision and lack of knowledge about their children's friends increases the risk of smoking, as does the perception that friends smoke. Participating in sports is associated with lower rates of smoking.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-01-20 13:48:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>The evidence of this review shows that family-based interventions have the potential to prevent children and adolescents from starting to smoke. There was more evidence that high intensity programmes were likely to be effective because more studies used interventions that were classified as high intensity, but there was not strong evidence of a dose response.</P>
<P>The implications for practice are to choose one of these authoritative parenting interventions most suited to the families who may be involved and the intervention resources available. Given the heterogeneity in the intervention and settings, caution is warranted. When implemented, it may be important monitor both implementation integrity and outcomes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-01-20 13:49:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>The implications for research are to conduct focus groups to assess how the theoretically best grounded interventions with significant results identified in the meta-analysis could be further improved and then test them head-to-head and against a control group. Consortia of researchers could collaborate to test them in fully powered trials with different adolescent and family populations, carefully executed with minimal attrition, maximum programme fidelity and analysed to assess any effects of clustering. The majority of studies were undertaken in the USA and studies in other countries and including their different cultural groups are much needed. The inclusion of an economic evaluation would be useful in understanding the potential cost-effectiveness of the interventions.</P>

<P>Intervention 1: Project Towards No Tobacco Use (TNT) smoking intervention: 10 modules modified for inner city schools to two face-to-face sessions each 2.5 hours (effective listening and tobacco information, course and consequences of tobacco use, self esteem, being true to oneself, changing negative thoughts, effective communication, assertiveness and refusal skills, advertising, and social activism) PLUS the "Linking Lives" intervention (a) "Raising Smoke-Free Kids" (manual of 9 short modules, two tobacco-related homework assignments for parents to use with adolescent), (b) two one-day sessions. Day 1: discussed modules, concept parents could make a difference in their adolescent's tobacco-related behaviour, strategies for effective communication, topics parents might consider discussing in their conversations with their adolescents, importance of setting limits. Day 2: Tobacco-related homework assignments: consequences of smoking, and ways to resist peer pressure. Mothers received 2 booster calls 1 &amp; 6 months after the intervention</P>

<P>Purpose: multifaceted family-based prevention approach to address common risk and protective factors for initiation into cigarette, alcohol, other drug use or sexual activity, delinquent and violent behaviour so that each teen&#8217;s particular vulnerabilities are addressed. Sought to test for overall effects on initiation of problem behaviours in the first 2 years of high school when initiation is likely to occur, but levels are still relatively low. Strategies designed to help families reduce risk factors. Programme teaches families to reduce family management problems by increasing parental supervision and effective consequences for misbehaviour.</P>

<P>(3) Control: No treatment follow-up only</P>
<P>Integrity of Intervention: Self-administered with telephone support: Mean level of reported completion of the family activities was 81%. On average, family consultants made 16.9 call attempts resulting in 9.7 completed calls during the 10 weeks; phone calls lasted about 10.5 min per week. Families received up to $100 for their completion of program activities.</P>
<P>Parent and Adolescent (PA) Format: Group leaders called families each week to remind them of the upcoming session. Of the 118 families assigned to the PA condition, 92 (77.9%) initiated the parent and teen sessions. The mean number of sessions attended was 4.56. Family sessions were led by two workshop leaders with prior experience conducting parent or teen workshops, and received 20 h of training.</P>

<P>Study design; RCT. Parent-child dyad (schools only used to recruit dyads). No power computation: "We reasoned from past studies that approximately 20% of invited families would respond. An average of 60 children was enrolled in the fifth grade at each elementary school. To attain the 150 dyads expected as part of the SAMHSA contract, we needed to include a minimum of 13 schools. We randomly selected 17 schools from the high and low minority enrolment schools." Intention-to-treat. Analysis: &#8220;a clustered randomized trial, the data included multilevel or hierarchically structured samples. Adult&#8211;youth dyads were clustered within each school. A two-level regression model was used (Rasbash, Charlton, Browne, Healy, &amp; Cameron, 2009) with a dummy variable for treatment effects to avoid underestimating standard errors of regression coefficients from fitting a model that did not recognize clustering. Baseline measures were used as covariates in each analysis. The model for assessing change was a multilevel model for fixed-occasion repeated outcomes (Goldstein, 1995; Yang, Health, &amp; Goldstein, 2000).&#8221;</P>

<P>Purpose: Assessing the short version of the Strengthening Families Program (SFP 10-14), a major revision of the 14 session SFP. Based on the Bio-psychosocial Vulnerability Model. Designed to reduce risk factors and build family capacity and coping skills to access and use resources within their school and community to achieve child socialization goals.</P>
<P>(1) Intervention: Youth and one parent attended the 7-week, 2-hr-per-week program together at community locations in the evenings or weekends in each city. Didactic content was presented by videotape, discussion sessions were timed, and the curriculum was detailed carefully in a manual that contained all the required handouts. In each session youth and parents or legal guardians were separated for the first hour to work on goal-oriented, developmentally appropriate activities and dyads were reunited in the second hour for family-oriented activities. (high intensity)</P>
<P>(2) Control: <I>Minimal contact comparison condition. </I>Comparison group families participated only in the data collection procedures. No comparison families reported participation in another family skill building or parenting program.</P>
<P>Integrity of Intervention: Used bachelor&#8217;s prepared or university students who were trained to facilitate the SFP 10-14. Trainers from the Iowa State University Extension conducted 2-day sessions on three separate occasions. Analyses of the checklists, more than 90% of the content was consistently covered in the adult groups and 87% for the youth groups. Analysis made by intensity of the intervention (partial dose/reduced completion).</P>

<P>A paradoxical result was: &#8220;significant outcomes among youth who received a partial dose were in the direction opposite than expected, that is, youth who received a partial dose perceived their communication with their father as statistically significantly less open at Post 2 and their involvement in the family as statistically significantly less at Post 1 than youth in the comparison condition.&#8221;</P>

<P>Intervention (1): Focus on Kids (FOK), (n = 321): 8 session (each 1.5 hours) HIV small-group risk reduction programme on decision making, goal setting, communicating, negotiating, and consensual relationships and information regarding safe sex, drugs, alcohol and drug selling. Conducted in small groups (5-10), led by 2 older peers, with games, discussions, homework assignments and videotapes.<BR/>Intervention (2): (n = 258) (a) FOK + (b) ImPACT (Informed Parents and Children Together): 20-min video emphasising concepts of parental monitoring and communicating with 2 instructor-led role-playing vignettes between the parent and youth in the child's home. The interventionist critiques the role play according to the main talking points of the videotape and conducts a condom demonstration.</P>
<P>Intervention (3): (n= 238) (a) FOK + (b) 4 FOK booster sessions at 6m and 10m + (c) + ImPACT</P>
<P>Focus on Kids has a minor informational component about tobacco and no family component. ImPACT is 20 minute video followed by role plays between parent and youth, then criticised by interventionist. It has no tobacco focus, but baseline and 24 months smoking were measured for all 3 programmes. ImPACT assessed as low intensity.</P>
