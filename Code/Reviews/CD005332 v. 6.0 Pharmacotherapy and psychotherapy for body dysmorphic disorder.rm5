<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-12 22:43:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a condition characterised by a distressing and disabling preoccupation with an imagined or slight defect in appearance. This causes people with this disorder either significant distress or disrupts their daily functioning (or both). There has been a growing recognition that BDD is common, and is associated with significant illness and disability. There is also some evidence that it may respond to pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Our systematic review of randomised controlled trials assesses the effects of drug treatment or psychotherapy when used on their own or in combination. We found five eligible trials, including three of psychotherapy (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and exposure and response prevention (ERP)) and two of medication (the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) fluoxetine and clomipramine). In the only placebo-controlled medication trial included in our review, people with BDD treated with fluoxetine were more likely to respond (56%, 19 out of 34) than those allocated placebo (18%, 6 out of 33). Symptoms became less severe after treatment with both medication and psychotherapy. Adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and none of the people in the active treatment groups were reported to have dropped out of the studies because of treatment-emergent adverse events. There is preliminary evidence from one trial of CBT that the effects of CBT may persist once treatment has ended. Treatment response in the medication trials was not effected by the degree to which people had insight into their condition. Although few controlled trials have been done, and those that have been conducted were small, indicating that our findings should be used with caution unless confirmed by larger studies (some of which are ongoing), the results suggest that treatment with both medication or psychotherapy can be effective in treating the symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-11-09 18:21:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Trial Register (December 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2007), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2007), and PsycINFO (1967 to December 2007). Ongoing and unpublished trials were located through searching the metaRegister of Controlled Trials, the CRISP and WHO ICTRP search portals (databases searched in December 2007), and through contacting key researchers and pharmaceutical companies. Additional studies were located through study reference lists.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-10-20 09:32:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of patients meeting DSM or ICD diagnostic criteria for BDD, in which the trials compare pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy or multi-modal treatment groups with active or non-active control groups. Short or long-term trials were eligible.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-13 00:36:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two pharmacotherapy and three psychotherapy trials were eligible for inclusion in the review, with data from four short-term RCTs (169 participants) available for analysis. Response data from a single placebo-controlled trial of fluoxetine suggested overall superiority of medication relative to placebo (relative risk (RR) 3.07, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.72, n = 67). Symptom severity was also significantly reduced in the RCTs of fluoxetine and clomipramine (relative to desipramine), as well as in the two CBT trials (WMD -44.96, 95% CI -54.43 to -35.49, n = 73). A low relapse rate (4/22) was demonstrated in one trial of CBT.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-11-13 00:38:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Results from the small number of available RCTs suggest that SRIs and CBT may be useful in treating patients with BDD. The findings of these studies need to be replicated. In addition, future controlled studies in other samples, such as adolescents, and using other selective SRIs, as well as a range of psychological therapy approaches and modalities (alone and in combination), are essential in supplementing the sparse data currently available.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-09 14:38:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a condition characterised by a distressing and disabling preoccupation with an imagined or slight defect in appearance. Patients with BDD are typically fixated on more than one body part over the course of the illness (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Veale 1996</LINK>), with common foci of distress including, but not limited to the skin, hair, and nose. Although currently classified as a somatoform disorder, some have argued that BDD should be conceptualised as a mood disorder, or as an obsessive compulsive spectrum disorder (OCSD) (<LINK REF="REF-Hollander-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollander 1993</LINK>). Cases of "dysmorphophobia" have been described for more than a century, but the disorder received increased clinical and research attention after its incorporation into the official psychiatric nomenclature in the DSM-IIIR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, version III revised) in 1987 (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>There has been a growing recognition that BDD is prevalent, and is associated with significant comorbidity, disability and social or occupational impairment. Patients with BDD have been reported as having low levels of self-esteem (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1998</LINK>) and impaired mental health - related quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2004</LINK>) relative to normal controls. Preliminary evidence from surveys indicates that approximately a quarter of patients with BDD may have attempted suicide in their lifetimes (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Veale-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veale 1996b</LINK>). Patients may undergo multiple cosmetic procedures, usually with little positive effect on their symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Veale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Veale 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Veale-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veale 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Tignol-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tignol 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Estimates of the prevalence of BDD have ranged between 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Faravelli-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faravelli 1997</LINK>) and 4-5% (<LINK REF="REF-Bohne-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohne 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bohne-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohne 2002b</LINK>) of the nonclinical population, with even higher prevalence rates in specialised medical settings (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2000</LINK>). Evidence concerning the gender distribution of BDD is inconsistent. (<LINK REF="REF-Rosen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Veale 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frare-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frare 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2000</LINK>). Males and females may have somewhat different kinds of concerns, with males generally more preoccupied with their height, genitals, body hair and build, and females with their breasts, hips, legs and body weight (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2006b</LINK>). Individuals with BDD are frequently diagnosed with comorbid psychiatric disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Veale 1996</LINK>), the most common being major depression, social phobia and obsessive compulsive disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1997a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The validity of the DSM distinction between BDD and delusional disorder, somatic type has been questioned. In a study assessing the prevalence of delusionality amongst 100 participants diagnosed with BDD, approximately half (52%) had at some point been absolutely convinced that their physical imperfections were real (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1994</LINK>). Furthermore, open-label (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2001b</LINK>), retrospective (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2001a</LINK>) and prospective (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2006d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2006d</LINK>) studies have found little evidence that BDD patients with and without insight have a different pharmacotherapy response. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that delusional BDD may represent a more severe form of the disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Eisen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisen 2004</LINK>). This receives some support from the finding of a positive association between delusionality and response to the SRI clomipramine in a RCT cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 1999</LINK>). Evidence of the lack of consensus about the classification of BDD is apparent in the ability to diagnose patients according to DSM-IV criteria as being afflicted with both BDD and delusional disorder, and the definition in the ICD-10, the standard diagnostic system employed outside of the United States, of BDD as a subgroup of hypochondrial disorder (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-09 12:14:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There appears to be evidence that BDD responds to pharmacotherapy, and to SRIs in particular. Case studies (<LINK REF="REF-Hollander-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollander 1989</LINK>), retrospective case series (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1994</LINK>), and open-label trials (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2006e" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2006e</LINK>) all contribute to the impression that SRIs are effective, and perhaps preferentially effective. In a chart review study of 90 patients, an improvement in BDD symptoms was observed for 63.2% of patents in response to a range of SRI's (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2001a</LINK>). This study also detected high relapse rates (84% (31) of 37 participants) following discontinuation of SSRIs (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2003</LINK>). Conversely, despite the apparent widespread use of antipsychotics to treat BDD (<LINK REF="REF-Saxena-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saxena 2001</LINK>), the only placebo-controlled study of the efficacy of this medication class in treating 28 patients with BDD was not able to detect any differences following the eight week open-label augmentation of the SSRI fluoxetine with pimozide (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2005b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Theoretical considerations suggest that psychotherapy may also be useful in treating BDD (<LINK REF="STD-Veale-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Veale 1996</LINK>). While evidence of the effectiveness of psycho-analysis is contested (<LINK REF="REF-Phillips-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 2001b</LINK>), findings of an increasing number of open studies (<LINK REF="STD-Wilhelm-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wilhelm 1999</LINK>) and RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Veale-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veale 1996b</LINK>) support the effectiveness of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in treating BDD. CBT treatment modalities typically include exposure with response prevention (ERP) and changing beliefs underlying patients' dissatisfaction with their bodies by focusing on cognitive processes such as self-focused attention and rumination. These methods are frequently augmented with information provided to the patient concerning the nature of BDD, and with reverse role playing strategies. Although there is some evidence that both the behavioural (<LINK REF="REF-Marks-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marks 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKay-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McKay 1997</LINK>) and cognitive (<LINK REF="STD-Geremia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Geremia 2001</LINK>) aspects of CBT are effective in isolation, the relative contribution of these respective elements in combined treatment requires further investigation. Nevertheless, there are preliminary indications that the behavioural component of CBT may result in lower relapse rates that those found in SRI trials (<LINK REF="STD-McKay-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McKay 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKay-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKay 1999</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-11-09 12:13:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the pathogenesis of BDD is not well understood, preliminary evidence of a response of BDD symptoms to SRIs is consistent with impaired modulation of neural activity by the serotonergic system. Abnormalities in brain structure (<LINK REF="REF-Gabbay-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gabbay 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Rauch-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rauch 2003</LINK>) and function (<LINK REF="REF-Feusner-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feusner 2007</LINK>), as well as cognitive impairments (<LINK REF="REF-Hanes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deckersbach-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deckersbach 2000</LINK>) have also been detected in subjects with the disorder, though evidence of the causal status of these factors vis-a-vie BDD is lacking. Both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy have demonstrated normalising effects on brain morphology and activation in OCD (<LINK REF="REF-Baxter-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baxter 1992</LINK>), a disorder frequently conceptualised as lying on the same spectrum of disorders as BDD.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-09 12:14:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To date only one systematic review and meta-analyses of the pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy of BDD has been conducted (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2006</LINK>). The authors concluded that both modalities are effective in treating BDD, but that CBT is more effective than medication therapies in treating this disorder. The latter conclusion was based on indirect comparisons of trials and should therefore be interpreted cautiously. Differences in the control groups employed in the different modes of treatment also raises doubts regarding their comparability (placebo controls are typically not feasible in psychotherapy trials). Moreover, the authors of this review did not control for the possibility of multiple sources of bias undermining the validity of their conclusions. These included (a) the synthesis of outcomes from both controlled and non-controlled trials, and (b) the inclusion of multiple effect sizes from individual studies in the same comparison. Our review was conducted in accordance with guidelines proposed by the Cochrane collaboration to minimise bias in determining the relative efficacy and acceptability of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in treating BDD.</P>

<P>The following information was collated independently by two review authors (CS and JI) from each trial that satisfied the inclusion criteria:</P>
<P>1. Description of the trials, including primary researcher and year of publication</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-11-09 16:54:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Dichotomous data</B>
<BR/>Relative risk of response to treatment and number needed to benefit (NNTB) was calculated for the dichotomous outcome of interest (CGI-I or related measure). Relative risk was used instead of odds ratios, as odd ratios are less easily interpreted. Odds ratios also tend to overestimate the size of the treatment effect when interpreted as relative risks. This is especially the case when the occurrence of the outcome of interest is common (as anticipated in this review, with an expected response greater than 20%) (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2008</LINK>). NNTB is defined as the inverse of the absolute risk difference due to the active intervention. In this review it is used to indicate the number of patients who require treatment with either pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy, relative to a control, before a single additional patient responds to active treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Continuous data</B>
<BR/>Weighted means were calculated for continuous summary data obtained from studies employing identical scales. Alternatively, in cases in which different versions of the same scale are employed, such as both the 10 and 12 item YBOCS-BDD, the standardised weighted mean was determined. This method of analysis standardises the differences between the means of the treatment and control group in terms of the variability observed in the trial.</P>

<P>
<B>Trials with more than one treatment group</B>
<BR/>Unit-of-analysis bias may be introduced from trials testing the efficacy of fixed doses of medication through comparing the summary statistics for multiple groups against the same placebo control (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2008</LINK>). Although no dose-comparison studies were included in this review, this bias will be controlled for in future editions of this review by pooling the means and standard deviations across all of the treatment arms as a function of the number of participants in each arm. The same form of bias resulting from the inclusion of trials comparing the efficacy of more than two interventions will be circumvented in future updates of this review by means of a multiple-treatments meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008b</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Cross-over trials</B>
<BR/>Primary outcome summary statistics for cross-over trials with an adequate wash-out period were calculated separately from RCTs which employ a parallel design (adequate wash-out will be defined as a minimum of ine month for trials employing psychotherapy, and a minimum of two weeks in the case of medication trials -- data from trials assessing the efficacy of agents with extended half-lives, such as the SSRI, fluoxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Gury-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gury 1999</LINK>), would require longer wash-out periods before being included). In cases in which the wash-out period is of an insufficient duration, or in which the small number of cross-over trials does not justify the separate analysis of the summary statistics, only treatment and placebo/comparator data from the first treatment period would be combined with the data from parallel RCTs.</P>

<P>All analyses of dichotomous data were intention-to-treat (ITT). The total number of participants randomised to the different comparison groups were used as the denominator in comparisons of treatment response. Only data from trials that provide information on the original group size (prior to drop-outs) were included in these analyses. Preference was given to the inclusion of summary statistics for continuous outcome measures derived from mixed effects models, followed by last observation carried forward (LOCF) and observed cases (OC) summary statistics (in that order). This is in line with evidence that ME methods are more robust to bias than LOCF analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Verbeke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verbeke 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>Heterogeneity of treatment response, that is whether the differences among the results of trials were greater than would be expected by chance alone, was assessed visually from a forest plot of relative risk, as well as by means of the chi-square test of heterogeneity. A significance level of less than 0.10 was interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity, as the chi-square statistic is reported to possess less power when the number of trials is small (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, the I-square heterogeneity statistic reported by RevMan was used to quantify the consistency of the trial results within each comparison (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Differences on continuous measures in medication efficacy between the group being compared was assessed by means of Deeks' stratified test of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>). This method subtracts the sum of the chi-square statistics for each of the groups from the total chi-square for the subgroup analysis, to provide a measure (Q<SUB>b</SUB>) of heterogeneity between groups. Differences in treatment response on the CGI-I was determined by whether the confidence intervals of the subgroups overlap. This method was chosen in preference to the stratified test, due to inaccuracies in the calculation in RevMan of the chi-square statistic for dichotomous measures (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>All comparisons were stratified by treatment mode (pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or multimodal interventions). A random effects model was employed for the analysis of both dichotomous and continuous outcome measures.

<BR/>Medication was reported in the trial report for the RCT of fluoxetine as demonstrating equivalent efficacy in reducing BDD symptom severity in both delusional and non-delusional participants (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2002</LINK>). Delusionality was significantly reduced in treatment responders versus non-responders from both treatment groups combined (F = 9.5, p &lt; 0.001).</P>

<BR/>Depression scores were also significantly reduced in participants administered fluoxetine (N = 1, WMD = -7.00, 95%CI -11.94 to -2.06, n = 67) (Graph 2.1). Fluoxetine failed to improve quality of life on the mental health subscale of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 1993</LINK>) (N = 1, WMD = 9.1, 95%CI -1.05 to 19.25, n = 67) (Graph 2.2). However, this agent was effective in reducing functional disability on the Range of Impaired Functioning Tool (<LINK REF="REF-Leon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leon 1999</LINK>) (WMD = -3.00, 95%CI -4.65 to -1.35, n = 67) (Graph 2.3).</P>

<BR/>Treatment with fluoxetine led to more than 20% of 34 participants experiencing insomnia, drowsiness and stomach/abdominal discomfort (in order of decreasing incidence) (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2002</LINK>). Stomach or abdominal discomfort (chi-squared = 7.5, p &lt; 0.01) and drowsiness (chi-squared = 4.4, p &lt; 0.05) were the only side effects to occur significantly more frequently in the medication than placebo group, with approximately a third of the participants experiencing these symptoms following treatment with fluoxetine.

<BR/>There was evidence from the single study comparing clomipramine with desipramine that clomipramine reduced BDD symptom severity on the BDD-YBOCS (WMS -5.72, 95%CI -11.17, -0.27, n = 23).</P>

<BR/>
<I>1. Delusionality</I>
<BR/>Clomipramine was reported to be more effective than desipramine in reducing symptom severity amongst both delusional and non-delusional patients (assessed using the Fixity of Beliefs scale (<LINK REF="REF-Foa-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foa 1995</LINK>)) (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 1999</LINK>). Higher levels of delusionality were associated with greater treatment response on the CGI-BDD after treatment with clomipramine (r = -0.56, p = 0.007). A reduction in symptoms of delusionality was observed in the clomipramine, but not the desipramine group.</P>
<P>
<I>2. Comorbid depression and OCD symptoms</I>
<BR/>Depression and OCD symptom severity scores were reported as decreasing to a greater extent following treatment with clomipramine than desipramine (t = 2.44, p = 0.02 and t = 3.01, p = 0.007, respectively) (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 1999</LINK>). The diagnosis of both social anxiety and OCD was found to be unrelated to outcome response in <LINK REF="STD-Hollander-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 1999</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<I>3. Quality of life/functional disability</I>
<BR/>Clomipramine was also reported as reducing functional disability on the Schneier Disability Profile (<LINK REF="REF-Schneier-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneier 1994</LINK>) to a greater extent than desipramine after a minimum of 4 weeks of treatment with both agents (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>4. Acceptability</I>
<BR/>Clomipramine and desipramine resulted in high rates of dry mouth, sedation or tiredness, constipation, sweating and tremor, and insomnia. Although the frequency of these side effects did not differ significantly between the two medication groups (averaging 64.8% versus 41.6% for clomipramine and desipramine, respectively), the only subjects in this review to withdraw due to adverse events were 4 patients receiving desipramine (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 1999</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-10 16:50:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of this review indicate that both pharmacotherapy (clomipramine, fluoxetine) and psychotherapy (CBT) may be effective in the treatment of BDD. </P>
<P>Fluoxetine demonstrated a significantly higher global response to treatment with medication than placebo on the CGI-I (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2002</LINK>). More than three times as many people responded on this scale in the medication group, which is equivalent to approximately three patients having to be treated with this agent before an additional person responds, relative to those who would have responded to placebo alone (ie. NNTB). The observation that clomipramine was more effective at decreasing symptom severity scores than desipramine is consistent with the findings of open-label trials of medications which more selectively target the serotonergic system, such as citalopram (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2003</LINK>) and escitalopram (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2006e" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2006e</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cognitive behavioural therapy was implemented in both short-term psychotherapy trials, thus demonstrating that this modality may be effective in the treatment of BDD. There is also preliminary evidence that the effects of treatment with CBT may persist once treatment has ended (<LINK REF="STD-Rosen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rosen 1995</LINK>). The only data on the efficacy of long-term treatment with psychotherapy are inconclusive, as six months of ERP maintenance treatment (and emergency support where required) did not result in significant reductions in BDD symptom severity (<LINK REF="STD-McKay-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McKay 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite some promising findings, there are a number of qualifications that need to be made with respect to the strength of the evidence upon which they are based. Firstly, the small sample size and number of RCTs in the comparisons conducted, as well as inadequacies of reporting (and possibly trial methodology) limit the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn. It was also not possible to compare the efficacy of different forms of psychotherapy, or to comment on the relative efficacy of the cognitive or behavioural modification components of CBT, as data from RCTs was only available for studies combining both aspects of treatment. The power to detect the efficacy of pharmacotherapy was compromised by the necessity of analysing data separately from the two included trials, as differences in study design prohibited synthesis of data from these trials. Finally, the review authors were not able to exclude the possibility of bias being introduced through dependence of publication in this field on study outcomes.</P>
<P>There is some evidence that fluoxetine and CBT may be effective in treating co-morbid symptoms of depression in BDD. Functional disability was significantly reduced in a trial of clomipramine (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 1999</LINK>), a noteworthy finding given the relatively high levels of functional disability suffered by those with BDD compared to other related disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Frare-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frare 2004</LINK>). However, treatment with another SRI, fluoxetine, failed to improve quality of life as measured by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item short-form Health Survey (SF-36) (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2002</LINK>). This could be due in part to the large proportion of participants who experienced treatment-emergent adverse event in this trial (82%). Nevertheless, no drop-outs due to adverse events were observed in this review following treatment with the SRIs, suggesting that this medication class is well tolerated in treating BDD.</P>
<P>There were insufficient data for a systematic evaluation of differences in treatment response between delusional and non-delusional participants. The conceptualisation of the delusional variant as representing a more severe form of the disorder receives some support from the discovery in one of these trials of a positive relationship between delusionality and response to the SSRI, clomipramine (<LINK REF="STD-Hollander-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hollander 1999</LINK>). Patients with poor insight were also significantly less likely to respond to placebo than less delusional participants in the fluoxetine study (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2002</LINK>). Indirect evidence that delusional and non-delusional BDD represent differences of severity rather than kind also comes from failure to observe differences in the response of these groups in placebo-controlled and open-label augmentation studies of the SSRI fluoxetine with the antipsychotics pimozide (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2005b</LINK>) and olanzapine (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2005c" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2005c</LINK>), respectively.</P>
<P>The evidence database does not currently support conclusions regarding the relative efficacy of pharmacotherapy versus psychotherapy in treating BDD. Difficulties in obtaining equivalent control groups when conducting head-to-head comparisons may be compounded in indirect comparisons of these treatment modalities. The frequent finding of larger effects in RCTs of CBT than antidepressants (eg <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2006</LINK>) needs to be considered in light of the possibility that wait-list controls in the former might inflate effect size estimates when compared to placebo-controlled pharmacotherapy trials. Assessing the comparability of trials of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy is further complicated by differences between modalities in the quality of reporting of trial methodology and outcomes. It is unclear, for instance, to what extent the results of psychotherapy RCTs in this review generalise to the highly comorbid populations that typically present in clinical practice, as the included studies did not provide data on prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity in their samples. The use of different measures of symptom severity in medication and psychotherapy trials also hinders cross-modality comparisons. Finally, the absence of a follow-up phase in three of the trials makes it difficult to assess whether or not the effects of CBT are more persistent than pharmacotherapy.</P>
<P>Evidence is currently lacking for the effectiveness of administering multiple forms of intervention concurrently in treating BDD (ie. combining medications or psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy), despite the widespread use of multiple interventions in clinical practice. Ongoing research on adding CBT to a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with a SSRI (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00211809" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00211809</LINK>) will help determine whether there is any basis for speculation that combining pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy might further increase treatment response relative to either intervention on its own. Preliminary evidence from small placebo-controlled studies and case series studies suggest that antipsychotics may not be useful when used in combination with an SSRI (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2005c" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2005c</LINK>).</P>
<P>The conclusion that pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy may be efficacious in treating BBD is consistent with the findings of the only other meta-analysis of treatment of this disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2006</LINK>).This is encouraging, given the stricter inclusion criteria employed in this review. The finding in <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2006</LINK> of a significantly larger overall treatment effect for five CBT trials (three of which have been excluded from this review - <LINK REF="STD-Khemlani_x002d_Patel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Khemlani-Patel 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Neziroglu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Neziroglu 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilhelm-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wilhelm 1999</LINK>) versus five trials of medication (including those in this review, as well as one case series study of citalopram (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2003</LINK>) and two of fluvoxamine (<LINK REF="STD-Perugi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Perugi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1998</LINK>)), should be approached with caution, however, not only because of the indirect nature of this comparison, but also as it combines data from case series studies and RCTs, some which contribute multiple effect sizes.</P>
<P>The small number of trials employing rigorous designs in assessing the treatment of BDD is noteworthy, given the high prevalence and morbidity associated with this condition. The lack of controlled trials and the paucity of research on the pathogenesis of this disorder indicate that it is a field which deserves additional attention and funding.</P>

<P>The results from the small number of RCTs reviewed suggest that certain SRIs and CBT may be effective in treating patients with BDD. Tolerability was acceptable for both modalities, as indicated by high compliance rates, and no drop-outs due to treatment-emergent adverse events with SRIs. There is also preliminary evidence that the effects of treatment with CBT may persist once treatment has ended. Although it was not an aim of this review to assess augmentation studies, there is little evidence in the literature that adding antipsychotics to treatment for non-responders to SRIs is an effective treatment strategy.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-11-10 16:49:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The small number of controlled trials included in this review reflects the paucity of research in the treatment of a prevalent and disabling disorder. Additional research into the relative efficacy of cognitive and behavioural therapy is warranted, as is the assessment of whether adding cognitive restructuring to behaviour therapy improves compliance rates, as has been speculated by some (<LINK REF="STD-Geremia-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Geremia 2001</LINK>). Controlled trials of other established psychotherapy modalities and third generation psychotherapies (eg. mindfulness therapy) may also be warranted. Open-label studies of promising selective SRIs, such as escitalopram and citalopram, should be followed up with randomised placebo-controlled trials. The contribution of these trials to knowledge regarding the effectiveness of particular interventions in treating BDD would be enhanced if they were reported in a manner consistent with the guidelines of the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Additional data are needed to address several areas, including the efficacy of treatment over the longer-term, the value of medication augmentation strategies for non-responders, and the efficacy of combination medication and multimodal treatment strategies (pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy). Future research should also focus on gender differences in treatment response and whether findings of this review translate to other age groups (ie adolescents). Finally, comparability between treatment of BDD with pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy would be enhanced through agreement on the use of a common standardised outcome scale.</P>

<P>Differences between the protocol and first version of the review (31 October, 2008)</P>
<P>The original protocol specified that studies meeting DSM criteria would be included. We have decided, in the interests of inclusivity, to include studies meeting ICD criteria as well.</P>
<P>Adverse responses to treatment as part of the narrative review was included under secondary outcomes in the section on "Types of outcome measures". Side-effects classified by the trial authors as severe, as well as significant differences between the medication and control groups in the prevalence of the most common drug-related adverse events (defined as occurring in at least 20% of the participants given medication) for the included trials were described as part of the narrative review.</P>
<P>Weighted mean differences were used instead of standardised mean differences (as specified in the protocol for this review) for the primary outcome of symptom severity reduction for trials of psychotherapy. The initial rationale for specifying the use of SMD instead of WMD for the symptom severity reduction outcome was to facilitate comparison of the effect sizes for the pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy trials. It was subsequently decided not to conduct this comparison, given doubts regarding the validity of conclusions regarding the relative efficacy of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy based on indirect comparison and the small number of trials involved. </P>
<P>The WHO international clinical trials registry platform (ICTRP) search portal (http://www.who.int/trialsearch) has been added to the section describing the method employed in identifying unpublished and ongoing studies (Search methods for identification of studies - electronic searches). </P>
