<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-15 20:30:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A substantial proportion of women who have an episode of threatened preterm labour (before 37 weeks) are actively treated with agents that stop the uterine contractions (tocolytic therapy) and they do not progress to give birth. After being successfully treated for an episode of threatened preterm birth, women may then take medication (tocolytics) to prolong gestation so that their baby is not born too early. Medications used for this purpose include betamimetics, magnesium sulphate, calcium channel blockers and COX inhibitors.</P>
<P>Oral betamimetics for maintenance therapy after threatened preterm labour do not prevent preterm labour. This conclusion is based on 13 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1551 women. In this review, the betamimetics ritodrine and terbutaline did not reduce the rate of preterm birth (eight trials), or prevent problems with babies that required admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (two trials), when compared with placebo, no treatment or other tocolytic drugs. Betamimetics may cause pregnant women to have an increased heart rate (palpitations) and rate of breathing, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, and high blood sugar concentrations as side effects.</P>

<P>We did not identify any new trials from the updated search so the results remain unchanged as follows.</P>
<P>We included 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1551 women. We found no differences for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit when betamimetics were compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 2.41; two RCTs of terbutaline with 2600 women) or with magnesium (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.46; one RCT of 137 women). The rate of preterm birth (less than 37 weeks) showed no significant difference in six RCTs, four comparing ritodrine with placebo/no treatment and two comparing terbutaline with placebo/no treatment (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.35; 644 women). We observed no differences between betamimetics and placebo, no treatment or other tocolytics for perinatal mortality and morbidity outcomes. Some adverse effects such as tachycardia were more frequent in the betamimetics groups than the groups allocated to placebo, no treatment or another type of tocolytic.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-15 20:32:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm birth occurs before 37 completed weeks' gestation and may arise from spontaneous preterm labour or from a decision to end the pregnancy early due to concerns regarding maternal or fetal wellbeing. Preterm birth is the principal cause of early neonatal mortality and causes both significant immediate morbidity and substantial long-term morbidity in a proportion of survivors. Prevention of preterm birth remains a goal in obstetrics, and a variety of therapeutic tocolytic agents have been used to inhibit preterm labour (<LINK REF="REF-Keirse-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keirse 1989</LINK>). Tocolytic drugs act through a variety of mechanisms to relax the uterus and prevent uterine contractions. While tocolytic drugs have been shown to reduce the occurrence of preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Anotayanonth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anotayanonth 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1988</LINK>), this has not translated into a reduction in adverse perinatal outcomes, such as low birthweight, respiratory complications or perinatal death (<LINK REF="REF-Gyetvai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyetvai 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keirse-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keirse 1995a</LINK>). A variety of tocolytic drugs have been used to inhibit preterm labour, including betamimetics (such as salbutamol or terbutaline), calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine (<LINK REF="REF-King-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2003</LINK>)) and COX inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-King-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Betamimetic drugs have side effects for the woman and, as they are able to cross the placenta, may affect the infant (<LINK REF="REF-Gyetvai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyetvai 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keirse-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keirse 1995a</LINK>). Adverse effects for the woman include tachycardia (increased heart rate), tachypnoea (increased rate of breathing), hypotension (low blood pressure), nausea and vomiting, hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels) and pulmonary oedema (fluid accumulation in the lungs) (<LINK REF="REF-Gyetvai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyetvai 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keirse-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keirse 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>A substantial proportion of women who have an episode of threatened preterm labour and are actively treated with intravenous tocolytic therapy do not progress to giving birth. For these women, the use of oral tocolytic maintenance medication (usually taken daily for a variable period of time after the initial episode of threatened preterm labour has settled) has been advocated to reduce the risk of recurrence of preterm labour and to prolong gestation to prevent preterm birth. Different forms of maintenance therapy have been suggested, including betamimetics (<LINK REF="REF-Nanda-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nanda 2002</LINK>), magnesium sulphate (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 1998</LINK>), calcium channel blockers (<LINK REF="REF-Gaunekar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaunekar 2004</LINK>) and COX inhibitors. This review examines the evidence for oral betamimetic maintenance therapy.<BR/>

<P>We included 13 randomised trials describing a total of 1551 women in this review. Ten studies were from the United States of America, one from the Netherlands (<LINK REF="STD-Holleboom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Holleboom 1996</LINK>), one from Japan (<LINK REF="STD-Sakamoto-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Sakamoto 1985</LINK>), and one from Croatia (<LINK REF="STD-Matijevic-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Matijevic 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ten trials of 1307 women examined maintenance therapy for threatened preterm labour with betamimetics versus placebo or no treatment. Five of these trials used the betamimetic terbutaline (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-How-1995" TYPE="STUDY">How 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parilla-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Parilla 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rust-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Rust 1996</LINK>), while five trials used ritodrine (<LINK REF="STD-Creasy-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Creasy 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holleboom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Holleboom 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matijevic-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Matijevic 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ricci-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ricci 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sakamoto-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Sakamoto 1985</LINK>).

<P>We excluded nine studies because the interventions did not meet the predefined criteria for inclusion in the review.

We excluded one study because the betamimetic for maintenance therapy was administered intravenously (<LINK REF="STD-Beall-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Beall 1985</LINK>), one because the betamimetic was given intramuscularly (<LINK REF="STD-Caritis-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Caritis 1984</LINK>) and one study compared long- and short-acting formulations of the same betamimetic (<LINK REF="STD-Hagay-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hagay 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>We excluded one study (<LINK REF="STD-Martin-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1988</LINK>) because the allocation of the women to treatment and control groups was according to staff preference. Thus the trial was not a randomised controlled trial.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Levy-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 1985</LINK> reported on the management of prelabour rupture of membranes with betamimetics, rather than premature labour, and thus we excluded this study from the review.</P>
<P>The outcomes measured by <LINK REF="STD-Penney-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Penney 1980</LINK> were not prespecified in the protocol as 'Types of outcomes measured' and therefore we have not included this study in the review.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-02-16 22:49:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Results from this review do not support the use of oral betamimetic maintenance therapy after threatened preterm labour. When betamimetics were compared to placebo or no treatment, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors or magnesium, we observed no differences in the incidence of preterm birth or for most of the other outcomes except for some adverse effects, such as tachycardia. No results were available for women's views and measures of satisfaction or costs. Although the trials were relatively small, the results were relatively consistent between trials and the various comparisons.<BR/>
<BR/>Systematic reviews have reported some benefit in the use of betamimetics to arrest preterm labour, in particular to delay birth and thus decrease the frequency of preterm birth and low birthweight (<LINK REF="REF-Anotayanonth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anotayanonth 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-King-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1988</LINK>). However, reviews assessing the use of various forms of maintenance tocolytic therapy have generally concluded there to be no benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gaunekar-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaunekar 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macones-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macones 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meirowitz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meirowitz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nanda-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nanda 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanchez_x002d_Ramos-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez-Ramos 1999</LINK>). A large number of obstetricians surveyed in Belgium and Holland reported that they would use betamimetics to prevent relapses after an acute episode had been overcome, as well as for prophylactic prevention of preterm labour (<LINK REF="REF-Keirse-1984a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keirse 1984a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keirse-1984b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keirse 1984b</LINK>) and it is likely that many hospitals are still using betamimetics for maintenance therapy.</P>
<P>It has been proposed that in efforts to prevent preterm labour, or maintain resolution of an acute episode of preterm labour, attention should be paid to understanding and treating the risk factors and causes of preterm labour. This may include treatment of vaginal infections and anaemia, and management of social issues such as nutrition, smoking, depression and maternal age (<LINK REF="REF-Keirse-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keirse 1995b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Oral betamimetics as maintenance therapy after an episode of threatened preterm labour have not been shown to reduce the chance of a woman giving birth early; and they are associated with an increased chance of adverse effects for the woman.</P>

<P>Available evidence does not support the use of oral betamimetics for maintenance therapy after threatened preterm labour.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-01-24 09:22:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Given the lack of beneficial effects demonstrated in the use of oral betamimetic therapy to reduce the chances of a woman giving birth preterm, and the risk of maternal adverse effects, research efforts should be directed towards other interventions that may reduce the occurrence of preterm birth. However, should future betamimetic maintenance studies be contemplated, outcome measures should include:</P>
<OL>
<LI>very preterm birth (less than 34 weeks' gestation);</LI>
<LI>low birthweight (less than 2500 g);</LI>
<LI>neonatal mortality or serious neonatal or infant morbidity;</LI>
<LI>maternal death, or serious maternal morbidity.</LI>

<P>Two review authors evaluated the potentially eligible trials against the selection criteria, with any discrepancies resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>We assigned quality scores for concealment of allocation using the criteria described in Section six of the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>).<BR/>A = adequate; B = unclear; C = inadequate; D = not used.</P>
<P>We also assessed completeness of follow up and blinding (of investigators, women or outcome assessors).</P>
<P>Two authors separately extracted and double-entered the data. We resolved discrepancies by discussion. There was no blinding of authorship. Categorical data were compared using relative risks and 95% confidence intervals using a fixed-effect model. Analyses were based on intention to treat principles. Sensitivity analyses were planned to evaluate the effect of trial quality. Statistical heterogeneity across trial results was evaluated using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic.</P>
<P>We planned to conduct the following subgroup analyses:</P>
<OL>
<LI>dosage administered;</LI>
<LI>type of betamimetic agent;</LI>
<LI>gestational age maintenance therapy given;</LI>
<LI>type of therapy (other tocolytic agent) in control group.</LI>
</OL>
<P>However, there were insufficient data to do this in a meaningful way.</P>
