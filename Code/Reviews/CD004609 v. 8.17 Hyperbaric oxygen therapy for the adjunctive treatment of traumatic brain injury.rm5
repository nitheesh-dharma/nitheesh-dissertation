<TITLE>Does hyperbaric oxygen therapy improve the survival and quality of life in patients with traumatic brain injury?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-16 16:22:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>Traumatic brain injury is a major cause of death and disability. Not all damage to the brain occurs at the moment of injury; a reduction of the blood flow and oxygen supply to the brain can occur afterwards and cause further secondary brain damage that is itself an important cause of avoidable death and disability. In the early stages after injury, it is therefore important that efforts are made to minimise secondary brain damage to provide the best chances of recovery.</P>
<P>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been proposed as a treatment for minimising secondary brain damage by improving the oxygen supply to the brain. Patients undergoing HBOT are placed inside a specially designed chamber in which 100% oxygen is delivered at a greater than normal atmospheric pressure. It is sometimes used as a treatment to increase the supply of oxygen to the injured brain in an attempt to reduce the area of brain that will die.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of HBOT on the recovery of brain-injured patients is uncertain. There is also concern regarding potential adverse effects of the therapy, including damage to the ears, sinuses and lungs from the effects of pressure, temporary worsening of short-sightedness, claustrophobia and oxygen poisoning.</P>
<P>In an attempt to address the uncertainty surrounding the use of HBOT, the authors of this review identified all studies which were randomied controlled trials investigating the effects of HBOT in traumatically brain-injured people of all ages.</P>
<P>The authors found seven eligible studies involving 571 people. The combined results suggest that HBOT reduces the risk of death and improves the level of coma; however, there is no evidence that these survivors have an improved outcome in terms of quality of life. It is possible, therefore, that the overall effect of hyperbaric oxygen is to make it more likely that people will survive with severe disability after such injuries. The authors conclude that the routine use of HBOT in brain-injured patients cannot be justified by the findings of this review.</P>
<P>Due to the small number of trials with a limited number of people, it is not possible to be confident in the findings. Further large, high quality trials are required to define the true extent of benefit from HBOT.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-08-08 11:58:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>Traumatic brain injury is a common health problem with significant effect on quality of life. Each year in the USA approximately 0.56% of the population suffer a head injury, with a case fatality rate of about 40% for severe injuries. These account for a high proportion of deaths in young adults. In the USA, 2% of the population live with long-term disabilities following head injuries. The major causes are motor vehicle crashes, falls, and violence (including attempted suicide). Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is the therapeutic administration of 100% oxygen at environmental pressures greater than 1 atmosphere absolute (ATA). This involves placing the patient in an airtight vessel, increasing the pressure within that vessel, and administering 100% oxygen for respiration. In this way, it is possible to deliver a greatly increased partial pressure of oxygen to the tissues. HBOT can improve oxygen supply to the injured brain, reduce the swelling associated with low oxygen levels and reduce the volume of brain that will ultimately perish. It is, therefore, possible that adding HBOT to the standard intensive care regimen may reduce patient death and disability. However, a concern for patients and families is that using HBOT may result in preventing a patient from dying only to leave them in a vegetative state, entirely dependent on medical care. There are also some potential adverse effects of the therapy, including damage to the ears, sinuses and lungs from the effects of the pressure and oxygen poisoning, so the benefits and risks of the therapy need to be carefully evaluated.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-16 22:28:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>Seven studies are included in this review, involving 571 people (285 receiving HBOT and 286 in the control group). The results of two studies indicate use of HBOT results in a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of people with an unfavourable outcome one month after treatment using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) (relative risk (RR) for unfavourable outcome with HBOT 0.74, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88, P = 0.001). This five-point scale rates the outcome from one (dead) to five (good recovery); an 'unfavourable' outcome was considered as a score of one, two or three. Pooled data from final follow-up showed a significant reduction in the risk of dying when HBOT was used (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.88, P = 0.003) and suggests we would have to treat seven patients to avoid one extra death (number needed to treat (NNT) 7, 95% CI 4 to 22). Two trials suggested favourably lower intracranial pressure in people receiving HBOT and in whom myringotomies had been performed. The results from one study suggested a mean difference (MD) with myringotomy of -8.2 mmHg (95% CI -14.7 to -1.7 mmHg, P = 0.01). The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) has a total of 15 points, and two small trials reported a significant improvement in GCS for patients treated with HBOT (MD 2.68 points, 95%CI 1.84 to 3.52, P &lt; 0.0001), although these two trials showed considerable heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 83%). Two studies reported an incidence of 13% for significant pulmonary impairment in the HBOT group versus 0% in the non-HBOT group (P = 0.007).</P>
<P>In general, the studies were small and carried a significant risk of bias. None described adequate randomisation procedures or allocation concealment, and none of the patients or treating staff were blinded to treatment.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-11-16 16:21:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>In people with traumatic brain injury, while the addition of HBOT may reduce the risk of death and improve the final GCS, there is little evidence that the survivors have a good outcome. The improvement of 2.68 points in GCS is difficult to interpret. This scale runs from three (deeply comatose and unresponsive) to 15 (fully conscious), and the clinical importance of an improvement of approximately three points will vary dramatically with the starting value (for example an improvement from 12 to 15 would represent an important clinical benefit, but an improvement from three to six would leave the patient with severe and highly dependent impairment). The routine application of HBOT to these patients cannot be justified from this review. Given the modest number of patients, methodological shortcomings of included trials and poor reporting, the results should be interpreted cautiously. An appropriately powered trial of high methodological rigour is required to define which patients, if any, can be expected to benefit most from HBOT.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-11-16 16:44:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-11-16 16:44:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of premature death and disability. Despite the deployment of increasingly sophisticated therapy at the scene (including early intubation) and increased monitoring in hospital, the mortality rate remains at about 40% in severe TBI (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1999</LINK>). A meta-analysis of studies on severe TBI in 2010 confirmed that case fatality rates have not decreased since 1990 (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2010</LINK>). Each year, there are at least 10 million new head injuries worldwide and these account for a high proportion of deaths in young adults (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thurman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thurman 1999</LINK>). In the USA there are more than 50,000 deaths due to traumatic brain injury each year, and a recent population-based survey in the USA estimated the incidence rate per 100,000 person-years at 558, or 0.56% (95% confidence interval (CI) 528 to 590) (<LINK REF="REF-Leibson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leibson 2011</LINK>). The major causes of TBI in high income countries are motor vehicle crashes (50%), falls (38%) and violence (including attempted suicide) (4%) (figures from a prospective survey in the Netherlands, <LINK REF="REF-Adriessen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adriessen 2011</LINK>). Prevention strategies, including restraints for vehicle occupants, are now legally enforced in many countries. However, while road death rates are falling in most industrialised countries they are rising in many rapidly motorising countries, particularly in Asia. For example, road death rates per head in China are already similar to those in the USA, although far fewer people own motor vehicles (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1995</LINK>). Head injuries are associated with long-term disability in many patients. In the USA, for example, 2% of the population (a total of 5.3 million people) are living with disability as a result of TBI (<LINK REF="REF-Thurman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thurman 1999</LINK>) and this places considerable medical, social and financial burden on both families and health systems (<LINK REF="REF-Fearnside-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fearnside 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pathophysiology of brain injury has a primary and secondary component. At the time of impact there is a variable degree of irreversible damage to the neurological tissue (primary injury). Following this, a chain of events occurs in which there is ongoing injury to the brain through oedema, hypoxia and ischaemia secondary to raised tissue or intracranial pressure, release of excitotoxic levels of excitatory neurotransmitters (for example glutamate) and impaired calcium homeostasis (<LINK REF="REF-Fiskum-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiskum 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tymianski-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tymianski 1996</LINK>) (secondary injury).</P>
<P>Therapy focuses on prevention or minimisation of secondary injury by ensuring adequate oxygenation, haemodynamics, control of intracranial hypertension, and strategies to reduce cellular injury. A number of therapies, including barbiturates, calcium channel antagonists, steroids, hyperventilation, mannitol, hypothermia and anticonvulsants have been the topic of previous Cochrane reviews, though none has shown unequivocal efficacy in reducing poor outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langham-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langham 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schierhout-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schierhout 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sydenham-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sydenham 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-11-16 16:23:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a further adjunctive therapy that has been proposed to improve outcomes in acute brain injury. HBOT is the therapeutic administration of 100% oxygen at environmental pressures greater than 1 atmosphere absolute (ATA). This involves placing the patient in an airtight vessel, increasing the pressure within that vessel, and administering 100% oxygen for respiration. In this way, it is possible to deliver a greatly increased partial pressure of oxygen to the tissues. Typically, treatments involve pressurisation to between 1.5 and 3.0 ATA, for periods between 60 and 120 minutes, one or more times daily.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-11-16 16:23:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the 1960s, there have been reports that HBOT improves outcomes following brain trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Fasano-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fasano 1964</LINK>). Administration of HBOT is based on the observation that hypoxia following closed head trauma is an integral part of the secondary injury described above. Hypoxic neurons performing anaerobic metabolism results in acidosis and an unsustainable reduction in cellular metabolic reserve (<LINK REF="REF-Muizelaar-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muizelaar 1989</LINK>). As the hypoxic situation persists, the neurons lose their ability to maintain ionic homeostasis, and free oxygen radicals accumulate and degrade cell membranes (<LINK REF="REF-Ikeda-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ikeda 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siesjo-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siesjo 1989</LINK>). Eventually, irreversible changes result in unavoidable cell death. When ischaemia is severe enough, these changes occur rapidly, but there is some evidence that the effects can occur over a period of days (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1989</LINK>). This gives some basis to the assertion that a therapy designed to increase oxygen availability in the early period following TBI may improve long-term outcomes. HBOT is also thought to reduce tissue oedema by an osmotic effect (<LINK REF="REF-Hills-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hills 1999</LINK>), and any agent that has a positive effect on brain swelling following trauma might also contribute to improved outcomes. On the other hand, oxygen in high doses is potentially toxic to normally perfused tissue, and the brain is particularly at risk (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1982</LINK>). For this reason, it is appropriate to postulate that in some TBI patients HBOT may do more harm, through the action of increased free oxygen radical damage, than good through the restoration of aerobic metabolism.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-08-08 12:16:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Despite 40 years of interest in the delivery of HBOT in TBI patients, little clinical evidence of effectiveness exists. HBOT has been shown to reduce both intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) in brain-injured patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hayakawa-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayakawa 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sukoff-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sukoff 1982</LINK>), improve grey matter metabolic activity on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan (<LINK REF="REF-Neubauer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neubauer 1994</LINK>) and improve glucose metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Holbach-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holbach 1977</LINK>). Some studies suggest that any effect of HBOT may not be uniform across all brain-injured patients. For example, Hayakawa demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) rebounded to higher levels following HBOT than at pre-treatment estimation in some patients, while others showed persistent reductions (<LINK REF="REF-Hayakawa-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayakawa 1971</LINK>). It is possible that HBOT has a positive effect in a subgroup of patients with moderate injury but not in those with extensive cerebral injury. Furthermore, repeated exposure to hyperbaric oxygen may be required to attain consistent changes (<LINK REF="REF-Artru-1976a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Artru 1976a</LINK>). Clinical reports have attributed a wide range of improvements to the utilisation of HBOT including cognitive and motor skills, improved attention span and increased verbalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Neubauer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neubauer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sukoff-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sukoff 1982</LINK>). These improvements are, however, difficult to ascribe to any single treatment modality because HBOT was most often applied in conjunction with intensive supportive and rehabilitative therapies.</P>
<P>HBOT is associated with some risk of adverse effects, including damage to the ears, sinuses and lungs from the effects of pressure, temporary worsening of short-sightedness, claustrophobia and oxygen poisoning. Although serious adverse events are rare, HBOT cannot be regarded as an entirely benign intervention. Further, it is conceivable that the addition of HBOT might improve survival from serious brain injury without improving the proportion of those who survive with a useful functional level, while at the same time increasing overall costs of therapy. For a number of reasons, therefore, the administration of HBOT for TBI patients remains controversial.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this review is to assess the evidence for the benefit or harm of adjunctive HBOT in the treatment of acute TBI. We compared intensive treatment regimens including adjunctive HBOT against similar regimens excluding HBOT. Where regimens differed significantly between studies, this is clearly stated and the implications discussed. </P>

<P>Using the data extraction form developed for this review, each author extracted relevant data and this was compared and discussed until consensus was achieved and a recommendation made for inclusion or exclusion from the review. We entered details in a risk of bias table for each included study, indicating the method of allocation, adequacy of concealment of allocation, blinding status of participants and outcome observers, and how patient attrition was handled. We considered these factors for possible sensitivity analysis. All data extracted reflected the original allocation group, where possible, to allow an intention-to-treat analysis.

A statistically significant difference between the experimental intervention and control intervention was assumed if the 95% CI of the RR did not include the value 1.0.

<P>The included trials were published between 1974 (<LINK REF="STD-Holbach-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Holbach 1974</LINK>) and 2010 (<LINK REF="STD-Mao-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mao 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 2010</LINK>), and the review authors are aware of a further trial being organised by Rockswold based on the information obtained from that group's most recent trial. In total, these trials included data on 571 participants, 285 receiving HBOT and 286 control (see table '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>').</P>
<P>The dose of oxygen per treatment session and for the total course of treatment varied between studies. The lowest dose administered was 1.5 ATA for 60 minutes daily (<LINK REF="STD-Holbach-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Holbach 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 2010</LINK>) while the highest dose was 2.5 ATA for 40 to 60 minutes 10 times in four days (<LINK REF="STD-Ren-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Ren 2001a</LINK>). All authors used between 1.5 and 2.5 ATA as the maximum oxygen pressure. The total number of individual treatment sessions varied from three (<LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 2010</LINK>) to between 30 and 40 (<LINK REF="STD-Ren-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Ren 2001a</LINK>).</P>
<P>No trial administered a sham treatment and only <LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 1992</LINK> attempted any concealment by blinding the outcome assessor.

Specific exclusion criteria varied between trials but open head injuries and participants with other than isolated head trauma were excluded when any criteria were specified.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Patient baseline characteristics</HEADING>
<P>All patients had suffered a head injury. Three of the studies closely defined the entry criteria as those patients with an isolated, closed head injury and a specified GCS: <LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 1992</LINK> (GCS &lt; 10), <LINK REF="STD-Ren-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Ren 2001a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 2010</LINK> (GCS &lt; 9), <LINK REF="STD-Xie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Xie 2007</LINK> (GCS 3 to 12). All trials enrolled patients with acute TBI, but only <LINK REF="STD-Xie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Xie 2007</LINK> stated the time between injury and enrolment (24 hours). <LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 1992</LINK> mentioned a case enrolled at day 29 following acute clinical deterioration such as to satisfy the entry criteria. <LINK REF="STD-Artru-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Artru 1976</LINK> assessed injury severity according to a scale described by <LINK REF="REF-Jouvet-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jouvet 1960</LINK> and reported that there was no statistical difference in the mean score between groups (HBOT group mean 9.39, control mean 9.59). We have not been able to review the characteristics of this scale. <LINK REF="STD-Holbach-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Holbach 1974</LINK> admitted comatose patients but did not state a specific measure of injury severity or the period of time prior to enrolment. Holbach described the patients as having 'mid-brain symptomatology' but did not define this term, while Artru stratified patients on enrolment to one of nine categories (brain stem contusion, bilateral frontal contusion, acute subdural haematoma, frontotemporal contusion, infratemporal haematoma, epidural haematoma, hydrocephaly, subdural hygroma and cribriform plate defect). <LINK REF="STD-Holbach-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Holbach 1974</LINK> excluded patients who died within the first 48 hours, but it is not clear whether these patients were enrolled and then withdrawn or were simply ineligible for entry.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>Neither the participants (who were unaware of their surroundings) nor treating staff were blinded as to allocation, and no study employed a sham hyperbaric exposure. <LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 1992</LINK> calculated GOS for each participant using a neurologist who was unaware of the treatment group to which the patient was allocated.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Patients lost to follow-up</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 1992</LINK> reported that two participants were lost to follow-up from the control group, and these participants did not appear in the analysis. None of the remaining studies suffered any losses to follow-up or reported any violation of allocated treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Artru-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Artru 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holbach-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Holbach 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ren-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Ren 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Xie 2007</LINK>). However, Ren stated that participants who died were excluded from the study (numbers not given). It is not clear if these participants were entered and then excluded or all died before enrolment on day three. Sensitivity analysis in this review involved making best and worse case analyses to examine potentially important effects on outcome where the Rockswold study contributed patients.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 1992</LINK> specifically described participants who did not receive HBOT as being analysed in the intended group, but participants lost to follow-up were excluded from analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 2010</LINK> analysed patients by intention to treat even when HBOT could not be given.

Three trials reported this outcome at some time (<LINK REF="STD-Holbach-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Holbach 1974</LINK> at 12 days, <LINK REF="STD-Artru-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Artru 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 1992</LINK> at 12 months) whilst <LINK REF="STD-Xie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Xie 2007</LINK> reported that all patients reached final follow-up at 10 days. These trials involved 387 participants (87.6% of the total); 194 (50%) were randomised to standard therapy plus HBOT and 193 to standard therapy alone. <LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 1992</LINK> contributed 51% of the participants to this analysis. There was a significantly reduced chance of dying in the HBOT group. The RR of dying if given HBOT was 0.69 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.88, P = 0.003). Heterogeneity between studies was low (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) and there was no significant effect exerted by allocation of participants who dropped out of the Rockswold trial (best case RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.89; worst case RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.87). The absolute risk difference of 15% was significant and the NNT to avoid one death by applying HBOT was 7 (95% CI 4 to 22).</P>

Twelve patients from <LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 1992</LINK> did not contribute data to this analysis, five in the standard care plus HBOT group and seven receiving standard care alone. The result was complicated by a change in the protocol during the conduct of <LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 1992</LINK>. The results could not be pooled because <LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 2010</LINK> did not report standard deviations for the measured differences in intracranial pressure (ICP). For <LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 1992</LINK>, while overall there was no difference in the mean maximum ICP between the two groups (MD 4.2 mmHg lower with HBOT, 95% CI -9.4 to +0.9 mmHg), the authors noted higher than expected ICP in the HBOT patients and performed pre-treatment myringotomy in the last 46 participants in the HBOT group (data analysed for 42). Comparing the standard care alone group with the HBOT participants with and without myringotomy, there was a significant lowering of ICP with HBOT plus myringotomy (MD with myringotomy -8.20 mmHg, 95% CI -14.68 to -1.72 mmHg, P = 0.01; without myringotomy MD +2.7 mmHg, 95% CI -5.87 to +11.27 mmHg, P = 0.54).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 2010</LINK> reported a mean drop in ICP following HBOT of 0.25 mmHg and an increase over the same period in the standard treatment group of 0.67 mmHg, and reported this difference to be statistically significant (P = 0.001).</P>

Overall, therefore, 15 patients (13% of those receiving HBOT) had severe pulmonary complications while no such complications were reported in the standard therapy arm. This difference was significant (RR 15.57, 95% CI 2.11 to 114.72, P = 0.007).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-14 17:58:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>We found no evidence that HBOT improves functional outcome or ability to perform activities of daily living following severe head injury, although the evidence does suggest an improvement in survival with the use of HBOT. The only two trials measuring the proportion of patients with functional outcomes in the short term were both reported in the 1970s (<LINK REF="STD-Holbach-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Holbach 1974</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Artru-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Artru 1976</LINK>), and together suggest increased unfavourable outcomes with HBOT (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88; P = 0.001). Pooled analysis of functional outcome at one year and drawing on two further studies do not suggest any advantage from HBOT (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.03; P = 0.07). </P>
<P>The two trials looking at ICP as a proxy for beneficial effects also suggest that ICP was lower immediately following HBOT when patients had received myringotomy tubes. These tubes avoid middle ear barotrauma on compression, a highly painful and stimulating condition that might be expected to raise ICP regardless of the underlying brain injury. Indeed, in Rockswold 1992 the treatment protocol was altered to include myringotomy because of the unexpected finding of increased ICP in the HBOT group. The ICP of the subsequent patients that received HBOT was 8.2 mmHg lower and this difference is of potential clinical importance given that the normal ICP is 7 to 15 mmHg and pressures of 20 to 25 mmHg require urgent treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Steiner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 2006</LINK>). Two trials also suggested that the Glasgow Coma Score was significantly improved following HBOT, but did not report any functional assessment. A subgroup analysis by study pressure did not suggest any significant advantage in outcome whether a higher (2.5 ATA) or lower (1.5 ATA) pressure was used. Given the high heterogeneity between trials, this result should be interpreted with extreme caution.</P>
<P>More convincingly, the risk of death in the HBOT group was significantly lower than in the control group (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.88). This analysis suggests that we would need to treat seven patients with HBOT in order to avoid one death (NNT 7, 95% CI 4 to 22) and was not sensitive to the allocation of dropouts. Given the small number of participants and generally poor quality of these trials, this result needs to be interpreted with caution. Taken together, however, these two primary outcome analyses suggest that while survival may be positively influenced by the addition of HBOT, there is little to suggest these patients have better functional outcomes.</P>
<P>The two trials measuring GCS as an outcome also suggested an improvement following HBOT but they analysed these data from a nominal scale as if it were a continuous variable, by comparing the mean value in the two groups. It is not clear that this approach is appropriate and the outcome is difficult to interpret clinically. This scale runs from three (deeply comatose and unresponsive) to 15 (fully conscious), and the clinical importance of an improvement of approximately three points will vary dramatically with the starting value (for example an improvement from 12 to 15 would represent an important clinical benefit, but an improvement from three to six would leave the patient with a severe and highly dependent impairment remaining).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-08-08 13:40:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>This review has included data from seven trials, and we believe these represent all randomised human trials in this area, both published and unpublished, at the time of searching the databases.</P>
<P>As is common with small trials, the incidence of adverse effects was poorly assessed by the studies included in this review. <LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Artru-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Artru 1976</LINK> reported a 13% incidence of severe pulmonary compromise with the application of HBOT (NNH 8, 95% CI 5 to 15). However, the other five trials did not report any such cases. It is not clear if this constitutes a true difference in incidence or a publication bias. HBOT is regarded as a relatively benign intervention. There are few major adverse effects (pulmonary barotrauma, drug reactions, injuries or death related to chamber fire) and the report of a 13% incidence of significant pulmonary compromise is surprising and may indicate a complication associated specifically with severe head injury when exposed to hyperbaric oxygen.</P>
<P>There are a number of more minor complications that may commonly occur. Visual disturbance, usually a reduction in visual acuity secondary to conformational changes in the lens, is very commonly reported; perhaps as many as 50% of those having a course of 30 treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2003</LINK>). While most patients recover spontaneously over a period of days to weeks, a small proportion of patients continue to require correction to restore sight to pre-treatment levels. None of the trials included in this review reported visual changes. The second most common adverse effect associated with HBOT is aural barotrauma. Barotrauma can affect any air-filled cavity in the body (including the middle ear, lungs and respiratory sinuses) and occurs as a direct result of compression. Aural barotrauma is by far the most common as the middle ear air space is small, largely surrounded by bone and the sensitive tympanic membrane, and it usually requires active effort by the patient in order to inflate the middle ear through the eustachian tube on each side. Barotrauma is thus not a consequence of HBOT directly but rather of the physical conditions required to administer it. Most episodes of barotrauma are mild, easily treated or recover spontaneously and do not require the therapy to be abandoned. Only Rockswold reported any cases of middle ear barotrauma (two in the HBOT arm). Less commonly, HBOT may be associated with acute neurological toxicity manifesting as seizure. Again, Rockswold reported two such occurrences in the HBOT arm.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-08-08 13:43:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>Only seven trials with 571 participants were available for evaluation using our planned comparisons, and meta-analysis was not appropriate or possible for a number of these. Other problems for this review were the poor methodological quality of many of these trials; variability in entry criteria and the nature and timing of outcomes; and poor reporting of both outcomes and methodology. In particular, there is a possibility of bias due to different mechanisms and severity of injury on entry to these small trials, as well as from non-blinded management decisions in all trials. We had planned a sensitivity analysis based on the presence or absence of allocation concealment but no trials were reliably concealed in this regard.</P>
<P>These trials were published over a 36-year period, up to 2010, and from a wide geographical area. We had planned to perform subgroup analyses with respect to age, dose of oxygen received (pressure, time and length of treatment course), nature of the comparative treatment modalities, severity of injury, and the nature of injury on CT scan. However, the paucity of eligible trials and poor reporting suggested that the majority of these analyses would not be informative, and we only performed subgroup analysis with respect to treatment pressure for the proportion of individuals achieving a good outcome at any time. Patient inclusion criteria were not standard, and poorly reported in some trials. No standard severity index was employed uniformly across these trials, no standard injury pattern was established, and only <LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rockswold-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rockswold 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Xie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Xie 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mao-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mao 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ren-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Ren 2001a</LINK> described the time at which the inclusion criteria were applied. There was significant variation both in oxygen dose during an individual treatment session and in the number of sessions administered to each patient. While subgroup analysis by treatment pressure suggested that those treated at 2.5 ATA did significantly better than those treated at 1.5 ATA, this result should be treated with extreme caution given the heterogeneity between the lower pressure trials and the observation that the estimated risk of a poor outcome was actually lower in the low pressure group. While all trials used some form of 'standard' intensive therapy, these comparator therapies were generally poorly described and could not form the basis for a meaningful subgroup analysis.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-08-08 13:43:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>All of these findings are subject to a potential publication bias. While we have made every effort to locate further unpublished data, it remains possible that this review is subject to a positive publication bias, with generally favourable trials more likely to achieve reporting. With regard to long-term outcomes following HBOT and any effect on the quality of life for these patients, we have not located any relevant data.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-08-09 14:59:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>A search revealed six publications reviewing the evidence for hyperbaric oxygen therapy in acute traumatic brain injury since 2000. All were in broad agreement with our findings. An early systematic review undertaken by the Alternative Therapy Evaluation Committee for the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia concluded "the scientific literature up to August 2001 does not support the use of hyperbaric oxygen for traumatic brain injuries...." (<LINK REF="REF-Alternative-Therapy-Committee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alternative Therapy Committee 2003</LINK>). Later reviews have given guarded support to HBOT, with recommendations for further high-quality trials in this area. A systematic review without meta-analysis in 2004 concluded there was insufficient evidence to recommend HBOT for acute brain injury without better evidence (<LINK REF="REF-McDonagh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonagh 2004</LINK>). Qualitative reviews from the Rockswold group and others have all made similar conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Adamides-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamides 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ali-Wali-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ali Wali 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rockswold-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockswold 2007</LINK>), while the most recent review relied heavily on the conclusions from our own review (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2010</LINK>).</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-08-08 13:47:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-08-08 13:46:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>There is limited evidence that HBOT reduces the chance of dying and improves the GCS following a traumatic brain injury. Although there is some evidence of improvements in GCS, there is little evidence that more survivors have a good outcome. Thus, the routine adjunctive use of HBOT in these patients cannot be justified by this review. The small number of studies, the modest numbers of patients, and the methodological and reporting inadequacies of the primary studies included in this review demand a cautious interpretation of the findings.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-08-08 13:47:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Given the findings of improved survival and GCS with the use of HBOT in acute traumatic head injury, there is a case for large randomised trials of high methodological rigour in order to define the true extent of benefit from the administration of HBOT. Specifically, more information is required on the subset of disease severity or classification most likely to benefit from this therapy, and the oxygen dose that is most appropriate. Any future trials would need to consider in particular:<BR/>
