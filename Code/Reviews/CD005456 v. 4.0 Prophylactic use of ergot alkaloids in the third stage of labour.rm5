<TITLE>Active management of third stage of labour with ergot alkaloid drugs (e.g. ergometrine)</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-07-07 14:25:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The third stage of labour is the period from birth of the baby to the expulsion of the placenta and membranes. As the placenta separates, there is inevitably some blood loss from the placental site until the muscles of the uterus clamp the blood vessels. Fit, healthy women cope with this normal blood loss without problems, but where poor nutrition, poor sanitation and limited or no access to clinical care are complications of pregnancy, severe morbidity and mortality can result from excessive blood loss at birth. This is very common in low- and middle-income countries. Active intervention, called 'active management of third stage', is recommended for the third stage of labour to reduce excess blood loss. Active intervention incorporates (1) the administration of a uterotonic drug, given either just before or just after the baby is born to help the muscles of the uterus contract; (2) early cord clamping; and (3) the use of controlled cord traction to deliver the placenta. This review of studies looked at the use of one group of uterotonic drugs called ergot alkaloids, e.g. ergometrine, as part of this active management. The review found six trials involving 3941 women receiving ergometrine by mouth (orally), into the muscle (intramuscularly (IM)) or into the vein (intravenously (IV)). Evidence indicates that the oral route was not very effective. The IV route, although it reduced blood loss, was associated with the adverse effects of raised blood pressure and pain due to uterine contraction, and so is unlikely to be used. The IM route showed benefit in terms of reducing blood loss, and although there were adverse effects similar to those associated with the IV route, these were less common. So, while the ergot alkaloid group of drugs given IM is an option, there are other drugs, namely oxytocin, syntometrine and prostaglandins (which are assessed in other Cochrane reviews), that can be used and may be preferable.</P>

<P>We included six studies, comparing ergot alkaloids with no uterotonic agents, with a total of 1996 women in the ergot alkaloids group and 1945 women in the placebo or no treatment group. The use of injected ergot alkaloids in the third stage of labour significantly decreased mean blood loss (mean difference (MD) -83.03 ml, 95% confidence interval (CI) -99.39 to -66.66 ml), postpartum haemorrhage of at least 500 ml (risk ratio (RR) 0.38, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.69) and the use of therapeutic uterotonics (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.66). The risk of retained placenta or manual removal of the placenta, or both, were inconsistent. Ergot alkaloids significantly increased the risk of elevated blood pressure (RR 2.60, 95% CI 1.03 to 6.57) and pain after birth requiring analgesia (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.78) but not in vomiting, nausea, headache or eclamptic fit. One study compared oral ergometrine with placebo and showed no significant benefit of ergometrine over placebo. No maternal adverse effects were reported. There were no included trials that compared different administration regimens of ergot alkaloids.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-08-15 15:38:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The third stage of labour is defined as the period of labour from birth of the baby to the expulsion or extraction of the placenta and membranes. Placental separation involves capillary haemorrhage and shearing of decidua spongiosa because of the mechanical action of uterine contraction. Blood loss during the third stage of labour depends on the time between placental separation and contraction of the placental bed by uterine activity. Most women experience mild to moderate blood loss. However, the third stage of labour can be a potentially hazardous period of childbirth resulting in postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). The World Health Organization (WHO) defines PPH as blood loss after delivery of 500 ml or more (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 2008, the estimate of global maternal mortality was approximately 342,900 (<LINK REF="REF-Hogan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogan 2010</LINK>). Almost all maternal deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. The most common preventable causes of maternal death are haemorrhage, pregnancy-induced hypertension and sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Sloan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sloan 2001</LINK>). Unfortunately, due to socio-economic conditions, dwindling investment in health, and non- or poorly-functioning health systems, many women are unable to access essential care during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period (<LINK REF="REF-Acuin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acuin 2010</LINK>). One of the most common causes of maternal death worldwide is PPH (<LINK REF="REF-McCormick-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Active management of the third stage of labour</HEADING>
<P>Active management of the third stage of labour before the occurrence of PPH is better than treatment when blood loss is 500 ml or more. The third stage of labour is an important and critical period for interventions to reduce the incidence of PPH (<LINK REF="REF-De-Groot-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Groot 1995</LINK>). Active management involves prophylactic use of oxytocic drugs; early clamping and division of the umbilical cord; and controlled cord traction for delivery of the placenta (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). Three recommendations for active management in the third stage of labour are administration of an uterotonic drug within one minute of the birth of the baby, clamping and cutting the umbilical cord soon after birth, and delivering the placenta by applying controlled cord traction during a strong uterine contraction (<LINK REF="REF-Den-Hertog-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Den Hertog 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCormick-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 2002</LINK>). Combined controlled cord traction in active management of the third stage reduces the time of the third stage, the incidence of PPH and retained placenta and the need for additional oxytocic agents compared with using only uterotonic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Brucker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brucker 2001</LINK>). A Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 2000</LINK>) showed the benefit of active management of the third stage of labour on the reductions of PPH, prolonged third stage of labour, and the use of therapeutic oxytocic drugs but an increase in nausea, vomiting, headache and hypertension when ergometrine is used. The recent updated Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Begley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begley 2010</LINK>) showed a reduction of the incidence of severe blood loss and blood transfusion requirement but an increase in maternal blood pressure and pain, as well as reducing the baby's birthweight .</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Uterotonic agents</HEADING>
<P>Uterotonic agents are divided into three groups: ergot alkaloids, oxytocin and prostaglandins (<LINK REF="REF-De-Groot-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Groot 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Den-Hertog-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Den Hertog 2001</LINK>). Their mechanisms of preventing PPH are different. Methylergometrine is the most common type of ergot alkaloid; it increases the muscle tone of the uterus, with superimposed fast rhythmic contractions of the myometrium and tetanic contraction for several hours resulting in compressed myometrial blood vessels. Oxytocin acts through oxytocin receptors in myometrium and decidua leading to fast and long-lasting contractions upon basal tone of the myometrium. Syntometrine, consisting of five units of oxytocin and 0.5 mg of ergometrine, has been designed to take advantage of the rapid onset of action of oxytocin with longer action of ergometrine. Carbetocin is similar to oxytocin, but it has a rapid onset and prolonged duration of action relative to oxytocin. Its effectiveness compared to oxytocin is still awaiting final evaluation. Finally, prostaglandins induce strong myometrial contractions by increasing uterine tone (<LINK REF="REF-De-Groot-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Groot 1995</LINK>). There are several Cochrane systematic reviews already published about the use of various uterotonic drugs in the third stage of labour for preventing PPH (<LINK REF="REF-Cotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotter 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-G_x00fc_lmezoglu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gülmezoglu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recent studies have highlighted oxytocin as the first-line drug used for prophylaxis based on the evidence of its benefit in terms of reducing PPH compared with using no uterotonic drugs, and its favourable side-effect profile (<LINK REF="REF-Cotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotter 2001</LINK>). However, the use of the combination preparation of ergot alkaloid plus oxytocin, syntometrine, is associated with a statistically significant reduction of PPH when compared with oxytocin alone, attributable to the ergometrine effect (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2004</LINK>). Because of the effect of strong and lasting uterine contractions, ergometrine has been used as one of the uterotonic drugs of choice for preventing PPH.</P>
<P>Ergometrine is ergot in origin and was recovered first as a product of a fungus, <I>Claviceps Purpurea</I>, and used in obstetrics for the first time in 1582. This use ended in 1822 due to uterine rupture, stillbirth and maternal death from inaccurate doses and ergotism (gangrene and convulsive forms) (<LINK REF="REF-De-Groot-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Groot 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Dongen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dongen 1995</LINK>). However, ergot alkaloids were found to be more useful and less harmful for obstetric practice in the form of ergometrine in 1932 by Moir and Dale (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 2002</LINK>). They have specific uterotonic action through adrenergic receptors with less vasoconstrictive ability and they prevent excessive bleeding after childbirth. Two chemical ergot alkaloids are ergonovine/ergometrine maleate (ergotrate) and methylergonovine/methylergometrine maleate (methergine). They produce persistent uterine contractions in the inner zone of myometrium through calcium channel mechanisms and actin-myosin interaction leading to the shearing effect on placental separation and less blood loss or PPH, but they may increase the risk of maternal side effects such as hypertension and other complications of vasoconstriction (<LINK REF="REF-Brucker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brucker 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Groot-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Groot 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dua-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dua 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gowri-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gowri 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultatos-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultatos 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1985</LINK>). In addition, the risks of partial retention or trapping of the placenta, or both, manual removal of placenta, or uterine inversion or cord avulsion are still concerns with ergometrine administration (<LINK REF="STD-Sorbe-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Sorbe 1978</LINK>).</P>
<P>Different types of ergot alkaloid, and different routes and timing of administration have been used for both prophylactic and therapeutic purposes (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Borri-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borri 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Groot-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">De Groot 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moir-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Moir 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Selm-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Selm 1995</LINK>). The most common ergot alkaloids for obstetric treatment are ergometrine and methylergometrine. Both injectable ergometrine and methylergometrine are very unstable when stored unrefrigerated, and deteriorate with higher storage temperatures and exposure to light; therefore, they need to be stored in a dark place at a temperature of 4º to 8º Celsius. Their oral forms also deteriorate within weeks or immediately after being taken from a sealed package or container or when stored in increased temperatures and high humidity. Intravenous methylergometrine administration induces both increased frequency of uterine contractions and basal tone with a decrease of amplitude lasting at least 30 minutes and maintained for 60 to 90 minutes. On the other hand, the uterine effect following oral administration is detected in 20 to 30 minutes, peaks at 60 to 70 minutes and is maintained for 120 minutes but its effect is unpredictable (<LINK REF="REF-De-Groot-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Groot 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Groot-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">De Groot 1996b</LINK>). Injectable oxytocin is much more stable than ergometrine and methylergometrine (<LINK REF="REF-De-Groot-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Groot 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Groot-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Groot 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hogerzeil-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogerzeil 1996</LINK>). Although the chemical instability and the side effects of ergot alkaloids are of concern, clinical trials on the use of ergot alkaloids in the third stage of labour for prevention of PPH have been conducted (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Groot-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">De Groot 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorbe-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Sorbe 1978</LINK>). Oral or vaginal forms of ergot alkaloids might be useful for women in some areas where intravenous administration is not possible. A systematic review on the effectiveness and safety of ergot alkaloids in the third stage of labour is needed.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Previous systematic reviews on the prevention of PPH</HEADING>

<P>The largest study (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>) reported all prespecified outcome measures. The following maternal outcomes not prespecified in the review are reported: postnatal Hb less than 10 g/dL (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>); headache (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGinty-1956" TYPE="STUDY">McGinty 1956</LINK>); pain after birth requiring analgesia (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>); eclamptic fit (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGinty-1956" TYPE="STUDY">McGinty 1956</LINK>); uterine subinvolution at routine follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Kerekes-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Kerekes 1979</LINK>) and postpartum febrile morbidity (<LINK REF="STD-Kerekes-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Kerekes 1979</LINK>). Blood loss was observed in five studies; clinically estimated in three (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daley-1951" TYPE="STUDY">Daley 1951</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howard-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 1964</LINK>), and measured by gravimetric method (<LINK REF="STD-De-Groot-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">De Groot 1996b</LINK>) and collection of blood in a container (<LINK REF="STD-Kerekes-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Kerekes 1979</LINK>). Maternal Hb concentration was checked at 48 to 72 hours postpartum in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerekes-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Kerekes 1979</LINK>). However, mean blood loss and maternal Hb concentration data could not be extracted in one study because the authors did not report the number in the result and noted only a significant difference between the comparison groups (<LINK REF="STD-Kerekes-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Kerekes 1979</LINK>). Two studies reported manual removal of the placenta (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Groot-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">De Groot 1996b</LINK>) and one study reported retained placenta for 60 minutes or more (<LINK REF="STD-Daley-1951" TYPE="STUDY">Daley 1951</LINK>). The incidence of blood transfusion was noted in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Groot-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">De Groot 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGinty-1956" TYPE="STUDY">McGinty 1956</LINK>). The use of therapeutic uterotonics was described in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Groot-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">De Groot 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howard-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 1964</LINK>). The duration of the third stage of labour was described as the mean length of the third stage (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daley-1951" TYPE="STUDY">Daley 1951</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Groot-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">De Groot 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerekes-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Kerekes 1979</LINK>), and not as third stage of labour lasting more than 30 minutes, which was a prespecified outcome of this review; one of the studies did not present the standard deviations (<LINK REF="STD-De-Groot-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">De Groot 1996b</LINK>), so we only analysed three studies for this outcome. The elevation of blood pressure was measured in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howard-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGinty-1956" TYPE="STUDY">McGinty 1956</LINK>) but the definitions varied; diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mmHg (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>), the increase of systolic or diastolic blood pressure greater than 10 mmHg (<LINK REF="STD-Howard-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 1964</LINK>) or the increase of systolic blood pressure 20 mmHg or more or systolic blood pressure greater than 170 mmHg (<LINK REF="STD-McGinty-1956" TYPE="STUDY">McGinty 1956</LINK>). Vomiting and nausea were reported in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGinty-1956" TYPE="STUDY">McGinty 1956</LINK>).

When blood loss of at least 500 ml (moderate postpartum haemorrhage (PPH)) was considered (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daley-1951" TYPE="STUDY">Daley 1951</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howard-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 1964</LINK>), there was significant heterogeneity observed (I² = 74%); thus, this outcome was analysed with a random-effects model and ergot alkaloids were associated with a significantly lower moderate PPH rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.38, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.69) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>) comparing ergot alkaloids with no treatment reported a significant reduction in blood loss of at least 1000 ml (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.72) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) and postnatal Hb less than 10 g/dL (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.67) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) and increased mean postnatal Hb concentration at 48 to 72 hours (MD 0.50, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.62) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>) compared with no treatment.</P>
<P>No difference was demonstrated in the incidence of blood transfusion (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>) when ergot alkaloid was compared with no uterotonic agents (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.05 to 2.16) (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGinty-1956" TYPE="STUDY">McGinty 1956</LINK>). We analysed the summary RR for the use of therapeutic uterotonics by a random-effects model due to significant heterogeneity (I² = 86%) (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howard-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 1964</LINK>). When intravenous ergot alkaloids were compared, there was a significant reduction of uterotonics use (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.66) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). Mean length of third stage of labour was significantly less in ergot alkaloid group (MD -1.70, 95% CI -3.33 to -0.06) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>) using random-effects analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daley-1951" TYPE="STUDY">Daley 1951</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerekes-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Kerekes 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>The risk of retained placenta or manual removal of the placenta, or both (RR 3.75, 95% CI 0.14 to 99.71) was not demonstrated (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daley-1951" TYPE="STUDY">Daley 1951</LINK>) but with a significant heterogeneity (I² = 90%), thus this outcome was analysed with a random-effects model (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). The outcomes of these two studies were different. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>), the risk of manual removal of placenta was increased in the ergot alkaloid group (RR 19.51, 95% CI 2.62 to 145.36), but in the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Daley-1951" TYPE="STUDY">Daley 1951</LINK>), the risk of retained placenta 60 minutes or more was not increased.</P>
<P>Vomiting and nausea were significantly increased with intravenous or intramuscular ergot alkaloids compared with no treatment using a fixed-effect model (RR 11.81, 95% CI 1.78 to 78.28 and RR 18.81, 95% CI 2.93 to 120.94); however, heterogeneity was present (I²<SUP> </SUP>= 47% and 63%). After using a random-effects analysis, there was no significant heterogeneity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>: RR 6.82, 95% CI 0.37 to 126.26; and <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>: RR 8.63, 95% CI 0.26 to 284.55) (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGinty-1956" TYPE="STUDY">McGinty 1956</LINK>). Maternal adverse effects were significantly increased with intravenous or intramuscular ergot alkaloids compared with no treatment: elevation of blood pressure (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>: RR 2.60, 95% CI 1.03 to 6.57) (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howard-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGinty-1956" TYPE="STUDY">McGinty 1956</LINK>); and pain after birth requiring analgesia in one study (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>: RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.78) (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>). However, elevated blood pressure showed significant heterogeneity (I² = 84%), which might be because different definitions of elevated blood pressure were used. There was no evidence of difference in the incidence of headache (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>) and eclamptic fits (<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>: <LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGinty-1956" TYPE="STUDY">McGinty 1956</LINK>).

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-08-25 11:01:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intravenous/intramuscular ergot alkaloids significantly decreased mean blood loss and reduced the incidence of postpartum blood loss of at least 500 ml. Postpartum blood loss of 1000 ml or more and postnatal Hb concentration less than 10 g/dL were decreased, and there was an increase in mean postnatal Hb in the intravenous ergot alkaloids group, but data were from one study only (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>). These effects can result from strong uterine contractions after giving ergot alkaloids (<LINK REF="REF-De-Groot-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Groot 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Groot-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Groot 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Groot-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Groot 1998</LINK>), leading to a reduction in the need for therapeutic uterotonics, but no change in the incidence of blood transfusion. Mean length of the third stage of labour in the ergot alkaloid group in this review was minimally decreased (two minutes); however, previous Cochrane reviews on prophylactic use of other uterotonics in the third stage of labour compared with no uterotonic agents have not shown this benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Cotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotter 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-G_x00fc_lmezoglu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gülmezoglu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2004</LINK>). Two-minute reduction in the third stage of labour seems unlikely to be clinically significant; however, it is a very critical period in case of bleeding.</P>
<P>No difference was demonstrated from three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daley-1951" TYPE="STUDY">Daley 1951</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Groot-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">De Groot 1996b</LINK>) for the risk of retained placenta or manual removal of the placenta, or both; heterogeneity was high (81%) and confidence intervals wide. One of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Daley-1951" TYPE="STUDY">Daley 1951</LINK>) could not demonstrate any difference in the risk of retained placenta of 60 minutes or more. In contrast, <LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK> showed an increased risk of requiring manual removal of placenta in the intravenous ergot alkaloid group in accordance with the result of a Cochrane review assessing the effectiveness of active versus expectant management in the third stage of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 2000</LINK>). The review showed the risk of removal of placenta was increased when ergot alkaloids alone, or a combination of ergot alkaloid and oxytocin, were used with active management of the third stage of labour.<I>
<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>Significant adverse events for elevation of blood pressure and pain after birth requiring analgesia result from the effects of ergot alkaloids caused by persistent uterine contraction and vasoconstriction (<LINK REF="REF-De-Groot-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Groot 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Den-Hertog-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Den Hertog 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Dongen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dongen 1995</LINK>). Data from case reports reported severe adverse effects (cerebral ischaemia, vasospasm and hypertensive encephalopathy) (<LINK REF="REF-Dua-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dua 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1985</LINK>), indicating that the drug should be used with caution. There was only one study (<LINK REF="STD-De-Groot-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">De Groot 1996b</LINK>) comparing oral ergometrine versus placebo, showing no significant risk or benefit of ergometrine. This may be explained by the small number of women in the study and therefore insufficient power to detect any difference. Easy deterioration of oral ergot alkaloids immediately after being taken from a sealed package or container, and increased temperature and high humidity (<LINK REF="REF-De-Groot-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Groot 1998</LINK>), or longer latency time and less effect on uterine motility when compared with the intravenous route, can lead to unpredictable bioavailability (<LINK REF="REF-De-Groot-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Groot 1996a</LINK>).</P>
<P>According to the magnitude of ergot alkaloid effect, 19 pregnant women are needed to be given ergot alkaloids to prevent one additional pregnant woman from moderate PPH (number needed to treat (NNT) 19, 95% CI 14 to 29) with simultaneous harm of pain after birth (number needed to harm (NNH) 37, 95% CI 22 to 111) and elevation of blood pressure (NNH 10, 95% CI 8 to 15), thus ergot alkaloids should be used with caution in the case of women with high blood pressure.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-08-25 11:01:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included six randomised controlled trial studies in this review. Three studies had low risk of biases and the remaining three studies had high risk of biases. Most studies classified as high risk of bias were due to unclear information on allocation concealment and lack of blinding.</P>
<P>Only mean blood loss supported the benefit of ergot alkaloids without heterogeneity. The reduction of moderate PPH, use of therapeutic uterotonics and length of third stage of labour and the increase of elevation of blood pressure were identified but the heterogeneity was high. The effects on severe PPH, postnatal Hb below 10 g/dL and pain after birth requiring analgesia were found only in one study.</P>
<P>When we identified high levels of heterogeneity among the trials (I² greater than 30%), we explored it by prespecified subgroup analysis (intravenous or intramuscular versus oral route). We used a random-effects analysis as an overall summary when this was considered appropriate. However, high levels still existed, possibly due to other related procedures such as active or physiologic management of the third stage or other unknown details of placental delivery that were not presented in the trial reports.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-08-15 15:38:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We found and excluded three additional studies in this review, the second updated version. There were no agreements of this updated review with the first published version in 2007 and the first updated version in 2008 which excluded four additional studies.</P>
<P>There have been no other systematic reviews comparing ergot alkaloids to no uterotonics published. Two Cochrane reviews compared ergot alkaloids with oxytocin or ergot alkaloids plus oxytocin (<LINK REF="REF-Cotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotter 2001</LINK>) or ergot alkaloids plus oxytocin compared with oxytocin (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effects of ergot alkaloids administered in the third stage of labour on reduction of moderate PPH, mean blood loss and use of therapeutic uterotonics compared with no uterotonics in this review were similar to the findings of the oxytocin review by Cotter et al which only included randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Cotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotter 2001</LINK>). In addition, a higher manual removal of placenta was noted in ergot alkaloids compared with oxytocin when the uterotonics were given before the delivery of placenta which was not identified in this review. The combination of 5 IU of oxytocin plus 0.5 mg of ergot alkaloids (syntometrine) had a higher reduction of the risk of moderate PPH and therapeutic uterotonics compared with 10 IU of oxytocin but the risks of elevation of diastolic blood pressure, vomiting, nausea and combined vomiting and nausea were reported (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2004</LINK>). More adverse effects of syntometrine may be due to higher doses of ergot alkaloids in the combination.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-05-06 16:24:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ergot alkaloid injection (intravenous or intramuscular) is one of the prophylactic agents used during the third stage of labour to prevent postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). Side effects include elevation of blood pressure and pain requiring analgesia after birth. The risk and benefit of uterotonic agents chosen for preventing PPH therefore should be considered carefully under appropriate resource settings.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-08-15 15:38:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>When ergot alkaloids were compared with no uterotonic agents, the beneficial effects on less postpartum blood loss and additional use of therapeutic uterotonics but higher risk of elevation of blood pressure was explicit. However, the participants in these trials were not at increased risk of PPH and so the possible benefits to this group of women have not really been assessed. In the Cochrane review by Cotter et al (<LINK REF="REF-Cotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotter 2001</LINK>), there was little evidence of differential effects on the advantages of ergot alkaloids alone compared with oxytocin. In addition, the optimal dosing of, and route of administration for ergot alkaloids is inconclusive. Therefore, future large, well-designed studies are required: these should compare the different types of uterotonic agents with different dosage and route, as well as assess serious morbidity from PPH to fill the knowledge gap of the appropriate uterotonic agents for preventing PPH, especially in developing countries where haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal deaths. However, the risk of ergot alkaloids needs to be seriously taken into account. None of the studies on prophylactic use of uterotonics included in this review addressed neonatal outcomes or serious morbidity from PPH, thus there is the need in future trials to measure neonatal outcomes, serious morbidity in the mother and possible adverse effects of ergometrine on lactation.</P>

<P>The following methods were used to assess <LINK REF="STD-Begley-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Begley 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daley-1951" TYPE="STUDY">Daley 1951</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Groot-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">De Groot 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howard-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Howard 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerekes-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Kerekes 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGinty-1956" TYPE="STUDY">McGinty 1956</LINK>.</P>
<P>We used the methods as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>The contact author (Tippawan Liabsuetrakul (TL)) assessed all potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy, using title and abstract, and searched for the full texts. Two authors (TL and Krantarat Peeyananjarassri) reviewed the full texts regarding types of studies, participants, interventions and outcomes, based on the prespecified inclusion criteria and using a trial eligibility form. We resolved any disagreement through discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of study validity</HEADING>
<P>Two authors (TL and Thanapan Choobun (TC)) assessed the validity of each included study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). We assessed each study for quality of allocation of concealment, completeness to follow up and blinding. We considered the analysis of participants in the groups to which they were initially assigned (intention to treat). There was no attempt to mask the authors' names, institutions, source of the publication or results when applying the inclusion criteria. TL and TC independently assessed the study validity using prepared data extraction forms.The quality of included studies was assessed qualitatively using the CONSORT statement on reporting the results of randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). We resolved any discrepancies by discussion and reached consensus through discussion.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>We assigned a quality score for each trial, using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) adequate concealment of allocation: centralised randomisation schemes; randomisation schemes controlled by a pharmacy; numbered or coded containers in which capsules from identical-looking, numbered bottles are administered sequentially; on-site computer systems, where allocations are in a locked unreadable file; and sequentially-numbered opaque, sealed envelopes;<BR/>(B) unclear concealment of allocation such as list or table used, sealed envelopes or study does not report any concealment approach;<BR/>(C) inadequate concealment of allocation: alternation, the use of case record numbers, dates of birth or day of the week or open list of random numbers;<BR/>(D) not used.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Completeness of follow-up</HEADING>
<P>We assessed completeness of follow-up using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) less than 5% of participants excluded;<BR/>(B) 5% to 10% of participants excluded;<BR/>(C) more than 10% to 20% of participants excluded;<BR/>(D) more than 20% of participants excluded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Blinding</HEADING>
<P>We assessed blinding using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) blinding of participants (yes/no/unclear);<BR/>(B) blinding of caregiver (yes/no/unclear);<BR/>(C) blinding of outcome assessment (yes/no/unclear).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>We designed a form to extract the data. Tippawan Liabsuetrakul (TL) and Thanapan Choobun (TC) extracted the data using the agreed form. We resolved discrepancies through discussion. We used the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) to enter the data and double checked them.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analyses</HEADING>
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data if studies were sufficiently similar. We extracted the data on specific comparison groups between ergot alkaloids versus placebo or no treatment for analysis.</P>
<P>For dichotomous data, we presented the results as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we used the mean difference (MD) if outcomes were measured in the same way between studies. We used the standardised mean difference (SMD) to combine studies that measured the same outcome but used different methods.</P>
<P>We analysed data on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. Therefore, all included participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. If, in the original reports, participants were not analysed in the group to which they were randomised, and there was sufficient information in the study report, we attempted to restore them to the correct group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We applied tests of heterogeneity between studies, if appropriate, using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. If there was no evidence of heterogeneity, we reported the results as a fixed-effect summary. If we identified levels of heterogeneity among the studies exceeding 50%, we explored them by subgroup analysis and performed sensitivity analysis based on trial quality. We used a random-effects meta-analysis as an overall summary when this was considered appropriate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We prespecified that we would perform the following sensitivity analysis by the quality of included studies: excluding trials where allocation concealment was inadequate (C).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Risk of having a postpartum haemorrhage: high risk versus low risk.</LI>
<LI>Route of administration of ergot alkaloids: intramuscular or intravenous compared with oral route.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>We will design a form to extract data. For eligible studies, at least two review authors will extract the data using the agreed form. We will resolve discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person. We will enter data into Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>) and check for accuracy.</P>
<P>When information regarding any of the above is unclear, we will attempt to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors will independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We will resolve any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We will assess the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator),</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number) or,</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4"> (2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence and determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.   </LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will consider that studies are at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judge that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk of bias for participants;</LI>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk of bias for personnel;</LI>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk of bias for outcome assessors.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We will state whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.  Where sufficient information is reported, or can be supplied by the trial authors, we will re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertake. We will assess methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias;</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study any important concerns we have about other possible sources of bias.</P>
<P>We will assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias;</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias;</LI>
<LI>unclear whether there is risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We will make explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we will assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings.  We will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see </I>Sensitivity analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we will present results as summary risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).<I> </I>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data, we will use the mean difference (MD) if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials. We will use the standardised mean difference (SMD) to combine trials that measure the same outcome, but use different methods. <B> </B>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes or standard errors<I> </I>using the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity or subgroup analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>For included studies, we will note levels of attrition. We will explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we will carry out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, i.e. we will attempt to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants will be analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial will be the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be missing.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We will assess statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the T<SUP>2</SUP>, I² and Chi² statistics. We will regard heterogeneity as substantial if T<SUP>2</SUP> is greater than zero and either I<SUP>2</SUP> is greater than 30% or there is a low P-value (&lt; 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>If there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually, and use formal tests for funnel plot asymmetry. For continuous outcomes, we will use the test proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>, and for dichotomous outcomes, we will use the test proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Harbord-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harbord 2006</LINK>. If asymmetry is detected in any of these tests or is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We will carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We will use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it is reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials are examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods are judged sufficiently similar. If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary will be treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful we will not combine trials.</P>
<P>If we use random-effects analyses, the results will be presented as the average treatment effect with its 95% CI, and the estimates of  T<SUP>2</SUP> and I<SUP>2</SUP>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>If we identify substantial heterogeneity, we will investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We will consider whether an overall summary is meaningful, and if it is, use random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>
