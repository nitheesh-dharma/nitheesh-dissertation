<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-10-14 10:09:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Deep venous incompetence (DVI) is a problem in the veins that can lead to leg ulcers (sores), pain and swelling. It may be caused by a problem in the valves of the vein, by a blockage of the veins or by a combination of these events. For most people, wearing special compression stockings and treating the ulcers is enough. When this does not ease the problem, surgery is sometimes tried. This review includes four studies with a total of 273 participants. All included studies reported on outcomes following surgical repair of venous valves (valvuloplasty). We did not identify studies investigating other surgical procedures for the treatment of patients with DVI. All included studies investigated primary valve incompetence (when valves do not close properly because of laxity of the vein wall or valve cusps). We found no trials that investigated the results of surgery for secondary valvular incompetence (when valves do not close properly, for example, when valves are damaged as a result of deep vein thrombosis) or for the obstructive form of DVI. As different outcomes were reported, it was not possible to combine the results of these studies. The methodological quality of the included studies was low, mainly because information regarding allocation of treatment and blinding was missing, or because data were incomplete or were poorly presented. Ulcer healing and ulcer recurrence were not reported in one study, and the remaining three studies did not include patients with ulcers or active ulceration. Three studies reported no significant complications of surgery or no incidence of DVT during follow-up. One study did not report on the occurrence of complications.</P>
<P>Clinical changes were assessed by subjective and objective measurements, as specified in the clinical, aetiological, anatomical, and pathophysiological (CEAP) classification score. This requires vascular laboratory measurements of lower limb haemodynamics before and after surgery. Tests include an overall evaluation of venous function with venous refilling time (VRT) or ambulatory venous pressure (AVP). Results show improvement in clinical symptoms and muscle pumping function and significant improvement in the haemodynamic status of patients who had external valvuloplasty along with surgery to the superficial venous system. In patients who had surgery to the superficial venous system only, clinical symptoms improved, but no improvement in muscle pumping function was reported.</P>
<P>Evidence is not sufficient to show the effects of surgery on the treatment of patients with DVI. The individual trials included in this review have demonstrated possible long-term benefit in certain groups of patients, but these trials were small, used different methods of assessment and overall were of poor quality. They did not include patients with severe DVI. Trials investigating the effects of other surgical procedures on the deep veins are needed. Until evidence from such trials becomes available, conventional conservative measures, such as high compression therapy or elasticated hosiery, remain the treatments of choice.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-10-12 21:19:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four studies with 273 participants were included. All included studies reported clinical outcomes following valvuloplasty. We found no studies investigating other surgical procedures for the treatment of patients with DVI. All included studies investigated primary valve incompetence. We found no trials that investigated the results of surgery for secondary valvular incompetence or the obstructive form of DVI. Because different outcome measures were used, it was not possible to pool the results of included studies. The methodological quality of the included studies was low, mainly because information regarding randomisation and blinding was missing, or because data were incomplete or were presented poorly. Ulcer healing and ulcer recurrence were not reported in one study, and the remaining three studies did not include participants with ulcers or with active ulceration. Three studies reported no significant complications of surgery and no incidence of DVT during follow-up. One study did not report on the occurrence of complications. Clinical changes were assessed by subjective and objective measurements, as specified in the clinical, aetiological, anatomical, and pathophysiological (CEAP) classification score. This requires vascular laboratory measurements of lower limb haemodynamics before and after surgery. Tests include an overall evaluation of venous function with venous refilling time (VRT) or ambulatory venous pressure (AVP). Two small trials comparing external valvuloplasty using limited anterior plication in combination with ligation of incompetent superficial veins against ligation alone (L) showed that ligation plus limited anterior plication produced significant improvement in AVP: The mean difference was -15 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI) -20.9 to -9.0) at one year and -15 mm Hg (95% CI -21 to -8.9) at two years. Sustainable statistically significant improvement in AVP and VRT was achieved by ligation and limited anterior plication at 10 years in one study. However, AVP values after surgery remained relatively high, causing its benefit to be questioned. Similarly, another study including participants who were deteriorating preoperatively showed sustained mild clinical improvement for seven years in those subjected to valvuloplasty compared with participants undergoing superficial venous surgery alone. However, this benefit was lost when the condition of participants was stable preoperatively. One small study (n = 40) with grade 3 reflux and no participants with ulcers reported that external valvuloplasty of the femoral vein combined with surgical repair of the superficial venous system improved the haemodynamic status of the lower limbs, restored valvular function more effectively and achieved better outcomes than surgical repair of the superficial venous system alone.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-10-14 10:24:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No evidence was found for benefit or harm of valvuloplasty in the treatment of patients with DVI secondary to primary valvular incompetence. The individual trials included in this review were small; they used different methods of assessment and overall were of poor quality. They did not include participants with severe DVI. Trials investigating the effects of other surgical procedures on deep veins are needed. Until the findings of such trials become available, the benefit of valvuloplasty remains uncertain.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-10-12 21:25:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-10-12 21:25:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic deep venous incompetence (DVI) is a troublesome condition that is associated with a variable range of distressing symptoms such as recurrent ulcers, leg pain and leg swelling. The underlying defect could be valvular incompetence (when the valve does not close tightly and allows blood to leak back into the vein), obstruction of large-calibre veins or a combination of these two events. Valvular incompetence may be primary or secondary. Primary valve incompetence is not associated with post-thrombotic changes, and the defect is sometimes congenital, leading to early development of symptoms. Secondary valve incompetence and the obstructive form of DVI are post-thrombotic phenomena and account for 80% to 95% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Bauer-1948" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauer 1948</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Browse-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browse 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perrin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perrin 2004</LINK>). The obstructive form is less common, affecting 3% to 9% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Halliday-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halliday 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raju-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raju 1988</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-10-12 02:10:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic DVI represents a therapeutic challenge for vascular surgeons. Most surgeons accept that well-fitted graduated compression stockings (GCS) and local care of wounds provide adequate treatment for the majority of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Lancet-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancet 1982</LINK>). Sometimes symptoms are not controlled and ulcers recur frequently, or they do not heal despite compliance with conservative measures. In these situations, in the presence of severe venous dysfunction, surgery has been advocated by some vascular surgeons (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kistner-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kistner 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most surgeons accept that primary surgical treatment for concomitant superficial system insufficiency and perforators in the absence of major vein obstruction is essential for good results (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1991</LINK>). Reconstructive surgery of the deep venous system is usually directed towards correcting the underlying defect by bypassing the obstructed segment or by restoring the valve mechanism (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 1987</LINK>). Examples include valvuloplasty, venous segmental transposition and venous segmental transplantation. Use of prosthetic valve material still has no place in venous surgery in human beings. Postoperative complications include deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), venous occlusion and venous incompetence.</P>

<P>The value of surgery in DVI has not been fully determined (<LINK REF="REF-Gloor-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gloor 1997</LINK>).

<LI>Clinical changes: certain subjective and objective assessments as specified by clinical, etiological, anatomical, and pathophysiological (CEAP) classification scoring for chronic venous disease (CVD) and by CEAP classification scoring for clinical outcomes after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Beebe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beebe 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Porter-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porter 1995</LINK>). This requires vascular laboratory measurements of lower limb haemodynamics before and after surgery. Tests include an overall evaluation of venous function with venous refilling time (VRT) or ambulatory venous pressure (AVP). Patients undergoing surgery for valvular incompetence should undergo duplex assessment of venous reflux and possibly radiological investigation of competence and patency. Patients undergoing surgery for deep venous obstruction should undergo measurements of maximum venous outflow for assessment of outcome and duplex scanning, or phlebography for assessment of patency and degree of reflux. An overall evaluation of the clinical outcome will be given on the following basis: +3 (asymptomatic = no symptoms of CVD, improvement in VRT of at least +5 seconds and improvement in AVP of at least -10 mm Hg), +2 (moderate improvement = mild symptoms with changes in VRT and AVP as in +3), +1 (mild improvement = clinical improvement or improvement in VRT or AVP), 0 (no symptomatic or laboratory changes), -1 (mild worsening = deterioration in symptoms or in VRT or AVP results), -2 (significant worsening = deterioration in symptoms and in VRT or AVP results) and -3 (marked worsening = that seen with -2 accompanied by new or worsening venous claudication).</LI>

<P>In future updates of this review, in studies in which the CEAP classification system has not been used to assess the outcome of surgery, available data from such studies will be used and, if possible, applied to the CEAP classification method.

<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>: This study investigated the efficacy of external valvuloplasty of the femoral vein in the treatment of participants with primary chronic venous insufficiency (PCVI). The study included 40 participants with bilateral PCVI who were classified as CEAP C2 to C4, with moderate incompetence of the deep vein. The limbs of each participant (total 80 limbs) were randomly assigned to two groups, each consisting of 40 limbs. Group A limbs underwent external valvuloplasty of the femoral vein combined with surgery of the superficial venous system; Group B limbs underwent surgery to the superficial venous system only. Participants were followed up for three years after surgery was performed. Participants with ulcers were excluded, so no new evidence of ulcer healing was identified.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1999</LINK>: Both of these studies compared external valvuloplasty using limited anterior plication (LAP) in combination with ligation of incompetent superficial veins (ligation and LAP group) versus only ligation of incompetent superficial veins (ligation only group). The number of participants was relatively small. All participants were deemed to have DVI due to primary valvular incompetence. Criteria for making the diagnosis were referred to in another article published by the same author (<LINK REF="REF-Belcaro-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belcaro 1993a</LINK>). The clinical scores of included participants may be converted to "C4s, Ep, As, d, p, Pr" (translated as symptomatic skin changes ascribed to venous disease; CVD of undetermined cause; involvement of superficial, deep and perforator veins; and underlying pathophysiology of reflux) according to the CEAP classification system. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. In both trials, the ligation and LAP group received subcutaneous heparin (dose and frequency not stated) on a daily basis for five days after surgery. In addition, elasticated GCS were used to prevent DVT for five days following surgery in <LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1999</LINK>.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Makarova-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Makarova 2001</LINK> compared participants with primary valvular incompetence undergoing superficial venous surgery alone versus participants having an additional internal valvuloplasty of the superficial femoral vein. In all, 128 participants of CEAP C2 to C4 were initially treated with elasticated compression for five years before entry into the trial. <LINK REF="STD-Makarova-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Makarova 2001</LINK> stratified participants into two groups according to change in CEAP class during five years of observation: those with "progressive clinical dynamics" (worsening of CEAP class by at least one level) and those with "stable clinical dynamics" (no change in CEAP class). Participants were further stratified according to changing CEAP class, yielding six separate subgroups for random assignment to treatment and control arms of the study. A total of 27 participants had developed active ulceration (C6), but no healed ulcers (C5) were reported. All participants had undergone yearly preoperative ultrasound scans to mark out sites of reflux and to measure reflux time (RT) and reflux volume index (RVI). Participants then underwent superficial venous surgery (including subfascial perforator ligation) with or without internal valvuloplasty to the proximal superficial femoral valve. Participants were followed up by annual duplex scan for seven to eight years after surgery.</P>
<P>We found no trials that investigated the results of surgery for secondary valvular incompetence or the obstructive form of DVI. Moreover, we identified no trials that compared the results of surgery versus those of conventional conservative measures.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1999</LINK> reported a degree of subjective improvement, as measured by a QoL questionnaire. However, information was insufficient to infer an overall score for clinical outcome.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Makarova-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Makarova 2001</LINK> did not provide individual data for included participants. However, it is possible to make some comment on changes in CEAP class over the seven years of follow-up, as reported in the paper. Among all participants who were clinically stable before surgery (21 in control group, 22 in valvuloplasty group), only one participant in the control group showed deterioration compared with none in the treatment group. Among 41 participants who demonstrated deterioration in CEAP class preoperatively, 14 continued to show deterioration after superficial venous surgery alone, 21 stabilised and six developed recurrent varicose veins. By comparison, progression was significantly halted in participants undergoing a valvuloplasty, with only six of 41 deteriorating and 33 stabilising (two developed recurrent varicose veins). Therefore, in the absence of individual data, the overall score for mean results of ligation and valvuloplasty, whether stable or progressive preoperatively, was +1 (clinical improvement but no physiological pressure data). A similar score was reported in the control group among participants who were stable preoperatively. However, among control participants with progressive disease preoperatively, a score of zero or -1 was documented in the study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK> did not present individual data for included participants. However this study reports that in Group A (external valvuloplasty with surgery to the superficial venous system), compared with preoperative baseline data, the amount of venous reflux, the VFI and the CEAP severity score at one month, one year and three years postoperatively, and the EF and RVF at one year and three years, were significantly less. Significant differences in venous reflux, reflux indices and CEAP severity scores were noted between the limbs of both groups, when compared postoperatively at one month (P &lt; 0.1) and at one year (P &lt; 0.1), and in all parameters at three years (P &lt; 0.5). In Group B (surgery to the superficial venous system only), compared with preoperative baseline data, the amount of venous reflux, the VFI and the CEAP severity were less, and the EF and RVF were not significantly different. Overall moderate improvement (+2) was noted.</P>
<P>These results show improvement in clinical symptoms and muscle pumping function and significant improvement in the haemodynamic status of participants in Group A limbs (external valvuloplasty with surgery to the superficial venous system). In Group B limbs (surgery to the superficial venous system only), improvement in clinical symptoms was reported with no improvement in muscle pumping function.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-10-14 10:19:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The only available randomised controlled trials involved performing ligation and valvuloplasty in study participants with primary valvular incompetence (<LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makarova-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Makarova 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>). This treatment was compared with ligation only. No trials investigated surgical treatment of participants with DVI due to secondary valvular incompetence or the obstructive form of DVI. Moreover, no trials compared the results of surgical procedures versus those of high compression therapy in participants with venous ulcers secondary to DVI. The included trials were of small scale. Participants suffered from mild to moderate DVI, and none was reported to have a past or present history of venous ulcers. Many of the measures used in these trials are no longer used in clinical practice.</P>
<P>Ulcer healing and ulcer recurrence were not reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Makarova-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Makarova 2001</LINK>), and the remaining three studies did not include participants with ulcers or active ulceration (<LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>). Three studies reported no significant complications of surgery and no incidence of DVT during follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>). One study did not report on the occurrence of complications (<LINK REF="STD-Makarova-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Makarova 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sustainable statistically significant improvement in AVP and VRT was achieved by ligation and LAP at 10 years (<LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1999</LINK>). Significance was maintained when AVP and VRT were measured with a cuff while the superficial system was excluded. However, AVP values after surgery remained relatively high, allowing the benefit of surgery to be questioned. Nevertheless, the benefit of valve repair was sustained at 10 years of follow-up, and the clinical outcome score for the ligation and LAP group was +2 compared with +1 for the ligation only group.</P>
<P>Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Makarova-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Makarova 2001</LINK> demonstrated in participants who were deteriorating preoperatively sustained mild clinical improvement for seven years among those subjected to valvuloplasty compared with participants undergoing superficial venous surgery alone (zero or -1). However, this benefit was lost when the participant's condition was stable preoperatively.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK> reported that external valvuloplasty of the femoral vein combined with surgical repair of the superficial venous system improved the haemodynamic status of the lower limbs, restored valvular function more effectively and achieved better outcomes than surgical repair of the superficial venous system alone. However the study sample was small&#8212;40 participants (80 limbs) with only grade 3 reflux&#8212;and did not include participants with ulcers.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-10-14 10:42:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included four small studies that reported clinical outcomes following valvuloplasty. We did not identify studies investigating other surgical procedures for the treatment of patients with DVI. Included studies reported different measures of clinical outcomes. Meta-analysis therefore was not possible, and we were not able to address all of our objectives. Individually, the studies reported promising results, but they included only participants with mild to moderate DVI, and so findings may not be applicable to patients with more severe DVI. One small trial showed continuous improvement for three years following external valvuloplasty of the femoral vein, in addition to surgery to the superficial venous system (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>). This improved the haemodynamic status of lower limbs and restored valvular function more effectively, achieving better outcomes when compared with surgery to the superficial venous system alone showing benefit in a group of patients not usually considered for surgery for DVI (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2006</LINK>). Results from three additional studies indicate that ligation and valvuloplasty may have produced moderate and sustained improvement for seven to 10 years after surgery among patients with mild to moderate DVI caused by primary valvular incompetence (<LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makarova-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Makarova 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Very little information was available from the included studies on the primary outcome of ulcer healing and recurrence. Three studies excluded patients with ulcers or active ulceration, and one study did not report on ulcer healing and recurrence.</P>
<P>Some of the measures used in the included studies to assess clinical changes, for example, APG and RVI, are no longer used in clinical practice, and consensus has not been reached on how venous haemodynamics should be assessed and quantified. A clinically useful robust measure for the pathophysiology of deep venous incompetence is needed for future trials.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-10-14 10:22:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall the quality of available evidence was low, which does not allow a robust conclusion regarding the effectiveness of surgical procedures in the treatment of patients with DVI, and we were unable to compare the results of surgical treatment of patients with DVI versus conventional medical treatment. Three of the four included studies provided no details of randomisation or blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makarova-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Makarova 2001</LINK>). Data within two trials were incomplete or were presented in such a way that further analysis was not possible (<LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makarova-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Makarova 2001</LINK>). This assessment is made more difficult by the lack of a clinically generalised robust measure of deep venous function.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-10-12 22:45:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We believe that all relevant studies have been identified by our searches, but this review has been limited by the number of suitable RCTs and the small numbers of participants treated in these trials. Most participants are treated on an individual basis, and study results should be interpreted with considerable caution.</P>

<P>No evidence was found for benefit or harm of valvuloplasty in the treatment of patients with DVI secondary to primary valvular incompetence. The individual trials included in this review are small, used different methods of assessment and overall were of poor quality. They did not include participants with severe DVI. Trials investigating the effects of other surgical procedures on deep veins are needed. Until the findings of such trials become available, the benefit of valvuloplasty remains uncertain.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-10-12 20:39:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Well-designed, large, randomised trials with long-term follow-up are needed to investigate surgical procedures for the treatment of patients with DVI. A clinically useful robust measure for pathophysiology of deep venous incompetence is needed for future trials. In the absence of this, trials should be designed and powered for clinically important outcomes such as ulcer healing, pain scores and QoL. In particular, trials including participants with venous ulcers secondary to DVI, trials reporting on ulcer healing and ulcer recurrence and trials comparing surgery with high compression therapy are required.</P>
