<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-16 10:41:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies have shown that stroke survivors and their carers often report they have not been given enough information about stroke and feel unprepared for life after discharge from hospital. However, the best way to provide information after stroke is unclear. The authors of this review looked at the evidence for the effectiveness of providing information to patients, or carers of patients, who have had a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), sometimes called a mini-stroke. They examined randomised trials (studies) in which one group of stroke patients or carers who were given the intervention being tested (such as a course of lectures) was compared with a group of stroke patients or carers who received standard care. Twenty-one studies, involving 2289 patients and 1290 carers, are now included in this updated review. Overall, the studies showed that providing information to patients and carers improved their knowledge of stroke and increased patient satisfaction with some, but not all, of the information they received about stroke. There was also an effect on reducing patient depression, although the reduction was small and may not be enough to seem meaningful to patients. When information was provided in a way that more actively involved patients and carers, for example by offering repeated opportunities to ask questions, it had more effect on patient mood than information which was given on one occasion only. There is not much evidence that providing information had effects on other aspects of patient or carer stroke recovery such as independence or social activities.</P>

<P>We have added four new trials to this update. This review now includes 21 trials involving 2289 patient and 1290 carer participants. Nine trials evaluated a passive and 12 trials an active information intervention. Meta-analyses showed a significant effect in favour of the intervention on patient knowledge (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.46, P &lt; 0.001), carer knowledge (SMD 0.74, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.43, P = 0.03), one aspect of patient satisfaction (odds ratio (OR) 2.07, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.23, P = 0.001), and patient depression scores (mean difference (MD) -0.52, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.10, P = 0.01). There was no significant effect (P &gt; 0.05) on number of cases of anxiety or depression in patients, carer mood or satisfaction, or death. Qualitative analyses found no strong evidence of an effect on other outcomes. Post-hoc subgroup analyses showed that active information had a significantly greater effect than passive information on patient mood but not on other outcomes.</P>

<P>There is evidence that information improves patient and carer knowledge of stroke, aspects of patient satisfaction, and reduces patient depression scores. However, the reduction in depression scores was small and may not be clinically significant. Although the best way to provide information is still unclear there is some evidence that strategies that actively involve patients and carers and include planned follow-up for clarification and reinforcement have a greater effect on patient mood.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-09-07 15:45:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Every year approximately 110,000 people in England have a stroke (<LINK REF="REF-National-Audit-Office-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Audit Office 2005</LINK>) and at any one time over 300,000 people are living with moderate to severe disability as a result of a stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Adamson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamson 2004</LINK>). The provision of appropriate, accurate, timely information and advice about stroke has been recommended as a key component of service provision (<LINK REF="REF-Canadian-Stroke-Network-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Canadian Stroke Network 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCP-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCP 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-National-Stroke-Foundation-Australia-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Stroke Foundation Australia 2010</LINK>). Information, combined with the right support, is the key to better care, better outcomes and reduced costs. Patients should have information and data on all aspects of health care, to enable them to share in decisions about their care and access appropriate services (<LINK REF="REF-Department-of-Health-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Department of Health 2010</LINK>). The information needs of people who have had a stroke and their carers are diverse and change over time. Information should be tailored to an individual's requirements and provided in a variety of formats (<LINK REF="REF-Department-of-Health-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Department of Health 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eames-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eames 2011</LINK>), taking into account their stroke-specific impairment and personal situation (<LINK REF="REF-RCP-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCP 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a wide range of nationally and locally produced leaflets, booklets, videos and audio tapes available for patients and carers. However, despite this emphasis on giving information, research suggests that patients' understanding of stroke, its consequences and the support available, remains poor. A recent systematic review identified multiple and diverse unmet educational needs by stroke patients and their caregivers (<LINK REF="REF-Hafsteinsdottir-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hafsteinsdottir 2011</LINK>). In a survey of community dwelling adults who suffered a stroke at least one and up to five years previously, over half reported wanting more information about their stroke (<LINK REF="REF-McKevitt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKevitt 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a UK study, carers of stroke patients reported that whilst leaflets were available, they were not always appropriate to the situation (<LINK REF="REF-Mackenzie-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackenzie 2007</LINK>). A survey by primary care trusts in England, of the information provided to patients after stroke, reported that the majority provided good information. However, only 40% contained information relevant to local services. Furthermore, the size, content and organisation of the information varied extensively (<LINK REF="REF-Care-Quality-Commission-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Care Quality Commission 2011</LINK>). Inadequate provision and receipt of appropriate information has important consequences for compliance with secondary prevention and the longer-term psycho-social outcome for patients and carers (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Mahoney-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Mahoney 1997</LINK>). Enhanced knowledge of stroke care by carers may improve the quality of discharge home from hospital for stroke patients (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1991</LINK>). Despite the perceived and expressed need for information, successful strategies have not as yet been identified. In order to fully explore available evidence we have undertaken a systematic review of information provision for patients and their carers after stroke.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-08-17 10:34:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A stroke is defined by the World Health Organization as: "Rapidly developing clinical signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function, lasting more than 24 hours or leading to death, with no apparent cause other than vascular origin" (<LINK REF="REF-Aho-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aho 1980</LINK>). A transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is a brief reversible episode of focal, non-convulsive ischaemic dysfunction of the brain with a duration of less than 24 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1998</LINK>). Stroke can lead to death or physical and cognitive impairment (<LINK REF="REF-McKevitt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKevitt 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mukherjee-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mukherjee 2011</LINK>) and can have long lasting psychological and social implications (<LINK REF="REF-Knapp-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knapp 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-09-07 15:45:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The intervention is the provision of information for stroke survivors or their informal caregivers, or both, following a stroke or TIA. The intervention may be provided in a variety of formats such as leaflets, workbooks, or verbal communication including lectures or teaching sessions. Whilst the content of the intervention may vary, it is likely to contain at least one of the following components: information about the causes and nature of stroke; management and recovery from the effects of stroke; prevention or reducing the risk of future strokes; information on resources or services. Whilst the provision of information should be incorporated as standard practice following stroke, evidence suggests it is lacking or inconsistent (<LINK REF="REF-Mackenzie-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackenzie 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Care-Quality-Commission-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Care Quality Commission 2011</LINK>). </P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-08-28 14:23:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If stroke survivors and carers are to be active in their decision making and management of the long-term effects of stroke, appropriate information delivered in a timely and effective format is necessary. Information is considered necessary to recognise and act upon symptoms, manage disease exacerbation and to access effective treatments and medicines and produce better outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Department-of-Health-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Department of Health 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Department-of-Health-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Department of Health 2010</LINK>). Furthermore, inadequate provision of information has implications for compliance with secondary prevention and psycho-social outcomes for stroke patients and carers (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Mahoney-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Mahoney 1997</LINK>). Evidence from non-stroke populations suggests providing written information improves adherence to hospital after-care regimens (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbs-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbs 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Firth-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Firth 1991</LINK>) and may assist with self-care (<LINK REF="REF-Coulter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulter 1998</LINK>), which may indirectly produce beneficial outcomes.</P>

<P>It has been proposed that information, combined with the right support, is the key to better care, better outcomes and reduced costs (<LINK REF="REF-Department-of-Health-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Department of Health 2010</LINK>). The information derived from this review has the potential to lead to the development of more effective information provision strategies and highlight which outcomes might be affected by such interventions.<B> </B>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2012-08-16 10:59:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts of records from the electronic searches and excluded obviously irrelevant studies. We obtained the full text of the remaining studies and at least two review authors assessed these against the review inclusion criteria to determine which trials would be eligible for inclusion. The review authors resolved disagreements by discussion with other members of the review team.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2012-08-16 11:01:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>At least two review authors scrutinised all the eligible trials to grade methodological quality, patient selection, the intervention, outcome measures used, and length of follow-up. We allocated studies to one of two categories - passive information or active information - according to the nature of the intervention. An intervention was classified as passive if the information was provided on a single occasion and there was no subsequent systematic follow-up or reinforcement procedure. An intervention was classified as active if, following the provision of the information, there was a purposeful attempt to allow the participant to assimilate the information and a subsequent agreed plan for clarification and consolidation or reinforcement. We made this classification because it would inform future research and be helpful for service planners in terms of committing resources. Two review authors extracted data independently using piloted data extraction forms, and measured agreement. They resolved disagreement through group consensus. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information and data.</P>

<P>We compared studies based on the end-of-study results. Meta-analyses have been undertaken for the domains of knowledge, emotional outcome, death and for selected satisfaction questions. For the domain of knowledge, we combined data using the SMD as all the trials had used different knowledge questionnaires. We combined dichotomous data (domains of mood, satisfaction, death) using the Peto OR. For the domain of mood, we dichotomised the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores, the Geriatric Depression Scale scores and the General Health Questionnaire scores using the recommended cut-off points (<LINK REF="REF-Zigmond-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zigmond 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheikh-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheikh 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1988</LINK>). We treated ordinal data (domain of patient mood) as continuous data and combined them using the MD. For a number of studies both ordinal and dichotomised patient Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale data were available. If this was the case, we extracted and analysed both forms of data.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Assessment of knowledge</HEADING>
<P>Ten trials evaluated patient or carer knowledge or both. All used different questionnaires, the majority of which had been specifically developed for the study. The questionnaire used by <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1988</LINK> had been validated (Stroke Care Information Test, range 0 to 36) (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1985</LINK>). The 26-item knowledge of stroke scale used by <LINK REF="STD-Rodgers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rodgers 1999</LINK> and the 17-item knowledge of stroke and services questionnaire used by <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2004</LINK> were based on instruments used in other studies (<LINK REF="REF-Wellwood-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wellwood 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drummond-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drummond 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mant-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mant 1998</LINK>), and the content of the specific educational programme under evaluation. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 2007</LINK>, the 25-item knowledge of stroke questionnaire developed for the study was based partly on a previously validated measure (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2004</LINK>). The content validity and test-retest reliability of this instrument were assessed prior to the commencement of the study. The questionnaire used by <LINK REF="STD-Lowe-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lowe 2007</LINK> was developed from professionals' ideas of what patients should be aware of concerning secondary prevention of stroke and was piloted with 58 stroke patients. In <LINK REF="STD-Maasland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Maasland 2007</LINK> the questionnaire was developed and validated in 42 partners of patients with TIA. None of the questionnaires in the remaining three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lomer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lomer 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pain-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pain 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mant-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mant 1998</LINK>) had been validated.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-08-28 14:23:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has explored the effectiveness of information provision for stroke patients and their carers as a process of care aimed at improving stroke recovery. In order to summarise effectively the available evidence on the core concept of information provision, we categorised the studies according to the nature of the intervention using two categories: passive and active. Our intention was to differentiate between interventions where participation was largely passive with no subsequent systematic follow-up or reinforcement procedure, and those in which there was active participation with a subsequent agreed plan for clarification and reinforcement. This classification was developed, agreed, and adopted prior to results synthesis.</P>
<P>We performed meta-analyses for the outcomes of knowledge, mood and death, and for selected satisfaction questions. We carried out a qualitative analysis for all other outcomes. We performed meta-analyses for the outcomes of patient anxiety and depression using both the reported mean and standard deviation of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores and dichotomised data. An advantage of using dichotomised data is that it may provide more clinically meaningful results as it relates to 'cases' of depression and anxiety. However, it has been argued that collapsing ordinal stroke trial data in this way can result in a loss of discrimination between groups such that significant treatment effects are missed (<LINK REF="REF-OAST-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">OAST 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is worthy of comment that we undertook extensive searches for the update of this review, we reviewed over 20,000 titles, yet only four new studies are included. This reflects a lack of precision of the search strategies but may also be a reflection on research progress. We excluded 73 studies, many of which evaluated a complex intervention of which information provision and education are components. Information provision is acknowledged as a key component of stroke service delivery, provision of leaflets is not effective and it would seem that new multi-faceted ways of addressing the information needs of patients and their carers are being developed and evaluated.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-16 14:39:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have identified a total of 21 trials involving 2289 patients and 1290 carer participants. We found some statistically significant but clinically small benefits supporting the general concept that information provision after stroke might improve outcomes. There was evidence of benefit in relation to improved patient and carer knowledge, some aspects of patient-reported satisfaction and for depression scores in patients. Additionally, we found some evidence that interventions using active information provision may be more effective than passive information for the clinically important outcomes of patient depression and anxiety symptoms. However, as we saw no effect with the dichotomous endpoints of anxiety or depression, effects may be small. We found no evidence that information interventions are associated with improvements in activity limitation, participation or changes in service use.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-06-13 11:40:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All included studies were relevant to the review question. There was extensive variation in the content and delivery format of the interventions. This appears to reflect the diversity of interventions provided within clinical practice. Whilst there were sufficient data to address the primary outcomes and the majority of secondary outcomes for this review, there were limited studies to address social activities in carers or resource outcomes. Current practice on information provision after stroke varies nationally and internationally. Our review identified studies from seven countries, thus drawing conclusions on overall applicability of findings internationally is limited.  </P>

<P>Our evaluation of the effect on passive or active information provision on the outcome of stroke knowledge was limited by a lack of a consistently-used measure. Knowledge of stroke was assessed in nine of the 21 studies reviewed (<LINK REF="STD-Lomer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lomer 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pain-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pain 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mant-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mant 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodgers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rodgers 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lowe-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lowe 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maasland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Maasland 2007</LINK>) but as each study had used a different questionnaire, combining the results in a meta-analysis was problematic. Our initial intention was to perform a meta-analysis using dichotomised data (knowledge improved or not improved). However, this was not feasible as in some trials knowledge was measured on one occasion only. We therefore combined the data using the SMD wherein the MDs in outcome between the groups being studied are standardised to account for differences in scoring methods. A disadvantage with this method is that interpretation of the clinical relevance of the treatment effect is difficult as estimated effect sizes serve only as a qualitative measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis (<LINK REF="REF-de-Beurs-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Beurs 1999</LINK>). The results should therefore be treated with some caution. In addition, for the majority of the bespoke questionnaires used to measure knowledge there was limited information available about the reliability of the questions they contained.</P>

<P>Our search strategy was comprehensive and as we were able to identify a number of unpublished studies, publication bias is unlikely. Study selection, data collection and analysis were undertaken by two people, with a third person or consensus meeting used to resolve differences. As a result we are confident of limited bias in the review process for this review.</P>

<P>The positive effects of information on knowledge and depression demonstrated in this review are supported by the findings of reviews of patient education interventions in other conditions. In a meta-analysis, Brown reported that diabetes education had a moderate to large effect on improving patient knowledge (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1990</LINK>). A systematic review of education for adults with rheumatoid arthritis showed a small effect on depression (<LINK REF="REF-Riemsma-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riemsma 2003</LINK>). In accord with our review, an overview of systematic reviews of educational interventions for healthcare professionals reported that passive approaches were generally ineffective and unlikely to result in changes in professionals' behaviour, whereas educational approaches involving active learning were more likely to be effective (<LINK REF="REF-Grimshaw-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimshaw 2001</LINK>). A systematic review of education programmes for patients with diabetic kidney disease found education programmes have beneficial effects on improving patients' knowledge of diabetes and some self-management behavioural changes (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2011</LINK>). A meta-analysis of patient teaching strategies showed that the greatest effect size was associated with reinforcement, independent study, and the use of multiple strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Theis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theis 1995</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Future direction</HEADING>
<P>This review has demonstrated some positive effects of information provision on patient and carer knowledge, aspects of satisfaction and depression. However, the effects, although statistically significant, were clinically small and more effective information provision strategies after stroke need to be developed. The results of the review suggest that a strategy based on an active, rather than passive intervention approach should be adopted. This is perhaps unsurprising as stroke is a complex condition with wide-ranging effects and probably requires a more profound approach to promote recovery than can be achieved by the provision of passive information alone. The specific components of the active information provision (i.e. involving recipients, planned follow-up or reinforcement), which resulted in modest beneficial effects on some outcomes, requires further investigation. Future work should focus on the further development of a generalisable active information intervention that could be robustly evaluated in a large multicentre study.</P>

<P>There is evidence to support the routine provision of information to stroke patients and their families. Providing information has been shown to improve knowledge of stroke, increase some aspects of patient satisfaction, and reduce patient depression scores. However, the reduction in depression score (as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) was small and may not be clinically significant. There is currently no evidence that providing information is effective in improving other patient and carer outcomes. Although the best way to provide information is still not clear, the results of the review suggest that strategies that actively involve patients and carers and include planned follow-up for clarification and reinforcement should be used in routine practice.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-08-28 14:23:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future work should focus on the further development of a generalisable intervention which could be robustly evaluated in a large multicentre study. The evaluation of interventions is currently limited by the lack of a widely recognised measure of stroke knowledge. Attention should be given to given to the design, development and evaluation of a stroke knowledge questionnaire. Consideration should be given to the most appropriate outcome domains for this type of intervention.</P>
