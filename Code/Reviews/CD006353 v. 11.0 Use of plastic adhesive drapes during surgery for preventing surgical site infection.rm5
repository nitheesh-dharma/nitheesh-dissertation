<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-08 01:42:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Following surgery, up to 30% of wounds may become infected. This complication of surgery may cause distress for the patient and lead to higher treatment costs. Many interventions have been designed to reduce postoperative infections. One of these is the use of a drape which adheres to the skin, and through which the surgeon cuts. It is thought that adhesive drapes prevent germs (which may be on the skin) from entering the open wound. This updated review of over 4000 patients, in seven separate trials could find no evidence that adhesive drapes reduce surgical site infection rates, and some evidence that they may increase infection rates.</P>

<P>Surgical site infection has been estimated to occur in about 15% of clean surgery and 30% of contaminated surgery cases. Using plastic adhesive drapes to protect the wound from organisms that may be present on the surrounding skin during surgery is one strategy used to prevent surgical site infection.

<P>We identified no new studies for this fourth update. The review includes five studies involving 3082 participants comparing plastic adhesive drapes with no drapes and two studies involving 1113 participants comparing iodine-impregnated adhesive drapes with no drapes. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the adhesive drape group developed a surgical site infection when compared with no drapes (risk ratio (RR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.48, P = 0.03). Iodine-impregnated adhesive drapes had no effect on the surgical site infection rate (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.66, P = 0.89). Length of hospital stay was similar in the adhesive drape and non-adhesive drape groups.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-27 01:38:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joan  Webster">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-12-04 16:07:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common postoperative complications, and has been estimated to occur in about 15% of cases of clean surgery and 30% of contaminated surgery cases (<LINK REF="REF-Bruce-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruce 2001</LINK>). SSI is associated with longer recovery and further risks of additional complications, therefore increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>). However the incidence rate depends on a number of factors, including the definition of infection used, the intensity of surveillance, whether patients are followed up after discharge, and the prevalence of risk factors in the population studied (<LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2000</LINK>). Risk factors associated with SSI have been grouped into two main categories: patient- or host-related and operation- or procedure-related (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2000</LINK>). Patient characteristics include age, obesity, co morbidities such as diabetes, remote infection, American Society of Anestheologists score (ASA) status, immunosuppressive therapy and length of preoperative hospital stay. Operative risk factors include length of surgery, skin preparation (including shaving and antiseptic skin preparation), type of procedure, antimicrobial prophylaxis and surgical technique (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surgical wounds are frequently classified as either 'clean', 'clean contaminated', 'contaminated' or 'dirty-infected' with the latter categories associated with a higher infection rate (<LINK REF="REF-Lilani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lilani 2005</LINK>). Many countries now benchmark their SSI rate using the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) system risk index, in which wound classification is combined with the ASA status, length of surgery and whether surgery was undertaken laparoscopically to assess risk of SSI (<LINK REF="REF-Gaynes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaynes 2001</LINK>). The additional per patient cost of SSI has been estimated to be between GBP 959 for abdominal hysterectomy to GBP 6103 for limb amputation (<LINK REF="REF-Coello-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coello 2005</LINK>), and over USD 14,000 for an organ space SSI (<LINK REF="REF-Kashimura-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kashimura 2012</LINK>). In the Unites States the estimated annual cost of SSIs is USD 3.5 billion to USD 10 billion (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2011</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-08-08 01:42:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The high additional costs associated with SSI have led to the adoption of strategies that could reduce the incidence of SSI. These strategies include administration of prophylactic antibiotics, use of antiseptic solutions for skin preparation, and the use of sterile disposable materials. One of the commonly used operative strategies to reduce SSI is the plastic adhesive drape (referred to hereafter as adhesive drape). This was first tested 50 years ago on a cohort of patients undergoing a range of abdominal surgeries (<LINK REF="REF-Payne-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Payne 1956</LINK>). The study had three main aims: 1) to test adherence of a polyvinyl drape to the skin; 2) to assess the level of wound contamination; and 3) to assess skin and wound reaction to the drape. Problems were found with adherence of the drape to the skin, despite trialing a number of skin preparation solutions. Positive cultures were recovered from two of the 51 wounds but no skin or wound reactions to the polyvinyl sheet were recorded. Since that time, use of adhesive drapes has become widespread and the product has undergone modifications to improve effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Ritter-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritter 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yoshimura-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yoshimura 2003</LINK>). This review will focus on plastic (defined as polyethylene, polyurethane or polyvinyl) adhesive drapes (e.g. OpSite (Smith and Nephew), Ioban (3M Company, USA), Steridrape (3M United Kingdom) through which an incision is made. Drapes may be either plain or impregnated with an antibacterial agent such as iodine.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-08-08 01:42:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For most SSIs, the source of the invading pathogen (or disease causing biological agent) is the patient's skin (<LINK REF="REF-Nichols-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nichols 1996</LINK>). Consequently, preoperative skin preparation is intended to render the skin as free as possible from bacteria that may enter the surgical wound. Although skin disinfection prior to surgery drastically reduces the number of bacteria on the skin's surface, recolonisation with bacteria from deeper skin layers and hair follicles may occur during the operation (<LINK REF="REF-Fleischmann-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleischmann 1996</LINK>). Sterile surgical drapes, made of either linen or impervious paper, are used to prevent any contact with unprepared surfaces. Adhesive drapes are also used for this purpose and, are generally used in combination with other draping techniques, but they have an additional function; theoretically, they act as a microbial barrier, to prevent migration of contaminating bacteria from the skin to the operative site, for which there is some evidence (<LINK REF="STD-French-1976" TYPE="STUDY">French 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ha_x0027_eri-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ha'eri 1983</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-03-27 01:38:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Joan  Webster">
<P>Although there is theoretical plausibility for the use of adhesive drapes, conflicting reports have been published regarding their usefulness in limiting bacteria around the surgical site (<LINK REF="REF-Katthagen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katthagen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lilly-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lilly 1970</LINK>) and for preventing SSI (<LINK REF="REF-Ritter-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritter 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swenson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Swenson 2008</LINK>). Recolonisation of the skin following antiseptic preparation is also more rapid under adhesive drapes compared with using no adhesive drapes in healthy volunteers (<LINK REF="REF-Falk_x002d_Brynhildsen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falk-Brynhildsen 2013</LINK>) and in cardiac surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Falk_x002d_Brynhildsen-2013a" TYPE="STUDY">Falk-Brynhildsen 2013a</LINK>). Moreover, allergic reactions to povidone iodine are not unknown, and there is at least one case report of allergic contact dermatitis associated with the use of iodophor-impregnated incise drapes (<LINK REF="REF-Zokaie-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zokaie 2011</LINK>). In a related systematic review, <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2009</LINK> found no benefit in using iodophor-impregnated adhesive drapes to prevent postoperative surgical wound infection, when they were used as part of preoperative skin antisepsis. In light of these controversies, and because their use is widespread, a systematic review of the possible benefits and harms of adhesive drapes is justified to guide clinical practice.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed the quality of eligible trials, using a predefined quality assessment form, based on the assessment criteria outlined below. Disagreements between review authors were again resolved by consensus or referral to the editorial base of the Wounds Group. We contacted investigators of included trials to resolve any ambiguities. Each included study was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool addresses six specific domains, namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other issues (e.g. extreme baseline imbalance) (see <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK> for details of criteria on which the judgement was based). We assessed blinding and completeness of outcome data for each outcome separately. We completed a risk of bias table for each eligible study. We discussed any disagreement amongst authors to achieve a consensus.</P>
<P>We presented an assessment of risk of bias using a 'Risk of bias' summary figure, which presents all of the judgments in a cross-tabulation of study by entry. This display of internal validity indicates the weight the reader may give the results of each study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Random sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>In all trials, the trial authors stated that participants were randomly allocated to the intervention. It was unclear how the allocation sequence was generated in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chiu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Psaila-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Psaila 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Segal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 2002</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Cordtz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cordtz 1989</LINK> trial, the National Centre for Hospital Hygiene was responsible for the randomisation process; <LINK REF="STD-Dewan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dewan 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2001</LINK> used a random number table and in the <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1971</LINK> trial, a 'spin of the coin' was used.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Allocation concealment was adequate in three studies. <LINK REF="STD-Segal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 2002</LINK> asked surgeons participating in the trial to draw the treatment allocation from a 'closed sack' at the beginning of surgery and <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dewan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dewan 1987</LINK> used sealed envelopes for group allocation. In other studies the information was not available to judge (unclear), although we contacted trial authors where possible (<LINK REF="STD-Chiu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cordtz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cordtz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Psaila-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Psaila 1977</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding </HEADING>
<P>It was impossible for surgeons to be blinded to the intervention. In the <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dewan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dewan 1987</LINK> trials, outcomes were assessed by staff who were unaware of group assignment. The study investigators inspected wounds for signs of infection in the <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1971</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Segal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 2002</LINK> trials.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>One trial did not indicate the period of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Psaila-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Psaila 1977</LINK>). In the remaining trials, follow-up ranged between five days and six months (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table)<I>. </I>In the <LINK REF="STD-Dewan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dewan 1987</LINK> trial, 46 patients (4.2%) were unable to be tracked and were excluded from the analysis. Based on reported data, follow-up appeared to be complete in all of the other included trials. However, the absence of detailed participant flow charts, or any reference to the number who started the trial and were unable to be followed up, makes assessment of rates difficult, particularly as the follow-up periods were lengthy in some studies, increasing the likelihood of incomplete follow-up.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selective reporting </HEADING>
<P>Results for all expected outcomes were reported in all of the trials.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other bias</HEADING>
<P>
<B>Intention-to-treat analysis</B>
</P>
<P>None of the trials reported group assignment violations, and so it is difficult to assess whether patient outcomes were analysed in the group to which they were assigned. None of the trials specifically reported that they used an intention-to-treat analysis.</P>

<B>Baseline comparability</B>
</P>
<P>No information was available about baseline comparability for five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chiu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cordtz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cordtz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Psaila-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Psaila 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Segal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 2002</LINK>).

<P>Five studies were included in this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Cordtz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cordtz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chiu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Psaila-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Psaila 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2001</LINK>). These studies included 3082 participants, of whom 1556 were in the adhesive drape group and 1526 were in the no adhesive drape group. Although the studies covered a 30-year time span and included a range of different types of surgery, we did not detect any heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). Pooling these studies (fixed-effect model) indicated significantly more SSIs in the adhesive drape group, (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.48, P = 0.03, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).

<P>A single trial of 921 participants analysed infection rates based on preoperative infection risk classifications (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1971</LINK>). In this trial there was no significant effect of using an adhesive drape overall, although infection rates were lower for the no adhesive drape group. Results did not vary depending on baseline risk of infection: RR (overall) 1.20, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.66; RR (for clean wounds) 1.37, 95% CI 0.53 to 3.53; RR (for potentially infected wounds) 1.24, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.92; and RR (for infected wounds) 1.03, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.75 (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). We have reported results from this trial as they were presented in the published paper, even though there was a minor discrepancy between results in the text and those in the tables. For example, in the text, 52 of the 448 cases in the no adhesive drape group became infected. In the table, when cases were classified as clean, potentially infected and infected, totals were 51 infections among 445 cases. Similarly in the adhesive drape group, 67 infections were reported in 473 patients in the text and 67 of 476 in the tables. Attempts to contact investigators were unsuccessful, however, using either set of results did not affect the overall level of significance for this outcome.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ward-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2001</LINK> was the only trial to report length of stay. The analysis was divided into two subgroups: length of stay for those with a SSI (n = 64) and those without a SSI (n = 539). In the infected subgroup, the mean length of stay in the adhesive drape group was 10.4 days (standard deviation (SD) 3.9 days), this was not statistically different from the mean length of stay in the no adhesive drape group (10.2 days, SD 3.9 days). Length of stay was much shorter among those without a SSI. In the adhesive drape group it was 5.2 days (SD 1.3 days) and also 5.2 days (SD 1.3 days) in the no adhesive drape group. We did not find any statistical difference in length of stay between the adhesive drape and no adhesive drape groups in either of these subgroups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).<BR/>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-08-08 01:42:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The conclusions from the original version of this review remain unchanged in this update. Although adhesive drapes are widely used in surgery to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs), the most recent recommendations for control of SSIs remains equivocal regarding the use of adhesive drapes for this purpose (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 2011</LINK>). Consequently, the primary focus of this review was to address the effectiveness of adhesive drapes in preventing SSI. We identified seven studies, including 4195 patients. The main finding of this review is that adhesive drapes are not associated with a reduced infection rate compared with no adhesive drapes, and appear to be associated with an increased risk of infection. The most obvious explanation for this result is that, if adequately disinfected prior to surgery, the patient's skin is unlikely to be a primary cause of SSI; so attempts to isolate the skin from the wound, using an adhesive drape, may be pointless and potentially harmful as excessive moisture under plastic drapes may encourage bacteria residing in hair follicles to migrate to the surface and multiply (<LINK REF="STD-Chiu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chiu 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the only trial to report on length of stay, the use of adhesive drapes did not appear to affect the duration of hospitalisation. There was no available evidence for our other preplanned outcomes of interest; mortality, cost, hospital readmissions or adverse reactions.</P>
<P>Three of the trials included in the review had concurrent interventions. <LINK REF="STD-Segal-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 2002</LINK> had four arms to the study, two of which did not involve a comparison between draping methods. In the analysis, we included the two arms of the study that included a draping comparison only. We believe it is unlikely that this design would have had an impact on the outcome as patients were mutually exclusive. Similarly, in the <LINK REF="STD-Psaila-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Psaila 1977</LINK> trial, ring drapes were used in a third group. <LINK REF="STD-Cordtz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cordtz 1989</LINK> allocated patients to four groups, adhesive drape or no adhesive drape combined with re-disinfection or no re-disinfection. Although there was a lower rate of SSI in the re-disinfection group, the reduction was similar irrespective of the type of drape used.<BR/>
<BR/>Studies were of variable quality with only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dewan-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Dewan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 2001</LINK>) meeting our criteria for high quality (receiving an A rating for the criterion of allocation concealment and for blinding of outcome assessment). The reporting aspects of other trials were poor, making it difficult to assess study quality. However, results of all but one of the trials were in a similar direction, favouring no adhesive drapes, providing some confidence in results. Although verification remains a problem, with many older studies, where contact with authors is impossible. Only the <LINK REF="STD-Psaila-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Psaila 1977</LINK> trial had a non-significant trend favouring adhesive drapes. This was a small study of 116 participants. The authors randomly allocated patients to two groups (adhesive drape and ring drape) and then stated, "in a control group, linen towels alone were used". We included outcomes from the control group in this study as the 'no adhesive drape' group in our analysis, but it was unclear how this group was selected. We are uncertain if any publication bias affected results; we did not find any unpublished studies.</P>
<P>Finally, it is unclear if all of the products used in the trials were similar. Trade names of adhesive drapes have changed over the 30-year time span this review covers. Whether this has led to a qualitative improvement in the product is unclear. No specific details were provided about, for example, the density of the material or its adherability. Irrespective of this, results have remained consistent over time suggesting that any improvements or changes to the product have not affected SSI rates.</P>

<P>Comment: Hello,</P>
<P>I am sending this message as a representative of the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN). We have provided a recommendation for our members based on the conclusion of a Cochrane systematic review with meta analysis. The methodology and conclusions of the researchers are being challenged. We would respectfully request a response regarding the questions posed.</P>
<P>AORN is a nonprofit membership association that represents the professional interests of more than 160,000 perioperative nurses by providing nursing education, standards, and clinical practice resources to enable optimal outcomes for patients undergoing operative and other invasive procedures. AORN&#8217;s 40,000 registered nurse members manage, teach, and practice perioperative nursing, are enrolled in nursing education, or are engaged in perioperative research.</P>
<P>Each year, AORN publishes its Perioperative Standards and Recommended Practices. AORN&#8217;s recommended practices represent what is believed to be optimal and achievable perioperative nursing practice and are based on the highest level of evidence available. The recommended practices describe excellent perioperative nursing practices, promote patient and health care worker safety, and guide policy and procedure development in surgical and invasive procedure settings.</P>
<P>Each recommended practices document focuses on a specific question or topic. The evidence review begins with a systematic literature search conducted using the databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for meta-analyses, randomized and nonrandomized trials and studies, systematic and nonsystematic reviews, and opinion documents and letters to identify articles related to the topic. The search is conducted by a medical librarian employed by AORN. As relevant studies are located, they are independently evaluated and critically appraised according to the strength and quality of the evidence using the Johns Hopkins Evidence-Based Practice Model Evidence Appraisal tools, adapted with permission for use in the AORN Authoring System&#8482;. The reviewers participate in conference calls to discuss the appraisal scores and to establish consensus. Each article or study is assigned an appraisal score as agreed on by the reviewers. The appraisal scores of individual references are noted in brackets after the citations in the references section of the RP document, as applicable.</P>
<P>After the studies are appraised, the collective evidence supporting each intervention within a specific recommendation is rated using the Oncology Nursing Society Putting Evidence into Practice schema. Factors considered in review of collective evidence are the quality of research, quantity of similar studies on a given topic, and consistency of results supporting a recommendation.</P>
<P>In our 2013 AORN &#8220;Recommended practices for sterile technique,&#8221; the following recommendation was made:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Plastic adhesive incise drapes should not be used.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In a systematic review of seven randomized, controlled studies involving 4,195 patients, researchers concluded there was no evidence to support the use of plastic adhesive incise drapes as a method for reducing infection, and that there was some evidence that infection rates may be increased when adhesive incise drapes are used. A meta-analysis of five studies included in the review, which included 3,082 participants, compared plain plastic adhesive incise drapes with no drape and showed a significantly higher number of patients developed a surgical site infection when the adhesive incise drape was used. There was no effect on surgical site infection rates according to a meta analysis of two additional studies, including 1,113 participants, which compared iodine impregnated plastic adhesive incise drapes with no drape. The researchers theorized that the patient&#8217;s skin is not likely to be a primary cause of surgical site infection if it is properly disinfected, and they concluded that attempting to isolate the skin from the surgical wound is of no benefit and may create increased moisture and bacterial growth under adhesive drapes.</P>
<P>The following evidence was cited to support this recommendation:</P>
<P>Webster J, Alghamdi A. Use of plastic adhesive drapes during surgery for preventing surgical site infection. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2011;1.</P>
<P>We are aware that this Cochrane review was updated in 2013, with no new studies identified and the conclusions of the researchers remaining unchanged.</P>
<P>According to our AORN model for individual evidence appraisal, the 2011 systematic review with meta analysis received the highest possible score for quality and strength of evidence, and the collective body of evidence was judged by consensus to be sufficient for qualification as a recommendation for practice.</P>
<P>The AORN recommendation not to use the adhesive incise drapes has received criticism by those who claim that the Cochrane meta analysis was flawed for the following reasons:</P>
<P>1. Clear incise drapes and antimicrobial incise drapes were analyzed separately and have different flaws.<BR/>a. All clear incise drapes were included as one entity despite the fact that not all of the products analyzed in the report are available and that the only common feature of clear incise drapes made by different manufacturers is that they are clear. Any differences in performance as a consequence of production history, adhesive, chemistry, etc., were not considered. As a result, those questioning the recommendation believe the conclusion of the researchers that the clear incise drapes raise the risk of surgical site infection is incorrect.<BR/>2. The meta analysis on iodine containing drapes failed to isolate those cases where infections are influenced by the use of such a drape, i.e., clean and clean-contaminated cases from those where the drape is not of clear value, i.e., contaminated or dirty surgery. As a result, those questioning the recommendation believe the conclusion of the researchers is conceptually flawed.<BR/>a. Those questioning the recommendation believe the use of antimicrobial impregnated incise drapes is commonly restricted to surgical cases where the nominal surgical site infection rate is approximately 1%; therefore, a randomized controlled trial would require in excess of 40,000 subjects.<BR/>3. The Cochrane review contradicts the clinical literature when speculating in the discussion that skin organisms do not cause surgical site infection.<BR/>4. The statistical methods used in the antimicrobial portion of the analysis are inconsistent with the Cochrane Collaboration methodology, in that simply combining data and summing results is an inappropriate method for analysis.</P>
<P>AORN would greatly appreciate Cochrane&#8217;s review of and response to the criticisms outlined above. We have suggested that these individuals contact Cochrane directly; however, this is not likely to happen. We believe it is important for these questions to be addressed. AORN is dedicated to providing recommendations for perioperative practice that are a credible and indispensable resource to perioperative nurses and other members of the surgical team. The use of scientific evidence to support national recommendations about clinical decisions has become an expectation of perioperative health care professionals. Evidence based practice is an essential method of improving patient care by promoting decisions based on scientific evidence rather than on the opinion of the individual health care provider.</P>
<P>Thank you so much for your swift attention to the issues expressed in this message. We look forward to hearing from you in the near future. Please do not hesitate to call or write if you have any questions or need additional clarification.</P>

</P>
<P>The limitations of this Cochrane review include:</P>
<P>1. The clinical studies included in the analysis were not powered to detect a reasonable difference in SSI rates. When studies are not powered to detect a difference in an outcome, the result is that even if there were a difference in SSI rate attributable to the adhesive drape, the studies would conclude that there was no difference. Adequate statistical power is critical because a false-negative result is a predictable consequence including an insufficient number of patients. For example, with a baseline SSI rate of 5% and a reasonable 20% reduction in SSI (to 4%), 18,000 subjects are needed to provide 90% power. Consider the two iodophor-impregnated drape studies included in the Cochrane review; the minimum reduction of SSI rate required to detect an inter-group difference given the number of patients actually included is shown in Table 1.</P>

<P>*For clean and clean-contaminated procedures</P>
<P>Segal et al is thus uninterpretable. Dewan et al would only detect a completely implausible 70% reduction in infection risk; from a practical perspective, it is also uninterpretable.</P>
<P>The same calculations can be made for the other five studies used for clear drapes. For four of the studies the reduction in SSI needed to detect a difference ranged from 45% to 95%, and for one of the studies it was not possible to detect any difference. Thus, none of the clinical studies included in this Cochrane review was powered to detect a reasonable SSI difference.</P>
<P>According to the Evidence Level and Quality Guide in the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice: Model and Guidelines, Second Edition, 2012, Appendix C, these seven studies fall under Level I Evidence (randomized controlled trials or RCT), and a Quality level C &#8220;Low Quality or Major Flaws&#8221; due to &#8220;insufficient sample size for the study design; conclusions cannot be drawn.&#8221;</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Many individual studies included in Cochrane reviews are under-powered. The strength of meta analysis is the pooling of trials which individually may be underpowered but together increase statistical power. Moreover, because reviews are updated every 2 years, Cochrane reviews ensure that evidence is cumulative. Cochrane reviewers are committed to scientific rigor and ensuring that reviews are free of any conflicts of interest. Careful peer review, including statistical review, is undertaken before any review is published.</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>With respect, the authors of the feedback are making the mistake of confusing internal validity with statistical power. These are completely different issues; the former concerns whether the results of the study are likely to be a true reflection of the effect of the intervention on the people in the study (or alternatively whether they reflect a bias in the design or method). Low statistical power does not introduce bias, but it reduces the precision of the estimate, so that one is less likely to detect a real treatment difference (if it exists) as statistically significant. </B>
</I>
</P>
<P>2. For both meta-analyses, clear and iodine-impregnated drapes, the definition of SSI was different among the studies, and the SSI data from all four wound classes was [sic] combined to determine the effect of incise drapes. This is conceptually flawed. There are four wound categories: clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated and dirty. Skin organisms are the major cause of SSI in clean and clean-contaminated surgeries ( <I>1) Mangram A et al. Guideline for the Prevention of Surgical Site Infection, 1999 The Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. Vol 20, No. 4, pp 247 - 278 ; and 2) Anderson D., Surgical Site Infections Infec Dis Clin N Am 25 (2011) 135-153</I>), for which an incise drape may provide benefit by way of reducing microbial contamination of the wound and helping to maintain the sterile field. On the other hand, non-skin pathogens are the primary cause of SSIs for dirty and contaminated procedures.</P>
<P>The Cochrane review failed to distinguish among types of wound class and, to study the effect of adhesive drapes, pooled all the SSI data from all wound classes, which is conceptually flawed.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>This is incorrect. Please see &#8216;</B>

</P>
<P>
<B>3. </B>The clear adhesive incise drape meta-analysis pools SSI data from five studies that used a wide variety of clear incise drapes. There was no distinction among materials, manufacturing processes, adhesives, or important study design factors. For example, two of the studies used linen or cotton drapes which are known to allow fluid and microbial strike-through, two used drapes that are no longer available, and one remarkably did not even identify the drape used (Table 2). In fact, the only characteristic these clear adhesive incise drapes share is their transparency. Comparability in treatment and outcome are required for valid meta-analysis &#8212; a requirement that was unmet in this case.</P>

<I>
<B>This information is quite irrelevant. In fact, using the statement that: &#8220;Linen drapes were used which are known to allow fluid and microbial strike-through (No barrier function)&#8221;, actually provides additional evidence for the failure of incise drapes. That is, plastic drapes could not be shown to be superior, even to these &#8216;flawed&#8217; linen comparisons.</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>4. Five studies were included in the meta-analysis for clear incise drapes. The relative risk of surgical site infections was 1.23 (95% CI 1.02 &#8211; 1.48) which is (barely) statistically significant. However, this purported risk traces to Cordtz et al. (1989), in which the authors specify that the rates of infection were &#8220;the same in draped patients and control.&#8221; The Cochrane Collaboration&#8217;s conclusion that adhesive drapes augment infection risk is supported by only a single study &#8212; from which even the authors did not conclude that risk was increased.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>An important design feature of systematic reviews is the pre-specification of review methodology, including anticipation of major decisions (such as choice of cut-point for statistical significance) whilst still &#8220;blind&#8221; to study results (hence the publication of review protocols). We followed our pre-specified protocol and its decisions faithfully, our methods are transparent. The authors of the feedback seem to be implying that we should alter our pre-specified methods if we don't like the findings, or don't agree with the conclusions of individual studies. This would reflect a traditional approach to reviewing that introduces bias and we are keen to avoid it.</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>The five included trials represent a population of over 3,000 participants. A relative risk of 1.23 indicates a 23% higher risk of infection in the plastic drape group. This is quite an important difference. The review presents the data which speak for themselves; we do avoid (as per Cochrane Collaboration guidance) the use of rather biased and potentially misleading phrases such as &#8220;barely statistically significant&#8221;; &#8220;tending to statistical significance&#8221;; &#8220;almost statistically significant&#8221;. It is not unusual to read a trial report where an author reports that the rates if infection were similar and then when the data presented in the report are analysed there is in fact a statistically significant difference. This is a strength of the independence and rigor of a Cochrane review.</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>5. Antimicrobial prophylaxis, serum glucose concentration, proper hair removal, and maintaining normothermia are important covariates that impact risk of SSI. In most studies, these issues were not even addressed, much less separately reported.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>In randomized controlled trials these factors would be balanced across treatment groups; this is the advantage and strength of randomization. </B>
</I>
</P>
<P>In addition to these limitations, the authors of this Cochrane report conclude that: &#8220;a large, high</P>
<P>quality definite [sic] RCT may be warranted to determine whether modern adhesive drapes do prevent or reduce SSIs&#8221;. Thus, even the Cochrane authors recognize that their conclusions are weak and do not constitute sufficient evidence to support a practice recommendation.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Our conclusion (that further research is needed) reflects the fact that the research in this field has shortcomings in volume and quality. However our conclusion that the available evidence does not suggest that plastic adhesive drapes reduce SSI rates still </B>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2013-08-16 16:03:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Comment: It is the view of 3M that the Cochrane Review titled Use of plastic adhesive incise drapes for preventing surgical site infection published in 2007 and subsequently have been issued as meta-analysis. Since it was issued, the review should have critically highlighted the many shortcomings of the data, the absence of meaningful information, and the inability to determine the effect of incise drapes on surgical site infection rates. This Cochrane Review has recently had a significant impact on product use recommendations in the USA which may have far-reaching repercussions so 3M feels compelled to provide feedback at this time.<BR/>3M has involved external experts (surgeons, biostatisticians, epidemiologists) to review the Cochrane Report and the seven clinical studies included and to provide honest, objective comments. Their consensus is that this Cochrane Review included studies that are flawed in many ways, making it unhelpful for policy.<BR/>The key flaws can be summarized as follows:<BR/>1. Failure in all studies to control for confounding<BR/>2. Likelihood of bias<BR/>3. Absence of power estimates, and thus, potential for type II errors<BR/>4. Heterogeneity of the study populations, definition of primary endpoint (infections) and incise drapes that seem to preclude a meta-analysis<BR/>5. The broad time span of the studies included and the absence of data on over a decade make the conclusions unuseful for the current medical practice</P>
<P>3M does acknowledge that there is a compelling need to conduct further clinical studies to demonstrate the effect of plastic adhesive incise drapes on surgical site infection.<BR/>Since we could not find a way to attach a document in this feedback page, 3M respectfully requests the Cochrane Organization to provide a mechanism, i.e. an e-mail address, to submit a document that includes a detailed scientific review.<BR/>We appreciate in advance your attention to this matter and we look forward to hearing from your soon.</P>

<P>
<I>
<B>Response by the Statistical Editor of the Cochrane Wounds Group</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>With respect to the comments from 3 M:</P>
<P>I don't think the Cochrane review is flawed, it followed the recommended methods. It is the studies contained within the review which are flawed, not the actual review. None of their 5 main points refer to the review methods, they all relate to either the methods of the studies or the evidence as a whole (in terms of heterogeneity and the wide time span).</P>
<P>1. Confounding: this isn't a problem. The review only included randomised controlled trials, as these have been randomised all known and unknown confounders should be balanced between the groups. There is no need to perform any matching, stratified or multivariate analysis. Matching would be inappropriate as is not relevant to an RCT, only observational studies. The other analysis methods could be used, for example, to adjust for centre if the randomisation was stratified by centre, or to account for prognostic factors, maybe type of surgery. But they are not strictly necessary.</P>
<P>2. Bias: I am not clear what is meant by the first point which compared the earlier to the later studies. Both sets of studies are quite likely to contain the same flaws, and again confounding is not an issue. Failure to report the randomisation method and lack of blinding, yes, this is a problem with the studies. Lack of randomisation details is a common problem with reviews but it is not really a form of bias just poor reporting. For the blinding, due to the intervention they couldn't blind the surgeons. But could blind the outcome assessor. The review comments on this in the risk of bias assessment and only 2 trials had blinded outcome assessment. The conclusion in the abstract says that further trials are needed using blinded outcome assessment so I think this has been addressed in the review.</P>
<P>3. Type II errors. True this is a fair comment. This could have been commented on in the review but it wasn't. However the risk of bias tool used doesn't judge whether or not there was a sample size calculation, so it was not discussed in the risk of bias section. But this is a flaw with the studies, and it is a common one. I read a lot of papers and it is the minority which report a sample size calculation.</P>
<P>4. Heterogeneity. Type of surgery and wound class, yes, these are possible causes of heterogeneity and could have been included as subgroup analyses. The review states the planned subgroup analyses (although not necessarily performed due to a lack of data) and one of them was clean compared with contaminated surgery. This has been done, there are forest plots showing results grouped by wound classification. Type of surgery has not been looked at but the thing to note here is that the potential sources of heterogeneity / subgroup analyses should be prespecified in the protocol, and not just explored within the review (as the more subgroup analyses you do the more likely you are to find something). So as surgery type was not prespecified it must not have been thought to be a potential factor. Definition of infection, yes this varied, but that is what the studies reported so the review has to use what the studies say. However the question this review is addressing is the use of adhesive drapes versus not, to address the actual type of drape was not part of the question or the protocol. Which is why it hasn't been done (and one study didn't tell you anyway).</P>
<P>5. Broad time span. Yes this is a good point. It is a wide time frame and presumably things have changed quite a lot since 1971. This could have been discussed more by the review. They do cover it briefly in terms of the changes in the product over 30 years but the points about antibiotic resistance of organisms could be added. It might also be useful to do a sensitivity analysis removing the 2 oldest studies to see how it changes the results.</P>
<P>Additional comments:</P>
<P> Lack of reporting of bacteria and MRSA, single institutions, all fair comment.<BR/> Increase in SSI, the results of analysis 1.1 do show this. Three of the five studies do show more SSI with the drapes although not statistically significant in 2 of them.</P>
<P>Conclusions.</P>
<P>The meta-analyses are not flawed. Some of the included studies were at moderate risk of bias, some were unclear for many aspects. This is covered by the discussion of the review. The review can only really discuss those aspects assessed by the risk of bias tool. It does highlight shortcomings in the evidence but aspects such as the power of the studies, and the materials and manufacturing processes of the drapes were outside the review's scope and not part of the protocol which is why they haven't been addressed.</P>

<B>Comments by Professor J. Martin Bland, Professor of Health Statistics </B>
</P>
<P>The critique raises five points:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Failure in all studies to control for confounding.</LI>
<LI>Likelihood of bias.</LI>
<LI>Absence of power estimates and thus the potential for type II errors.</LI>
<LI>Heterogeneity of the study populations, definition of primary endpoint (infections) and incise drapes that seem to preclude a meta-analysis.</LI>
<LI>The broad time span of the studies included and the absence of data in over a decade make the conclusions not useful for current medical practices.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<B>1. Failure in all studies to control for confounding.</B>
</P>
<P>&#8220;Confounding&#8221; occurs when the outcome variable, infection, and the explanatory variable, drapes, are both related to a third, pre-existing variable which affects the apparent relationship between them. Confounding should not occur in a randomised trial, because the randomised groups are from the same population. They should not differ in any way other than those arising by chance. The critics say:</P>
<P>
<I>&#8220;In no study was there matching on the front end, a stratified analysis on the back end or a multivariate analysis. Examples of such confounding variables include age, co-morbidities, obesity, serum glucose concentration, proper hair removal, normothermia, and receipt of antibiotics preoperatively and their timing relative to incisions. All of these important covariates impact the risk of SSI.&#8221;</I>
</P>
<P>If there are covariates which are prognostic, related to the outcome variable, it is a good idea to adjust for them. This will improve the precision of estimates. This can only be done using the participant level data, so should be done by the original investigators. It is a feature of clinical trials that most of them could have been done better. If all trials were done to the highest standard, we would not need systematic reviews, but the world is not like that. The effect of not adjusting is to widen confidence intervals and increase P values. It does not invalidate or bias the trial; it makes it inefficient.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Likelihood of bias.</B>
</P>
<P>The critics say:</P>
<P>
<I>&#8220;If the initial 4 studies performed between 1971 and 1989 (3480 subjects), versus those from 1993 to 2001 (826 subjects), had errors (confounding issues or bias) in favor of no efficacy, bias would be likely.&#8221;</I>
</P>
<P>There is no doubt that this is a true statement. This true statement does not imply that there is, in fact, any bias. As noted above, there should not be confounding in a randomised trial and failure to adjust for covariates does not produce bias. The critics also say:</P>
<P>
<I>&#8220;The failure to provide a recorded randomization method and the lack of blinding are both well known to lead to bias.&#8221;</I>
</P>
<P>It is true that both of these are potential sources of bias. They do not necessarily lead to bias. General experience is that biases are usually in favour of the test treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>3. Absence of power estimates and thus the potential for type II errors.</B>
</P>
<P>The critics say:</P>
<P>
<I>&#8220;All seven studies in the meta-analyses were grossly underpowered and thus the ability to find a difference &#8211; if one existed &#8211; is negated, even in the meta analysis. None of the seven clinical studies included in the analyses were powered to detect a reasonable difference in SSI rates. Adequate statistical power is critical because a false-negative result is a predictable consequence of including an insufficient number of patients. For example, with a baseline SSI rate of 5% and a reasonable 20% reduction in SSI (to 4%), 18,000 subjects are needed to provide 90% power.&#8221;</I>
</P>
<P>This calculation is correct. Many, if not most, randomised clinical trials are underpowered. However, when the trials have been carried out, we should not refuse to analyse them on these grounds. Systematic review was introduced to deal with just this problem and enables us to get the maximum amount of information from the inadequate data available. Confidence intervals, the preferred method to report results from trial, do not give us a yes or no answer but a range of plausible values for the treatment effect. In this review, for adhesive drapes the risk of SSI is estimated to be between 1.02 and 1.48 times the risk without adhesive drapes, which does not include the critics&#8217; postulated 0.80, and for iodine impregnated adhesive drapes the risk of SSI is estimated to be between 0.66 and 1.60 times the risk without adhesive drapes, which does include the critics&#8217; postulated 0.80. Thus we have good evidence that adhesive drapes increase the risk of infection, though possibly only by as much as 3%, and that iodine impregnated adhesive drapes may reduce the risk of SSI by up to a third and may increase it by up to two-thirds.</P>
<P>Significance test approaches are not as informative. The fact that a particular study could not produce a significant difference alone does not mean it is not informative and interpretable in a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>4. Heterogeneity of the study populations, definition of primary endpoint (infections) and incise drapes that seem to preclude a meta-analysis.</B>
</P>
<P>There is certainly clinical heterogeneity between these studies. It may be that adhesive drapes work completely differently in different surgical procedures and using different wounds definitions, to the extent that an average effect is of no interest. If that is true, we would need very large trials separately for each type of surgery and each definition of infection. Is it plausible that the effect of adhesive drapes varies so much? This would make it very difficult to know when they could be used, in the absence of these trials. But surely while we wait for them we should make the best use of what data are currently available.</P>
<P>We could note that there is no evidence of statistical heterogeneity in SSI relative risk, though the clinical heterogeneity would certainly lead me to prefer a random effects model to be used. Using current methods, and the random effects and the fixed effect analyses will be identical. There is no statistical reason to suppose that the clinical heterogeneity produces heterogeneity of effects.</P>
<P>
<B>5. The broad time span of the studies included and the absence of data in over a decade make the conclusions not useful for current medical practices.</B>
</P>
<P>The authors say:</P>
<P>
<I>&#8220;The first study was performed 41 years ago and the last 31 years afterwards, and no studies were included for the last 11 years. This is problematic. The practices of medicine and surgery have changed greatly; infection control and quality of care have become more visible and more effective over the time span; standardized surveillance is more commonplace now. The fact that there are no studies in over a decade during which time safety has emerged as a priority and guidelines have become more common and are more detailed suggest little relevance to practice today. Furthermore, the organisms causing infections have changed over 41 years and become more antibiotic resistant, prompting some changes in perioperative prophylaxis.&#8221;</I>
</P>
<P>While this is true, should we need to keep randomising people to treatments where there has been past evidence of harm, in case things have changed? We can only analyse the data available and if we have a system where established effective treatments have to be continually retrialled, things will grind to a halt.</P>
<P>
<B>Additional Comments</B>
</P>
<P>The critics say: <I>&#8220;There was failure to show the spectrum of bacteria implicated in 6/7 studies. In the Chiu study with 14 SSIs, 8 were caused by MRSA (perioperative prophylaxis with an ineffective &#8220;cephalosporin&#8221;), suggesting a true problem at the hospital, such as an outbreak, and opportunity for co-founding in the study.&#8221; </I>
<BR/>The point that the spectrum of bacteria implicated might have been informative is a valid one, but there is nothing that reviewers can do about this.</P>
<P>The critics say: <I>&#8220;Six of the seven studies were performed in a single institution making generalization problematic.&#8221; </I>
<BR/>By looking at the studies combined, a greater variety of settings is studied, which is a strength of systematic review. This point is nonsensical.</P>
<P>The critics say: <I>&#8220;The Cochrane Review authors concluded was that there was some evidence that plastic adhesive incise drapes increase infection rates, but there is no such evidence. Five studies were included in the meta-analysis for clear incise drapes. The relative risk of surgical site infections was 1.23 (95% CI 1.02 &#8211; 1.48) which is (barely) statistically significant. However, this purported risk traces to Cordtz et al. (1989), in which the authors specify that the rates of infection were &#8220;the same in draped patients and control.&#8221; The Cochrane Collaboration&#8217;s conclusion that adhesive drapes augment infection risk is supported by only a single study &#8212; from which even the authors did not conclude that risk was increased.&#8221; </I>
<BR/>The confidence interval would certainly convince me that the evidence is that adhesive drapes do not reduce infection. It does not depend on one study alone; four of the five studies have a point estimate of the relative risk greater than 1.00 and the fifth is the smallest study in terms of numbers randomised. That Cordtz <I>et al.</I> choose to interpret &#8220;not significant&#8221; as &#8220;the same&#8221; is not the fault of reviewers. This is a very common misunderstanding among clinical researchers.<BR/>

<B>OBJECTIVE</B>
<BR/>The objective of this review is to evaluate the limitations of the Cochrane Review titled &#8220;Use of plastic adhesive drapes during surgery for preventing surgical site infection&#8221;.</P>
<P>
<B>REVIEW</B>
<BR/>The Cochrane review consisted of two meta-analyses that assessed the effect of adhesive incise drapes on surgical site infection (SSI) rates:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Five trials with the use of clear adhesive incise drapes (non-antimicrobial)</LI>
<LI>Two trials with the use of iodine-impregnated adhesive incise drapes.</LI>
</OL>
<P>This Cochrane review is flawed in many ways and the key limitations are summarized below and are also presented in tabular form in the Appendix.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Failure in all studies to control for confounding.</LI>
<LI>Likelihood of bias.</LI>
<LI>Absence of power estimates and thus the potential for type II errors.</LI>
<LI>Heterogeneity of the study populations, definition of primary endpoint (infections) and incise drapes that seem to preclude a meta-analysis.</LI>
<LI>The broad time span of the studies included and the absence of data in over a decade make the conclusions not useful for current medical practices.</LI>
</OL>
<P>1<U>. <B>Confounding</B>.</U> In no study was there matching on the front end, a stratified analysis on the back end or a multivariate analysis. Examples of such confounding variables include age, co-morbidities, obesity, serum glucose concentration, proper hair removal, normothermia, and receipt of antibiotics preoperatively and their timing relative to incisions. All of these important covariates impact the risk of SSI.<BR/>
<I>
<B>We agree that certain risk factors will impact on an individuals&#8217; risk of acquiring a SSI. However, this Cochrane review only included RCTs, which by definition do not experience confounding (if randomisation is properly conducted &#8211; hence the importance of Risk of Bias Assessment). </B>
</I>
<BR/>
<I>
<B>In the current review, no baseline data were reported for the studies of Cordez (1989), Jackson (1971) or Psaila (1977). Whereas Chiu (1993), Dewan (1987), Segal (2002) and Ward (2001) all indicated that patients were matched for all relevant risk factors at baseline.</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>
<U>
<B>2. Bias.</B>
</U>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>If the initial 4 studies performed between 1971 and 1989 (3480 subjects), versus those from 1993 to 2001 (826 subjects), had errors (confounding issues or bias) in favor of no efficacy, bias would be likely.</LI>
<LI>The failure to provide a recorded randomization method and the lack of blinding are both well known to lead to bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<I>
<B>Please see above. All studies are assessed for their individual risk of bias in six domains (sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of outcome data, selective reporting, and other biases, such as baseline imbalance). In the table &#8216;Characteristics of included studies&#8217;, shortcomings of each trial are reported against each of these criteria. Many trial reports, published before the CONSORT statement, failed to provide sufficient information to be able to judge the quality of the trials&#8217; conduct. Because of this, it is unclear, in many studies, if bias existed or not. It may have been the case that some requirements outlined in the CONSORT Statement may have been met but simply was not reported. </B>
</I>
</P>
<P>
<U>
<B>3. Type II errors</B>
</U>. All seven studies in the meta-analyses were grossly underpowered and thus the ability to find a difference &#8211; if one existed &#8211; is negated, even in the meta-analysis.<BR/>
<I>
<B>We agree with the feedback that the studies are underpowered, but they still contain information; the value of which is enhanced by meta-analysis (by increasing the power). The implied alternative is that we ignore all studies that were individually underpowered or had design flaws. That would consign most of all the medical research ever conducted to the waste bin. </B>
</I>
</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Moreover, because reviews are updated every 2 years, Cochrane reviews ensure that evidence is cumulative. Cochrane reviewers are committed to scientific rigor and ensuring that reviews are free of any conflicts of interest. Careful peer review, including statistical review, is undertaken before any review is published.</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>4. <B>Heterogeneity</B>. Besides leading to confounding and bias, this aspect of the report usually precludes a meta-analysis. The most obvious issues include:</P>
<P> Types of surgery: abdominal &#8211; general (N=3), cardiac (N=1), C-section (N=2), and hip surgery (N=1).<BR/>
<I>
<B>There was no statistical heterogeneity between studies (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). In addition, all of the studies trended towards favouring the &#8216;no drape&#8217; group (with the exception of the smallest study (</B>

<I>
<B>)</B>
</I>
</P>
<P> Wound Class. The SSI data from all four wound classes were combined to determine the effect of incise drapes. This is conceptually flawed. There are four wound categories: clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated and dirty. Skin organisms are the major cause of SSI in clean and clean-contaminated surgeries (1, 2), for which an incise drape may provide benefit by way of reducing microbial contamination of the wound and helping to maintain the sterile field. On the other hand, non-skin pathogens are the primary cause of SSIs for dirty and contaminated procedures. The Cochrane review failed to distinguish among types of wound class and, to study the effect of adhesive drapes, pooled all the SSI data from all wound classes, which is conceptually flawed. <I>
<B>This is incorrect. Please see &#8216;</B>

</I>
<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>
<I>
<B>, irrespective of wound category, the SSI rate was not statistically lower in the plastic drape group, in any study.</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Definition of Infection. The inconsistency of definitions for an infection is remarkable from very nonspecific definitions such as &#8220;tenderness&#8221; to a vague definition of &#8220;clinical evidence&#8221; to a more robust definition of &#8220;pus&#8221; &#8211; the single definition in two studies. <I>
<B>As definitions of infections frequently vary between studies (and sometimes are absent) our inclusion criteria clearly stated that: &#8220;For the purposes of this review we accepted the definition of SSI used in the trial&#8221;. This is a pragmatic, and we feel entirely defensible, approach. </B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Clear Incise Drape Used. The clear adhesive incise drape meta-analysis pools SSI data from five studies that used a wide variety of clear incise drapes. There was no distinction among materials, manufacturing processes, adhesives, or important study design factors. For example, two of the studies used drapes that are no longer available, two of the studies used additionally linen or cotton drapes which are known to allow fluid and microbial strike-through, and one, remarkably, did not even identify the drape used (Table 2). In fact, the only characteristic these clear adhesive incise drapes share is their transparency. Comparability in treatment and outcome are required for valid meta-analysis &#8212; a requirement that was unmet in this case. <I>
<B>This information is quite irrelevant. In fact, using the statement that: &#8220;Linen drapes were used which are known to allow fluid and microbial strike-through (No barrier function)&#8221;, actually provides additional evidence for the failure of incise drapes. That is, plastic drapes could not be shown to be superior, even to these &#8216;flawed&#8217; linen comparisons.</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>5. <B>Broad time span</B>. The first study was performed 41 years ago and the last 31 years afterwards, and no studies were included for the last 11 years. This is problematic. The practices of medicine and surgery have changed greatly; infection control and quality of care have become more visible and more effective over the time span; standardized surveillance is more commonplace now. The fact that there are no studies in over a decade during which time safety has emerged as a priority and guidelines have become more common and are more detailed suggest little relevance to practice today. Furthermore, the organisms causing infections have changed over 41 years and become more antibiotic resistant, prompting some changes in perioperative prophylaxis. <I>
<B>Despite the time span, head to head comparisons between no adhesive plastic drape versus use of an adhesive plastic drape have consistently shown no advantage associated with adhesive drapes. We would be pleased to include information from independent clinical trials in any future update, Cochrane reviews are updated on average every two years but will be updated earlier in the light of substantial new evidence becoming available.</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>
<B>Additional Comments</B>
</P>
<P>There was failure to show the spectrum of bacteria implicated in 6/7 studies. In the Chiu study with 14 SSIs, 8 were caused by MRSA (perioperative prophylaxis with an ineffective &#8220;cephalosporin&#8221;), suggesting a true problem at the hospital, such as an outbreak, and opportunity for co-founding in the study.<I>
<B>This observation is irrelevant; the same conditions existed for both arms of the trial.</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Six of the seven studies were performed in a single institution making generalization problematic. <I>
<B>Single-centre trials are not unusual, hence the usefulness of systematic reviews.</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>The Cochrane Review authors concluded was that there was some evidence that plastic adhesive incise drapes increase infection rates, but there is no such evidence. Five studies were included in the meta-analysis for clear incise drapes. The relative risk of surgical site infections was 1.23 (95% CI 1.02 &#8211; 1.48) which is (barely) statistically significant. However, this purported risk traces to Cordtz et al. (1989), in which the authors specify that the rates of infection were &#8220;the same in draped patients and control.&#8221; The Cochrane Collaboration&#8217;s conclusion that adhesive drapes augment infection risk is supported by only a single study &#8212; from which even the authors did not conclude that risk was increased. <I>
<B>Again, this is why systematic reviews are so useful, results from one trial are often inconclusive and trial authors can make statements which are not always supported by the data they present. Cochrane review authors are independent, they have no conflicts of interest and present the data and draw conclusions independently of any affiliations. In addition, a statistically significant 23% increase in risk of SSI in the plastic drape group seems to us to be clinically important and ignoring it would be indefensible.</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>
<B>CONCLUSIONS</B>
</P>
<P>The meta-analyses by Webster and Alghandi as published in the Cochrane Review is flawed and should not have been accepted. It fails to critically highlight the many shortcomings for the data, the absence of meaningful information, and the inability to determine the effect of incise drapes on surgical site infection rates.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>We do not agree with the assessment of the reviewers from 3M. The review was carefully peer refereed and we are confident in its results. </B>
</I>
</P>
<P>There is a compelling need to conduct further clinical studies to determine the effect of plastic adhesive incise drapes on surgical site infection rates.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>We would be pleased to see published, independent, robust RCTs of plastic adhesive drapes to add to our review in future updates.</B>
