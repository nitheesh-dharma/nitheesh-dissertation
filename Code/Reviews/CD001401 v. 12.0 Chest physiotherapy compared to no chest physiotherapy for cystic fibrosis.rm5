<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of using chest physiotherapy compared to no physiotherapy for clearing excess mucus from the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>The lungs of people with cystic fibrosis produce excess mucus. This leads to repeated infection and tissue damage in the lungs. It is important to clear the mucus using drugs and chest physiotherapy. Physiotherapy clears mucus by different techniques or by using mechanical devices or both. Daily physiotherapy takes a lot of time and trouble so it is important to know if it works. We searched for studies where the people taking part had equal chances of being in the group using chest physiotherapy or the group with no chest physiotherapy. This is an update of previously published reviews.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to: 02 June 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included eight studies in the review reporting results from a total of 96 people with cystic fibrosis. All the studies were very different and some looked at multiple treatments compared to no treatment. One study looked at autogenic drainage, six considered conventional chest physiotherapy, three considered oscillating positive expiratory pressure, seven considered positive expiratory pressure and one considered high pressure positive expiratory pressure. We could not combine the results to analyse them statistically.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Summarising the findings of these eight studies, we found that methods of clearing the airways have short-term benefits for moving mucus. Three studies measured sputum which had been coughed up and found those people using chest physiotherapy coughed up more sputum; four studies measured radioactive tracer clearance and found increased clearance with chest physiotherapy. Only one study reported an improvement in lung function in some of the treatment groups; but three other studies who reported this outcome did not find any significant effect from chest physiotherapy. At present there is no clear evidence of long-term effects in chest clearance, quality of life or survival with chest physiotherapy.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Most of the included studies had some design problems which may affect confidence in the results. In just under half of the studies it was not clear as to whether all of the results were reported.</P>
<P>In physiotherapy studies the person and their physiotherapist will know which treatment they are receiving and this may affect some of the findings. Half the studies looked at amount of sputum coughed up and lung function testing, with a quarter asking the person's views on the treatment and these results may have been affected by being aware of the treatment. In all of the studies it was not clear if the person was experienced in carrying out the treatment. This may affect how well they were able to do the treatment which could affect confidence in the results.</P>

<P>Chest physiotherapy is widely used in people with cystic fibrosis in order to clear mucus from the airways. This is an updated version of previously published reviews.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-06-09 12:49:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.</P>
<P>Date of the most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 02 June 2015.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-08-14 14:45:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical studies in which a form of chest physiotherapy (airway clearance technique) were taken for consideration in people with cystic fibrosis compared with either no physiotherapy treatment or spontaneous cough alone.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-09-18 12:27:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. There was heterogeneity in the published outcomes, with variable reporting which meant pooling of the data for meta-analysis was not possible.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-11-04 12:22:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The searches identified 157 studies, of which eight cross-over studies (data from 96 participants) met the inclusion criteria. There were differences between studies in the way that interventions were delivered, with several of the intervention groups combining more than one treatment modality. One included study looked at autogenic drainage, six considered conventional chest physiotherapy, three considered oscillating positive expiratory pressure, seven considered positive expiratory pressure and one considered high pressure positive expiratory pressure. Of the eight studies, six were single-treatment studies and in two, the treatment intervention was performed over two consecutive days (once daily in one, twice daily in the other). This enormous heterogeneity in the treatment interventions prevented any meta-analyses from being performed. Blinding of participants, caregivers or clinicians in airway clearance studies is impossible; therefore this was not considered as a high risk of bias in the included studies. Lack of protocol data made assessment of risk of bias unclear for the majority of other criteria.</P>
<P>Four studies, involving 28 participants, reported a higher amount of expectorated secretions during chest physiotherapy as compared to a control. One study, involving 18 participants, reported no significant differences in sputum weight. In five studies radioactive tracer clearance was used as an outcome variable. In three of these (28 participants) it was reported that chest physiotherapy, including coughing, increased radioactive tracer clearance as compared to the control period. One study (12 participants) reported increased radioactive tracer clearance associated with all interventions compared to control, although this was only reported to have reached significance for postural drainage with percussion and vibrations; and the remaining study (eight participants) reported no significant difference in radioactive tracer clearance between chest physiotherapy, without coughing, compared to the control period. Three studies, involving 42 participants reported no significant effect on pulmonary function variables following intervention; but one further study did report significant improvement in pulmonary function following the intervention in some of the treatment groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The results of this review show that airway clearance techniques have short-term effects in the terms of increasing mucus transport. No evidence was found on which to draw conclusions concerning the long-term effects.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-06-15 13:19:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-07-16 16:08:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common inherited life-limiting disorder. Persistent infection and inflammation within the lungs are the major contributory factors to severe airway damage and loss of respiratory function over the years (<LINK REF="REF-Cantin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Konstan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstan 1997</LINK>). Excessive production of thick mucus may overwhelm the normal mucus transport mechanisms and thereby lead to airway obstruction and mucus plugging (<LINK REF="REF-Zach-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zach 1990</LINK>). Removal of airway secretions is therefore an integral part of the management of CF. A variety of methods are used to help remove secretions from the lungs, some physical, i.e. chest physiotherapy, and some chemical, i.e. medications and inhalation therapies. Treatment methods which improve mucus clearance are considered essential in optimising respiratory status and reducing the progression of lung disease.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-07-16 16:09:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Chest physiotherapy has, for a long time, played an important role in assisting the clearance of airway secretions and is usually commenced as soon as the diagnosis of CF is made. However, the performance of chest physiotherapy may be unpleasant, uncomfortable, and time-consuming. Early chest physiotherapy relied on techniques for which the assistance of another person, such as a physiotherapist or relative, was needed and which included postural drainage, percussion, vibration, and shaking performed by an assistant and huffing or coughing. More recently, several self-administered alternatives to these conventional techniques have been developed. These include the active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT), forced expiration technique (FET), autogenic drainage (AD), positive expiratory pressure (PEP), flutter, high frequency chest compression (HFCC) and exercise. We have defined all of these methods under the interventions below. These methods of treatment help to give the individual with CF more independence in their management.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-06-15 13:19:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Despite the expansion of treatment modalities, there remains little evidence supporting their efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Prasad-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Schans-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Schans 1996</LINK>). A previous meta-analysis concluded that standard chest physiotherapy resulted in more mucus (phlegm or sputum) expectoration than no treatment in people with CF (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1995a</LINK>). Similarly a review into airway clearance techniques used in the management of non-CF related bronchiectasis concluded that there may be improvements in sputum expectoration, selected measures of lung function and health-related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2013</LINK>). Lee, however, also highlighted that data to establish long term efficacy of airway clearance techniques in this population were lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2013</LINK>). In contrast to these findings a further review by Osadnik suggested the benefits achieved from airway clearance techniques for people with COPD may only confer small benefits in some of the measured clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Osadnik-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osadnik 2012</LINK>). However, COPD is less frequently associated with the excessive sputum production as often manifested in CF or non-CF related bronchiectasis.</P>
<P>This review is an update of previously published reviews (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Schans-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Schans 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warnock-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnock 2013</LINK>). It compares the efficacy of any of the above interventions as compared to no treatment or spontaneous coughing alone. Subsequent reviews will aim to determine whether a specific type of treatment offers any advantage over others.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-05-29 14:50:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>In the original review, the authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies using a system as described by Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). In the event of disagreement about the quality score, they asked an independent author from a third centre to review the paper(s) in question. The authors considered aspects such as generation of randomisation sequence, the concealment of this sequence, degree of blinding and whether data were reported completely.</P>
<P>For the 2013 update of the review, the new author team assessed the risk of bias of the included studies according to the methods described in Chapter 8 of <I>The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Specifically, the authors judged there to be either a high, low or unclear risk of bias from sequence generation, concealment of sequence allocation, blinding (from participants, clinicians and outcome assessors), missing data and reporting biases.</P>

The remaining studies all included both male and female participants: eight male, eight female (<LINK REF="STD-Braggion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Braggion 1995</LINK>); 11 male, eight female (<LINK REF="STD-Jarad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jarad 2010</LINK>); six male, four female (<LINK REF="STD-Mortensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mortensen 1991</LINK>); five male, nine female (<LINK REF="STD-Pfleger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pfleger 1992</LINK>). The studies included participants with a wide range of disease severity. The mean (SD) FEV<SUB>1</SUB>% predicted was reported in three studies: 61.7% (17%) (<LINK REF="STD-Braggion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Braggion 1995</LINK>); 53% (21%) (<LINK REF="STD-Pfleger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pfleger 1992</LINK>) and 70% (24%) (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Schans-1991" TYPE="STUDY">van der Schans 1991</LINK>).

Braggion also used postural drainage combined with vibrations, deep breathing, percussion and coughing after each of the active therapies as well as the control sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Braggion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Braggion 1995</LINK>). Elkins compared postural drainage with percussion and vibrations, PEP, oscillating PEP and matched cough (where participants coughed the maximum numbers of coughs during any of the preceding intervention groups,including control) (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2005</LINK>). One study compared PEP breathing, AD, PEP breathing followed by AD or AD followed by PEP breathing with a control period (<LINK REF="STD-Pfleger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pfleger 1992</LINK>). Van der Schans also used PEP in comparison with control, but varied the water pressure between the two active treatment arms (5 cm water pressure and 15 cm water pressure respectively) and followed this with directed vigorous coughing (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Schans-1991" TYPE="STUDY">van der Schans 1991</LINK>). Jarad investigated the effect of the flutter and HAT compared to control (although the HAT group has been excluded from this review as it is not a recognised form of airway clearance) (<LINK REF="STD-Jarad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jarad 2010</LINK>). The remaining study compared directed vigorous cough, postural drainage, postural drainage with mechanical percussion and conventional physiotherapy with control (<LINK REF="STD-Rossman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rossman 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>The control intervention in three studies was directed coughing (<LINK REF="STD-Pfleger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pfleger 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rossman 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Schans-1991" TYPE="STUDY">van der Schans 1991</LINK>) and in four studies it was spontaneous coughing (<LINK REF="STD-Braggion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Braggion 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Falk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mortensen 1991</LINK>). The control intervention in the study by Jarad was a placebo form of HAT which involved sitting in a bath with sounds audible, but without delivery of the acoustic waves thought to provide external thoracic oscillation therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Jarad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jarad 2010</LINK>).</P>

<ALLOCATION MODIFIED="2013-07-09 16:40:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>All eight studies were described as randomised; however, only one study gave any details on the method of randomisation (Latin square design) (<LINK REF="STD-Braggion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Braggion 1995</LINK>). We therefore judged the studies to have an unclear risk of bias for the generation of the randomisation sequence, except for the Braggion study which had a low risk of bias.</P>
<P>None of the eight studies discussed the concealment of the allocation and so all were deemed to have an unclear risk of bias.</P>

<P>It is impossible to blind participants and caregivers or clinicians to physiotherapy interventions, but it is possible to blind the outcome assessors to the intervention. Only one study was described as single-blind, which we assume refers to the outcome assessors being blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Mortensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mortensen 1991</LINK>). Since, except for the outcomes well-being and therapy compliance, all other outcome measurements are physiological data, we do not consider the fact that participants, caregivers or clinicians were not blinded as an important source of bias.</P>

<P>In order to assess for selective reporting, we planned to compare the study protocols with the final publication. However, it was only possible to obtain a study protocol for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Jarad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jarad 2010</LINK>). The protocol in this instance stated secondary outcome data would be collected on oxygen saturation (SpO<SUB>2)</SUB>, respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) during the interventions and this was confirmed in the 'Methods' section of the published paper; however, the published paper made no further reference to these variables in the 'Results' or 'Discussion' sections suggesting selective reporting and giving a high risk of bias.</P>
<P>Two of the included studies were only available in abstract form; therefore there was insufficient information available to assess for selective reporting.

<P>Mortenson was the only study in the current review to report a source of funding (<LINK REF="STD-Mortensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mortensen 1991</LINK>). However, because the interventions being studied in the remaining studies either do not require equipment or use equipment widely available it was not considered by the authors that potential funding sources for the other studies in the review represented a significant risk of bias.</P>
<P>The study by Jarad included sputum wet and dry weight as an outcome, but did not report the unit of measurement in either the protocol or published study (<LINK REF="STD-Jarad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jarad 2010</LINK>). If it is assumed that the measurement is in grams, then the participants appear to be non or low sputum producers (sputum wet weight ranging from 0.0 g to 5.3 g during the interventions analysed in this review). This would likely have impacted on treatment efficacy and the ability to detect a difference between control and active treatment groups.</P>
<P>The efficacy of any physiotherapy technique may be influenced by the proficiency and familiarity of the patient with that technique. Therefore, naivety of patients to some but not all interventions being studied could introduce a potential source of bias. No reference is made to how experienced patients were with each intervention in six of the studies reviewed (<LINK REF="STD-Braggion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Braggion 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mortensen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rossman 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Schans-1991" TYPE="STUDY">van der Schans 1991</LINK>). In the study by Jarad, there was the potential for this practised effect as four of the eighteen participants' usual physiotherapy technique was the flutter with the remainder of participants naive to this treatment intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Jarad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jarad 2010</LINK>).

<P>Four studies, involving 28 participants, found a higher amount of expectorated secretions during chest physiotherapy compared to the control period (<LINK REF="STD-Braggion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Braggion 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mortensen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pfleger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pfleger 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rossman 1982</LINK>). Braggion found a mean wet weight of expectorated secretions during the control day of 6 g and during the chest physiotherapy sessions 23 g to 30 g (<LINK REF="STD-Braggion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Braggion 1995</LINK>). Mortenson reported medians and ranges, making comparisons between studies difficult but did report a significantly larger (P &lt; 0.01) sputum weight in grams with FET + PEP median (range) 8.6 (3.5 to 19.9) and PD + FET 8.0 (2.3 to 13.9) compared to control 0.0 (0.0 to 2.1) during the treatment period; but this increase in sputum weight was not sustained in the post-intervention follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Mortensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mortensen 1991</LINK>). In the paper by Pfleger, the mean (SD) weight of expectorated mucus was presented for each treatment arm as a figure, but no specific data is given in the text. Data extracted from the graphs show that during spontaneous coughing the mean weight of expectorated mucus was approximately 17 g, which was less than during the three forms of chest physiotherapy (range 34 g to 45 g) (<LINK REF="STD-Pfleger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pfleger 1992</LINK>). Pfleger also reported that PEP alone produced the highest amount of sputum, followed by a combination of PEP and AD (in either order); AD alone produced the lowest volume of sputum (<LINK REF="STD-Pfleger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pfleger 1992</LINK>). Rossman found a statistically significant higher volume of expectorated secretions during the different forms of chest physiotherapy compared to the control session (<LINK REF="STD-Rossman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rossman 1982</LINK>). Jarad, however, found no significant differences in wet or dry weight of expectorated sputum between the placebo or flutter groups; the P values and absolute value of measurement for sputum weight were not stated in the results making it difficult to draw comparisons between the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jarad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jarad 2010</LINK>).</P>

Elkins found the mean percentage of radioactivity cleared from each region of interest (% C30) was 8.4% greater during postural drainage with percussion and vibrations compared to control (95% CI 2.4 to 14.5; P = 0.017). Elkins also reported greater % C30 with PEP, oscillating PEP and matched cough compared to control but these did not reach significance (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2005</LINK>). Falk found approximately 6% clearance during the control measurement and 9% during chest physiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Falk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 1993</LINK>). In the study by Mortensen, median clearance after 30 minutes during control was 7% and during two different chest physiotherapy sessions was 33% and 34% (<LINK REF="STD-Mortensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mortensen 1991</LINK>). Rossman found 32% radioactive tracer clearance during the control measurement and 40% to 46% during the different forms of chest physiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Rossman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rossman 1982</LINK>). One study (eight participants) reported no significant difference between two different chest physiotherapy sessions of PEP breathing (clearance 10% and 6%), without coughing, compared to a control period (clearance 8%) (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Schans-1991" TYPE="STUDY">van der Schans 1991</LINK>). Different outcomes between the study by van der Schans and the other studies can be explained by the fact that in the van der Schans study participants were requested not to cough, but coughing was encouraged in the other studies as a part of the treatment (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Schans-1991" TYPE="STUDY">van der Schans 1991</LINK>).</P>

Pfleger measured FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC at five different time points during each intervention session and reported means and SDs at the end of the first and fifth intervention session where the intervention varied in a random order from session two to five, hence we are unable to enter the data in a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Pfleger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pfleger 1992</LINK>).

The questionnaire addressed breathlessness during treatment, ease of clearance, relaxation, how pleasant therapy was to perform and overall preference. The information from the completed questionnaires highlighted patient preference for placebo over flutter (results for the HAT group are not reported here following exclusion from the current review). The placebo treatment was rated as slightly or much better than the flutter regarding the ease at which phlegm is coughed up by 50.1% of participants; 35.3% of patients reported flutter therapy was slightly or very unpleasant, with none of the participants stating that they would prefer to use flutter for physiotherapy if available (<LINK REF="STD-Jarad-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jarad 2010</LINK>). These results should be considered in the context of the placebo treatment having involved the participant sitting in a bath of warm water receiving a sham form of HAT; as the effects of sitting in a warm bath on both secretion clearance and perceived ease of clearance is unknown. As it is unclear as to whether this represents a true control, these results should be interpreted with caution.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-08-14 15:18:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Chest physiotherapy has been a mainstay of the respiratory management of people with CF for so long that it may now be difficult for them, their parents, physiotherapists and medical staff to consider a study design that incorporates a 'no treatment' control group for any length of time. Despite there being a reasonable degree of equipoise with regard to whether physiotherapy is better than no treatment, many would argue that to recruit participants into a 'no treatment' group would be unethical. This explains in part why there are currently no long-term studies which use this design.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-08-14 15:17:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The heterogeneity of treatments and outcome measures reported in the included studies make it impossible to pool their results. The short-term studies that were included in this review suggest that chest physiotherapy increases mucus transport in people with CF. Specifically, four out of the five studies included in the review which used sputum weight as an outcome found increased sputum weight produced with an intervention compared to control (with the remaining study reporting no significant differences). Also, four out of five of the included studies which assessed radioactive tracer clearance found positive effects associated with the active intervention groups compared to control; one study, which included only eight participants, observed no significant differences. Only one of the four studies which reported pulmonary function tests as an outcome observed any significant improvement following some of the interventions but not control. It is not reported, however, over how long a period these changes were sustained.</P>
<P>It is generally accepted that patient satisfaction or preference for airway clearance techniques is an important factor in treatment selection when considering likely adherence to treatment. Only one study included in the review addressed patient satisfaction; however in this study some of the participants were naive to the intervention. The authors consider that patient preference in a short-term, single-intervention study where a new intervention introduces a 'novelty' element could be misleading. Care should therefore be taken when extrapolating these findings for consideration of likely patient satisfaction or preference for a technique carried out in the long term as part of daily management.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-08-14 14:48:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>This review only included short-term studies where each of the interventions were only repeated over one or two days. Due to the nature of the disease the long-term clinical consequences of missing one or two treatments is unlikely to be significant. Therefore, the outcomes from these short-term studies may not represent the true effect of the interventions performed in the long term and should be interpreted with caution. Despite this limitation, the included cross-over studies may provide a potentially useful signal regarding the efficacy of physiotherapy treatments.</P>
<P>All of the studies included in the review recruited participants who were older children, adolescents or adults with the youngest participant 9.8 years of age. Extrapolation of these findings to the younger paediatric population should therefore be performed with caution; particularly when considering the efficacy of routine airway clearance technique for asymptomatic screened babies. In 2008 the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Cystic Fibrosis (ACPCF) produced a guidance paper on the management of screened infants. This document provides a review of the evidence for airway clearance applicable to this population and consensus clinical opinion on this issue (<LINK REF="REF-Prasad-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 2008</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-07-10 10:15:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The included studies each recruited only a small number of participants. Furthermore, there was enormous heterogeneity of treatments and outcome measures reported so that it was impossible to pool results from different studies. There are inherent risks of bias in physiotherapy studies; firstly, due to a lack of control group since a sham or placebo treatment clearly cannot be substituted for a clearly physical intervention such as percussion, PEP or postural drainage. Similarly, participants and therapists cannot be 'blinded' from the treatment being received. This partly explains the low quality scores of the included studies as reported using the Jadad scoring system in the original review and the risk of bias assessments in the current version, since these methods place significant emphasis on blinding. </P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-07-10 10:15:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The authors are not aware of potential bias in the review process.

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-08-14 15:18:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The short-term studies that were included in this review suggest that chest physiotherapy increases mucus transport in people with CF. This finding supports the conclusion of an earlier review (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1995a</LINK>). These studies also suggest that in the short term, airway clearance techniques have no sustained effects on pulmonary function. Other Cochrane reviews of physiotherapy interventions have assessed pulmonary function as an outcome in both short-term and long-term studies and, certainly in the short term, findings remain consistent (<LINK REF="REF-Elkins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elkins 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKoy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKoy 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrison-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 2009</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-08-14 14:48:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Short-term cross-over studies suggest that airway clearance regimens have beneficial effects in people with CF with regard to improving mucus transport. However, based on this review, we have not been able to find any robust scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that chest physiotherapy for the purpose of clearing airway secretions has a long-term beneficial effect in people with CF, nor to support the claim by some authors that it is harmful.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-08-14 14:49:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The gold standard for establishing efficacy of therapy is the randomised controlled study with a 'no treatment' group. The application of this study design to the question in this review would be very effective. However, several ethical considerations could be raised in the discussion with regard to the withdrawal of an established and trusted treatment like chest physiotherapy in people with CF, even in the absence of firm evidence. On the other hand, it could be argued that in view of scant evidence to support the use of chest physiotherapy for people with CF and the fact that this intervention can be unpleasant, uncomfortable, and time-consuming, we believe that a study with a 'no treatment' control group is justified in some circumstances. Therefore, we propose that in future research, control groups or control periods should be included with sufficient numbers of included participants. This would be best studied as a parallel study over a time period of months rather than days or weeks.</P>
