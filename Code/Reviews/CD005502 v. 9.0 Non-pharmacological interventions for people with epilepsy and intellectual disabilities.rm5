<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-07-28 19:36:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is a neurological condition characterised by involuntary activity of the brain, which manifests in seizures. The rate of epilepsy in people with intellectual diabilities is significantly higher than in the general population. Epilepsy in this population is often less responsive to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. One relevant study comparing two surgical procedures has been included in this review. This study found that anterior corpus callosotomy (a procedure in which a section of the corpus callosum is severed) with anterior temporal lobectomy (a procedure in which part of the temporal lobe is removed) is more effective than anterior temporal lobectomy alone in improving quality of life and performance on IQ tests among people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. No support was found for a relative benefit of either procedure for improved seizure control. This review accentuates the lack of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating non-pharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. Given the prevalence and nature of epilepsy in this population, well-designed RCTs are needed to ascertain the effects of non-pharmacological interventions on seizure and behavioural outcomes in people with intellectual disabilities. However, good quality evidence derived from RCTs including the non-intellectually disabled should be assessed for side effects and efficacy before such studies are undertaken.</P>

<P>One study is included in this review. When two surgical procedures were compared, results indicated that corpus callosotomy with anterior temporal lobectomy was more effective than anterior temporal lobectomy alone in improving quality of life and performance on IQ tests among people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. No evidence was found to support superior benefit in seizure control for either intervention. This is the only study of its kind and was rated as having an overall unclear risk of bias. The previous update (December 2010) identified one RCT in progress.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-07-28 19:36:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is the most common serious neurological disorder, with an overall incidence rate in developed countries of between 40 and 70 cases per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Zarrelli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zarrelli 1999</LINK>). Recent population data indicate that 1% of the general adult population in the United States is reported to have active epilepsy. The prevalence of epilepsy among people with intellectual disabilities is significantly higher than in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Kobau-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kobau 2013</LINK>), with estimates ranging from 14% to 44%, increasing with severity of intellectual disability (<LINK REF="REF-Bowley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowley 2000</LINK>). In the general population, the prognosis for full seizure control is good, with approximately 70% of patients achieving long-term remission, most within five years of diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Cockerell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockerell 1997</LINK>). This means that approximately 30% of patients remain refractory to drug treatment and continue to experience seizures whilst taking one or more antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Management of epilepsy in people with intellectual disabilities poses additional challenges for clinicians, as the condition has been associated with significantly higher rates of morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 2003</LINK>). Several non-pharmacological interventions available to refractory patients may be used in conjunction with or as an alternative to AEDs.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Surgical interventions</HEADING>
<P>Surgical interventions have been an option for certain types of medically refractory epilepsy for more than 100 years; however, recent advances in neuroimaging and in surgical techniques have improved the surgical treatment of epilepsy to such an extent that some experts now suggest that physicians should offer surgery early to patients with surgically remediable epileptic syndromes (<LINK REF="REF-Engel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engel 2003</LINK>). Surgical treatment to abolish seizures has been particularly recommended for patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and neocortical epilepsy. Three randomised controlled trials assessing the impact of epilepsy surgery have been identified. One compared partial versus complete hippocampectomy in temporal lobe epilepsy (<LINK REF="STD-Wyler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wyler 1995</LINK>), another assessed the impact on language of resecting the superior temporal gyrus compared with performing standard left anterior temporal lobectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Hermann-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermann 1999</LINK>) and still another compared surgical versus medical therapy for the treatment of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Wiebe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiebe 2001</LINK>). Studies carried out by Wiebe et al (<LINK REF="REF-Wiebe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiebe 2001</LINK>) and by Wyler et al (<LINK REF="STD-Wyler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wyler 1995</LINK>) excluded patients with an IQ lower than 70. <LINK REF="REF-Gleissner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gleissner 1999</LINK> has reported favourable seizure outcomes following epilepsy surgery in people with an intellectual disability following careful patient selection.</P>
<P>Several surgical options are available for the treatment of individuals with epilepsy.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Resection: When surgeons are clear as to the origin of seizure activity, they can remove the portion of the damaged brain that appears to be causing epileptic seizures.</LI>
<LI>Corpus callosotomy: In the most severe cases of generalised seizures, the corpus callosum, which connects the two hemispheres and allows for interhemispheric communication, may be severed to stop epileptic seizures.</LI>
<LI>Deep brain stimulation (DBS): This involves implanting a medical device sometimes referred to as a brain pacemaker, which sends electrical impulses to stimulate specific portions of the brain.</LI>
<LI>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS): This method uses a medical device that includes two coils to stimulate the vagus nerve, which causes the vagus nerve to send electrical impulses to the brain.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dietary interventions</HEADING>
<P>Another non-pharmacological therapeutic option for patients with epilepsy consists of specialised diets or dietary supplementation. One example is the ketogenic diet - a restrictive high-fat, low-protein and very low-carbohydrate diet that has been used mainly in children, although recent research has demonstrated its effectiveness in an adult population (<LINK REF="REF-Schoeler-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoeler 2014</LINK>). One study indicates that ketogenic diets are effective, independent of age, seizure type and electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 1998</LINK>). A recent Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2012</LINK>) identified four randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of dietary interventions in children and six prospective studies that assessed various dietary interventions. Findings from this review suggest that the ketogenic diet may provide benefit for people with medically intractable epilepsy and for those for whom surgery is unsuitable, but it is poorly tolerated. This review also highlights the low-carbohydrate Atkins diet as beneficial, but additional evidence of high quality is required to confirm this finding. Potential beneficial effects of the ketogenic diet have been highlighted by the <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2009a</LINK> study, in which investigators describe a reduction in parent-reported seizures but no significant difference in EEG-confirmed seizures. This cross-over study included children younger than 12 years, making generalisation of results to adult populations problematic. Advantages of less restrictive Atkins-like diets and low glycaemic diets have been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2009b</LINK>). Dietary supplementation includes vitamins and folic acid, although currently no reliable high-quality evidence can be found for these interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Ranganathan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranganathan 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Psychological interventions</HEADING>
<P>Psychological interventions represent another non-pharmacological treatment option for people with epilepsy. However, a recent Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Ramaratnam-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramaratnam 2008</LINK>) evaluating the effects of psychological treatments for people with epilepsy revealed that the literature provides no reliable evidence to support these interventions, which include relaxation therapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy, EEG biofeedback and educational interventions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Yoga interventions</HEADING>
<P>Yoga, an ancient Hindu practice, involves exercise that focuses on strength, flexibility and breathing to improve physical and mental well-being. A Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Panebianco-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panebianco 2015</LINK>) found only two unblinded, controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Lundgren-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundgren 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Panjwani-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panjwani 1996</LINK>) and was unable to draw reliable conclusions about the efficacy of such treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Acupuncture interventions</HEADING>
<P>Acupuncture is based on complex theories involving regulation of blood and body fluid, yin and yang and the five elements (earth, fire, metal, water, wood). Two small randomised controlled trials have shown no beneficial effects of acupuncture for patients with intractable epilepsy with respect to seizure frequency (<LINK REF="REF-Kloster-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kloster 1999</LINK>) or quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Stavem-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stavem 2000</LINK>). One study on the effects of acupuncture on spasticity in children with cerebral palsy reported no effects on frequency of seizures (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2008</LINK>). This study included children between one and six years of age.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dietary interventions</HEADING>
<P>How the ketogenic diet may work remains unclear. Since the time of Hippocrates, fasting has been known to have a potentially beneficial effect on seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Hartman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartman 2007</LINK>). The ketogenic diet was designed to mimic the biochemical response to starvation when ketone bodies replace glucose as the primary fuel for the brain's energy demands (<LINK REF="REF-Hartman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartman 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Psychological interventions</HEADING>
<P>Seizure occurrence may be influenced by behavioural, psychological and physiological states (<LINK REF="REF-Fenwick-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenwick 1992</LINK>).

<P>Stress is considered an important precipitating factor for seizures, stimulating interest in the use of yoga as treatment for stress.

<P>In an RCT conducted by Liang in 2010, 60 people with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and intellectual disability (ID) were recruited and were randomly assigned to one of two surgery intervention groups. To screen participants, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalogram (EEG) and positron emission tomography (PET) assessments were performed. In the control group, participants underwent anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL group), and in the experimental group, participants underwent anterior temporal lobe lobectomy and anterior corpus callosotomy (ATL and aCCT group). Resective regions in the anterior temporal lobectomy procedure included 4 to 5 cm on the left side and 5 to 6 cm on the right side of both the superior temporal gyrus and the interior temporal gyrus. At least 2 to 3.5 cm of the hippocampus was removed. When anterior temporal lobectomy was combined with anterior corpus callosotomy, a unique incision was needed on both the fronto-temporal flap and the bone flap. Anterior corpus callosotomy was performed after anterior temporal lobectomy had been completed. Following full exposure of the posterior part of the corpus callosum, the anterior extent of resection was defined by the dorsal surface of the anterior cerebral arteries. The corpus callosum was disconnected until the ependyma was visible. The callosotomy was performed under microscope. The length of the corpus callosotomy was 6 to 7 cm, thus representing approximately two-thirds of the corpus callosum. Preoperative assessments included performance IQ, verbal IQ and full-scale IQ measures from the Wechsler Child Intelligence Scale (WCIS; Chinese version) or the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS; Chinese version), ; responses on an eight-item quality of life (QOL) questionnaire that had been developed by the study authors and seizure frequency were recorded for the three months before surgery was performed. Two years after surgery, participants again completed the WAIS and the QOL questionnaire During this time, participants monitored their seizure frequency.</P>

Investigators explained that no permanent complications were experienced by any participants. However, temporary complications were reported by nine participants. In the ATL and aCCT groups, two participants reported urinary incontinence, one reported aphasia and two reported apraxia following surgery. In the ATL group, two participants reported aphasia and two reported apraxia, but the duration of temporary complications was unclear. Study authors concluded that ATL and aCCT can improve QOL and the performance intelligence quotient (PIQ) of individuals with TLE and ID with no permanent adverse effects; therefore ATL combined with aCCT can be considered a viable option for patients with TLE and ID. No significant differences in seizure frequency before and after surgery were reported between groups.

<P>In terms of evaluating non-pharmacological interventions for epilepsy in people with intellectual disabilities, the present review included only one study that assessed surgical interventions. We included in this review no studies assessing dietary, psychological, yoga or acupuncture interventions. Therefore, the overall completeness and applicability of evidence provided are poor. The key finding of the present review is the shortage of high-quality RCTs undertaken to assess non-pharmacological interventions that can be used as alternatives or adjuncts to AEDs for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities.</P>

<P>The present review includes only one RCT, which found that anterior temporal lobectomy with anterior corpus callosotomy may be more effective than anterior temporal lobectomy alone for improving quality of life and performance on IQ tests among people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. <LINK REF="REF-Liang-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liang 2014</LINK> was a prospective study, which found anterior corpus callosotomy to be more effective than AEDs in terms of seizure control, improved quality of life and enhanced performance on IQ tests. In a retrospective study (<LINK REF="REF-Jalilian-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jalilian 2010</LINK>) comparing anterior versus complete corpus callosotomy among children and adolescents, study authors concluded that a complete corpus callosotomy should be considered for lower-functioning children, and that higher-functioning children without clinically significant disconnection syndrome may benefit from a complete corpus callosotomy. Despite supporting evidence, few RCTs have assessed the efficacy and potential risks involved with such surgical procedures because of ethical issues surrounding this type of research (<LINK REF="REF-Wiebe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiebe 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The present review included no RCTs assessing the effectiveness of dietary interventions. However, a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2012</LINK>) reported that dietary interventions, particularly the ketogenic diet, can have a beneficial effect for seizure control among people with epilepsy. Adverse effects including gastrointestinal (short-term) and cardiovascular (long-term) complications were reported. Additionally, such dietary interventions are poorly tolerated and therefore are poorly maintained by patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hemingway-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemingway 2001</LINK>). This suggests that dietary interventions may offer a feasible alternative to AEDs for the treatment of individuals with drug-refractory epilepsy.</P>
<P>A paucity of literature has been found on studies assessing the efficacy of yoga as an intervention within the wider field of epilepsy, with one Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Panebianco-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panebianco 2015</LINK>) identifying just two studies. Despite suggestions that yoga may have a beneficial effect for people with epilepsy, we have drawn no firm conclusions , given the quantity and the quality of this evidence. Limited evidence is available on the use of psychological interventions for seizure control and psychological well-being among people with epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Ramaratnam-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramaratnam 2008</LINK>), as well as on non-pharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities.</P>
<P>In the light of the limited number of RCTs performed to assess non-pharmacological interventions, authors of future updates of this review may wish to consider inclusion of non-RCTs, with the goal of identifying a potentially wider evidence base.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-07-28 20:12:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As only one study is included in the present review, implications for practice are limited. Despite the findings of <LINK REF="STD-Liang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Liang 2010</LINK> suggesting that anterior temporal lobectomy with anterior corpus callosotomy may be more effective than anterior temporal lobectomy alone in improving quality of life and enhancing performance on IQ tests among people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities, this is the only study of its kind. Therefore the reliability of these findings is questionable. Furthermore, we found no studies undertaken to assess psychological, dietary, yoga or acupuncture interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. Therefore, we obtained no robust evidence from randomised controlled trials designed to assess non-pharmacological interventions available to clinicians treating people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-09-04 22:12:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The prevalence of epilepsy among people with intellectual disabilities is significantly higher than in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Kobau-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kobau 2013</LINK>). Furthermore, people with intellectual disabilities often have drug-resistant epilepsy, for which AEDs are insufficient. Despite this, very little quality evidence is available from studies assessing the efficacy and side effects of various alternatives to drug therapy for people with intellectual disabilities. Absence of good quality evidence for non-pharmacological interventions appears to involve not only people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities but also those with epilepsy within the wider population. Given that the rate of refractory epilepsy is thought to be around 30% among people with epilepsy, and even higher among those with intellectual disabilities, good quality research is needed to explore alternatives to drug therapy for people with epilepsy, particularly for those with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities.</P>

<P>We rated this study as of low quality because an insufficient randomisation method was reported and limited information was provided on study methodology in general. This study used different neuropsychological tests to assess IQ (WAIS in adults and WISC in children). Comparing scores across these tests is often problematic because of the potential disparity between the 2 scales, particularly for lower-scoring individuals. Ethical approval was not mentioned. The quality of life questionnaire used in this study did not include a validated scale</P>

<P>The following search terms were used (as free text and as index terms, as appropriate for each database) during searches for the first version of this review (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2007<I>,</I> Issue 4). The same search terms were used for the update.</P>

<P>To identify randomised controlled trials, we combined these search terms with phases 1 and 2 of the Cochrane highly sensitive search strategy for MEDLINE, as set out in Appendix 5b of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Again, we modified this strategy as appropriate for different databases.</P>
