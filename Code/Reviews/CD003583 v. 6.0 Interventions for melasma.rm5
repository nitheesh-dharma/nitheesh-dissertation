Added &amp;quot;topical steroids&amp;quot; to the treatments being evaluated.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-06-15 14:11:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura  Prescott">
<P>Melasma is a psychologically distressing skin disorder also known as &#8216;chloasma&#8217; or &#8216;mask of pregnancy&#8217;. Darker patches of skin gradually develop on the cheeks, forehead, nose, and upper lip. It is more common in women and is associated with pregnancy and medication containing hormones. Melasma is divided into three types: epidermal, dermal, and mixed melasma. Epidermal melasma is the most superficial with an increase in the skin pigment (melanin) in the top layer of skin (epidermis). In dermal melasma, there is increased skin pigment in the second deeper layer of the skin (the dermis). Mixed melasma is a combination of epidermal and dermal melasma.</P>
<P>Conventional treatments for melasma include sunscreens, bleaching creams (e.g. hydroquinone), acne creams (e.g. azelaic acid), topical retinoids (e.g. tretinoin), and facial peels where an acid solution is used to remove outer layers of the skin (e.g. glycolic acid peels). Some treatments incorporate a combination approach such as triple-combination cream (hydroquinone, tretinoin, and steroid). There is inadequate information available at present to determine the best treatment for melasma.</P>
<P>We included 20 studies with a total of 2125 participants covering 23 different treatments. Triple-combination cream was significantly more effective at lightening melasma when compared to hydroquinone alone or to dual combinations such as tretinoin and hydroquinone, tretinoin and fluocinolone acetonide, or hydroquinone and fluocinolone acetonide. Tretinoin was more effective at lightening melasma compared to placebo, as was the skin-whitening complex Thiospot. However, many studies were of a poor quality with a only small number of participants.</P>
<P>The side-effects reported most frequently by both participants and clinicians were dry, red, and sore skin. No serious side-effects were seen.</P>
<P>More evidence is needed on other treatments which are widely used, including the role of sunscreens which were recommended in almost all studies. There is a need for high-quality studies comparing the treatments for this difficult to manage condition. For example, studies should have a minimum follow-up period of 6 months and should clearly categorise participant groups such as age, type of melasma, and duration of the condition at the start of the trial so that these differences can be considered when assessing results. Addtionally, study outcomes should include participants' views in a standardised manner because they may perceive the degree of skin lightening differently to the trial investigators.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-06-15 14:10:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura  Prescott">
<P>We included 20 studies with a total of 2125 participants covering 23 different treatments. Statistical pooling of the data was not possible due to the heterogeneity of treatments. </P>
<P>Each study involved a different set of interventions. They can be grouped into those including a bleaching agent such as hydroquinone, triple-combination creams (hydroquinone, tretinoin, and fluocinolone acetonide), and combination therapies (hydroquinone cream and glycolic acid peels), as well as less conventional therapies including rucinol, vitamin C iontophoresis, and skin-lightening complexes like Thiospot and Gigawhite.</P>
<P>Triple-combination cream was significantly more effective at lightening melasma than hydroquinone alone (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.97) or when compared to the dual combinations of tretinoin and hydroquinone (RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.59 to 4.74), tretinoin and fluocinolone acetonide (RR 14.00, 95% CI 4.43 to 44.25), or hydroquinone and fluocinolone acetonide (RR 10.50, 95% CI 3.85 to 28.60).</P>
<P>Azelaic acid (20%) was significantly more effective than 2% hydroquinone (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.48) at lightening melasma but not when compared to 4% hydroquinone (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.32).</P>
<P>In two studies where tretinoin was compared to placebo, participants rated their melasma as significantly improved in one (RR 13, 95% CI 1.88 to 89.74) but not the other. In both studies by other objective measures tretinoin treatment significantly reduced the severity of melasma.</P>
<P>Thiospot was more effective than placebo (SMD -2.61, 95% CI -3.76 to -1.47).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Definition and epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Melasma is an acquired increased pigmentation of the skin characterised by symmetrical and confluent grey-brown patches mostly on the areas of the face exposed to the sun, such as the cheek bones, forehead, and chin. It may occasionally affect other areas such as the neck and forearms (<LINK REF="REF-Newcomer-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newcomer 1961</LINK>). Its clinical and histological presentation does not differ between men and women, apart from being more common in women. There are few studies showing how many people are affected. A study done in Mexico (<LINK REF="REF-Estrada_x002d_Castanon-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Estrada-Castanon 1992</LINK>) and a study done in Peru (<LINK REF="REF-Failmezger-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Failmezger 1992</LINK>) found melasma to be present in 4% to 10% of new dermatology hospital referrals. A survey of 2000 black participants at a private clinic in Washington found melasma to be the third most common pigmentary disorder of the skin (<LINK REF="REF-Halder-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halder 1983</LINK>). Melasma is thought to be more common in people of Hispanic and Asian origin (<LINK REF="REF-Newcomer-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newcomer 1961</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Causes</HEADING>
<P>Melasma occurs most commonly in women of childbearing age (<LINK REF="REF-Pandya-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandya 2007</LINK>). The majority of cases seem to be related to pregnancy, use of oral contraceptives and some other drugs, such as antiepileptics (<LINK REF="REF-Sanchez-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez 1981</LINK>). Exposure to the sun appears to be important for the development of melasma (<LINK REF="REF-Sanchez-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez 1981</LINK>). The condition may also occur in men (<LINK REF="REF-V_x00e1_zquez-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vázquez 1988</LINK>). There seems to be a familial predisposition for the development of melasma but the exact risk is unknown.</P>
<P>Melasma may be caused by a hormonal mechanism but this has not been proven (<LINK REF="REF-P_x00e9_rez-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pérez 1983</LINK>). A case control study of 108 non-pregnant women with melasma found a significant association with increased thyroid antibodies in the blood (<LINK REF="REF-Lawrence-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrence 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical features and symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Melasma is usually a clinical diagnosis. Microscopic skin studies suggest that there may be two differentiated types of melasma and a third mixed type:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Epidermal-type melasma, characterised by increased melanin (skin pigment) in the epidermis (the outer layer of the skin).</LI>
<LI>Dermal-type melasma, characterised by increased melanin in the dermis (the deeper layer of the skin).</LI>
<LI>Mixed-type melasma, a combination of epidermal and dermal melasma in the same person.</LI>
</OL>
<P>It may be important to distinguish between different categories of melasma as it has been suggested that dermal-type melasma may be less responsive to conventional therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Pathak-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Pathak 1986</LINK>). This distinction can be made in clinical practice by using a Wood's lamp. A Wood's lamp examination is a test which uses ultraviolet light to look closely at the skin. The level of melanin deposition can be differentiated using Wood's lamp. In people with light-coloured skin (e.g. Fitzpatrick skin types I to IV), epidermal melasma becomes more pronounced (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2006</LINK>). The dark colour due to pigment in the outer epidermal layer of the skin is accentuated while in dermal melasma the colour of the deeper dermal pigments is decreased during Wood's lamp examination. This contrast is less marked in darker skin types. Fitzpatrick devised a description of skin types known as the Fitzpatrick skin type classification. This classification denotes six different skin types based on constitutional colour and result of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (tanning). In general; skin type I and II is white skin, with type I always burning and type II sometimes burning, skin type III is olive skin which sometimes burns, type IV is brown skin which rarely burns, and type V and VI are respectively dark brown skin which rarely burns and black skin which never burns.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Melasma usually lasts for several years. It may present as odd streaking on the face causing significant cosmetic disfigurement. Pregnancy-related melasma may persist for several months after delivery and melasma related to hormonal treatments may persist long after stopping oral contraceptive hormones. Melasma is a chronic disease and recurrences are common especially after re-exposure to the sun (<LINK REF="REF-Sanchez-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez 1981</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-06-14 01:39:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment is often unsatisfactory and has been associated with side-effects such as local irritation, scarring, and residual patches of lighter colour on the skin.</P>
<P>Available therapies consist of preparations applied to the skin and recently laser therapy. These are listed below.</P>
<P>1. Sunscreens that block ultraviolet light<BR/>2. Topical steroids<BR/>3. Topical retinoids<BR/>4. Azelaic acid &amp; kojic acid<BR/>5. Bleaching agents such as hydroquinone<BR/>6. Peeling agents such as glycolic acid<BR/>7. Laser therapy<BR/>8. Combined therapies<BR/>9. Other therapies</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-06-14 01:39:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The currently available treatments for melasma are unsatisfactory. There are a wide range of treatments available, response to which is variable. Some treatments may have significant side-effects. The other problem is the chronic and relapsing nature of melasma, such that any response achieved will need to be maintained. We undertook this Cochrane systematic review of treatments for melasma because it is a common and distressing condition and we wished to assess the effectiveness of the variety of treatments that are used.</P>

<P>We considered published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) related to the treatment of melasma. We considered open label trials where placebo use was possible if the assessment of outcomes was done blindly. Where placebo use was not possible (e.g. laser therapy), we considered trials either if the assessment was done blindly or with objective-validated scales. This is a deviation from the original protocol, our initial criteria to exclude all open label trials where placebo use was possible was too stringent. </P>
<P>We initially excluded open label trials where placebo use was possible as knowledge of the assigned intervention may impact on outcomes. If however, the outcome assessors were not aware of the assigned intervention, the assessment may be less biased. This was the reason we deviated from our initial protocol which was possibly too exclusive.</P>
<P>We did not consider quasi-randomised trials and information from trials in which the unit of randomisation was different to the unit of analysis when addressing the effects of treatment (e.g. randomised people analysed by individual lesions).</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2010-06-15 14:16:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura  Prescott">
<P>Two of us (RR, JH) identified and checked titles and abstracts from the searches. If the study did not refer to a randomised controlled trial on melasma it was excluded. We (RR, JH) independently assessed each study to determine whether it met the pre-defined selection criteria. We included open label trials even when placebo use was possible as long as they were randomised and the outcome assessor-blinded. If placebo use was not possible, we included trials if the assessment was done blindly or with objective validated scales. Any differences in opinion were resolved through discussion. If this was not possible, we planned to discuss the paper with a third author (AS), however this was not necessary as there was little disagreement over which papers to include.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2010-06-14 14:08:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Two of us (RR, JH) developed and piloted a data extraction form in order to summarise the trials. We (RR, JH) extracted data independently and subsequently checked for discrepancies. Differences were resolved by discussion. Data was checked and entered by one of us (RR).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-06-14 14:10:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Two of us (RR, JH) performed the quality assessment and independently judged the components on the quality assessment form. We assessed the risk of bias and the methodological quality of included studies using the following components of internal and external validity for each included study, as outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The main criteria we considered were:</P>
<P>a) the method of generation of the randomisation sequence;</P>
<P>b) the method of allocation concealment - it was considered 'adequate' if the assignment could not be foreseen. Trials without evidence of adequate allocation concealment were included initially and we planned to do a sensitivity analysis to investigate whether reported allocation concealment was associated with modifications in the effect magnitude or direction;</P>
<P>c) who was blinded and not blinded;</P>
<P>d) loss to follow up: trials where losses to follow up were greater than 20% or those with highly differential withdrawal rate between groups (&gt; 15% difference between groups) would be initially included, and a sensitivity analysis carried out to address their impact on the conclusions and results of the meta-analysis;</P>
<P>e) intention-to-treat analysis: the review focused on intention-to-treat analysis of data as far as possible and highlighted the clinical outcomes. An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis includes all participants randomised into the trial irrespective of what happened subsequently. Data from participants who did not complete the trial will be considered for the time they remained in the study;</P>
<P>f) comparability of the two treatment groups in each arm.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2010-06-15 14:04:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura  Prescott">
<P>Two of us (RR, JH) analysed the data with input from a statistician. We calculated mean differences for continuous outcomes (with 95% confidence interval). We expressed the results as risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. This analysis differed slightly from the plan in our protocol which was to express results for dichotomous outcomes as odds ratios. We did not pool data as the interventions and outcomes measured were not appreciably similar. The data has been summarised for each trial as a narrative. </P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2010-06-14 14:12:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Some of the studies in this review used a 'within patient' design, where two interventions were allocated randomly to the left and right side of the face. These studies potentially give more accurate estimates of treatment effect since the comparison is made within the same participant rather than between two different groups of participants. A paired data analysis should therefore be applied to data from within participant studies which is not possible within the Review Manager software. As interventions used in the trials were all different, there was no usable data to combine with parallel group studies. There were no cross-over trials. For studies which had more than two intervention groups, pair-wise comparisons were made between intervention groups, which if investigated alone would meet the criteria for inclusion to the review.

<P>We have presented the results from the individual trials. Quantitative pooling of data was not possible because of the diversity of therapies evaluated and the heterogeneity of the studies. A detailed description of individual studies is presented in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table. Our primary outcome measure was improvement in quality of life measures or participant-rated improvement in melasma. However, as none of the included trials used quality of life measures and only a few had participant-reported outcomes, we invariably had to use the clinician rating. </P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2010-06-15 11:30:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura  Prescott">
<P>We did no subgroup analysis due to the wide variety of interventions and small sample sizes.

We had also planned to do a sensitivity analysis if there was clear evidence that the study groups were unbalanced to suggest confounding. No studies fell into this category.

The most common was the melasma area and severity index (MASI) score which attempts to quantify pigmentation area, darkness, and homogeneity (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ejaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ejaz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Francisco_x002d_Diaz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Francisco-Diaz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guevara-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Guevara 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hurley 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kimbrough_x002d_Green-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kimbrough-Green 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leenutaphong-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leenutaphong 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 1993</LINK> assessed improvement on a scale of much worse (-2) to much improved (+2), while <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2003</LINK> used the melasma severity rating scale. Four studies scored the percentage of improvement (<LINK REF="STD-Francisco_x002d_Diaz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Francisco-Diaz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lim-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lim-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sivayathorn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sivayathorn 1995</LINK>). However, the descriptions relating to the response varied; for example <LINK REF="STD-Sivayathorn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sivayathorn 1995</LINK> described lightening of pigmentation by 50% to 75% as good, &gt; 75% as an excellent response, and described improvement of more than 50% as treatment success and less than 50% as no response. <LINK REF="STD-Lim-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 1997</LINK>, however, described improvement in colour of melasma according to the categories no change, 0% to 33% lighter as slight improvement, and 34% to 66% as moderate improvement.   </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Bali_x00f1_a-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Baliña 1991b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ennes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ennes 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Khemis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khemis 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sivayathorn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sivayathorn 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Thirion-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thirion 2006</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-V_x00e1_zquez-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Vázquez 1983</LINK> devised their own scale for physicians to score improvement in pigmentation. This differed for each study. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Bali_x00f1_a-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Baliña 1991b</LINK> used excellent, good, fair, and poor responses, while <LINK REF="STD-Thirion-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thirion 2006</LINK> graded improvement on a scale of 0 (absent) to 3 (intense) pigmentation.   </P>

Additional forms of objective evaluation of melasma were used in <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kimbrough_x002d_Green-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kimbrough-Green 1994</LINK> (evaluation of epidermal pigment on histology) while <LINK REF="STD-Thirion-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thirion 2006</LINK> used corneomelametry to quantify melanin in the stratum corneum.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2010-06-15 14:12:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura  Prescott">
<P>In this section we have presented the results for the effects of interventions only for studies that examined the primary and secondary outcomes of interest in this review. Of the 20 trials included, only 2 had similar interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kimbrough_x002d_Green-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kimbrough-Green 1994</LINK>). The results of these 2 trials were not pooled as there was clinical heterogeneity. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 1993</LINK> was on participants with white skin and had a higher proportion of epidermal melasma, whereas the participants in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Kimbrough_x002d_Green-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kimbrough-Green 1994</LINK> had black skin and had more dermal melasma.</P>
<P>We did not perform any calculations on number needed to treat. Most of the trials had scale-based outcomes, the baseline characteristics, time frame, and outcomes measured were not homogeneous and comparison between values would be misleading.</P>
<P>We did not find the outcome measures we had expected when we wrote the protocol. None of the studies addressed the primary outcome of effect of treatment on quality of life and only 11 of the 20 studies included participant-assessed changes in melasma severity. In the <LINK REF="STD-Khemis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khemis 2007</LINK> study, one of the intended outcomes was effects of rucinol treatment on quality of life. However, these results from a questionnaire to participants at 12 weeks were not presented. In the <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK> studies quality of life was not specifically addressed but participants were asked to rate satisfaction with treatment.</P>
<P>The secondary outcome measures of physician-assessed changes in melasma severity and adverse events are reported below. None of the studies were longer than 12 months and consequently we have not been able to evaluate the long-term remission rate set out in the protocol. Melasma is a chronic relapsing disorder and the long-term maintenance of unpigmented skin is the most clinically relevant. Additionally none of the studies set out to evaluate the time-to-improvement of melasma, a factor which may affect compliance to treatment. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ennes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ennes 2000</LINK>) an earlier onset of action of the study product was noted, though this was not one of the pre-defined outcome measures.</P>

<P>Participants assessed self-improvement using a static global assessment score. A score of 0 related to clear and 1 related to minor hyperpigmentation.

Eleven of 18 participants felt there was more improvement on the peeled side versus 4/18 on the non-peeled side. One of the 18 felt there was no difference between the 2 sides.

A broad spectrum sunscreen was applied once a day in the morning. However, no details of the sunscreen SPF were provided or if participants could reapply during the day. In the participant-assessed self-improvement the differences between the groups were unclear.

Intense pulsed light is a broad spectrum light with wavelengths ranging from 400 nm to 1200 nm which penetrate the skin's surface and targets specific elements in the skin such as melanin. The frequency of hydroquinone application in either group is unclear. The rationale for hydroquinone in the control arm where participants had been shown to be unresponsive is also unclear. Some participants had also used tretinoin, azelaic acid, and L-ascorbic acid. There was a co-intervention of a broad spectrum sunscreen. In the hydroquinone-only group, 64% of the participants were slightly satisfied and 36% were unsatisfied.

<P>In a small split face study of 10 participants in Singapore with moderate to severe epidermal melasma, <LINK REF="STD-Lim-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 1997</LINK> compared glycolic acid peels applied every 3 weeks in addition to glycolic acid and hydroquinone cream applied twice daily for 24 weeks, to glycolic and hydroquinone cream only twice daily for 24 weeks. The glycolic acid peels were started at 20% for 5 minutes and the concentration increased to 70% as tolerated. All participants also had a pre-treatment period of 2 weeks of 8% AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) skin-smoothing cream twice daily to both sides of the face. The participants self-evaluation showed that a higher proportion of people noticed an improvement on the side that was peeled. Five out of 10 had 34% to 66% improvement and 5/10 had a 0% to 33% improvement. In the non-peeled group, 2/10 had a 34% to 66% improvement, 7/10 had a 0% to 33% improvement, and 1 had no improvement. </P>
<P>In another study in Singapore <LINK REF="STD-Lim-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 1999</LINK> compared a cream containing 2% hydroquinone, 10% glycolic acid, and 2% kojic acid, to a cream containing 2% hydroquinone and 10% glycolic acid both applied twice daily for 12 weeks in a split face trial. Forty-five per cent of participants felt there was greater improvement on the kojic acid side while 7.5% of participants noticed greater improvement on the hydroquinone and glycolic acid only side, 47.5% felt there was no difference between the sides. </P>

<P>In the Philippines <LINK REF="STD-Francisco_x002d_Diaz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Francisco-Diaz 2004</LINK> conducted a split face trial on 28 women with mixed melasma. Participants applied Gigawhite solution or placebo to either the right or left side of the face twice daily for 12 weeks. Gigawhite is a complex of botanical origin containing mallow, peppermint leaf, <I>Primula veris</I>, <I>Alchemilia vulgaris</I>, <I>Mellissa officinales</I> leaf extract, and <I>Achillea millefolium</I> extract. There was also a co-intervention of SPF-60 sunscreen. Two participants were lost to follow up. The participants' self-assessment was poorly reported. Three participants had a greater than 90% improvement, 15 had a greater than 50% improvement, and 7 participants a greater than 25% improvement. It is unclear if this was compared to baseline or if compared to the placebo side. It is also stated that two participants had no improvement and one had worsening of melasma; these three appear to have been unaccounted in the self-assessment above. </P>
<P>In Korea <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2003</LINK> conducted a split face trial on 29 women with melasma. The requirement for entry to the trial was a difference in the luminance value measured with a colorimeter of greater than 2 between the normal and melasma areas. It is unclear how many participants were lost to follow up. Outcomes were measured in 26 participants and it is assumed 3 were lost to follow up. Participants were randomised to receive either Vitamin C iontophoresis in a magnesium-L-ascorbyl-2-phosphate (MAP) solution or distilled water iontophoresis to the right or left side of the face for 8 minutes twice a week for 12 weeks. Vitamin C is known to inhibit melanin formation. However, Vitamin C is quickly oxidised and decomposes easily. MAP, a stable water based solution, was used to resolve this problem. The authors proposed that iontophoresis enhances Vitamin C penetration through the skin.</P>
<P>Participants assessed their own improvement according to the categories; greater than 75% improvement, 50% to 75% improvement, 25% to 50%, less than 25% or worse.

<P>Two trials of azelaic acid compared to hydroquinone were included (<LINK REF="STD-Bali_x00f1_a-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Baliña 1991b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sivayathorn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sivayathorn 1995</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Bali_x00f1_a-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Baliña 1991b</LINK> compared 20% azelaic acid to 4% hydroquinone, while <LINK REF="STD-Sivayathorn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sivayathorn 1995</LINK> compared 20% azelaic acid to 2% hydroquinone. Most studies of hydroquinone have used the 4% strength. Sivayathorn et al chose the 2% hydroquinone strength as there were ethical obstacles to using placebo for 6 months. This trial aimed to demonstrate the superior efficacy of azelaic acid. The two studies reached different conclusions and this is likely to be due to the different concentrations of the hydroquinone comparator. </P>
<P>The trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Bali_x00f1_a-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Baliña 1991b</LINK> was a multicentre South American trial on 329 women with epidermal or mixed melasma. There was a large loss to follow up (86 participants) though the differential loss to follow up between the groups was not significant. Assessments were performed on 122 participants in the azelaic acid group and 121 participants in the hydroquinone group. There was no significant difference in the two groups with regard to overall response or reduction in pigmentary intensity. Both subjective and objective assessments were made. Using the participants who had a good to excellent response as 'treatment success', 71.9% of those in the hydroquinone group had success versus 64.8% in the azelaic acid group (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.32; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). The authors also included an objective measure of reduction in lesion size in the two groups, of which no significant difference was demonstrated. There was limited data and no mean or standard deviations (SDs) for lesion size was provided. <BR/>
<BR/>Most of the side-effects were mild and transient occurring more frequently in the azelaic acid group (18/122) versus the hydroquinone group (1/121) (RR 17.85, CI 2.42 to 131.64; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). </P>
<P>The trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Sivayathorn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sivayathorn 1995</LINK> was also a multicentre trial. Participants (340) with epidermal or mixed melasma from 5 dermatology units in Thailand and the Philippines were randomised to 20% azelaic acid cream or 2% hydroquinone cream. Forty participants were lost to follow up, 20 from each group. Although an intention-to-treat analysis was stated to be done, the percentages of participants in each category did not correlate with the numbers randomised to each group. We have therefore presented the data in this review as the per protocol analysis, those who completed the 24 weeks. Physicians rated response according to the categories excellent, good, moderate, or poor. Good or excellent response was taken as treatment success. Significantly more participants in the azelaic acid group (75.5%) achieved a good or excellent response compared to the 2% hydroquinone group (47.1%). The percentage improvement was also scored according to categories less than 25%, 25% to 50%, 50% to 75%, and greater than 75%. Taking an improvement of greater than 50% as treatment success, significantly more participants in the azelaic acid group improved by more than 50% (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.48; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). However, no statistically significant difference between the groups was found on the objective measures of reduction in lesion size (mean and SDs not provided). </P>
<P>Mild adverse events including, itching, burning, and erythema were reported in 61/147 in the azelaic acid group and 22/153 in the hydroquinone group.<B> </B>Marked local irritation was reported in 15 participants in the azelaic acid group and 2 participants in the hydroquinone group. Overall more participants in the azelaic acid group had adverse events compared to the hydroquinone group (RR 3.30, 95% CI 2.21 to 4.91; <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the multicentre trial by <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2008</LINK> comparing triple-combination (fluocinolone acetonide 0.01%, hydroquinone 4%, tretinoin 0.05%) cream to 4% hydroquinone cream, the melasma severity scale was used by physicians to assess response. A score of 0 relates to the presence of no melasma and 1 relates to the presence of mild melasma. Significantly more participants in the triple-combination group achieved a score of 0 or 1 (the trial authors stated P &lt; 0.001, RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.13; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Triple-combination cream also had an earlier onset of action with significant differences in the score evident at week four. </P>
<P>Treatment-related adverse effects however were also significantly more frequent in the triple-combination group compared to hydroquinone (RR 3.55, 95% CI 2.23 to 5.65; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The most commonly reported side-effects were erythema, irritation, and discomfort of the skin though this was stated to be mostly mild in intensity. In this trial participants were also asked how much the side-effects bothered them. Significantly more (77%) of those in the hydroquinone group were not bothered at all by side-effects compared to 43% in the triple-combination cream group. </P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Espinal_x002d_Perez-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Espinal-Perez 2004</LINK> split face trial, only an objective assessment of improvement was made. Colorimetric assessment was performed by obtaining the melanin index difference between the lesional and perilesional areas. This was performed at the beginning and the end of the study. The mean colorimetric improvement was not significantly different for the hydroquinone (4.1) versus the ascorbic acid (2.8) side. There was, however, more irritation from hydroquinone (11/16) compared to L-ascorbic acid (1/16). The trial authors concluded that, although hydroquinone showed a better response in the subjective assessment, there was no difference objectively. Additionally, ascorbic acid had fewer side-effects.  </P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Hurley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hurley 2002</LINK> trial the physicians assessed improvement with subjective and objective measures. While there was a significant improvement from baseline in both groups there was no significant difference between the sides in terms of mexameter readings. There was also no significant difference in improvement in MASI scores between the two groups (mean and SD for the groups were not provided). The trial authors concluded that the use of 4% hydroquinone is effective in the treatment of melasma but the addition of 4 glycolic acid peels did not enhance the effect of hydroquinone. Four participants developed significant erythema though no peeling or erosions occurred secondary to the peels. There was no comment on adverse events from hydroquinone.  </P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-V_x00e1_zquez-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Vázquez 1983</LINK> trial only included a subjective assessment of improvement. The physicians rated a higher proportion of participants in the hydroquinone and sunscreen group (96.3%) as improved compared to the hydroquinone-only group (80.8%). In the sunscreen group, 4 had marked improvement, 13 moderate, 9 slight, and 1 no improvement. In the placebo group, 5 had marked improvement, 6 moderate, 10 slight, and 5 no improvement. Although no statistical analysis was conducted, the trial authors concluded that hydroquinone is the main stay of therapy and addition of a sunscreen has a positive effect. </P>
<P>Nine participants developed irritation, stinging, and burning which was reported to be minor and transient, resolving with continued use and this was attributed to hydroquinone. It is unclear which arm this was in as both groups received hydroquinone. </P>
<P>The physicians in the <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK> study assessed improvement objectively using a mexameter. There was a statistically significant difference (authors report P &lt; 0.05) between the groups with a greater reduction in the melanin index score in the hydroquinone and pulsed light group. Participants in the intense pulsed light group achieved an average of 39.8% improvement compared to a mean improvement of 11.6% in the hydroquinone-only group. The number of adverse events was reported to be low and no more detailed data was presented. In this study a further mexameter measurement was made at 36 weeks in the pulsed light group only and not in the hydroquinone group and is therefore not included in this review.   </P>

<P>The three studies investigating the benefit of a topical retinoid were of the longest duration.</P>
<P>Two American studies with a total of 80 participants reported the effect of 0.01% tretinoin cream versus placebo on melasma (<LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kimbrough_x002d_Green-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kimbrough-Green 1994</LINK>). The two trials were not pooled due to clinical heterogeneity. The study by Griffiths et al was on 50 Caucasian women with 94% epidermal, 4% dermal, and 2% mixed melasma. The study by Kimbrough-Green et al was on 30 black people with moderate to severe melasma only. The type of melasma was also different with a lower proportion of epidermal melasma (43%) and a higher proportion of dermal melasma (37%) which is more resistant to treatment; 20% had mixed melasma.   </P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 1993</LINK> 12 participants were lost to follow up and 38 people included in the analysis; 19 in the tretinoin and 19 in the placebo group. Assessment of improvement was made with both subjective and objective measures. At 40 weeks there was a significant difference and 13/19 in the tretinoin group were improved or much improved compared to 1/19 in the placebo group (the trial authors stated P = 0.0006, RR 13, 95% CI 1.88 to 89.74; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). The overall severity of melasma was also evaluated using a Wood's lamp on a 0 to 9 scale; 0 is no melasma and 9 severe melasma. Tretinoin treatment significantly reduced the severity of melasma compared to placebo (SMD -0.85, 95% CI -1.51 to -0.18; <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). </P>
<P>The significant improvement seen was also confirmed on colorimetry. In the tretinoin group there was an increase in luminance (L value) from baseline 58.5 (SD 3.9) to 59.4 (SD 3.1) versus a decrease in the placebo group from 60.0 (SD 2.6) to 59.7 (SD 2.6) at 40 weeks. The onset of improvement is slow and the first significant improvement occurred at 24 weeks of tretinoin treatment. </P>
<P>Although adverse reactions were noted, the numbers recorded were confusing. Moderate skin reactions defined as moderate redness and peeling on at least 2 visits was noted in 22/25 tretinoin participants and 7/24 placeb participants. In a further five tretinoin participants the reaction was severe. This would imply that 27 participants in tretinoin group had a moderate or severe adverse event, when only 26 participants received tretinoin.   </P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Kimbrough_x002d_Green-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kimbrough-Green 1994</LINK> study 2 participants were lost to follow up in the placebo group and 28 participants included in the analysis; 15 in the tretinoin group and 13 in the placebo group. At 40 weeks 11/15 in the tretinoin group were improved or much improved compared to 6/13 in the placebo group. There was no significant difference between the groups (the trial authors stated P = 0.07, RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.08; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>).  Although no difference was found between the groups on the scale of much worse to much improved, when the MASI score was used a significant difference was detected at 40 weeks. In the tretinoin group there was a mean reduction in MASI score by 32% compared to a mean reduction in the placebo group by 10% (P = 0.03). The significant improvement noted on the subjective MASI evaluation was also confirmed on colorimetry (the trial authors stated P = 0.02, SMD 0.83, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.61; <LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were more adverse events in the tretinoin group with mild erythema and/or peeling in 10/15 participants versus 1/15 in the placebo group (RR 10.0, 95% CI 1.46 to 68.69; <LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>). Reduction of side-effects did not require use of any other medication and was achieved with more application of emollient. None of the participants experienced hyperpigmentation or gross depigmentation.</P>
<P>In Thailand <LINK REF="STD-Leenutaphong-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leenutaphong 1999</LINK> compared 0.05% isotretinoin gel to placebo. Thirty Thai participants with moderate to severe melasma were randomised to receive either isotretinoin gel or colour-matched vehicle twice daily for 40 weeks. Seven were lost to follow up. Participants were also supplied with a broad spectrum sunscreen SPF-28 applied daily and before sun exposure. At 40 weeks there was a reduction in the MASI (melasma area and severity index) score in both the isotretinoin group as well as the placebo group. There was however no significant difference in the reduction of MASI between the groups (the trial authors stated P = 0.4337, SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.89; <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>). Using the colorimeter, a melanin area and melanin index score was calculated for each participant. In the isotretinoin group there was a reduction in the MASI score by 47% versus 34% reduction in the placebo group. The trial authors stated that the difference in reduction between the groups was not significant. </P>
<P>Four out of 15 in the isotretinoin group had mild erythema or peeling versus 0/15 in the placebo group. This was transient and resolved after 4 weeks with continued use. The authors concluded that isotretinoin did not have any significant lightening effect on melasma in these Thai participants. The lightening effect seen in both groups was ascribed to the broad spectrum sunscreen.  </P>

<P>In Brazil <LINK REF="STD-Ennes-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ennes 2000</LINK> compared a cream containing 4% hydroquinone and 2 sunscreens with a SPF-15 to a cream containing 2 sunscreens with a SPF-15 both applied for 12 weeks. In addition, participants applied a SPF-30 sunscreen every morning. No explanation was given for the need of three different sunscreens in each arm. </P>
<P>Forty-eight participants were randomised and 3 were lost to follow up (all from the hydroquinone group). Improvement was assessed according to one of three categories: total improvement, partial improvement, or failure. Eight participants in the hydroquinone group showed total improvement and 12 had partial improvement. In the sunscreen-only group, 2 had total improvement, 14 had partial improvement, and there were 4 failures. Outcomes were not reported in five participants. The difference between the treatments was stated to be statistically significant though it is unclear which category of improvement was analysed (trial authors report P = 0.0082). This significant difference between the groups was evident from week three. The trial authors also assessed tolerability of the study products. There was no difference in the tolerability between the groups. Adverse events, mostly erythema, were reported in 6/21 of those in the hydroquinone and sunscreen group, versus 5/24 in the sunscreen-only group (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.85; <LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>). Serious adverse events did not occur.</P>
<P>In the USA <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2003</LINK> conducted two trials to compare triple-combination cream with three dual-combination agents. The two trials were stated to be similar in protocol, participants, and study agents, and reported together. The participants (641) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: triple-combination cream (4% hydroquinone, tretinoin 0.05%, and fluocinolone acetonide 0.01%) n = 161, dual-combination agent (tretinoin 0.05% and 4% hydroquinone) n = 158, dual-combination agent (tretinoin 0.05% and fluocinolone acetonide 0.01%) n = 161, or dual-combination agent (4% hydroquinone and fluocinolone acetonide 0.01%) n = 161, daily at night for 8 weeks. </P>
<P>The trial authors stated their assessment was objective. However, none of the conventional objective assessments, e.g. reflectance spectroscopy, were used and outcome measures presented were the authors own 8-point scale of global improvement. </P>
<P>Of those receiving the triple-combination cream, 26.1% had complete clearing of melasma compared to 9.5%, 1.9%, and 2.5% respectively in each of the dual-combination creams. Triple-combination cream was significantly more effective than tretinoin and hydroquinone (RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.59 to 4.74; <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>), or tretinoin and fluocinolone acetonide (RR 14.00, 95% CI 4.43 to 44.25; <LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>), or hydroquinone and fluocinolone acetonide (RR 10.50, 95%CI 3.85 to 28.60; <LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>) in treating melasma. The trial authors report P &lt; 0.001 for improvement from triple-combination cream versus each of the dual-combination creams. Side-effects were erythema, desquamation (loss of the outer layer of skin by peeling or shedding), burning, dryness, and pruritus. Side-effects were seen most commonly in the dual-combination group, tretinoin and hydroquinone (80%), followed by the tretinoin and fluocinolone acetonide (65%) group, and the triple-combination cream (63%). The hydroquinone and fluocinolone acetonide group was the most tolerated with 34% having side-effects. However, the only participant in the study to develop skin atrophy was in this group.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Guevara-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Guevara 2003</LINK> study improvement in pigmentation was assessed objectively using the mexameter and subjectively with MASI assessments. There was a significant decrease in mexameter readings using the combination cream compared to sunscreen alone (the trial authors reported that the mean difference between the group scores was 19.8 (SD 6.24) P &lt; 0.0001). There was also a statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of reduction in MASI score (trial authors stated P = 0.01). The mean and SDs for each group were lacking in this trial.</P>
<P>The side-effects reported by participants were all either mild or moderate, and included burning, itching, dryness, redness, and peeling. No serious side-effects were seen. Mild dryness and erythema was noted in 12/20 and 11/20 respectively, and mild burning in 7/20 of those treated with the combination cream versus 0/15 who had dryness, 1/15 redness, and 3/15 mild burning in the sunscreen group (RR 19.05, 95% CI 1.22 to 298.21; <LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK>), (RR 8.25, 95% CI 1.19 to 57.10 <LINK REF="CMP-010.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.2</LINK>), (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.54 to 5.67; <LINK REF="CMP-010.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.3</LINK>).

Improvement in melasma was graded on a scale of -1 (worse compared to baseline), 0 (no change), 1 (0% to 33% lighter), 2 (34% to 66% lighter), and 3 (&gt; 66% lighter). At the end of 26 weeks there was no significant difference between the groups. The mean score in the peeled side was 1.4 versus 1 in the non-peeled side (no SDs provided). Adverse events were stinging and redness post-peel which was transient. One participant had a burn after the 20% glycolic acid peel resulting in hyperpigmentation which cleared in 2 months. No side-effects in the non-peeled group were mentioned in the text.   </P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Lim-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lim 1999</LINK> study the physician-subjective assessment found that on the side of face treated with kojic acid, a higher proportion of participants (24/40) had greater than 50% improvement compared to the hydroquinone and glycolic acid side (19/40). The side treated with kojic acid also showed a faster response rate. When the physicians were asked to compare the side treated with kojic acid to the other side, 42.5% thought there was greater improvement on the kojic acid-treated side and 12.5% on the hydroquinone and glycolic acid only side; 45% could not tell the difference. The improvement in the kojic acid group was not statistically significant (trial authors report P = 0.9). </P>
<P>All participants were reported to have redness, stinging, and mild exfoliation and this was seen on both sides of the face.These adverse events settled by the third week of the study. No further details were provided.   </P>

<P>In Pakistan <LINK REF="STD-Ejaz-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ejaz 2008</LINK> conducted a trial to compare Jessner&#8217;s (14% salicylic acid, 14% lactic acid, 14% resorcinol in alcohol) peel to 30% salicylic acid peel after 2 weeks of priming with 0.05% tretinoin cream nightly. Sixty participants with epidermal melasma were randomised to receive either Jessner&#8217;s peel or salicylic acid peel for 5 minutes every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Participants then entered a 12-week follow-up period. There were 3 withdrawals at the end of 12 weeks and 14 withdrawals at 24 weeks. </P>
<P>The authors found no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of reduction in MASI at 12 weeks (SMD 0.08, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.61; <LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK>) or 24 weeks (SMD -0.09, 95% CI-0.71 to 0.52; <LINK REF="CMP-011.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.2</LINK>).

<P>In France <LINK REF="STD-Khemis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Khemis 2007</LINK> conducted a split face trial on 32 women with moderate to severe melasma. Participants were randomised to rucinol serum or placebo to the right or left side of the face, they were also provided with a broad spectrum sunscreen SPF-60. There were 4 withdrawals, and 28 participants completed the 12-week study. There was also an open label extension of the study for 3 months during which time participants received rucinol on both sides of the face, the results of which are not reported in this review. A clinical pigmentation score from 0 (no pigmentation) to 10 (brown pigmentation of high intensity) was allocated for different regions of the face (forehead, malar (cheek) region, and chin) and a mean taken. A significantly lower pigmentation score was achieved on the side treated with rucinol (P = 0.027 reported). The mean clinical pigmentation score at baseline in the rucinol group was 7.5 (SD 1.9) and at 12 weeks it was 6.2 (SD 2.3). In the placebo group the score at baseline was 7.5 (SD 1.9) and at 12 weeks was 6.7 (SD 2.1). The small reduction in score seen in the placebo group was attributed to sunscreen use. Although a reduction in the clinical pigmentation score was also seen at the earlier assessment of 8 weeks, the score was not significantly different from baseline and rucinol may have a slower onset of action. Colorimetric assessments using the chromameter confirmed that the rucinol-treated side was significantly lighter and less yellow at 12 weeks. The L, a, b system was used. The L value expresses the relative brightness of colour (the higher value the better), the 'a' value records erythema and the 'b' value skin tanning. The mean and SDs were not provided at baseline (trial authors stated P = 0.013 for the &#8216;L&#8217; value and P = 0.008 for the &#8216;b&#8217; value). There was also a tendency to less erythema (P = 0.051 for &#8216;a&#8217;).</P>
<P>There were 12 adverse events reported, the majority of which were mild. The authors felt only one was related to the study product, a small depigmented spot due to placebo. It is unclear if the numbers of adverse events include the extended phase of the study.   </P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2003</LINK> study although the participants' self-assessment detected no difference between the treatments, objective evaluation using a colorimeter found a significant difference with more improvement on vitamin-C-treated side (the trial authors stated P = 0.03). At baseline the mean difference in the L value between the melasma and normal area on the vitamin C side was 4.6. At 12 weeks, the mean difference in the L value was 2.78. On the distilled water side the mean difference in the L value at baseline was 4.45 and at 12 weeks, 3.87. In participants treated with vitamin C iontophoresis, there was mild sensation of electric shock in 6/29 participants, itching, and erythema in 2 participants each as well as a burning sensation in 1 participant and dryness in another. No side-effects of the distilled water iontophoresis were mentioned. </P>
<P>Thirion et al conducted a trial in Belgium on 27 women with melasma affecting the forehead for at least 6 months (<LINK REF="STD-Thirion-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thirion 2006</LINK>). It is unclear if participants were excluded if they had melasma elsewhere (e.g. cheeks or chin). No explanation is given as to why the authors limited inclusion to forehead melasma. Participants were randomised to Thiospot intensive, a cosmetic-whitening formulation containing ethyl linoleate, thioctic acid, octadecanedioic acid, lactic acid, and ethylhexylmethoxycinnamate, or Eucerin non-whitening skin care both applied twice daily for 3 months. Thiospot is purported to inhibit the enzyme tyrosinase involved in melanin synthesis. There was a significant difference between the groups. At three months the group receiving Thiospot had lighter skin with a lower melanin index measured using a mexameter (the trial authors stated P &lt; 0.01, SMD -2.61, 95% CI -3.76 to -1.47; <LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>). The significant improvement in melasma in the Thiospot group was also confirmed on the other objective measurements of video-recorded ultraviolet light reflection, corneomelametry, as well as the physician&#8217;s subjective assessment. </P>

<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Francisco_x002d_Diaz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Francisco-Diaz 2004</LINK> study after 12 weeks, the decrease in the MASI was not significantly different for the 2 sides, although there was greater decrease on the Gigawhite-treated side. There was a decrease in MASI by 18.5% (mean) on the Gigawhite side compared to 13.5% (mean) on the placebo side. Although no significant differences were noted on subjective measures, the colorimeter analysis found a significant difference with improvement of 6.9% (mean) in luminance on the Gigawhite side compared to 1.03% (mean) on the placebo side at 12 weeks (the trial authors stated P = 0.013). There were no adverse effects due to Gigawhite or placebo.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-06-15 13:27:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura  Prescott">
<P>The large number of different treatments (23) evaluated supports the view that there is no standard therapy for melasma. Most of the studies were unable to provide robust evidence about the many choices of treatment options. We found weak evidence of the effects of some of the interventions used in the management of melasma including some less conventional therapies. Results have been presented for individual studies as data pooling was not possible. Most of the included trials compared two or more active treatments and consequently the RR reported may be lower than if placebo-controlled trials were conducted. Additionally some studies may fail to reach statistical significance due to this same reason and care has to be exercised in not concluding that none of the treatments work.  </P>
<P>The most common intervention among the included trials was topical hydroquinone (seven RCTs). The formulation of hydroquinone used was mostly as 4% hydroquinone cream. All the trials using hydroquinone compared two active interventions and there were no placebo-controlled trials. Hydroquinone (4%) was compared to 20% azelaic acid and to 5% ascorbic acid in separate trials. No significant difference in skin lightening was found by the physicians, although in the trial involving ascorbic acid a significant difference in favour of hydroquinone was noted by those participants who self-assessed. When hydroquinone cream was compared to combination therapy of hydroquinone cream and glycolic acid peels, no significant difference was found. In both arms there was a significant improvement from baseline. Hydroquinone (4%) was not as effective as triple-combination cream (hydroquinone, tretinoin, and steroid) or as effective as when combined with intense pulsed light treatment. Lower strengths of hydroquinone were used in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Sivayathorn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sivayathorn 1995</LINK> (2% hydroquinone) and <LINK REF="STD-V_x00e1_zquez-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Vázquez 1983</LINK> (3% hydroquinone). Hydroquinone (2%) was not as effective as 20% azelaic acid in treating melasma according to the physicians in the <LINK REF="STD-Sivayathorn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sivayathorn 1995</LINK> study though no difference was noted on objective measures. More benefit in terms of depigmentation was noted when 3% hydroquinone was combined with a daily sunscreen in the <LINK REF="STD-V_x00e1_zquez-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Vázquez 1983</LINK> study.</P>
<P>Topical retinoids were used in three RCTs. Tretinoin was significantly more effective than placebo in lightening melasma by objective measures in those with white and black skin, though in the latter trial, no difference was found for one of the subjective outcome measures. When topical isotretinoin, a chemically-related structure to tretinoin was used, no difference was found to placebo. </P>
<P>A variety of combination creams were used. The combination of hydroquinone and sunscreen was significantly more effective than sunscreen alone as was the combination of hydroquinone, glycolic acid, vitamins, and sunscreen compared to sunscreen alone. In the largest study in the review the triple-combination cream (hydroquinone, tretinoin, and steroid) was more effective than any of the agents in a dual-combination cream. In two other studies using combination creams there was no difference between hydroquinone, glycolic acid, and kojic acid cream versus hydroquinone and glycolic acid cream, or between hydroquinone and glycolic acid cream versus combination therapy of hydroquinone and glycolic acid cream and glycolic acid peels.  </P>
<P>No significant difference was found between Jessner&#8217;s peels and salicylic acid peels both with tretinoin priming. </P>
<P>Four RCTs of unconventional therapies were found all of which suggested some efficacy. Rucinol serum was more effective at lightening melasma compared to placebo as was the skin-whitening complex Thiospot, containing ethyl linoleate, thioctic acid, octadecanedioic acid, lactic acid, and ethylhexylmethoxycinnamate. Vitamin C iontophoresis which is used to increase penetration of vitamin C in the skin was compared to distilled water iontophoresis and was significantly more effective on objective measures though the participants in the study could not tell the difference. Similarly in the trial of a botanical extract, Gigawhite 5%, no significant differences to placebo were noted on subjective measures by the physicians though colorimeter analysis showed that the side treated with Gigawhite was significantly lighter. </P>
<P>Adverse events reported in the studies were mostly mild and transient such as skin irritation, pruritus, burning, and stinging.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-06-15 09:04:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>We found 20 studies altogether of 23 different interventions. The lack of replication of the studies in itself limits the overall applicability of results. The studies we identified were not sufficient to address all the objectives of the review. It is disappointing that no studies provided quality of life data and none examined the long-term effects of the interventions. Additionally a significant number of studies did not include participant assessment which in our view is an important measure of successful treatment. </P>
<P>All the RCTs assessed therapies aimed at depigmenting melasma rather than other approaches such as cosmetic camouflage, laser therapy, or even preventative measures such as the use of a sunscreen. The only study which investigated the benefit of a sunscreen used it in addition to hydroquinone and the results were poorly reported. We did not find any trials of sunscreen versus placebo although it is worth pointing out that in most trials the use of a sunscreen was recommended. It is also worth noting that just over the half (11) of the included studies were industry-sponsored, e.g. by the manufacturing company, whereby only positive studies are likely to be reported.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-06-15 13:29:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura  Prescott">
<P>We included 20 randomised controlled trials involving 2125 participants. In general, there was low methodological quality and a lack of reliable outcome assessments. There was considerable variation in the methods used for scoring improvement in pigmentation and it is difficult to assess the validity of the results. There was also a striking scarcity of placebo-controlled trials. Only seven placebo-controlled trials were conducted. The lightening of the skin noted in the groups receiving placebo varied, but in some were considerable (2% to 60%). In six of the seven trials, there was a co-intervention of a sunscreen and the improvement seen in the placebo group was attributed to this. Most studies poorly documented the details of the sunscreen co-intervention or if it was similar across the groups in each trial. There is a case series of 200 participants that concluded that sunscreen improves melasma (<LINK REF="REF-Lakhdar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lakhdar 2007</LINK>). It is possible that in some studies the benefit seen could have been due to different patterns of use of sunscreen between the groups studied. </P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-06-15 14:16:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura  Prescott">
<P>It is possible that all relevant studies have not been included in this review and that some unpublished trials were not found. Every effort has been made to locate such studies though in many studies authors failed to respond to additional requests for information. Considering the wide number of different countries in which the trials were conducted, some may be less well represented in the databases searched and may have escaped our searches. </P>
<P>Some studies containing potentially useful data had to be excluded as those with melasma were lumped together with people with a range of other hyperpigmentary skin conditions. Our pre-specified criteria of excluding studies which were open label where placebo use was possible and if not outcome assessor-blinded also meant that further studies were excluded.</P>
<P>Finally, the variety of scoring systems, descriptions relating to improvement, as well as the inadequate reporting of many of the trials may have led to misunderstanding during our evaluation of effect in the individual studies.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2010-06-15 14:13:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura  Prescott">
<P>The results of our review are in general agreement with the comments of <LINK REF="REF-Rendon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rendon 2006</LINK> in a review by the Pigmentary Disorders Academy aimed at estimating the clinical efficacy of the different treatments available for melasma. The group consensus was that first-line therapy should consist of effective topical therapies mainly the triple-combination cream or if unavailable, dual combinations (hydroquinone and glycolic acid), or single agents of hydroquinone, tretinoin, or azelaic acid. Second-line therapy recommended was peels alone or in combination with topical therapy. We found evidence of effect of all the above treatments but were unable to conclude which was the best. <LINK REF="REF-Rendon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rendon 2006</LINK> also noted that given the variations of assessing treatments it was difficult to make effective comparisons. </P>
<P>A systematic review by Gupta and colleagues concluded that combining topical agents such as hydroquinone, tretinoin, and a corticosteroid, in addition to regular sunscreen use, is the mainstay of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2006</LINK>). Other lightening agents mentioned include monotherapy of tretinoin, azelaic acid or hydroquinone, chemical peels, laser treatments, and intense pulsed light therapy. Kojic acid, isopropylcatechol, N-acetyl-4-cysteaminylphenol, flavonoid extracts, and oral pycnogenol were also reviewed but the Gupta and colleagues felt more investigation was needed before they could be recommended. We found no RCTs assessing the latter four compounds which fulfilled our inclusion criteria. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-06-15 14:11:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura  Prescott">
<P>The evidence from this review is insufficient to provide clear guidelines for practice. We found low-quality RCT evidence for a number of different interventions producing varying degrees of skin lightening. All comparisons were evaluated in only one study each apart from the comparison of tretinoin versus placebo (two studies). Tretinoin was beneficial in both white and dark skin participants with a higher proportion of dermal melasma, though in the latter group, the effect was less marked. Triple-combination cream may be more effective than hydroquinone alone or when compared to any of the individual constituents as a dual combination. </P>
<P>Our review also found limited evidence for other combination creams. Hydroquinone combined with a sunscreen, or hydroquinone combined with glycolic acid, vitamins, and sunscreen are more effective than a sunscreen alone. There is also limited evidence for the combination therapy of hydroquinone cream combined with intense pulsed light being more effective than hydroquinone cream alone.</P>
<P>Rucinol serum and a skin-whitening complex, Thiospot, may also be useful. In four trials comparing vitamin C iontophoresis to distilled water iontophoresis, Gigawhite botanical extract to placebo, 4% hydroquinone to 5% ascorbic acid, and 20% azelaic acid to 2% hydroquinone, evidence of significant differences between the interventions was less clear. This was because by some of the outcome measures no differences were found whereas with other outcome measures significant differences were noted. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2003</LINK> comparing vitamin C iontophoresis to distilled water iontophoresis, statistically significant results were found on the colorimeter analysis, but the participants in the study could not tell the difference between the sides treated. Similarly, in <LINK REF="STD-Francisco_x002d_Diaz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Francisco-Diaz 2004</LINK>, the physician-assessed MASI for the Gigawhite-treated side was not significantly different to placebo, but colorimeter analysis showed significantly lighter melasma on the side treated with Gigawhite. The clinical benefit of improvement on objective measures only without taking into account improvement noted subjectively by the participants or physicians is questionable.</P>
<P>For the other comparisons (six studies) the results for the interventions studied were not significantly different and maybe equally effective. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-06-15 13:40:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura  Prescott">
<P>Melasma affects many people around the world, yet there is a paucity of well-conducted RCTs. Most of the trials conducted were of poor methodological quality and short duration. Melasma is a chronic and relapsing disorder. We therefore recommend that trials should have an intervention period of at least 6 months and there should be long-term follow up for at least 12 months following the intervention to assess the maintenance of response. Future trials should clearly define participants at baseline. Variation in participant features such as age, duration, or type of melasma are important considerations in assessing the differing response to the interventions and should be provided for each group. Well-designed RCTs investigating the benefit of sunscreen are needed. If sunscreen is recommended as a co-intervention there should be details on the SPF, frequency of application and ideally, the sunscreen should be provided along with the study products. In poorer countries, adequate application of a sunscreen may be costly and if not equal between the groups could lead to confounding.   </P>
<P>Participant perception of the severity of disease and degree of improvement can be different to the clinical trial investigators, and participant-assessed outcomes should be incorporated into the study design. There is also a need for trials to include quality of life measures in view of the considerable effect that melasma has on sufferers. The inclusion of the quality of life measures such as the Dermatology Quality of Life Index or the new melasma specific MELASQOL developed for women with melasma would improve relevance of trials and allow comparison between trials using different interventions. Trial investigators should avoid individual made-up scores to assess response and instead use uniform outcome measures such as the subjective measures of MASI or the melasma severity scale as well as objective measures, e.g. reflectance spectroscopy or corneomelametry. Finally, trials should include a more systematic approach to adverse event reporting including grading of the severity of the adverse event by participants and it should be noted whether the adverse event is related to the study product.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2010-06-15 13:53:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laura  Prescott">
<P>There are several changes compared to the published protocol:</P>
<P>In the Methods section, under the subheading 'Criteria for considering studies for this review' &gt; 'Types of studies' we included trials that were open label even if placebo use was possible as long as they were assessor-blinded. This is a change from the protocol in which the plan was to exclude open label trials if placebo use was possible. We felt that the original criteria of excluding all open label trials where placebo use was possible was too stringent. By ensuring there was a blind assessment of outcome, observer bias is likely to have been limited. </P>
<P>Under the section 'Types of interventions' we had planned to categorise treatments according to categories such as sunscreens, treatments which decrease inflammation, skin-lightening agents etc. However, as each trial had a unique set of interventions and as most had active comparisons it did not make sense to categorise treatments in this manner as most trials would come under one or two categories. </P>
<P>Under the section 'Types of outcome measures' we defined our outcome measures more clearly by stratifying the outcomes of greatest interest as the primary outcomes and other measures as secondary outcomes. In view of the significant impact melasma has on sufferers, the two primary outcomes were the participant-assessed changes in severity and quality of life measures. We felt it was necessary to define these outcomes separately as quality of life measures focus on how people feel about their skin appearance and the impact the melasma has on their life whilst the participant-assessed improvement focused on the change in severity of pigmentation following treatment.</P>
<P>The other outcomes of interest: physician evaluation, adverse events, and long-term improvement were our secondary outcomes. In terms of physician-assessed changes we divided this into subjective and objective evaluation techniques. After extracting the data we found most trials assessed outcomes according to either method and this may allow more accurate comparisons between trials. The subjective measures are the clinically relevant changes in pigmentation whilst the objective techniques aim to measure skin colour in an accurate reproducible manner. The MASI score, whilst attempting to standardise the evaluation of pigmentation, was included in the subjective rather than objective measures as set out in the protocol as the components of darkness, area, and homogeneity which make up the score are assessed subjectively.</P>
<P>We added two further outcomes, the time to improvement of melasma and the long-term remission rate. The rapidity of action of a test substance may affect adherence to treatment and overall satisfaction with treatment and this was measured by time to improvement of melasma. Long-term remission rate is defined as improvement in pigmentation lasting more than 12 months and was used to identify potential relapses following cessation of treatment.</P>
<P>In the 'Data collection and analysis' section under 'Measure of treatment effect' we changed the effect estimate from odds ratio (OR) stated in the protocol, to risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes.</P>
