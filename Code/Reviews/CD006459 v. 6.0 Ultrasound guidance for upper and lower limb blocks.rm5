<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Nerve blocks are used to numb all or part of the arms or legs (peripheral blockade) for surgery, or to provide pain relief after the operation, or both. Using ultrasound, anaesthetists can 'see' vital structures below the skin, which should allow them to place the local anaesthetic injection accurately and avoid damaging other tissues or organs. We aimed to assess whether ultrasound has any advantages over other nerve-locating techniques for nerve blocks of the arms or legs in adults.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current up to 27 August 2014. We found 32 studies with 2844 participants. Most studies compared ultrasound with electrical nerve stimulators or compared ultrasound combined with nerve stimulators against nerve stimulators alone. We reran the search in May 2015. We will deal with the 11 studies of interest when we next update the review.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We combined the results of studies using statistical tests and found that nerve blocks were more likely to be assessed as adequate for surgery and were less likely to need additional anaesthetic when performed using ultrasound guidance or ultrasound guidance combined with other techniques. We also found that there were fewer complications such as 'pins and needles' or accidental punctures of blood vessels. It also took less time to perform the nerve block when ultrasound alone
 
was used.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>There was variation in the quality of the studies and authors had not always made sufficient attempts to ensure that the outcome assessors were unaware of what technique had been used for the nerve block. Studies had also often not clearly explained how experienced the people giving the nerve block were. This is particularly important, as ultrasound is still a relatively new technique and some anaesthetists may have limited experience. We rated our evidence for whether the nerve blocks were sufficient and adequate for surgery as of moderate quality, but evidence for our other outcomes was either low or very low.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Our evidence suggests that ultrasound is superior to other techniques for peripheral nerve blocks. However, we are unable to say whether this result depends on the experience of the practitioner in the technique being used.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-08-18 11:06:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of this review was to assess whether the use of ultrasound to guide peripheral nerve blockade has any advantages over other methods of peripheral nerve location. Specifically, we have asked whether the use of ultrasound guidance:</P>
<P>1. improves success rates and effectiveness of regional anaesthetic blocks, by increasing the number of blocks that are assessed as adequate</P>
<P>2. reduces the complications, such as cardiorespiratory arrest, pneumothorax or vascular puncture, associated with the performance of regional anaesthetic blocks</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-08-18 11:07:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the 2014 update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 8); MEDLINE (July 2008 to August 2014); EMBASE (July 2008 to August 2014); ISI Web of Science (2008 to April 2013); CINAHL (July 2014); and LILACS (July 2008 to August 2014). We completed forward and backward citation and clinical trials register searches.The original search was to July 2008. We reran the search in May 2015. We have added 11 potential new studies of interest to the list of 'Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate them into the formal review findings during future review updates.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-08-18 11:07:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block of the upper and lower limbs, alone or combined, with at least one other method of nerve location<I>
<B>.</B>
</I> In the 2014 update, we excluded studies that had given general anaesthetic, spinal, epidural or other nerve blocks to all participants, as well as those measuring the minimum effective dose of anaesthetic drug. This resulted in the exclusion of five studies from the original review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-06-25 18:37:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, including an assessment of risk of bias and degree of practitioner experience for all studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-08-19 16:16:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 32 RCTs with 2844 adult participants. Twenty-six assessed upper-limb and six assessed lower-limb blocks. Seventeen compared ultrasound with peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), and nine compared ultrasound combined with nerve stimulation (US + NS) against PNS alone. Two studies compared ultrasound with anatomical landmark technique, one with a transarterial approach, and three were three-arm designs that included US, US + PNS and PNS.</P>
<P>There were variations in the quality of evidence, with a lack of detail in many of the studies to judge whether randomization, allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessors was sufficient. It was not possible to blind practitioners and there was therefore a high risk of performance bias across all studies, leading us to downgrade the evidence for study limitations using GRADE. There was insufficient detail on the experience and expertise of practitioners and whether experience was equivalent between intervention and control.</P>
<P>We performed meta-analysis for our main outcomes. We found that ultrasound guidance produces superior peripheral nerve block success rates, with more blocks being assessed as sufficient for surgery following sensory or motor testing (Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) odds ratio (OR), fixed-effect 2.94 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.14 to 4.04); 1346 participants), and fewer blocks requiring supplementation or conversion to general anaesthetic (M-H OR, fixed-effect 0.28 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.39); 1807 participants) compared with the use of PNS, anatomical landmark techniques or a transarterial approach. We were not concerned by risks of indirectness, imprecision or inconsistency for these outcomes and used GRADE to assess these outcomes as being of moderate quality. Results were similarly advantageous for studies comparing US + PNS with NS alone for the above outcomes (M-H OR, fixed-effect 3.33 (95% CI 2.13 to 5.20); 719 participants, and M-H OR, fixed-effect 0.34 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.56); 712 participants respectively). There were lower incidences of paraesthesia in both the ultrasound comparison groups (M-H OR, fixed-effect 0.42 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.76); 471 participants, and M-H OR, fixed-effect 0.97 (95% CI 0.30 to 3.12); 178 participants respectively) and lower incidences of vascular puncture in both groups (M-H OR, fixed-effect 0.19 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.57); 387 participants, and M-H OR, fixed-effect 0.22 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.90); 143 participants). There were fewer studies for these outcomes and we therefore downgraded both for imprecision and paraesthesia for potential publication bias. This gave an overall GRADE assessment of very low and low for these two outcomes respectively. Our analysis showed that it took less time to perform nerve blocks in the ultrasound group (mean difference (MD), IV, fixed-effect -1.06 (95% CI -1.41 to -0.72); 690 participants) but more time to perform the block when ultrasound was combined with a PNS technique (MD, IV, fixed-effect 0.76 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.98); 587 participants). With high levels of unexplained statistical heterogeneity, we graded this outcome as very low quality. We did not combine data for other outcomes as study results had been reported using differing scales or with a combination of mean and median data, but our interpretation of individual study data favoured ultrasound for a reduction in other minor complications and reduction in onset time of block and number of attempts to perform block.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-08-18 11:08:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence that peripheral nerve blocks performed by ultrasound guidance alone, or in combination with PNS, are superior in terms of improved sensory and motor block, reduced need for supplementation and fewer minor complications reported. Using ultrasound alone shortens performance time when compared with nerve stimulation, but when used in combination with PNS it increases performance time.</P>
<P>We were unable to determine whether these findings reflect the use of ultrasound in experienced hands and it was beyond the scope of this review to consider the learning curve associated with peripheral nerve blocks by ultrasound technique compared with other methods.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-08-20 16:36:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-08-20 16:36:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Regional anaesthesia (using an injection of local anaesthetic to produce a 'nerve block' to numb a part of the body) has a well-established role in anaesthetic practice. Nerve blocks may be used as the sole form of anaesthesia or to provide postoperative analgesia. For the block to work effectively, the local anaesthetic has to be injected in the correct place, near the nerve, so locating the nerve is vital (<LINK REF="REF-Denny-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denny 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Various techniques have been used for finding nerves. Easily identifiable landmarks, usually bones or arteries, may be used to guide the point of needle insertion.
 
Low-current electrical nerve stimulators linked to the injection needle have also been used to locate the nerve. As the needle nears the nerve, muscles supplied by the nerve can be seen to twitch in time with the pulses of current. Latterly, ultrasound has been used to guide nerve block insertion and a number of approaches to nerves and plexuses (groups of nerves) have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kapral-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kapral 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kirchmair-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirchmair 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandhu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandhu 2002</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-03-13 12:39:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Proponents of ultrasound-guided blocks suggest many benefits over other methods of nerve location (for instance, <LINK REF="REF-Marhofer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marhofer 2005</LINK>). 'Seeing' the nerve, needle, and spread of local anaesthetic as it is injected is said to be an advantage over the other techniques outlined above. It is possible to use the ultrasound image to position the needle more precisely, which should lead to a higher success rate and allow smaller volumes of drug to be used whilst still producing the desired effect. As the severity of the life-threatening complications of local anaesthetic injection is proportional to the dose of drug injected, this should make blocks safer. Other important structures, for instance blood vessels, tendons, and pleura, can be more easily avoided. Some reports have also suggested faster onset times (<LINK REF="STD-Marhofer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Marhofer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marhofer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marhofer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sandhu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandhu 2002</LINK>), longer duration of block (<LINK REF="REF-Marhofer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marhofer 2004</LINK>), and improved quality of anaesthesia (<LINK REF="STD-Marhofer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Marhofer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marhofer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marhofer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2003</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-08-20 16:36:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Complications of regional anaesthesia are rare but can be serious. In a prospective study of 21,278 patients receiving peripheral nerve blocks, there were three episodes of cardiac arrest (1.4/10,000); 16 seizures (7.5/10,000); and four cases of neurological damage (radiculopathy) (1.9/10,000) (<LINK REF="REF-Auroy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Auroy 1997</LINK>). A follow-up study in 2002 collected serious complications self-reported by anaesthetists over a 10-month period. Out of 50,223 peripheral nerve blocks, patients showed one cardiac arrest (0.2/10,000); two episodes of acute respiratory failure (0.3/10 000); six seizures (1.2/10,000); and 12 episodes of peripheral neuropathy (2.3/10,000) (<LINK REF="REF-Auroy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Auroy 2002</LINK>). However, due to underreporting, actual complication rates may be higher than is stated in the literature. It has been suggested that the use of ultrasound may reduce complication rates by allowing more accurate needle placement and avoidance of other structures.</P>
<P>Whilst it is clear that peripheral nerve blocks can be successfully performed using ultrasound guidance, it is important to systematically review the evidence supporting its use.</P>

<P>We excluded the use of ultrasound to guide epidural and spinal anaesthetic injections. We considered blocks performed for treatment of chronic pain to be beyond the scope of this review, as techniques and assessed outcomes are likely to be different. In this updated review we also excluded studies which had been designed to test the minimum effective volume of anaesthetic (MEAV), as it was not possible to effectively measure our primary outcome with this design. We also excluded studies that had given general anaesthetic, spinal, epidural or additional nerve blocks to all participants in addition to the nerve block under investigation, and therefore also excluded studies that described the purpose of the nerve block as 'postoperative analgesic' only.

<P>We reconsidered the outcome definitions for the 2014 update and made alterations to improve clarity. We divided the primary outcome of block success into two outcomes to distinguish between the assessments used to define block success, i.e. predicted adequacy of the block with the use of motor or sensory testing, and the assessment of whether surgical anaesthesia had been achieved without the need for supplementary anaesthesia or conversion to general anaesthesia. We adapted the complications outcome to include <I>all</I> complications. We did not include studies that specifically assessed the volume of anaesthetic given during nerve blocks, as outcome data from these studies could not adequately measure our primary outcome<I>

<P>Due to changes to the &#8217;Risk of bias&#8217; tool in RevMan 5.3 since the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2009</LINK>), we reconsidered the risk of bias for all included studies. These changes included separation of blinding of participants and personnel from blinding of outcome assessors. We considered each individual outcome for performance and detection bias. We assessed methodological quality using criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed individual studies for adequacy of sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, handling of incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other potential forms of bias.

<P>Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding of the practitioner was never going to be possible and it is therefore an unavoidable source of bias. It was necessary for us to judge performance bias across all outcomes in all studies as being at high risk of bias due to this lack of blinding. It was, however, possible for detection bias to be reduced by ensuring that observers/investigators collecting data for some of the outcomes were blinded to group allocation. Seventeen studies had reported sufficient information on whether outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation on at least one of the outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Brull-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brull 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casati-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Casati 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cataldo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cataldo 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Domingo_x002d_Triado-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Domingo-Triado 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dufour-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dufour 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gurkan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gurkan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2009a</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Meierhofer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Meierhofer 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perlas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perlas 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sauter-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sauter 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seidel-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Seidel 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shrestha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shrestha 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sites-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sites 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taboada-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Taboada 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trabelsi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Trabelsi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Geffen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Van Geffen 2009</LINK>).

<P>There was one study that failed to report any baseline characteristics (<LINK REF="STD-Soeding-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soeding 2005</LINK>) and we were therefore unable to make a judgement on whether any bias could have been introduced. A further four studies reported baseline characteristics for which there were some discrepancies between groups: in <LINK REF="STD-Dhir-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dhir 2008</LINK> there were more older participants in the nerve stimulation (with stimulating catheter) group; in <LINK REF="STD-Domingo_x002d_Triado-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Domingo-Triado 2007</LINK> there were differences between groups in the types of surgery; in <LINK REF="STD-Geiser-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Geiser 2011</LINK> there were more women than men reported in the table, although the text stated that there was no difference; and in <LINK REF="STD-Dufour-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dufour 2008</LINK> there was a difference in the ASA status between groups. We were unsure whether these differences could potentially introduce any bias into the results, and assessed them as being at unclear risk. The remaining 27 studies all had comparable baseline characteristics between participants.</P>
<P>We were interested in whether study authors had been provided with any funding for their research and therefore considered this in our assessment of risk of bias. There were five studies that declared that the ultrasound or nerve stimulator equipment had been provided by the manufacturer for the purpose of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Brull-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brull 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gurkan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gurkan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sites-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sites 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Geffen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Van Geffen 2009</LINK>). We judged these studies to be at a higher risk of bias. All other studies either declared funding from departmental sources only, or did not make any funding declarations, and we assessed them as being at low risk of bias.</P>
<P>The experience of practitioners in both ultrasound and control techniques, as well as the number of practitioners involved, varied across studies. There were 12 studies that described the person giving the block as experienced (<LINK REF="STD-Bloc-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bloc 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brull-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brull 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casati-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Casati 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Danelli-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Danelli 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kapral-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kapral 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meierhofer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Meierhofer 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morros-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Morros 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perlas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perlas 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salem-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Salem 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sauter-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sauter 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soeding-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soeding 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taboada-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Taboada 2009</LINK>). However, even for those that stated that the practitioners had experience in both techniques, it was not clear whether this experience was equivalent for each technique. For this reason we were unable to judge whether any bias had been introduced by the practitioners in these studies. Some procedures were performed by anaesthesia residents under supervision (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2003</LINK>), and we felt that could be likely to introduce bias, particularly for block performance time, and therefore assessed them as being at high risk. We also rated studies at high risk of bias if it was clear that the practitioner had more experience in one technique than the other, or that different procedures were intentionally performed by different practitioners.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Block success - predicted adequacy of block</HEADING>
<P>There were 17 studies with 1346 participants comparing ultrasound guidance with either nerve stimulation (15 studies: <LINK REF="STD-Bloc-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bloc 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brull-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brull 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Geiser-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Geiser 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kapral-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kapral 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macaire-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Macaire 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meierhofer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Meierhofer 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perlas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perlas 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Renes-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Renes 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sauter-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sauter 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taboada-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Taboada 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trabelsi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Trabelsi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Geffen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Van Geffen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zaragoza_x002d_Lemus-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Zaragoza-Lemus 2012</LINK>), anatomical landmark technique (one study: <LINK REF="STD-Soeding-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soeding 2005</LINK>) or a transarterial approach (one study: <LINK REF="STD-Sites-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sites 2006</LINK>) and reporting on predicted adequacy of the block. This outcome was often described by the authors as "block success" and was evaluated using appropriate sensory and motor testing at intervals following the procedure, using a scale to determine the degree of block. We combined data described as "complete", "successful" of "sufficient" block. If studies separated results for adequacy of sensory and motor success, we used data from the sensory block.</P>
<P>For the purpose of this analysis we combined the two ultrasound groups in both <LINK REF="STD-Bloc-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bloc 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2005</LINK>. We also included data for <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2007</LINK> for the ultrasound alone versus nerve stimulation group. The analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the ultrasound versus nerve stimulation groups, with a higher rate of predicted adequacy of the block in the ultrasound group than the comparison group (Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) odds ratio (OR) 3.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.11 to 4.31), 1250 participants, P value &lt; 0.00001). When data for <LINK REF="STD-Soeding-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soeding 2005</LINK> (anatomical landmark technique) and <LINK REF="STD-Sites-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sites 2006</LINK> (transarterial approach) were also included the result remained statistically significant in favour of ultrasound (M-H OR 3.06 (95% CI 2.18 to 4.30), 1346 participants, P value &lt; 0.00001). This result shows a low level of heterogeneity (I² = 13%). Considering the potential effect of bias on this result we graded this to be moderate-quality evidence of an effect in the 'Summary of findings' table.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Block success - supplementation requirement</HEADING>

Authors sometimes described this outcome as "block failure" and defined it as the need for participants to be given either supplementary block, local anaesthetic, supplementary intraoperative analgesics or conversion to general anaesthesia. For the purpose of this outcome, we combined all supplementary anaesthesia/analgesia together. As above, we combined the two ultrasound groups in <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2005</LINK>. There was a statistically significant difference between groups with fewer participants in the ultrasound group requiring additional supplementation (Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) OR 0.31 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.46),1570 participants, P value &lt; 0.00001). When we included data for <LINK REF="STD-Soeding-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soeding 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Strub-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Strub 2011</LINK> (anatomical landmark technique) and <LINK REF="STD-Sites-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sites 2006</LINK> (transarterial approach), the results remained statistically significant (M-H OR 0.28 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.39), P value &lt; 0.00001). Again, there was a low level of heterogeneity in this result (I² = 16%), and we graded it as moderate-quality evidence of an effect in the 'Summary of findings' table.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Complications</HEADING>
<P>Complication rates were recorded in 23 trials There were no reported incidences of major complications (cardiorespiratory arrest, seizures, pneumothorax, nerve injury) in any included study. Paraesthesia and vascular puncture were the most frequently reported complications and we included data for these in meta-analysis.</P>
<P>There were six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bloc-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bloc 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brull-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brull 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Concei_x00e7__x00e3_o-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Conceição 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sauter-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sauter 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soeding-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soeding 2005</LINK>) with 471 participants that reported data for paraesthesia for the groups ultrasound versus nerve stimulation (five studies) and anatomical landmark technique (one study). This analysis showed more incidences of paraesthesia in the nerve stimulation group (M-H OR, 0.42 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.76)). However there was a high level of heterogeneity in this analysis (I² = 75%) and it is clear that the result is influenced by <LINK REF="STD-Brull-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brull 2009</LINK> with a very large number of events (22 events, 45%) in the nerve stimulation group. We downgraded the quality of this evidence to very low on account of the relatively few events reported in studies and the high level of heterogeneity. See <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. There were only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dhir-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dhir 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dufour-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dufour 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shrestha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shrestha 2011</LINK>) with 178 participants that reported data for paraesthesia for the groups ultrasound + nerve stimulation versus nerve stimulation alone. There was no significant difference in this analysis (M-H OR, 0.97 (95% CI 0.30 to 3.12), P value = 0.95). See <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>.</P>
<P>There were five studies with 387 participants that reported data for vascular puncture for the groups ultrasound versus nerve stimulation (four studies: <LINK REF="STD-Bloc-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bloc 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brull-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brull 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Concei_x00e7__x00e3_o-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Conceição 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taboada-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Taboada 2009</LINK>) and transarterial approach (one study: <LINK REF="STD-Sites-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sites 2006</LINK>). The result (M-H OR 0.19 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.57)) showed that there were fewer incidences of vascular puncture in the ultrasound groups and we graded this as low level of evidence in the 'Summary of findings' table. See <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. There were only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gurkan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gurkan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shrestha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shrestha 2011</LINK>; 143 participants) that reported data for vascular puncture from our comparison groups of ultrasound + nerve stimulation versus nerve stimulation alone, and again this analysis showed a statistically significant effect of fewer incidences of vascular puncture in the ultrasound + nerve stimulation group (M-H OR 0.22 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.90)). See <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>.</P>
<P>One study reported data for axillary vessels puncture (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2005</LINK>, three incidences in the nerve stimulation group). <LINK REF="STD-Meierhofer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Meierhofer 2014</LINK> gave data for venous puncture (one incidence in the nerve stimulation group) and for arterial puncture (two incidences in both groups) and <LINK REF="STD-Morros-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Morros 2009</LINK> also for arterial puncture (one incidence in the ultrasound group and two in the nerve stimulation group).</P>
<P>Studies gave differing terms for nerve damage, but it was not always clear whether these effects were immediate, medium- or long-term and whether they were equivalent between studies. It was therefore not possible to combine them in meta-analysis. Studies that reported on such complications were <LINK REF="STD-Domingo_x002d_Triado-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Domingo-Triado 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kapral-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kapral 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perlas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perlas 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salem-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Salem 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sites-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sites 2006</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Strub-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Strub 2011</LINK>. Of these, <LINK REF="STD-Kapral-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kapral 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sites-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sites 2006</LINK> reported no events and <LINK REF="STD-Salem-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Salem 2012</LINK> reported that such effects were equivalent between groups. <LINK REF="STD-Perlas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perlas 2008</LINK> reported more numbness at 24 hours postoperatively in the ultrasound group (eight versus four events) and more weakness at this time point in the ultrasound group (10 versus two events). <LINK REF="STD-Strub-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Strub 2011</LINK> reported two events of neuralgia in the hand in the traditional nerve block technique and no events in the ultrasound group. <LINK REF="STD-Domingo_x002d_Triado-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Domingo-Triado 2007</LINK> reported that one participant had neuropathic pain at one week in the nerve stimulation group which resolved within 10 days.</P>
<P>Other effects reported were tachycardia (<LINK REF="STD-Brull-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brull 2009</LINK>, one event in the nerve stimulation group), subcutaneous haematoma (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2005</LINK>, one event in the nerve stimulation group), haematoma requiring additional manual compression (<LINK REF="STD-Sites-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sites 2006</LINK>, two events in the transarterial approach group), axillary haematoma (<LINK REF="STD-Strub-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Strub 2011</LINK>, five events in the traditional nerve block technique and two in the ultrasound group), prolonged pain in axilla (<LINK REF="STD-Strub-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Strub 2011</LINK>, three in traditional group and one in ultrasound group) and respiratory discomfort (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2003</LINK>, one participant in each group).</P>

However, some of these data were presented as median and interquartile range, or presented means without standard deviations, and it was therefore not possible to include them in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Bloc-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bloc 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brull-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brull 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Concei_x00e7__x00e3_o-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Conceição 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Danelli-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Danelli 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Domingo_x002d_Triado-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Domingo-Triado 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macaire-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Macaire 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sauter-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sauter 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strub-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Strub 2011</LINK>). We did not combine data for <LINK REF="STD-Cataldo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cataldo 2012</LINK> in our analysis which had given time data by each blocked nerve. We also decided that those studies which included catheter placement should not be included in this analysis, due to the increased length of time involved in this procedure. We therefore excluded <LINK REF="STD-Dhir-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dhir 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Salem-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Salem 2012</LINK>.

<P>Our first meta-analysis was conducted using only 10 studies of ultrasound versus nerve stimulation (nine studies: <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Concei_x00e7__x00e3_o-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Conceição 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Geiser-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Geiser 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meierhofer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Meierhofer 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perlas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perlas 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taboada-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Taboada 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trabelsi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Trabelsi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Geffen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Van Geffen 2009</LINK>) and transarterial approach (one study: <LINK REF="STD-Sites-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sites 2006</LINK>) with a total of 690 participants.

<P>The analysis showed a statistically significant difference, with performance time being less in the ultrasound group (mean difference (MD), IV fixed-effect, -1.06 (95% CI -1.41 to -0.72), P value &lt; 0.00001). See <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>.</P>
<P>For performance time, seven studies with a total of 587 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dufour-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dufour 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gurkan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gurkan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morros-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Morros 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salem-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Salem 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shrestha-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Shrestha 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2003</LINK>) compared ultrasound guidance + nerve stimulation with nerve stimulation technique. There was a statistically significant difference between groups, with performance time being less in the nerve stimulation group (MD, IV, fixed-effect, 0.76 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.98)). See <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>.</P>
<P>There was a high level of heterogeneity for both these analyses (I² = 88% in <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK> and I² = 80% in <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).

See <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>.

<P>We performed subgroup analysis according to the type of nerve block and block approach. For 'Time to perform block' results remained statistically significant and with a high level of heterogeneity in the axillary and infraclavicular brachial plexus block, but for those studies which used the popliteal fossa sciatic block there was no difference in the time to perform the block between ultrasound and nerve stimulation use (MD, IV, fixed-effect -1.00 (95% CI -2.43 to 0.44), I² = 0%)<I>. </I>However there were only two studies using this block in this analysis (see <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). For those studies combining ultrasound with peripheral nerve stimulation, there were only single studies in the nerve block approaches other than for axillary plexus block, and for this there was no difference in the result and I² remained similarly high (see
 

<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the outcome 'Paraesthesia', subgroup analysis showed that for the infraclavicular brachial plexus block there were still significantly fewer events of paraesthesia with ultrasound use, although statistical heterogeneity remained high (I² = 87%). But for the axillary brachial plexus block there was no longer any statistical difference between block technique, with only moderate heterogeneity (I² = 40%). See

<P>Although experience of practitioners is an important consideration for this review, we did not perform subgroup analysis.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-08-18 11:31:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As we had changed the eligibility criteria in the 2014 update, resulting in the exclusion of several studies, we felt that the included studies were now more homogeneous and that it was appropriate to combine the results of our data with meta-analysis.</P>
<P>This review, based on 32 studies in 2844 adult participants, has found that ultrasound guidance produces superior peripheral nerve block success rates, with more blocks being assessed as complete or sufficient for surgery following sensory or motor testing, and fewer blocks requiring supplementation or conversion to general anaesthetic compared with the use of nerve stimulation, anatomical landmark techniques or transarterial approach. This result was similarly advantageous for studies that compared ultrasound, either alone or combined with nerve stimulation, against nerve stimulation. Results suggest that there are fewer incidences of paraesthesia and vascular puncture when using ultrasound approaches, and the review authors' interpretation of other results also suggests a reduction in complications such as nerve damage.</P>
<P>The evidence in this review, both using meta-analysis and interpretation of individual authors' results, also suggests that it takes less time to perform the block when using ultrasound techniques alone rather than nerve stimulation. As expected, it takes longer to perform the block when nerve stimulation is used as an additional technique combined with ultrasound than when nerve stimulation is used alone. The results for analysis of this outcome had moderate to high levels of heterogeneity.</P>
<P>The performance of peripheral nerve blocks is clearly dependent on experience and expertise of the practitioner and we were concerned about the influence of this bias on the results. Our subgroup analysis, removing studies which we had judged as being at high level of risk of bias for this outcome, remained consistent with the main analysis that ultrasound-guided techniques require less time to perform.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-08-18 11:31:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out a thorough search, both in the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2009</LINK>) and in the 2014 update, using appropriate electronic databases. We also included backward and forward citation tracking and details of studies posted on clinical trials registers. Where necessary, we made attempts to contact authors for additional study details. Despite narrowing our eligibility criteria for this update, we were still able to identify 32 relevant studies that met our eligibility criteria for participant and interventions.</P>
<P>Studies included a variety of nerve blocks for procedures of the upper and lower limbs, including different approaches to the brachial plexus block and the sciatic and popliteal fossa nerves. Whilst we did not restrict the comparison to a particular nerve block technique, the majority of included studies compared ultrasound against nerve stimulation, with only two studies comparing against anatomical landmark technique and one comparing against a transarterial approach. With so few studies comparing against anatomical landmark technique or transarterial approach, we are not able to reliably rate the applicability of these findings against these two comparisons.</P>
<P>Results of our review are applicable to peripheral nerve blocks of the upper and lower limbs for which peripheral nerve block is the intended sole anaesthetic, as we had excluded studies of other blocks.</P>

<P>The methodological quality of the trials was moderate, at best. Details of methods of randomization, allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessors were inconsistent across studies and it is unclear whether this was due to a failure by authors to report study details or to a lack of methodological rigour.</P>
<P>We accepted that it was not possible to blind the anaesthetist and this inevitably skewed our 'Risk of bias' assessment as all studies were at an increased risk of performance bias. Another important aspect of performance bias for this review was the likelihood of varying experience of the practitioners and their attitude towards ultrasound or alternative
 
techniques. It is possible that those 12 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bloc-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Bloc 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brull-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Brull 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Casati-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Casati 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Danelli-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Danelli 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kapral-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kapral 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meierhofer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Meierhofer 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morros-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Morros 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perlas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Perlas 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salem-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Salem 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sauter-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sauter 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soeding-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Soeding 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taboada-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Taboada 2009</LINK>) which described their practitioners as 'experienced' had used personnel who were ultrasound enthusiasts, with considerable experience in ultrasound. Equally, studies may have used personnel with considerably less experience in ultrasound. Unfortunately without this information we were unable to explore this further and do not know whether our results could be applicable to experienced ultrasound users only.</P>

<P>Our decision to restrict the eligibility criteria in the 2014 update meant that we excluded several of the original studies (<LINK REF="STD-Casati-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Casati 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Danelli-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Danelli 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dolan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Dolan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marhofer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Marhofer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marhofer-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Marhofer 1998</LINK>), as well as additional studies that would have been included in our latest search. Whilst this restriction could have introduced bias into the results, we felt that it reduced the heterogeneity between studies and allowed meta-analysis that previously had not been possible.</P>
<P>In the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2009</LINK>) the authors had made attempts to contact known authors in the research field, as well as conducting handsearches of journals. We did not replicate this level of searching in the 2014 update and, whilst our searches ultimately identified 32 included studies, we do not know whether we would have identified further eligible studies had we searched to this extent.</P>
<P>We reran the search in May 2015 and found seven studies of interest. We added them to the list of '<LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>' and will incorporate them into the next review update.</P>

<P>In the original review, we had concluded that there was limited evidence to support the routine use of ultrasound for peripheral nerve blocks. However, our evidence as a result of further included studies and meta-analyses in this update demonstrate the benefits in the use of ultrasound guidance over other techniques. This is consistent with other reviews in the field (<LINK REF="REF-Gelfand-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelfand 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2009b</LINK>) which support the use of ultrasound for peripheral nerve blocks with improved block success and fewer adverse events.</P>

<P>We have presented evidence in this review to support the routine use of ultrasound guidance techniques for upper and lower limb blocks. Our analysis demonstrates that ultrasound improves the quality of the sensory blockade, reduces the need for supplementation, with fewer minor complications reported and shorter performance time.</P>
<P>We were unable to confirm whether or not these findings reflect the use of ultrasound in experienced hands.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-08-18 11:30:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future research should specify the experience of practitioners and assess if ultrasound use improves the success of nerve blocks with less experienced personnel.</P>
<P>Our results are only applicable to nerve blocks of the upper and lower limbs. Further systematic reviews would be required to assess whether these findings are consistent with other nerve blocks.</P>

<P>Differences between review (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2009</LINK>) and current update.</P>
<P>New authors, Sharon R Lewis and Anastasia Price, contributed to the 2014 update whilst Kristine Aas-Eng decided not to contribute and was therefore removed from the author list.</P>
<P>In the 2014 update we excluded studies that had given general, spinal or epidural anaesthetic, or additional nerve blocks as part of standard care in addition to the peripheral nerve block under investigation. We also excluded studies that were designed to assess anaesthetic drug volume. As a result of these changes, we excluded some studies which had been included in the original review.</P>
<P>In the 2014 update we altered the review outcomes. The primary outcome of block success was divided into two outcomes to distinguish between the assessments used to define block success, i.e. predicted adequacy of the block with the use of motor or sensory testing, and the assessment of whether surgical anaesthesia had been achieved without the need for supplementary anaesthesia or conversion to general anaesthesia. We adapted the complications outcome to include <I>all</I> complications. We did not include studies that specifically assessed the volume of anaesthetic given during nerve blocks, as outcome data from these studies could not adequately measure our primary outcome. We took an a priori decision to only include limb blocks in the review.</P>
<P>In the 2014 update we expanded the Methods section to include headings: <LINK TAG="UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Unit of analysis issues</LINK>; <LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK>; <LINK TAG="HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of heterogeneity</LINK>; <LINK TAG="BIAS_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of reporting biases</LINK>; <LINK TAG="DATA_SYNTHESIS" TYPE="SECTION">Data synthesis</LINK>; <LINK TAG="SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</LINK>; and <LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>. We also included a 'Summary of findings' table and incorporated this into the results.</P>
