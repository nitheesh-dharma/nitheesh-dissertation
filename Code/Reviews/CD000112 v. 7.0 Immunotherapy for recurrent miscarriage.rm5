<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-10-03 11:22:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Immunotherapy does not lower the risk of future miscarriage in women who repeatedly miscarry.</P>
<P>
<B>Background<BR/>
</B>Recurrent miscarriage is three or more consecutive early miscarriages. One theory is that for some women, this might be caused by an immune system response to the embryo or fetus. Therapies that try to immunize the woman against the 'foreign' cells of a future pregnancy have been tried. Immunotherapies have included white blood cells (leukocytes) from the woman's partner or a donor, products derived from early embryos (trophoblast membranes), or antibodies derived from blood (immunoglobulin).</P>
<P>
<B>Review question<BR/>
</B>We sought to determine whether immunological treatments would improve the chance of live births in women with a history of recurrent miscarriage.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Study characteristics<BR/>
</B>We included 20 randomized controlled trials involving 1137 women, which took place from 1985 and 2004 in 11 countries. The trials examined four different forms of immunotherapy: immunization using white blood cells from the woman's partner (12 trials, 641 women), white blood cells from a third-party donor (three trials, 156 women), products derived from early embryos (one trial, 37 women), or antibodies derived from blood (intravenous immunoglobulin) (eight trials 303 women).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence and conclusions<BR/>
</B>Overall, we considered the risk of bias for the majority of included studies to be low.</P>
<P>The review of trials found that none of these treatments provided a significant beneficial effect over placebo in improving the live birth rate or lowered the risk of future miscarriage in women who have recurrent miscarriages.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2014-09-15 15:43:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Because immunological aberrations might be the cause of miscarriage in some women, several immunotherapies have been used to treat women with otherwise unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-09-15 15:42:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of any immunotherapy, including paternal leukocyte immunization and intravenous immunoglobulin on the live birth rate in women with previous unexplained recurrent miscarriages.</P>

<P>Randomized trials of immunotherapies used to treat women with three or more prior miscarriages and no more than one live birth after, in whom all recognized non-immunologic causes of recurrent miscarriage had been ruled out and no simultaneous treatment was given.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The review author and the two co-authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality for all studies considered for this review. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-15 15:42:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Twenty trials of high quality were included. The various forms of immunotherapy did not show significant differences between treatment and control groups in terms of subsequent live births: paternal cell immunization (12 trials, 641 women), Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.70; third-party donor cell immunization (three trials, 156 women), Peto OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.82; trophoblast membrane infusion (one trial, 37 women), Peto OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.45; or intravenous immunoglobulin, (eight trials, 303 women), Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.58.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-09-15 15:49:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-09-15 15:49:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Approximately one to two per cent of couples experience recurrent pregnancy loss during the first trimester (<LINK REF="REF-Coulam-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulam 1991</LINK>). Commonly defined as three or more consecutive miscarriages, recurrent miscarriage usually refers to those pregnancy losses occurring in the first trimester. This time limit is arbitrary and does not consider a variety of potential underlying causes of fetal death during the first half of pregnancy. Some couples who present for evaluation of recurrent miscarriage are found to have a disorder which is thought to be responsible for their pregnancy losses. However, the etiology of recurrent miscarriage remains elusive in the majority of women. It has been postulated that immunologic aberrations may be responsible for otherwise unexplained recurrent miscarriage.</P>
<P>The physiological mechanisms that allow a mother to tolerate her semi-allogeneic baby are unclear. Early reports proposed that human leukocyte (white blood cell) antigens compatibility of couples, the absence of maternal leukocytotoxic antibodies, or the absence of maternal blocking antibodies were related to recurrent miscarriage. Defects in molecular immunosuppressive factors (cytokines and growth factors) at the local decidual/trophoblast level have been implicated (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1992</LINK>). Elevated serum levels of systemic natural killer (NK) cells have also been found in women having miscarriages of karyotypically normal pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1995</LINK>), and the presence of increased levels of NK cells in non-pregnant women was associated with a higher probability of miscarriage in a subsequent pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Aoki-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aoki 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yamada-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamada 2003</LINK>). Most recently, experimental models of miscarriage have focused on the placental milieu showing that pregnancy survival depends on inhibition of local inflammatory mediators (<LINK REF="REF-Salmon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salmon 2004</LINK>). Complement-inhibitory proteins, maternal regulatory T-cells, tryptophan catabolizing enzymes, and immunoregulatory cytokines may play a role in immunotolerance at the maternal-fetal interface (<LINK REF="REF-Aluvihare-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aluvihare 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mellor-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mellor 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xu 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Not all studies favor an alloimmune cause of recurrent miscarriage. Several studies have found little correlation between pregnancy outcome and histocompatibility, the presence of antipaternal leukocytotoxic or blocking antibodies (<LINK REF="REF-Coulam-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulam 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1988</LINK>). Authorities point out that extrapolation from animal models may not be relevant in humans because of interspecies endocrine, immunologic, and reproductive differences, and the beneficial effect of pre-transplant blood transfusions to ameliorate rejection has been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1995</LINK>). The relationship of NK cell activity to pregnancy outcome has also been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Morikawa-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morikawa 2001a</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-09-15 15:43:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Several immunologic treatments have been advocated by some investigators, based on evidence that pre-transplant blood transfusions decreased rejection of organ allografts. The most popular attempts at maternal immunomodulation have employed transfusion of paternal leukocytes (white blood cells - lymphocytes) prior to conception or passive immunization with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) during pregnancy. Other interventions include third-party donor white cells or trophoblast membranes transfusions, although these have been largely abandoned because of doubts about efficacy.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-06-09 14:56:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The rationale for using IVIG to treat women with recurrent miscarriage is based on reports that it down regulates systemic NK cells (<LINK REF="REF-Kwak-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwak 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruiz--1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruiz 1996</LINK>) and abrogates NK cell activity at the implantation site (<LINK REF="REF-Aoki-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aoki 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morikawa-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morikawa 2001b</LINK>). Immunization with paternal white cells or third-party donor white cells has been postulated to prevent miscarriage in a similar manner as pre-transplant blood transfusions to improve kidney graft survival.</P>

<P>Overall risk of bias for the majority of included studies was judged to be low. Assessment of the methodological quality of the included studies was based on the following 'Risk of bias' domains: selection bias (method of randomization and allocation concealment), performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias (loss of participants from the analyses) and reporting bias. A summary of 'Risk of bias' assessments for each study, and for included trials overall, are set out in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>.<BR/>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-15 15:46:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>In this updated version of the review, we assessed a total of 15 studies (seven new studies identified from an updated search; and eight studies that were awaiting assessment at the time of the last review). Fourteen of these studies were excluded as they did not meet inclusion criteria for our review and one of these studies is awaiting translation into the English language to allow classification. In total, 20 randomized controlled trials of high quality were included involving a total of 1137 women. The results of this review indicate no improvement in live births with paternal cell immunization, third-party donor cell immunization, trophoblast membrane immunization, or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) immunotherapy regimens.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-09-15 15:50:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There is considerable variation in reported subsequent live birth among studies examining immunotherapy for recurrent miscarriage. This may be attributed to significant variation in the participants included, methodology, intervention, and treatment regimen. Given the considerable costs for immunotherapy and potential for serious side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coulam-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulam 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duhem-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duhem 1994</LINK>), it is important to establish the efficacy of immunotherapy for the treatment of recurrent miscarriage. While we performed individual analysis for paternal cell immunization, third-party donor cell immunization, trophoblast membrane immunization, and IVIG, our ability to reach conclusive findings is limited by heterogeneity in dose, duration, and timing of immunotherapy. Subgroup analysis by these variables was not feasible due to the small number of included trials and participants. However, our review was inclusive of published and unpublished data as well as English and non-English data. Furthermore, our review was restricted to randomized controlled trials of moderate to high quality, increasing the level of confidence in our conclusion that immunotherapy does not improve the live birth rate in women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage. Moreover, women should be spared the pain and grief associated with false expectations that an ineffective treatment might work. These therapies should no longer be offered as treatment for unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-09-15 15:46:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The overall quality of the trials included in this review was moderate to high since only randomized controlled trials were included and all but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Illeni-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Illeni 1994</LINK>) was double-blinded. The overall risk for bias of the included trials is low. None of the studies assessed were at high risk of bias for the majority of the domains. Only two trials were noted to be at high risk for bias in one or two areas. <LINK REF="STD-Ho-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 1991</LINK> was noted to be at high risk for attrition bias, with outcomes not reported in approximately 20% of the participants due to early reporting for reasons unstated. <LINK REF="STD-Illeni-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Illeni 1994</LINK> was found to be at high risk for performance and detection bias because the treatment and control groups were not blinded to investigators, patients, or physicians. There were also several trials that did not provide clear information on methodology. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Christiansen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Christiansen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ho-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mowbray-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mowbray 1985</LINK>) were reported as randomized trials, but did not provide sufficient information to permit evaluation of their random sequence generation. The risk of selection bias was unclear for three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mowbray-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mowbray 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pandey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pandey 2004</LINK>) because their methods for allocation concealment were not described. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 1991</LINK>), did not provide sufficient information to permit evaluation of performance and detection bias. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cauchi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Cauchi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gatenby-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gatenby 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mowbray-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Mowbray 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reznikoff-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Reznikoff 1994</LINK>) reported missing data, although the risk for attrition bias is likely low given the similarly small proportion of missing data in treatment and control groups.</P>
<P>The use of so-called intention-to-treat analysis has been suggested as the best method of comparing the effects of any treatment on a given disease process versus those of placebo, because it more closely resembles actual patient care in everyday clinical practice. The validity of intention-to-treat studies evaluating the effects of preconceptional treatment on pregnancy outcome has been questioned since women who do not achieve pregnancy cannot have a primary outcome. Most studies of immunotherapy for recurrent miscarriage given prior to conception excluded women from analysis if pregnancy was not achieved. However, two recent studies of paternal cell immunization (<LINK REF="STD-Ober-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ober 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pandey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pandey 2004</LINK>) included outcome data from all treated women, regardless of whether or not conception occurred. In the present review, it was also possible to combine the results of four trials of each type of immunotherapy using an intention-to-treat analysis. No significant benefit was found.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-05-30 15:38:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We took steps to minimize introduction of bias at every stage of the review process. We were able to identify all relevant trials, including unpublished studies and published abstracts from conference proceedings, and those from English and non-English publications alike. At least two review authors independently assessed each trial, performed data extraction, and assessed quality for each of the included trials. A member of the review team was an author on one of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Scott-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1994</LINK>) but was not involved in assessing the quality and risk of bias for this trial or carrying out data extraction of this trial. No new unpublished trials have been identified since the initial review. Previously identified unpublished trials have remained unpublished and our assessment of their methodology and potential biases are limited to the records of the initial communication between our authors and the authors of the unpublished trials.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-10-03 11:27:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Conclusions about the value of paternal cell immunization in recurrent miscarriage have been conflicting and highly dependent on the methods used for meta-analysis. The earliest meta-analysis, which included only published trials, reported no improvement in live birth rates among women with recurrent miscarriage (<LINK REF="REF-Fraser-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fraser 1993</LINK>). Using a different data set and adjusting for maternal age and the number of prior miscarriages, paternal cell immunization appeared to slightly increase the live birth rate over placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Scott-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1994</LINK>). Another meta-analysis performed simultaneously using similar methodology also demonstrated a small but significant benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coulam-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulam 1994</LINK>). This benefit disappeared when the largest published trial was included (<LINK REF="STD-Ober-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ober 1999</LINK>). Even so, the most recent randomized controlled trial of paternal cell immunization trials reported a significant increase in live births among treated women (<LINK REF="STD-Pandey-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pandey 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the current review, we were unable to identify a statistically significant improvement in live birth when paternal cell immunization was used to treat women with recurrent miscarriage. Our findings disagree from those of the most recent meta-analysis (for several reasons. Pandy et al. introduced bias by including control patients who received neither treatment nor placebo. They pooled study group pregnancy outcomes and control group (when available) outcomes in lieu of using the more statistically appropriate method of weighted averages in either a fixed-effect or random-effects model. The inclusion of non-randomized trials in a meta-analysis of randomized trials is likely to bias the results in favor of a significant difference.</P>
<P>Paternal cell immunization using viable mononuclear cells carries a risk for transmission of hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Reactions are uncommon but include soreness and redness at the injection site, fever, maternal platelet alloimmunization, blood group sensitization, and cutaneous graft-versus-host-like reaction (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coulam-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulam 1994</LINK>). Rare adverse pregnancy outcomes have also been reported, including placental abruption, placenta accreta, oligohydramnios, pre-eclampsia, fetal growth retardation, preterm delivery, renal anomalies, trisomy 21 and 13, and an unusual case of undefined immunodeficiency disease. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ober-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ober 1999</LINK>) indicated that women who have received lymphocyte immunotherapy may have a higher incidence of subsequent miscarriage than women who did not receive such cellular products. The Director of the Office of Therapeutics Research and Review, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), sent a letter on January 30, 2002 to physicians believed to be using lymphocyte immunotherapy to prevent miscarriages. He informed them that the injectable products used in lymphocyte immunotherapy do not have the required FDA approval and are considered investigational drugs that pose several safety concerns. Administration of such cells or cellular products in humans can only be performed in the United States as part of clinical investigations, and then only if there is an Investigational New Drug application (IND) in effect. All institutions, reproductive centers, and physicians were reminded that they should not administer allogeneic cells or cellular products to miscarriage patients until an IND has been submitted and reviewed by the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.</P>
<P>Intravenous immunoglobulin has become a popular treatment for unexplained recurrent miscarriage in some centers. One meta-analysis of four randomized trials reported a treatment effect of 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Daya-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daya 1998</LINK>). However, a more recent meta-analysis using both published data (MAL) and review of individual patient data (MAP) from six trials indicates that IVIG treatment has no clinically meaningful effect on the live birth rate (<LINK REF="REF-Daya-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daya 1999</LINK>). The authors of the latest randomized trial (<LINK REF="STD-Christiansen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Christiansen 2002</LINK>) suggested that IVIG may have a role in the treatment of women with secondary recurrent miscarriage. However, inclusion of their data with the six other trials shows no significant increase in the overall pregnancy success rate over placebo or no treatment. These data on the use of IVIG for recurrent miscarriage are important because of its expense, not to mention the serious and life-threatening reactions to IVIG, which have occasionally been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Duhem-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duhem 1994</LINK>).</P>

<P>Neither immunization with paternal leukocytes nor treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) improve the live birth rate in women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage. Both are expensive and have potential serious side effects. Moreover, women should be spared the pain and grief associated with false expectations that an ineffective treatment might work. These therapies should no longer be offered as treatment for unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss. Furthermore, immunological laboratory tests, which have been previously been advocated as justification for immunotherapies, have no predictive value for pregnancy success and should be abandoned.</P>

<P>Effective treatment of an alleged alloimmune cause of recurrent miscarriage awaits more complete knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology. A specific assay to diagnose immune-mediated early pregnancy loss and a reliable method to determine which women might benefit from manipulation of the maternal immune system are urgently needed. It is not presently known exactly how many recurrent early pregnancy losses are the result of anembryonic or chromosomally abnormal conceptuses, anatomic or structural abnormalities and how many are embryonic or fetal deaths. It is likely that some unexplained early losses are due to as yet undefined subchromosomal genetic abnormalities impairing early development of the conceptus (<LINK REF="REF-Copp-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Copp 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pegoraro-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pegoraro 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quenby-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quenby 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rossant-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossant 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spandidos-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spandidos 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tempfer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tempfer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsai-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsai 1998</LINK>). New molecular techniques should be directed at understanding the factors responsible for successful pregnancy as well as pregnancy loss.</P>
<P>To establish definitively or to rule out the efficacy of any proposed treatment for recurrent pregnancy loss, randomized controlled trials with adequate numbers of participants are needed. These should be studies approved by institutional review boards in centers with research expertise and interest in this problem. New therapeutic modalities should be tested only under protocol with rigorous study designs. Finally, further studies on complications of treatment and long-term follow-up of offspring are necessary. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States and other funding agencies should be encouraged to support proposals that offer new and innovative approaches to this problem. The Agency of Health Care Policy and Research in the United States and similar funding agencies in other countries need to support proposals to evaluate outcome of treatments especially for large trials.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>Please comment on whether the trials reported genetic abnormalities in the miscarried fetuses, and whether allowing for these abnormalities changes the conclusions about immunotherapy. Also, several relevant studies are not mentioned in the review, including some from Japan, and it would be good to know why.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Genetic abnormalities in miscarriage specimens were noted in some studies but not all. Miscarriage specimens with abnormalities were excluded. Only randomized controlled trials were included in this review. While some studies from Japan were identified initially, none were randomized controlled trials.</P>

<P>For <LINK REF="REF-Porter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porter 2006</LINK>, authors carried out the following additional searching:</P>
<P>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2004, Issue 3) and MEDLINE (1966 to September 2004) using the following terms: (immunoglobulin, intravenous (MeSH) OR leukocytes [immunology] (MeSH) OR immunotherapy (MeSH)) AND (fetal death (MeSH) OR abortion, spontaneous (MeSH) OR abortion, habitual (MeSH) OR fetal loss (two) OR miscarriage$ (tw) OR recurrent abortion$ (tw) OR recurrent miscarriage$ (tw)).</P>
<P>The term MeSH refers to medical subject headings and tw to text word in the title or abstract. The $ is a truncation character which allows all possible suffix variations of the root word. In the search of CENTRAL we replaced the $ with *.</P>
<P>In MEDLINE, the result of this search was combined with the phase one and phase two search strategy developed by Carol Lefebvre of the UK Cochrane Centre (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>We searched EMBASE (1980 to September 2004) using a sensitive strategy developed by the Cochrane Stroke Group (<LINK REF="REF-Stroke-Group-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stroke Group 2005</LINK>) combined with the following terms: (immunoglobulin [drug therapy] (sh) OR leukocyte (sh) OR immunotherapy (sh) OR immunization (sh)) AND (fetus death (sh) OR spontaneous abortion (sh) OR recurrent abortion (sh) OR fetal loss (tw) OR miscarriage$ (tw) OR recurrent abortion$ (tw) OR recurrent miscarriage (tw)).<BR/>
<BR/>sh refers to subject headings in the EMBASE thesaurus.</P>
