<P>Metal pins are sometimes used to apply traction or to attach other external fixation devices into broken arms or legs. These pins pierce through the skin. The way they are cared for may affect the frequency of infection. Different solutions are used for cleaning around pins, different dressings can be used, scabs may or may not be removed and massage might be used to drain fluids around them. Few clinical trials have investigated this area, and they were of poor quality. As a result, this review found no strong evidence that one pin care technique was better than any other for reducing the chance of infection and other complications.<BR/>

<P>Metal pins are used to apply skeletal traction or external fixation devices in the management of orthopaedic fractures. These percutaneous pins protrude through the skin, and the way in which they are treated after insertion may affect the incidence of pin site infection. This review set out to summarise the evidence of pin site care on infection rates.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-09-05 17:46:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In September 2013, for this third update, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-01-12 11:18:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Elizabeth Royle">

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-10-15 10:14:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of eleven trials (572 participants) were eligible for inclusion in the review but not all participants contributed data to each comparison. Three trials compared a cleansing regimen (saline, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide or antibacterial soap) with no cleansing (application of a dry dressing), three trials compared alternative sterile cleansing solutions (saline, alcohol, peroxide, povidone iodine), three trials compared methods of cleansing (one trial compared identical pin site care performed daily or weekly and the two others compared sterile with non sterile techniques)<I>
<B>,</B>
</I> one trial compared daily pin site care with no care and six trials compared different dressings (using different solutions/ointments and dry and impregnated gauze or sponges). One small blinded study of 38 patients found that the risk of pin site infection was significantly reduced with polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) gauze when compared to plain gauze (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.44) (infection rate of 1% in the PHMB group and 4.5% in the control group) but this study was at high risk of bias as the unit of analysis was observations rather than patients<I>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-06-08 11:17:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available trial evidence was not extensive, was very heterogeneous and generally of poor quality, so there was insufficient evidence to be able to identify a strategy of pin site care that minimises infection rates. Adequately-powered randomised trials are required to examine the effects of different pin care regimens, and co-interventions - such as antibiotic use - and other extraneous factors must be controlled in the study designs.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-04-15 23:25:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-04-15 23:13:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>External fixation is a process by which pins or wires are inserted into bone fragments through small incisions in the skin, and then held together with an external clamp or framework. This means of treating fractures was proposed by Malgaigne in 1853 (cited <LINK REF="REF-Sisk-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sisk 1983</LINK>) as an alternative to immobilisation in a plaster cast, traction or internal fixation.</P>
<P>Percutaneous orthopaedic pins are metal rods, or wires, used to apply either skeletal traction, or support an external fixator device in the management of orthopaedic fractures or surgical procedures. They penetrate the skin, adjacent muscle and soft tissue, then enter bone and may penetrate through to the other side of a limb. Skeletal traction using a Steinmann pin does not totally immobilise bone fragments, but allows a force to be applied to a limb, thus holding it in a suitable position and allowing fracture healing to occur.</P>
<P>The early advocates of external fixation experienced considerable problems. The skin entry points, known as pin sites, frequently became infected and reported infection rates range between 1% for major infections to 80% for minor infections (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1983</LINK>). Infection is undesirable as it can lead to failure of fixation with consequent loss of alignment of the fracture. It can also lead to osteomyelitis (inflammation of bone due to infection) and systemic infection, which may be both costly and difficult to treat. Therefore, external fixation was frequently criticised during the ensuing century (<LINK REF="REF-Sisk-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sisk 1983</LINK>), but its advantages, namely early mobilisation, axial loading of the fracture (along the normal line of load for the limb), easy observation of the limb, and access to the skin for wound care, have led to its continued use and development (<LINK REF="REF-Behrens-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behrens 1988</LINK>). External fixation is now an established treatment modality, and is extensively used to treat fractures either alone, or in combination with internal fixation (where screws and plates are used to hold bone fragments together beneath a surgical wound), traction or plaster cast (<LINK REF="REF-Blaiser-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blaiser 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is no uniformly accepted definition of pin site infection, which makes comparing infection rates difficult. Consensus opinion from experts on pin site management have attempted to differentiate between reaction, colonisation and infection (<LINK REF="REF-Lee_x002d_Smith-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee-Smith 2001</LINK>). Reaction was defined as the normal changes that occur at the pin site after pin insertion (i.e. changes in normal skin colour, skin warmth and drainage at the pin site); these are expected to subside after 72 hours. Colonisation was defined as warmth and red skin colour around the pin site, increased drainage, possible pain and the presence of microbes on culture. Infection includes all the changes seen with reaction and colonisation, together with possible pus, pin loosening and increased microbial growth. Two classification systems are used to grade the level of pin site infection (<LINK REF="REF-Checketts-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Checketts 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sims-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sims 1996</LINK>), but neither system has published validity, or reliability, results. In addition, pin site infections have been categorised as either major or minor (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1998</LINK>). Minor infections are considered to be benign, easily treatable with antibiotics and characterised by prolonged drainage, crusting, swelling and erythema (redness). Major infections require removal of one or more of the pins before the infection can be resolved (<LINK REF="REF-Lee_x002d_Smith-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee-Smith 2001</LINK>). The threat of infection remains a constraint to the use of external fixators.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-04-15 23:14:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has been proposed that effective insertion techniques and subsequent nursing care of pin sites will reduce the frequency of pin site infections, loosening of fixation, and osteomyelitis (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kroll-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroll 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sisk-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sisk 1983</LINK>). Many different regimens for pin site care have been described. These include regular cleansing with solutions such as hydrogen peroxide (<LINK REF="REF-Jones_x002d_Walton-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones-Walton 1991</LINK>), 0.9% normal saline or cooled boiled water (<LINK REF="REF-Sims-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sims 1996</LINK>). At the Kurgan Ilizarov Institute in Russia, a very specific dressing regimen of 70% alcohol and 0.2% chlorhexidine has been prescribed immediately postoperatively. In this regimen, pins are never left uncovered, and care is carried out by hospital personnel on a weekly basis (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1992</LINK>). There is no consensus, however, on the optimal frequency of pin site care, which ranges from daily (<LINK REF="REF-Tolo-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tolo 1983</LINK>), to weekly (<LINK REF="REF-Ahlborg-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahlborg 1999</LINK>), or even fortnightly (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1992</LINK>). Other uncertainties include whether or not scabs around the pin sites should be removed, and whether massage to promote drainage of exudate should be practised (<LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKenzie-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenzie 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sims-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sims 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Mahan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahan 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Wissing-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wissing 1988</LINK> have emphasised that a number of factors (including the surgical technique used to apply the fixator) might affect infection rates and might be more important than any local care. While experimental studies have shown the benefit in terms of either reduced pin loosening or pin site infection from silver-coated (Collinge 1994), tobramycin-impregnated (Voos 1999), or hydroxyapetite-coated pins (<LINK REF="REF-Moroni-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moroni 1998</LINK>), this aspect falls outside the scope of this review.</P>

<P>Titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy were assessed initially in terms of their relevance and design, according to the selection criteria, by the review author in charge of updating the review (AL). Copies of all relevant and potentially relevant papers were obtained, if they satisfied the inclusion criteria of this initial assessment. This process was repeated independently by the primary original author (JT), and selection results compared. Where there was disagreement over the selection of studies that could not be resolved by discussion, a third review author (JS) made the final decision. While papers published in languages other than English will be translated in sufficient detail to determine whether they are randomised trials, no non-English papers were identified for this update.</P>

<P>All assessments of the risk of bias and data extraction were performed independently by two review authors (AL and JT), using forms designed according to Cochrane guidelines. Two of the review authors (JT and JS) are experts on clinical issues. The other review author (AL) has statistical and methodological expertise. Where necessary, additional information on trial methodology or original trial data were sought from the principal or corresponding author of any trials that appeared to meet the eligibility criteria (see Acknowledgements for details of the authors who provided additional clarification of data beyond what was reported in the publications).</P>
<P>Included trials were assessed for risk of bias using the risk of bias tool developed by the Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The tool assesses:</P>

<LI>Sequence generation (whether the allocation sequence was adequately generated, for example using random number tables, computer random number generator, coin tossing, or shuffling).</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment (whether the allocation was adequately concealed, for example using central randomisation, or serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes).</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors (whether knowledge of the allocated intervention was adequately prevented during the study by reporting the method of blinding, or by reporting that the participants, personnel and/or outcome assessors were blinded or, if the study was unblinded, whether knowledge of the intervention was unlikely to cause bias).</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (whether incomplete outcome data were adequately addressed, for example whether the reasons for missing data that are unlikely to be related to the true outcome, or missing outcome data, were balanced in numbers across intervention groups).</LI>

<P>
<I>A priori</I>, it was decided that results from the included studies would be combined in meta-analyses only if there were similarities in the included studies. Clinical heterogeneity was explored by close examination of the characteristics of the participants, interventions, outcomes and duration of the included studies. It was intended that, if there was no evidence of clinical heterogeneity, studies would be pooled and the forest plots inspected for statistical heterogeneity by reference to the chi-squared test (with a cut off level of P value 0.10) and the I<SUP>2</SUP> quantity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The I<SUP>2</SUP> values are roughly categorised as follows: a value of 25% or less is an indication of low heterogeneity, 50% equates to moderate heterogeneity, and 75%, or more, to high heterogeneity. Where no clinical or statistical heterogeneity is found, it is intended that analysis will be by a fixed-effect model. Where there is evidence of heterogeneity and a meta-analysis is appropriate, it is intended to use a random-effects model for analysis of the data.</P>

<P>In the first published version of this review in 2004, we identified a total of 21 potentially relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) that considered any aspect of pin management. Eleven of these made reference to some aspects of pin site care, but only one trial met the criteria for inclusion and was included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Henry-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1996</LINK>). For the updates of this review prior to 2013, a further seven RCTs met the inclusion criteria for the review (<LINK REF="STD-Camilo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Camilo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cavusoglu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cavusoglu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Egol-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Egol 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grant-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-W_x002d_Dahl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">W-Dahl 2003</LINK>). During the 2013 update of the review, a further 64 potential studies were identified, of which 3 appeared to meet the inclusion criteria. After independent selection processes, two of these studies were included (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Camathias-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Camathias 2012</LINK>) and one study that was waiting assessment in previous versions of the review was also included (<LINK REF="STD-Yuenyongviwat-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yuenyongviwat 2011</LINK>).

<P>A total of eleven RCTs with 572 participants were included in the review, although not all the participants contributed to the assessment of all comparative outcomes. Full descriptions of each of the included studies are provided in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Although in some trials data were collected using randomised participants as the unit of analysis, seven trials conducted analyses of the severity of pin site infections and their frequency per pin or frequency per observation rather than per participant (as participants had multiple pin sites or observations), without making adjustments for within patient clustering (<LINK REF="STD-Cavusoglu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cavusoglu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grant-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henry-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-W_x002d_Dahl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">W-Dahl 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Camathias-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Camathias 2012</LINK>). The reported analyses from these trials must be viewed with caution because of unit of analysis errors. For these trials, no information was provided by the authors on the infection rate per participant.</P>
<P>There was significant heterogeneity in the types of participants (in particular, type and location of surgery and protocol for pin placement), types of regimens used for pin site care and outcomes (different methods for classifying infection). Meta-analysis was undertaken only for the comparison of cleansing regimens with no cleansing regimens (3 studies), sterile antiseptic cleansing with sterile non antiseptic cleansing (3 studies), and sterile cleansing with non sterile cleansing (2 studies). For all other comparisons, meta-analysis was not considered appropriate because of extreme heterogeneity. The findings from each trial are discussed below and summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were not undertaken, either because the data were not pooled, or all the studies were at high risk of bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Camathias 2012</HEADING>
<P>This double blinded RCT recruited 56 participants from a hospital in the Soloman Islands. Consecutive patients who were treated with a standard external fixator (ExFix) in the lower or upper extremity over 2 years were included. They remained inpatients for the duration of their treatment. Antibiotics were given intravenously as soon as possible and continued for a total of 48 hours in all cases. The ExFix constructs normally had 4 pins, 2 proximal and 2 distal and randomisation was applied to the pins according to location rather than the patients, resulting in the patients being their own control. The pins were randomised to daily care regimen (removal of crusts, sterile saline irrigation, drying with sterile swabs and sterile dressing pre-soaked in povidone-iodine with dry dressing wrap) or no pin site care. The outcomes included condition of the soft tissue interface, stability of the pins, torsional stability of the pins as determined with a torque metre during their removal, osteolysis on pre-removal radiographs and pin site pain. The authors noted that observed inflammatory changes may not necessarily represent an infection but they stated that microbiological swabs were not reliable in the diagnosis of pin site infection as they may represent normal skin colonisation.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Camilo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Camilo 2005</LINK> recruited 30 participants (average age 30.5 years) with Ilizarov external fixation apparatus from two hospitals in Brazil. The same team of surgeons inserted the apparatus in both settings. The entry point to the study was the first postoperative follow-up, although the researchers did not state how many days after surgery this was, or whether this was consistent across the sample groups. Patients with signs of active infection in the same limb as the external fixator at the entry point were excluded. Patients in both treatment arms of the study were instructed to apply the wound care protocol after a shower, after washing their hands with clean water and soap. In the control group, the skin around each pin site was cleaned with sterile gauze soaked in 0.9% saline solution to remove all 'dirt'. The sites were then dried with sterile gauze and each site was covered with folded gauze. The experimental group followed the same protocol except that, in addition to all other aspects, gauze soaked in polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine (PVPI) was applied to each site.</P>
<P>Observation of each of the pin sites for the presence, or absence, of signs and symptoms of infection took place at each outpatient visit. The presence of purulent exudate (pus) was the criterion adopted for defining the presence of infection. Any drainage fluid or purulent exudate was collected for culture according to a described protocol. Follow-up continued until the fixator was removed (mean of 273 days; range 95 to 276 days).</P>

All patients had tibial or fibula fractures with Ilizarov external fixation, and used sterile gauze with iodine solution for the first 15 days before continuing with the two separate protocols. No dressing was applied throughout the period. Pin sites were inspected and graded on a scale of 0 to 5 according to a modification of the system of Dahl, described by <LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2000</LINK>, during multiple follow-up periods from 5 to 150 days after surgery, until removal.

Participants (46 males and 16 females; children and adults) had undergone distraction osteogenesis (bone lengthening) with external fixators and follow-up was every two weeks for six months.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Egol-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Egol 2006</LINK> recruited 118 adults (mean age 54 years), with 120 distal radial fractures, from two hospitals in the USA, and allocated them to one of three treatment groups one week after surgery: (1) daily pin site care with a solution of 1/2 normal saline and 1/2 hydrogen peroxide, (2) weekly application of chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings (Biopatch) by the treating surgeon, or (3) weekly dry dressing changes without pin site care. One of the objectives of the study was to ascertain if the chlorhexidine-impregnated foam disc provided a significant reduction in pin site infection. Surgery and care after surgery was performed according to a specific protocol. All patients received three doses of first-generation cephalosporin antibiotics, one dose before and two after surgery. Patients undertook pin site care after discharge from hospital. The groups were equivalent at baseline in terms of age or mechanism of injury, but not equivalent in terms of gender. Patients returned to the clinic for weekly evaluation and X-rays were performed every two weeks. It is not clear how infection was identified, although all infections were treated with antibiotics, so antibiotic use can be used as a surrogate outcome for rate of infection. The external fixator was removed at six weeks after surgery (unless infection necessitated earlier removal), and patients were followed up for a minimum of six months. In addition to antibiotic use, patients were assessed weekly for cellulitis, erythema, drainage, pin loosening and whether pin removal was necessary before fracture healing due to infection.</P>

<P>Twenty patients (at least 18 years old), who required skeletal pins for acute injury, were recruited from a hospital in Australia for the small, randomised trial by <LINK REF="STD-Grant-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2005</LINK>. At 72 hours after surgery, participants were randomised to (1) cleansing with normal saline flush and application of soft white paraffin ointment, or (2) twice daily cleansing with normal saline and application of 10% povidone-iodine solution. Both groups underwent cleansing for 14 days, or until discharge, followed by daily care at home until either the pins were removed or infection occurred. The length of time the pins remained in situ ranged from four to 120 days. The number of pin sites per patient ranged from two to 17. Patients managed their own care, and follow-up occurred once a week after discharge from hospital. Prophylactic antibiotics were prescribed either during surgery or immediately after for 83% of patients. Clinical signs of infection (defined as redness, induration (skin hardening), haemo-serous ooze and pain), and requirement for antibiotic use were measured.</P>

Thirty women aged 11 to 18 years with 120 pin sites, who were undergoing leg-lengthening surgery, had daily pin site care according to a specified protocol. They were randomised to cleansing with either (1) 0.9% saline; (2) 70% alcohol; or (3) no cleansing. Crust removal, gentle massage, spraying with dry povidone iodine and dressing with dry gauze was undertaken at all sites. The majority of sites were in the femur or tibia. Infection was defined by pain, redness and swelling and the culturing of a significant number of pathogenic bacteria.

Rates of pin site infection were assessed blindly at multiple follow up times (2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks) according to the grading system suggested by <LINK REF="REF-Saw-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saw 2006</LINK>. The patients and their caretakers were taught how to perform pin site dressing according to a standard protocol used in the hospital. The dressings appeared identical and both patients and assessors were blinded. The study was designed to look at infection rates per observations rather than per number of pin sites or per patient. The researchers also compared infection rates between the two groups according to infection grades (1, 2 or 3) and between the two groups according to types of bone fixation (wire-skin and pin-skin interfaces).</P>

The control group had no cleansing, and a dry dressing which was only changed if it became wet or soiled. Participants were recruited from two centres in the USA. Two-thirds of participants were male, 31% were children or adolescents; the most common diagnosis was closed fracture with lower extremity involvement, and each participant had an average of six pins. Patients undertook pin site care after discharge from hospital.<BR/>Pin sites were evaluated for redness, swelling, discomfort, tenting, loosening of pins, crusting and drainage by a rating scale designed to evaluate pin site reaction.

<P>The randomised controlled trial by <LINK REF="STD-W_x002d_Dahl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">W-Dahl 2003</LINK> compared (1) daily cleansing of pins sites with 0.9% saline solution and a dry dressing and bandage, to (2) the same procedure conducted weekly. A sample of 50 adult patients (mean age 54 years), who had undergone elective surgery for gonarthrosis by the hemicallatasis technique and insertion of external fixation apparatus, were recruited from a hospital in Sweden. Participants had an average of four hydroxyapatite-coated pins each. The treatment regimen was carried out by the hospital-based staff and any one of several district nurses after discharge. In hospital, a technique with sterile dressings and sterile gloves was used, and at home or in outpatients the sterile gloves were replaced with clean gloves. Patients could shower, provided they protected the whole device in a plastic bag. Outcomes were evaluated weekly by district nurses. As well as bacterial cultures of each pin, a published assessment tool was used for the identification of pin site infection (<LINK REF="REF-Checketts-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Checketts 1999</LINK>), though the reliability and validity of this tool has not been clearly established. The criteria rate minor infections as grades I to lll and major infections as grades lV to VI, which are equivalent to Sims &amp; Saleh 1996 grades (<LINK REF="REF-Sims-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sims 1996</LINK>). The researchers also considered the pain levels experienced by the patients (using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)), antibiotic use, whether the pins were still tightly fixed (or could be removed by hand), and all pin tips were cultured on removal.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cleansing compared with no cleansing</HEADING>
<P>Three trials addressed the issue of whether cleansing solution of any type reduced pin site infection when compared with no cleansing (application of dry dressing without cleansing) (<LINK REF="STD-Egol-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Egol 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henry-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Henry-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1996</LINK> compared cleansing with either 0.9% saline (sodium chloride), or 70% alcohol, with a control group that had no cleansing procedure, but had daily pin site care with dry povidone-iodine spray, gentle massage and change of dressing. <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2005</LINK> compared cleansing with half-strength hydrogen peroxide, saline or antibacterial soap and water with a control group that had no cleansing procedure (dressing was changed only if it became wet or soiled). In <LINK REF="STD-Egol-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Egol 2006</LINK>, one of the experimental groups had daily cleansing with a solution of one-half normal saline solution and one-half hydrogen peroxide, and the control group had the weekly application of a dry dressing with no cleansing. The other experimental group in this study used a specific type of dressing which is not relevant to this comparison.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Henry-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1996</LINK> defined infection as pain, redness and swelling and a significant number of pathogenic bacteria on culture at the pin site with, or without, systemic symptoms. Infections occurred in 25% (10/40) and 18% (7/40) of those participants who had cleansing with either solution, and in 8% (3/40) of those in the control group who had no cleansing. There was no statistically significant difference in infection rates between cleansing or no-cleansing regimens. The infection rate was 35% higher in femoral than tibial pins, particularly in those situated near the groin, or on swollen thighs; this was reported incidentally and location of infection was not an objective of the study. All pins were massaged to remove crusts and none had to be surgically released because of tension. All pin sites were sprayed with povidone-iodine dry spray. Ninety-two per cent of the infections were due to <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> and all resolved with oral antibiotics. There were 120 pin sites in the 30 participants in this study, and these were in situ for 56 to 244 days. The infection rate did not relate to the length of time pins were in situ.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2005</LINK> assessed the effects of cleansing solution and type of dressing on pin site infections when compared with a control group with no cleansing. A ratings scale was piloted in this trial (from the Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri) which required scores on a number of different parameters: redness, swelling, discomfort, tenting, loosening of pins, crusting and drainage. The criteria for a stage II pin site infection were a rating score greater than three and requiring treatment with antibiotics. The criteria for a stage III infection were receiving a score greater than seven, treatment with IV antibiotics and/or removal of the pin. Data were collected over a follow-up time of six weeks to control for increasing infection rate associated with the length of time pins were in place. There was no significant difference in infection rates depending on treatment. Pin site infections - mostly stage II - developed in 27%, 30% and 45% of participants in the groups having cleansing and 36% of participants in the control group with no cleansing. Infection rate was also analysed per pin, but is not reported here because of unit of analysis errors with this method of analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Egol-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Egol 2006</LINK> evaluated pin site complications weekly (erythema, cellulitis, drainage, pin loosening, need for antibiotics and need for pin removal before fracture healing due to infection), and participants carried out their own care. Oral antibiotics were administered when participants developed erythema, cellulitis or pin-track infection (which is equivalent to the Sims and Saleh grade 2 categorisation) (<LINK REF="REF-Sims-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sims 1996</LINK>), and pins were removed when the infection did not respond to antibiotics (equivalent to Sims and Saleh grade 4 categorisation). There was no significant difference in the rate of pin site complications, antibiotic use or requirement for early removal between the group that had cleansing and the control group, however, a lack of statistical power cannot be ruled out as a contributory factor in this result. Of those having cleansing with saline/hydrogen peroxide, 22.5% required treatment with antibiotics compared with 2.5% of those that were not cleansed (RR 9.00; 95% CI 1.20 to 67.77) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>); 7.5% of the former group required early fixator removal compared with 0% in the control group. Fixators were left in place for an average of six weeks, and all participants were followed up at six months.</P>
<P>In spite of the high heterogeneity between studies (I<SUP>2</SUP> 68%), the data on infection rates were pooled in a meta-analysis (random-effects) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Evidence of infection was defined differently in the three studies and the cleansing regimens all differed. There was no statistically significant difference in the infection rates (RR 2.30; 95% CI 0.63 to 8.33). Results must be viewed with extreme caution as there is moderate to high heterogeneity in the analysis. When the individual results from the studies are inspected, one study reported significantly lower infection rates with the no-cleansing regimen (RR 9.00, 95% CI 1.20 to 67.77) (<LINK REF="STD-Egol-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Egol 2006</LINK>), but the confidence intervals are very wide. Sensitivity analysis was not undertaken as all trials had major methodological flaws, which would make the results of a sensitivity analysis meaningless.</P>
<P>In summary, there is insufficient evidence of an effect of pin site cleansing on pin site infection from three small studies at high risk of bias.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2005</LINK>). Cleansing with saline 0.9% was compared with cleansing with 70% alcohol in <LINK REF="STD-Henry-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1996</LINK>, cleansing with half-strength peroxide, saline, or soap and water were compared by <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2005</LINK>, and cleansing with a diluted povidone-iodine solution was compared with saline in <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2009</LINK>
</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Henry-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1996</LINK>, infections occurred in 25% of those participants whose pins were cleansed with 0.9% saline (10 participants), and 18% of those whose pins were cleansed with 70% alcohol (seven participants). <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2005</LINK> assessed the effects of cleansing solution, methods of cleansing (sterile versus non sterile)<B> </B>and type of dressing on infection rates. When the groups were combined according to the type of cleansing that was used, there was no evidence that infection rates differed (infection rate was 27% in participants having half-strength peroxide cleansing, and 30% in those having saline cleansing). Infection rates in <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2009</LINK> were almost identical in the iodine group and the saline group, at 19% and 17% respectively, and were 45% in those having soap and water cleansing. Studies were pooled in a meta-analysis comparing cleansing solutions with sterile antiseptic properties to those with sterile non-antiseptic properties.</P>
<P>The three trials that compared cleansing solutions had major methodological shortcomings, with small sample sizes, and there was no evidence of differences in infection rates in meta-analysis (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.39) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). Thus, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether one particular cleansing solution is more effective than any other.</P>

There was no statistically significant difference in minor infection rates (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.02; one study) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). When the two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cavusoglu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cavusoglu 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2005</LINK>) were pooled for the outcome of major infection rates (I<SUP>2</SUP> 0%, fixed effect) there was no statistically significant difference (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.49 to 1.30; two studies) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study compared the effects of daily cleansing with weekly cleansing with 0.9% sodium chloride solution using a sterile technique in 50 patients having surgery for gonarthrosis by the hemicallotasis technique (<LINK REF="STD-W_x002d_Dahl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">W-Dahl 2003</LINK>). There was no evidence of a difference in the frequency and severity of pin site infections (data were reported per pin, rather than per randomised participant), pain (mean VAS score 1.5 (SD 0.5) for daily care compared with mean VAS score 1.6 (SD 0.4) for weekly care) or the use of antibiotics (mean days 41 (SD 30) for daily care versus mean days 53 (SD 22) for weekly care) or analgesics. Unit of analysis errors resulting from the analysis of infection rates by pin sites limits the confidence that we can have in the results from this study.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dressing compared with no dressing</HEADING>
<P>One study compared daily pin site care with no pin site care (<LINK REF="STD-Camathias-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Camathias 2012</LINK>). The pin site care regimen included removal of crusts, sterile saline irrigation, drying with sterile swabs, sterile dressing pre-soaked in povidone-iodine and dry dressing wrap. Most participants had 4 pins, 2 proximal and 2 distal and these groups of pins, proximal and distal, were randomised rather than the participants. The outcome of interest in this RCT was the condition of the soft tissue interface, categorised as either dry, or with secretions or granulation. The authors considered that dry pin sites were considered a success of treatment and secretions and granulation were considered a failure of treatment. They reported that inflammatory changes (secretions or formation of granulation tissue) did not necessarily represent an infection as studies had shown that microbiological swabs were not reliable in the diagnosis of pin tract infection, often representing normal skin colonisation. In pin sites not receiving treatment, 35% were considered not dry and in pin sites with daily care 36% were not dry (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.48) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). Analyses taking into account possible confounding factors such as age, sex, duration of fixation, location of pins and presence of infection in the primary wound did not find evidence of a significant difference in the paired pin sites according to treatments.There was also no evidence of a difference in pin site pain. No cases of osteomyelitis were identified in 2 years follow up. The authors concluded that routine pin site care is unnecessary in external fixation treatment of injuries.</P>

The authors reported that a greater proportion of pin sites in the soft white paraffin ointment group (34.1%) developed clinical signs of infection when compared with the povidone-iodine group (18.1%), but this difference did not reach the prespecified level of significance (P value less than 0.05) (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.28 to 1.01) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>).

There was no significant difference in the rates of rehospitalisation due to infection (26.7% in the PVPI group and 6.7% in the dry gauze group), however, the study was underpowered. When groups were combined in the <LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2005</LINK> trial, those with gauze/sponge dressings had an infection rate of 38.5%, those with Xeroform had an infection rate of 31%, and those in the control group in which the gauze/sponge remained in situ had an infection rate of 36.5%. There was no evidence of a difference between groups (RR 0.8; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.47)(<LINK REF="CMP-005.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.4</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2012</LINK> study analysed the infection rate risk according to number of observations and these data could not be displayed in a forest plot because of unit of analysis errors.

<P>The studies included in this review were not able to determine an optimal strategy for pin site care.</P>
<P>It is not surprising that few differences were reported between pin site care regimens in the included studies, as few studies ensured that the sample size was adequately powered to find differences. Although the combination of dressings and cleansing agents was not a defined objective of this review, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Patterson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Patterson 2005</LINK>) found that patients having cleansing with hydrogen peroxide followed by the application of Xeroform dressing had a lower rate of infection (9%) than the other combinations of cleansing and dressing and the control group with no cleansing; however, no adjustments were made for multiple comparisons, controlling for age (which was found to significantly influence infection rate) and we cannot exclude the possibility that this is a chance finding. Another blinded study (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2012</LINK>) found that the risk of pin site infection was significantly reduced with polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) gauze when compared to plain gauze (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.44) (infection rate of 1% in the PHMB group and 4.5% in the control group). It is necessary that these findings be confirmed by further research before any recommendations can be made.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-08-09 12:13:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, study quality was poor. Although randomised, most studies were small and underpowered with methodological flaws, and only two were blinded. In most studies, minimal efforts were made to control for other factors that might have influenced the results, such as patient compliance with pin care protocols after discharge from hospital, antibiotic use, length of time pins were in place, location of pins, pin insertion procedures, types of hardware used, heterogeneity (variation) in the age of participants and condition being treated by external fixators. Some of the studies included in this review indicated that age of the participants and location of the pins were independently associated with the likelihood of infection. One blinded study of reasonable quality attempted to control for pin site location, age, sex, and duration of fixation, but did not directly measure infection rates. Other factors that may affect these rates are: active correction phase, pins compared with wires, fixator type, pin stability and type of pin coating. Moreover, the primary outcome, pin site infection, was not consistently defined in the included studies, and was often reported using pin sites or observations as the denominators without adjustment for unit of analysis errors.</P>

<P>The findings of this review are broadly in agreement with a systematic review of the literature resulting in a National Association of Orthopaedic Nurses Guidelines in pin-site care (<LINK REF="REF-Holmes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 2005</LINK>). This group assessed the evidence, and made four recommendations. Firstly, it was suggested that pins located in areas with considerable soft tissue should be considered at greater risk of infection. In this review, <LINK REF="STD-Henry-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1996</LINK> reported higher rates of infection in femoral pins compared to tibial pins, and proximal femoral when compared with lower and middle pins. A recommendation was also made that after the first 48 to 72 hours, pin site care should be done daily, or weekly for sites with mechanically-stable bone-pin interfaces. <LINK REF="STD-W_x002d_Dahl-2003" TYPE="STUDY">W-Dahl 2003</LINK> reported no differences between daily or weekly pin site care. Thirdly, it was suggested that chlorhexidine 2 mg/ml solution may be the most effective cleansing solution for pin site care. This finding was based on the results of a non-randomised observational study (<LINK REF="STD-W_x002d_Dahl-2004" TYPE="STUDY">W-Dahl 2004</LINK>). One study in this review found no differences in the rates of infection with chlorhexidine dressings when compared with the use of hydrogen peroxide care. This review has not been able to determine whether one particular cleansing agent is more effective at reducing infection than any another. Finally, the Guidelines recommend that patients and their families should be taught pin site care before discharge from the hospital. Since most patients with external bone fixators and pins are discharged from hospital before healing at the pin sites has occurred, compliance with a prescribed pin site regimen is an important factor that is likely to influence the rate of pin site complications and infections. Most of the studies included in this review explicitly described instructions for pin site care at home after discharge from hospital (using clean rather than sterile procedures), but there were no attempts to measure patient compliance with these instructions.</P>
<P>Another review (<LINK REF="STD-Lagerquist-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lagerquist 2012</LINK>) was also unable to reach definitive solutions on pin site care. This review included both randomised and non randomised studies. It also recommended that patients and their families should be taught pin site care, including signs and symptoms of infection, and noted that further research was required to reach more evidence based recommendations for care.</P>
<P>In conclusion, this review has not found sufficient evidence to recommend a particular strategy of pin site care. Adequately-powered, randomised trials are required to examine the effects of different pin care regimens and their co-interventions such as antibiotic use; furthermore, other extraneous factors must be controlled in the study designs. Any new trials should be reported in line with CONSORT guidance, and data regarding baseline distribution of prognostic factors, such as pre-drilling holes for pins, incising the pin sites prior to pin insertion and use of antimicrobial coating on pins should be clearly displayed, and adjustments made for imbalances (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>). If multiple pin sites are located on each randomised participant or multiple observations are made at different follow up times, adjustments should be made to prevent unit of analysis errors.</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence of adequate quality to inform a strategy for the best management of pin sites. In the absence of good evidence, the implementation of general strategies for minimising the risk of cross infection are advised.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-06-08 11:17:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adequately-powered, well designed randomised controlled trials are required to determine optimal pin site management. Studies should focus on using a consistent method for identification of infection rates and randomisation should be per participant, rather than by pin site to avoid unit of analysis errors. Subgroup analyses should be used to control for participant age and location of pin sites, to avoid confounding.<BR/>

<P>The search strategies for Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL can be found in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK> respectively. The Ovid MEDLINE search was combined with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximizing version (2008 revision); Ovid format. The EMBASE and CINAHL searches were combined with the trial filters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. There was no restriction by language or publication status. For the second update of the review, the electronic searches retrieved 31 records in total.</P>
