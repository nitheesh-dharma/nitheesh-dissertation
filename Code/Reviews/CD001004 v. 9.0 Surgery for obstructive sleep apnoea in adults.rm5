<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-01-14 15:45:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>Surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome aims to relieve obstruction by increasing the<I> </I>size of the airway in the throat, bypassing the airway or removing a lesion. A limited number of trials assessing diverse surgical techniques were identified. There were inconsistent effects reported across the trials. The available evidence from these small studies does not currently support the widespread use of surgery in people with mild to moderate daytime sleepiness associated with sleep apnoea.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2013-01-14 15:47:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome(OSAHS) is the periodic reduction or cessation of airflow during sleep. The syndrome is associated with loud snoring, disrupted sleep and observed apnoeas. Surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome aims to alleviate symptoms of daytime sleepiness, improve quality of life, and reduce the signs of sleep apnoea recorded by polysomnography.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of any type of surgery for the treatment of the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome in adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-09-01 13:15:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of articles. We contacted experts in the field, research dissemination bodies and other Cochrane Review Groups. Searches were current as of July 2008.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-01-14 15:42:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>Two reviewers assessed electronic literature search results for possibly relevant studies. Characteristics and data from studies meeting the inclusion criteria were extracted and entered into RevMan 5.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-14 15:47:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Twelve studies (709 participants) of mixed risk of bias met the inclusion criteria. Data from ten studies were eligible for assessment in the review. The participants recruited to the studies had mixed levels of AHI, but tended to suffer from moderate daytime sleepiness where this was measured. No data could be pooled. <U>Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) versus conservative management (one trial)</U>: An un-validated symptom score showed intermittent significant differences over a 12-month follow-up period. No differences in Polysomnography (PSG) outcomes were reported. <U>Laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP) versus conservative management/placebo (two trials)</U>: One study recruited a mixed population and separate data could not be obtained for this trial. In the other study no significant differences in Epworth scores or quality of life reported. A significant difference in favour of LAUP was reported in terms of apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) and frequency and intensity of snoring. <U>Palatal implants versus placebo (one trial): </U>Symptoms and AHI were lower with palatal implants. <U>LAUP versus bipolar radiofrequency volumetric tissue reduction (one trial)</U>: Within-treatment group differences were significant for symptoms and AHI, but the between treatment group differences were not available to assess whether indirect inferences could be made regarding the effects of either treatment. <U>UPPP versus oral appliance (OA) (one trial)</U>: AHI was significantly lower with OA therapy than with UPPP. No significant differences were observed in quality of life. <U>UPPP versus lateral pharyngoplasty (lateral PP) (one trial)</U>: No significant difference in Epworth scores, but a greater reduction in AHI with lateral PP was reported. <U>Expansion sphincter pharyngoplasty (one trial):</U> Both interventions reduced AHI although statistical analysis on the difference between treatments was not reported. <U>Tongue advancement (mandibular osteotomy) + PPP versus tongue suspension + PPP (one trial)</U>: There was a significant reduction in symptoms in both groups, but no significant difference between the two surgery types. Complications reported with all surgical techniques included nasal regurgitation, pain and bleeding. These did not persist in the long term. An additional study assessed the effects of four different techniques. No data were available on between group comparisons.<U> Multilevel temperature-controlled radiofrequency tissue ablation (TCRFTA) versus sham placebo and CPAP (one trial):</U> There was an improvement in primary and secondary outcomes of TCRFTA over sham placebo and but no difference in symptomatic improvement when compared with CPAP. <U>Radiofrequency assisted uvulopalatoplasty technique versus channeling technique (one trial):</U> Dysphagia scores were lower in the channeling group immediately post-operation, but at four months the difference was no longer significant. Snoring scores did not differ at long-term follow-up. The number of participants achieving AHI lower than 10 at four months was slightly higher with RAUP than channeling technique.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-01-14 15:43:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby  J Lasserson">
<P>There are now a small number of trials assessing different surgical techniques with inactive and active control treatments. The studies assembled in the review have failed to demonstrate consistent effects in favour of surgery and do not provide convincing evidence to support its use in sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome. Short-term outcomes are unlikely to consistently identify suitable candidates for surgery. Long-term follow-up of patients who undergo surgical correction of upper airway obstruction is required. This would help to determine whether surgery is a curative intervention, or whether there is a tendency for the signs and symptoms of sleep apnoea to re-assert themselves, prompting patients to seek further treatment for sleep apnoea.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-19 10:48:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-01 13:16:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) is the periodic reduction (hypopnoea) or cessation (apnoea) of airflow during sleep that results from pharyngeal narrowing or collapse. The syndrome is associated with loud snoring, disrupted sleep and observed apnoeas. The condition is often brought to the attention of the health care professionals through the concern of bed partners or parents, who may witness apnoeic episodes followed by choking and periods of loud snoring. This may have led to disharmony in the relationship.</P>
<P>While the epidemiology of OSAHS is not completely clear, it is thought to be a relatively common problem, affecting 2-4% of males and 1-2% of females in middle age (approximately 30 to 69 years) (<LINK REF="REF-Jennum-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jennum 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stradling-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stradling 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Young-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1993</LINK>). Risk factors may include obesity, male gender, retrognathia, hypothyroidism, nasal obstruction and evening alcohol ingestion (ASDA 1996). In children, the epidemiology of OSAHS is poorly described with few estimates of prevalence (<LINK REF="STD-Boudewyns-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Boudewyns 1995</LINK>). However the most common cause of paediatric OSAHS is adeno tonsillar hyperplasia (<LINK REF="STD-Potsic-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Potsic 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>The main symptoms of OSAHS are loud snoring, daytime sleepiness (<LINK REF="REF-Guilleminault-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guilleminault 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamadera-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yamadera 1995</LINK>), and the associated cognitive impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 1995</LINK>). There is also some evidence that OSAHS may be associated with road traffic accidents (<LINK REF="REF-Findley-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Findley 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCP-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCP 1993</LINK>). Therefore in some countries, including the UK, heavy goods and public transport vehicle drivers may have their licenses withdrawn if they have untreated OSAHS (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Conservative treatments include weight loss, modification of the patient's sleep position, medications to relieve nasal obstruction and avoidance of evening alcohol and hypnotics (ASDA 1996), although the evidence for these is unclear. The most commonly used and recommended treatment modality is Continuous Positive Airways Pressure (CPAP) during sleep (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2003</LINK>). Oral appliances are also used (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surgical treatments for OSAHS aim to relieve the obstruction by increasing the surface area of the airway, to bypass the pharyngeal airway, or to remove a specific pathological lesion. The principal interventions are briefly described by the ASDA 1996 and can be considered as:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Tracheostomy (which bypasses the pharyngeal airway)</LI>
<LI>Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) which increases the area of the retro palatal airway by resection of the free edge of the uvula and soft palate<I>,</I> and may be combined with tonsillectomy- a modification is laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP)</LI>
<LI>Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy - accepted treatment of OSAHS in children</LI>
<LI>Inferior sagittal mandibular osteotomy and genioglossal advancement with hyoid myotomy and suspension (GAHM) aim to create an enlarged retrolingual airway</LI>
<LI>Laser midline glossectomy and lingualplasty also create an enlarged retrolingual airway</LI>
<LI>Maxillo-mandibular osteotomy and advancement enlarges both retrolingual and retropalatal airway</LI>
<LI>Epiglottoplasty for selected cases of laryngomalacia</LI>
<LI>Removal of local specific obstructing pathological lesions</LI>
</OL>
<P>The place of surgery in the treatment of OSAHS and the relative effectiveness of different interventions is controversial. Most studies recommending a particular surgery are based on evidence from case series. Previous reviews of the surgical therapy for OSAHS are generally narrative, summarising the evidence provided by case series and uncontrolled observational studies (<LINK REF="STD-Banerjee-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Banerjee 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hochban-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hochban 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodenstein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rodenstein 1992</LINK>). There is one systematic literature search with a meta-analysis of results, but this was restricted to articles published in English and found on MEDLINE, the search criteria were not clearly stated and it was based on evidence from non-randomised studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sher-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sher 1996</LINK>). A systematic review of randomised controlled trials would summarise the best evidence of the value of surgery in the treatment of OSAHS.</P>

<P>Where reported, the methods of randomisation indicated that the studies were conducted appropriately. Blinding was not possible for some of the comparisons undertaken (e.g. surgery versus conservative management or oral appliance therapy). Three studies undertook a single-blind comparison with a sham surgical procedure that was conducted with a local anaesthetic (<LINK REF="STD-Bassiouny-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bassiouny 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larrosa-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Larrosa 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Woodson 2003</LINK>). Incomplete data were analysed in all the studies, which may affect the reliability of some of the findings. The lack of information either in trial reports or following requests, means that we remain uncertain as to how study design protects the findings from bias (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). </P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-02 15:47:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The initial version of this systematic review did not identify any randomised trials to support surgical interventions in the treatment of sleep apnoea. This updated version incorporates findings from 12 randomised trials of mixed quality, recruiting 709 participants with predominantly mild to moderate symptoms of sleep apnoea. Each study undertook different comparisons, precluding summary estimates of data. Individually, the findings from the studies included in the review do not support the widespread use of surgical intervention as a means of improving sleep quality over other therapeutic options currently available. The response to therapy could vary depending on the nature of airway obstruction in individual patients.</P>
<P>The concept of control in sleep apnoea trials has been contentious (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1997</LINK>). This is due to the predominantly physical nature of treatments used in management of OSAHS, including surgery. However, there has been a recent trend to conduct single blind trials in surgical trials controlled with a sham procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Larrosa-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Larrosa 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tommi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tommi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Woodson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Friedman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 2008</LINK>). A sham procedure is vital in establishing an estimate of efficacy whereby the effects of an active surgical intervention can be controlled. Adequate control with active therapies such as conservative management, drug treatment, CPAP or oral appliances relies on the continued acceptance of these interventions. The advantage of a sham surgical procedure is its control for the one-off or short-term nature of surgery. Given the implications of leaving significant populations who suffer from debilitating daytime sleepiness associated with sleep apnoea untreated in long-term studies, the most likely studies to be conducted in severely symptomatic patients will have an active form of control. Such studies would provide useful information on the relative effectiveness of surgery.</P>
<P>The severity of sleep apnoea is conventionally measured by polysomnography, incorporating measurements of the frequency of AHI. It is widely acknowledged that the disease is defined in terms of both physiological markers such as AHI, and subjective markers such as symptoms and heath-related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2003</LINK>). Although the correlation between changes in AHI and symptoms remains weak (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2005</LINK>), reducing AHI and reducing the burden of sleep apnoea in terms of symptoms and quality of life are primary goals of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>When compared with sham or usual care, surgery did improve some important outcomes, but this effect was not consistent. For example, there was an effect in favour of TCRFTA over a sham procedure in Epworth symptom scores and SAQLI questionnaire (<LINK REF="STD-Woodson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Woodson 2003</LINK>), but LAUP did not reduce these scores compared with conservative management (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2003</LINK>). Conversely, AHI reduction favoured LAUP in <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2003</LINK>, but was not significantly different between TCRFTA and placebo in <LINK REF="STD-Woodson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Woodson 2003</LINK>. The control regimens differed in these trials, although it could be that in <LINK REF="STD-Woodson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Woodson 2003</LINK>, blinding was not adequately concealed, with a limit on the number of treatment sessions, and the absence of localised stimulation at the treatment sites.</P>
<P>The symptoms of those participating in the trials were mild to moderate. It is not unreasonable to suppose that participants exhibiting greater signs of daytime somnolence at baseline stand to perceive greater benefit from treatment. With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Woodson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Woodson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Friedman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Friedman 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lojander-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lojander 1996</LINK>, there was a lack of an impact on symptoms. This may be at least partly explained by the moderate baseline symptoms of the populations studied. Patients with severe OSAHS have been excluded from three of the studies assembled (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tegelberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tegelberg 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Woodson 2003</LINK>). Trials in more overtly symptomatic participants might assist in determining the strength of evidence in favour of surgery in patients who have otherwise been shown to benefit from CPAP therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Giles-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giles 2006</LINK>), but who may not persist with treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Haniffa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haniffa 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Cahali-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cahali 2004</LINK> recruited participants with relatively high AHI, although these participants had moderate baseline symptoms. Within-group comparisons of change in symptom scores in actively treated participants were statistically significant. However, the absence of adequate control means that they provide evidence on the issue of relative efficacy.</P>
<P>Screening failures were reported in one study, and this indicated a very highly selected sample of participants with just under a fifth of those screened meeting the eligibility criteria of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Woodson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Woodson 2003</LINK>). This could undermine the generalisability of the study findings of this trial, but may equally be a reflection of the necessary rigour required when selecting patients who are most likely benefit from removal of tissue or mandibular manipulation. <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2003</LINK> failed to show a symptomatic improvement in unselected participants given LAUP over conservative management. End of treatment values for AHI suggested that surgery may not have been sufficiently effective in improving sleep quality, so that feelings of residual daytime sleepiness were not altered.</P>
<P>Unlike other forms of management of OSAHS which involve adherence with a device or drug regimen, surgery offers a 'one off' or 'short course' treatment which could alleviate signs and symptoms of OSAHS, forestalling future requirement for therapy and attendant difficulties with their poor acceptance (<LINK REF="REF-Haniffa-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haniffa 2004</LINK>). There is a paucity of data on the long term follow-up of surgically treated participants, which would otherwise help to establish whether those who opt for surgery require further intervention, and what the complication rate is. There is a need to ensure that patients are not merely 'symptom free', but that they are not at risk from long term cardiovascular disease and events where OSAHS is under-treated (<LINK REF="REF-Mooe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mooe 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data from long-term (greater than 12 month) follow-up in this review are drawn from <LINK REF="STD-Tegelberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tegelberg 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lojander-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lojander 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Atef-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Atef 2005</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Tegelberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tegelberg 1999</LINK>, the mean difference in favour oral appliance therapy in AHI after one year increased at four years. This could be a reflection of the continued acceptance of the device in the more censored population participating in the study at four years in the OA group, where a higher withdrawal rate occurred. The 'contentment' domain of a quality of life questionnaire used in this study favoured surgery. Whilst improvement in symptoms were reported by <LINK REF="STD-Lojander-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lojander 1996</LINK>, this was on an un validated scale. The data from the <LINK REF="STD-Atef-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Atef 2005</LINK> study are limited by the lack of between treatment group assessment, and the unclear numbers of participants completing follow-up.</P>
<P>A large retrospective cohort study has identified a significant effect of surgery over CPAP on &gt;1 year mortality in 20,826 ex-servicemen with OSAHS treated with either of these options in North America (<LINK REF="REF-Weaver-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weaver 2004</LINK>). It should be noted that imbalances between the groups existed in terms of sample size, age and co-morbidity, which could bias the findings against CPAP. The absence of data on acceptance and continued usage of CPAP therapy, along with an absence of polysomnographic, symptom, adverse events and quality of life data for patients undergoing both treatment options, mean that the study does not provide definitive evidence on long-term effects of either of these interventions.</P>
<P>Concerns regarding the interference of surgery on CPAP effectiveness have been raised (<LINK REF="REF-Mortimore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mortimore 1996</LINK>). In non-randomised evidence to date, this appeared to increase requisite therapeutic pressure levels in 29% patients continuing with CPAP after UPPP surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Masdon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Masdon 2004</LINK>). Studies which assess CPAP, oral appliance and drug therapy tend to exclude patients who have undergone prior surgical treatment, presumably on the assumption that they will not stand to benefit from 'additional' treatment to the same degree as those who are naive to treatment. However, it is imperative that studies should remain relevant to both those who present for the first time, and those who present because other forms of treatment have failed. Future research is needed to determine the extent that CPAP effectiveness is compromised in patients who have undergone removal of palatal tissue.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-09-02 15:48:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The available evidence does not currently support the widespread use of surgical interventions in the management of unselected patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. Given the proven efficacy of CPAP in patients with moderate and severe symptoms and significant sleep disordered breathing, surgery cannot be recommended as a front line therapy, ahead of positive airways pressure in these patients. Long-term follow up comparing surgery with oral appliances suggests that the initial effect of surgery on airway obstruction lessened over time. This observation requires confirmation. The appeal of an apparently curative intervention for sleep apnoea should be balanced against the uncertainty surrounding its safety, continued effectiveness and inconsistent impact on subjective and objective markers of disease in patients with OSAHS.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Surgical treatment has not been shown to be consistently effective compared with different forms of active and inactive control. However, although surgery may not be appropriate in all patients with OSAHS, there may be subgroups of patients who could benefit from this type of therapy, and surgical trials should continue to report the nature of airway obstruction in their participants, and how this relates to symptomatic response. Randomised controlled trials are required to help establish whether there are differences between surgical techniques in terms of ESS and other important markers of OSAHS. Long-term comparison with the current first line of care for sleep apnoea (CPAP) would help to confirm whether CPAP is superior in terms of symptoms and ongoing management in the light of the possible moderation of surgical success over time, and its uncertain long-term safety profile. Additional randomised studies are required to assess the impact of UPPP on CPAP effectiveness/adherence. Cardiovascular outcomes such as blood pressure should also be included in future studies. The advent of more tolerable forms of positive airway pressure delivered via automatic titration should also be compared with surgical procedures. Long term follow up of patients (possibly from prospective cohorts) would help to elucidate the continued interface between patients and sleep services, as the frequency of requirement for additional treatment is hard to establish from the randomised evidence to date. Further research should be undertaken to identify and standardise techniques to identify the site of airway obstruction. Localisation of the site of airway obstruction may allow more specific selection of surgical procedures.</P>

</TD>
<TD>
<P>A total of 594 articles were identified through electronic searching, 44 through correspondence and a further 28 through hand-searching reference lists. Of these, 656 articles were excluded because of the following non-inclusive reasons: did not focus on sleep apnoea (n=134); did not look at surgical interventions (n=328); obviously not an RCT (overviews, letters, case series etc.) (n=194). Ten articles, for which full text reports were obtained, were assessed for inclusion by both reviewers. All of these articles were excluded, five because they were descriptions of a surgical procedure, reviews or letters, four because they were not intervention studies and one was not about sleep apnoea. There was no disagreement on final inclusion/exclusion of studies.</P>
