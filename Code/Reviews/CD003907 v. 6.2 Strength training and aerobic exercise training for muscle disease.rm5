<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-06-26 09:23:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Strength training, which is performed to improve muscle strength and muscle endurance, or aerobic exercise programmes, which are designed to improve cardiorespiratory endurance, might optimise physical fitness and prevent additional muscle wasting in people with muscle disease. However, people with muscle disease and some clinicians are still afraid of overuse and have a cautious approach to training. This updated review (most recent date of search 2 July 2012) included two eligible trials of strength training in people with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) and myotonic dystrophy (101 participants), two trials of strength training combined with aerobic exercise in people with mitochondrial myopathy (18 participants) and myotonic dystrophy type I (35 participants) and one trial of aerobic exercise in people with polymyositis and dermatomyositis (14 participants). These trials showed that moderate-intensity strength training in people with myotonic dystrophy or with FSHD, and aerobic exercise training in people with dermatomyositis or polymyositis appear not to harm muscles. Strength training combined with aerobic exercise appears to be safe in myotonic dystrophy type I and may be effective in increasing endurance in people with mitochondrial myopathy. Evidence suggests that strength training is not harmful in people in FSHD, myotonic dystrophy, mitochondrial disorders and dermatomyositis and polymyositis, but further research is needed to determine potential benefit.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-26 09:23:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included five trials (170 participants). The first trial compared the effect of strength training versus no training in 36 people with myotonic dystrophy. The second trial compared aerobic exercise training versus no training in 14 people with polymyositis and dermatomyositis. The third trial compared strength training versus no training in a factorial trial that also compared albuterol with placebo, in 65 people with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). The fourth trial compared combined strength training and aerobic exercise versus no training in 18 people with mitochondrial myopathy. The fifth trial compared combined strength training and aerobic exercise versus no training in 35 people with myotonic dystrophy type 1.</P>
<P>In both myotonic dystrophy trials and the dermatomyositis and polymyositis trial there were no significant differences between training and non-training groups for primary and secondary outcome measures. The risk of bias of the strength training trial in myotonic dystrophy and the aerobic exercise trial in polymyositis and dermatomyositis was judged as uncertain, and for the combined strength training and aerobic exercise trial, the risk of bias was judged as adequate. In the FSHD trial, for which the risk of bias was judged as adequate, a +1.17 kg difference (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 2.16) in dynamic strength of elbow flexors in favour of the training group reached statistical significance. In the mitochondrial myopathy trial, there were no significant differences in dynamic strength measures between training and non-training groups. Exercise duration and distance cycled in a submaximal endurance test increased significantly in the training group compared to the control group. The differences in mean time and mean distance cycled till exhaustion between groups were 23.70 min (95% CI 2.63 to 44.77) and 9.70 km (95% CI 1.51 to 17.89), respectively. The risk of bias was judged as uncertain. In all trials, no adverse events were reported.</P>

<P>Moderate-intensity strength training in myotonic dystrophy and FSHD and aerobic exercise training in dermatomyositis and polymyositis and myotonic dystrophy type I appear to do no harm, but there is insufficient evidence to conclude that they offer benefit. In mitochondrial myopathy, aerobic exercise combined with strength training appears to be safe and may be effective in increasing submaximal endurance capacity. Limitations in the design of studies in other muscle diseases prevent more general conclusions in these disorders.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-26 09:23:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The term 'muscle disease' comprises a large group of conditions. Skeletal muscles are primarily affected but in some disorders other organ systems may also be involved. Most conditions are progressive, causing the muscles to gradually weaken over time. When a person is diagnosed as having a muscle disease, questions arise about the prognosis, possible interventions and genetics. However, people with muscle disease are usually also concerned about everyday issues such as participation in sports, work and hobbies. We cannot give evidence-based advice about these issues, because we do not know how physical exercise affects the diseased muscular system or the cardiorespiratory system. To answer these questions, controlled trials of aerobic exercise and strength training in people with a muscle disease are needed.</P>
<P>Weakness and impaired cardiorespiratory function are common in people with muscle disease; pain and fatigue may also be common symptoms, all of which contribute to a decreased quality of life. In healthy persons the best intervention to improve strength and cardiorespiratory function is physical training. Strength training or aerobic exercise programmes in people with muscle disease might maximise muscle and cardiorespiratory function and prevent additional disuse atrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Vignos-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vignos 1983</LINK>). However, reports of progression of weakness after exercise in people with myopathies have encouraged a cautious approach to training (<LINK REF="REF-Brouwer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brouwer 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fowler-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowler 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1971</LINK>). Therefore, many people with a muscle disease were advised to avoid physical exertion (<LINK REF="REF-Fowler-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowler 1982</LINK>). Thus the benefit from strength training or aerobic exercise training in muscle diseases is still not clear (<LINK REF="REF-Kilmer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilmer 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The relative rarity of many muscle diseases has led researchers to group participants with different neuromuscular disorders together in one study, including myopathies, neuropathies and motor neuron disease (<LINK REF="STD-Aitkens-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Aitkens 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dawes 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kilmer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kilmer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kilmer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kilmer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCartney-1988" TYPE="STUDY">McCartney 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milner_x002d_Brown-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Milner-Brown 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milner_x002d_Brown-1988b" TYPE="STUDY">Milner-Brown 1988b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wright-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 1996</LINK>). As the pathophysiology of these disorders differs, their reaction to an intervention might also be different. Therefore, conclusions about the effect of training derived from these mixed populations cannot readily be extrapolated to people with specific muscular disorders (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this review we systematically analysed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of these interventions for people with specified muscle diseases. This review was first published in 2004, with the most recent update of the searches in 2012.</P>

<P>We selected all trials that included participants with a well-described diagnosis of a muscle disease, such as inflammatory myopathies, metabolic myopathies, muscular dystrophies, muscle diseases with myotonia and other well-defined myopathies. We decided not to include studies looking at strength training or aerobic exercise training for people in whom muscle weakness was not the primary feature, but might have been secondary to chronic renal insufficiency, chronic heart failure, renal or heart transplantation, or corticosteroid use. We did not review the effects of respiratory muscle training. We did not include studies regarding aerobic exercise training for McArdle disease because there is a separate Cochrane review available for this metabolic myopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Quinlivan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinlivan 2011</LINK>). We excluded studies in which participants had a variety of muscle diseases if we could not obtain results for each condition separately. We assessed the diagnostic criteria of each study; diagnosis has to be confirmed by muscle biopsy or genetic testing.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2013-06-26 09:24:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To date, there is no evidence or recommendation for a minimum duration of training in muscle disease. However, in the first six weeks, the change in muscle strength or aerobic capacity is generally caused by neural adaptation. Therefore, we included all forms of strength training and aerobic exercise training lasting at least six weeks. We excluded all studies using a within-subjects design with the non-exercised limb as a control. If exercises are performed to increase muscle strength on one side of the body, voluntary strength can increase on the contralateral side. This concept is called cross-education, and has been described with different forms of exercises. A meta-analysis of 16 randomised studies concluded that, on average, the magnitude of cross-education is eight per cent of the initial strength of the untrained limb (<LINK REF="REF-Munn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munn 2004</LINK>). Neural adaptations to training and learning effects due to testing are postulated as explanations (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Munn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sale-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sale 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shima-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shima 2002</LINK>). Moreover, the results may well be confounded by the presence of asymmetric weakness of both limbs, as the absolute gain in muscle strength resulting from strength training is related to pre-exercise muscle weakness (<LINK REF="REF-Kilmer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilmer 2002</LINK>). For this reason, a non-exercised limb is not an appropriate control, even if training is randomly assigned. For this reason, we have excluded studies using such a within-subjects design.</P>

<P>We assessed the risk of bias and other aspects according to the Cochrane approach using the updated guidance in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed the included studies for randomisation sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding (participants and outcome assessors), incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias. When there was uncertainty, we contacted authors for clarification. We resolved disagreements about fulfilment of inclusion or quality criteria by discussion between the two authors. We made a judgement on each of the 'Risk of bias' criteria, of "High risk of bias", "Low risk of bias" or "Unclear risk of bias". Whenever characteristics of study design or drop-out rates were likely to cause a higher risk of bias, we planned to make a note of this and investigate the possibility of differences in treatment effects varying with the degree of this problem.</P>

Because pooling of the results of trials in different muscle diseases is usually not appropriate, we expressed, when possible, the results per muscle disease as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous outcomes, and risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI for dichotomous outcome measures.

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2013-06-26 09:24:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review, the search retrieved approximately 7400 records. After assessing the titles and abstracts, we identified 61 studies for potential inclusion: 26 completed trials that studied strength training as an intervention, 20 trials studying aerobic exercise training, and 15 trials studying combined strength training and aerobic exercise, sometimes incorporated in more comprehensive rehabilitation programmes. Most strength training trials included people with the following muscle diseases: slowly progressive dystrophies (mostly myotonic dystrophy, limb-girdle dystrophies, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)) and in the older studies, non-specified progressive muscular dystrophies and inflammatory myopathies. Studies on the effects of aerobic exercise training included mainly people with slowly progressive dystrophies and metabolic myopathies (mostly unspecified mitochondrial myopathies).</P>
<P>Studies have generally been limited by small sample sizes. We excluded 48 studies because there was no randomised controlled comparison between training and non-training participants and six studies because of a within-subjects design (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only seven studies were RCTs making a comparison between training and non-training participants (<LINK REF="STD-Cejudo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cejudo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dawes 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesinger-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesinger 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesinger-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesinger 1998b</LINK>). Regrettably, the extension of the initially randomised, controlled six-week aerobic exercise study in people with dermatomyositis and polymyositis by Wiesinger et al (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesinger-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesinger 1998b</LINK>) lost its randomised controlled design due to a decision of the ethics committee. The randomised controlled strength training combined with aerobic exercise trial which compared eight weeks of walking and strengthening exercises versus no training in 20 participants with different muscle diseases (<LINK REF="STD-Dawes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dawes 2006</LINK>) has been excluded as both study groups consisted of participants with various muscle diseases and the outcome measures were not presented for each muscle disease separately. As the pathophysiology of each muscle disease differs, their reaction to training might be different. It is not known if the effect of strength training and aerobic exercise training is the same for every muscle disease. Therefore, data should be presented and analysed for each disease individually, and the power should be sufficient for each individual disorder. For this reason, no conclusions can be drawn with regard to the effect of exercise training for each specific muscle disease in the trial. Finally, no specific details about the exercise programme were provided and the risk of bias of the trial was high.</P>
<P>In conclusion, we included two strength training trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>), one aerobic exercise trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesinger-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesinger 1998a</LINK>) and two strength training combined with aerobic exercise trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cejudo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cejudo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 2011</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). The first strength training trial compared the effect of 24 weeks of training versus no training in 36 adults with myotonic dystrophy and 30 adults with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy types I or II (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>). As this review is concerned with muscle disease, we will not discuss the results of the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy participant group. The aerobic exercise trial compared six weeks of cycle and step aerobics exercise with no training in nine adults with dermatomyositis and five adults with polymyositis (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesinger-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesinger 1998a</LINK>). The second strength training trial compared 52 weeks of strength training versus no training in a factorial trial that also compared albuterol with placebo after the first 26 weeks of training in 65 adult participants with FSHD (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>). Only the results for the comparison strength training versus no training will be discussed in this review. The first combined aerobic exercise and strength training trial compared 12 weeks of cycle exercises and dynamic and isokinetic strength training versus no training in 18 people with mitochondrial myopathy (<LINK REF="STD-Cejudo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cejudo 2005</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). The second combined aerobic exercise and strength training trial compared 14 weeks of balance exercises, aerobic activities, flexibility exercises, strength exercises and a brisk walk versus no training in 35 people with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (<LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 2011</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Strength training trial in myotonic dystrophy</HEADING>
<P>In the first myotonic dystrophy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>), participants with myotonic dystrophy were individually matched for muscle strength and performance in a stair-climbing test. Within each matched pair, participants were randomly assigned to the training or control group. There was no published information on the method of randomisation or on allocation concealment but the first author (Lindeman) informed us that two independent persons drew one sealed name per matched pair and allocated it to the training or non-training group by tossing a coin. We graded the intention to blind the clinical evaluators as adequate, although approximately 20% of the myotonic dystrophy participants revealed information to the clinical evaluators that resulted in unblinding during the course of the trial. The authors considered the baseline comparability of the groups as suboptimal because the training group had longer time scores for stair climbing (a measure of functional ability) and had higher knee torques (a measure of muscle strength). They argued that the first three items could have resulted in an underestimation of the training effect, whereas the last item could have resulted in an overestimation of the training effect. They concluded that the differences in experimental group composition did not seem to explain the absence of differences in outcomes between treatment groups. We considered the way the authors presented and discussed the baseline differences as adequate. Three of the initially 36 randomised participants withdrew before disclosure of treatment allocation. The 33 participants starting the trial made 15 matched pairs. During the trial one person dropped out because of knee problems. Because of the matched pair design only complete pairs were analysed, thus eventually 28 of the initial 36 randomised participants were analysed. Follow-up was therefore incomplete and analysis was not by intention-to-treat. However, the flow path of participants was well documented.</P>

<P>In the dermatomyositis and polymyositis trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesinger-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesinger 1998a</LINK>), nine people with dermatomyositis and five with polymyositis were randomly assigned to the training or control group using distinct randomisation lists. The training group received six weeks of bicycle exercises and step aerobics. Participants in the control group did not undergo any training and continued their previous way of life. There was no published information on allocation concealment and our attempts to obtain further information on this were not successful. During the strength measurements, the clinical evaluator was blinded to the treatment allocation. The success of blinding of assessors was not formally checked as blinding of participants is not possible in an exercise study. There was no published information on blinding during the other measurements. Baseline characteristics were presented for both groups. The authors considered the two groups to be well balanced with respect to most baseline characteristics. There was complete follow-up of all participants.</P>

<P>In the FSHD trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>), 65 participants were stratified into two groups based on muscle strength. Participants in both strata were randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups according to a computer-generated randomisation list. The treatments consisted of training plus albuterol, training plus placebo, non-training plus albuterol, or non-training plus placebo. Training or non-training was the first intervention, starting just after the baseline visit until after the final visit at 52 weeks. Information on the assignment to training or non-training was disclosed to the participants by the physical therapist (supervising the training programme) after their baseline visit. The clinical evaluator was blinded for the assignment to both interventions. The participants, physical therapist and the neurologist evaluating side effects were blinded to the treatment allocation. The blinding of the clinical evaluator was considered adequate, although one of the main secondary outcome measures, the one-repetition maximum (1RM) measurement for assessing dynamic strength, was performed by the physical therapist who supervised the training, and who was therefore not blinded to the allocation to training or non-training. Allocation to the training or non-training group was unmasked in three cases, due to unintentional remarks. The success of blinding was not formally checked. Baseline characteristics were presented for all treatment groups. One participant stopped training but still attended all trial visits, resulting in complete follow-up of all participants. Data analysis was by the intention-to-treat principle. As no statistically significant interactions between the two interventions (that is, training versus non-training) could be detected, the effect sizes, being the differences in mean change from baseline, were presented for each intervention.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Combined aerobic exercise and strength training trial in mitochondrial myopathy</HEADING>
<P>In the mitochondrial myopathy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cejudo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cejudo 2005</LINK>), 20 participants were randomly assigned to the training or control group. There was no published information on the method of randomisation, allocation concealment, or blinding of the evaluators. The author (Cejudo) informed us that participants were randomly assigned according to a computer generated randomisation list. The evaluators were not blinded to the intervention allocation, but knew to which group each participant was assigned. One participant in each group failed to finish the study for personal reasons. Baseline characteristics were presented for both groups, except for the participants lost to follow-up. Follow-up was therefore incomplete and analysis was not done by intention-to-treat. No flow path of participants was documented. The authors considered both groups as comparable with respect to age and gender, as well as to each measured variable at baseline.</P>

<P>In the second myotonic dystrophy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 2011</LINK>), the median value of the results of the six-minute walk test was used to divide the 35 participants into two strata from which they were divided into the training or the control group. The lots consisted of folded pieces of paper with the name of the participant and were drawn by a person not involved in any part of the study. Since participants were recruited before randomisation, concealed allocation procedures were applied. An intention-to-treat analysis was applied. Three participants had missing data for perceived exertion at baseline and one person in the control group did not attend the measurement after the intervention but still completed the questionnaires. There was no significant difference in sex or age of participants between groups in the study; however, the mean muscular impairment scale (MIRS) grade was higher in the exercise group, indicating that participants in the exercise group were more severely impaired than participants in the control group. The training group received a comprehensive group exercise training programme, they were also asked to perform an active 30 min walk every week. The participants in the control group were advised to live their normal lives and to maintain their degree of physical activity during the study period. The degree of activity of both groups was not objectively checked.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of diagnostic criteria</HEADING>
<P>This assessment took into account if and how diagnoses were verified. In the first myotonic dystrophy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>), participants were recruited via neurologists, physiatrists and the Dutch association for neuromuscular diseases (Vereniging Spierziekten Nederland) on clinical grounds and without genetic verification. We therefore considered the quality of the diagnostic criteria as inadequate. In the second myotonic dystrophy (type I) trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 2011</LINK>), the diagnosis was genetically confirmed in all participants and the diagnostic criteria are therefore adequate.</P>
<P>In the dermatomyositis and polymyositis trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesinger-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesinger 1998a</LINK>), all the participants had an established diagnosis of primary inflammatory muscle disease as defined by the established criteria of Bohan and Peter, with a disease duration of at least six months (<LINK REF="REF-Bohan-1975a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohan 1975a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bohan-1975b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohan 1975b</LINK>). In all participants, muscle biopsies, electromyograms and laboratory studies had been performed to establish the diagnosis. We therefore considered the quality of the diagnostic criteria to be adequate.</P>
<P>In the FSHD trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>), participants or a first-degree relative had the associated deletion at chromosome 4 (<LINK REF="REF-Deidda-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deidda 1996</LINK>). The quality of the diagnosis was therefore adequate. In the mitochondrial myopathy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cejudo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cejudo 2005</LINK>) participants were recruited from a larger group of patients followed at the university hospital of Sevilla, Spain. Diagnosis was based on clinical and muscle biopsy data. Biopsy findings were determined by biochemical and histological techniques without genetic verification. One participant in each group had only a probable diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy. The quality of the diagnostic criteria is therefore uncertain.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of training programme</HEADING>
<P>The training programmes of the first myotonic dystrophy (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>), FSHD (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>), mitochondrial myopathy (<LINK REF="STD-Cejudo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cejudo 2005</LINK>) and dermatomyositis and polymyositis (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesinger-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesinger 1998a</LINK>) trials fulfilled most of the minimum requirements as defined by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) Position Stand (<LINK REF="REF-Garber-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garber 2011</LINK>). In the second myotonic dystrophy type I trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 2011</LINK>), the intervention consisted of a comprehensive group exercise training programme supported by music. The author could not give the exact training load of each strength training exercise as a percentage of repetition maximum (RM) as it was not tested that way. However, all major muscle groups were trained: arm, back, leg and abdominal muscles (<LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 2011</LINK>). The training scheme for the other strength training trials was inadequate only with respect to the number of muscle groups trained, as the ACSM recommends eight to 10 exercises of all the major muscle groups. Only four muscle groups were trained in the first myotonic dystrophy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>), two in the FSHD trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>) and three in the mitochondrial myopathy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cejudo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cejudo 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>All studies except the combined aerobic exercise and strength training in myotonic dystrophy type I trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 2011</LINK>), focused on a limited number of muscle groups for reasons of effect evaluation, safety and time restraints per training session.</P>
<P>In the dermatomyositis and polymyositis trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesinger-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesinger 1998a</LINK>), the training frequency was only twice a week in the first two weeks, but increased to three times a week in the remaining four weeks. In the mitochondrial myopathy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cejudo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cejudo 2005</LINK>), there was no published information regarding supervision. In the other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>), a physiotherapist supervised training.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcome measure for strength training: muscle strength, expressed in measures of static (ie. isometric) or dynamic strength</HEADING>
<P>Muscle strength was the primary outcome measure for the first myotonic dystrophy (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>) and FSHD trials (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>). In the first myotonic dystrophy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>), differences in muscle strength were measured isokinetically on a dynamometer as maximum concentric knee torques at three velocities, and isometrically as maximum voluntary contraction. Knee torques of the myotonic dystrophy group did not show any statistically significant difference between the training and control groups, as found with a paired t-test. After 24 weeks, mean change in isokinetic knee torque extension was 1.4 Nm (SD 8.2) for the control group and 5.3 Nm (SD 12.9) for the training group, P = 0.34. Mean change in isokinetic knee torque flexion was 3.7 Nm (SD 8.6) for the control group and 7.4 (SD 11.4) for the training group, P = 0.34 and mean change in maximum isometric voluntary contraction was 6.6 Nm (SD 11.0) for the control group and 8.7 Nm (SD 14.71) for the training group, P = 0.67.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The primary outcome measure in the FSHD trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>) was a change in maximum voluntary isometric strength of the elbow flexors and ankle dorsiflexors, measured on a Quantitative Muscle Assessment fixed myometry testing system. After 52 weeks the isometric strength of the elbow flexors did not differ significantly between the training and non-training group, for the right side the difference in the means was 0.54 kgF (95% CI -0.38 to 1.46) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>), with the better score being for the training group. Dynamic strength was evaluated using the one-repetition maximum (1RM), the weight a person can lift once, but not twice, at a steady controlled pace through the full range of joint motion. The 1RM of the elbow flexors showed a significantly larger increase in the training group compared to the non-training group (for the right side the difference in the means was 1.17 kg (95% CI 0.18 to 2.16) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). Both strength measures of the ankle dorsiflexors decreased significantly and markedly in all treatment groups. This decrease was not influenced by training (on the right side the difference in the means in maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) was 0.43 kgF (95% CI -1.62 to 2.48) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>) more for the training group, in 1RM the difference was -0.44 kg (95% CI -1.77 to 0.89) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>) less for the training group). Differences between groups for the left-sided trained muscles did not materially differ from those for the right side.</P>
<P>Muscle strength was a secondary outcome in the mitochondrial myopathy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cejudo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cejudo 2005</LINK>). In this trial, weight-lifting capacity was measured as the heaviest weight that could be lifted throughout the complete range of movement (1RM test). After the study period, all participants showed increases in all 1RM tests. After 12 weeks, weight-lifting capacity did not differ significantly between the training and non-training group. The differences in mean 1RM between groups were -5.00 kg (95% CI -14.71 to 4.71) less for the training group for the shoulder press exercise (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>), 6.40 kg (95% CI -2.89 to 15.69) in favour of the training group for the butterfly exercise (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>) and 7.30 kg (95% CI -2.91 to 17.51) in favour of the training group for the biceps curls exercise (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>).</P>

In the mitochondrial myopathy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cejudo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cejudo 2005</LINK>), work capacity was measured in a cycle test and in the shuttle walking test. Endurance time was measured in a submaximal cycling test at a constant workload of 70% of the maximum power output achieved during the baseline incremental cycle test. After 12 weeks, the differences in mean time and distance cycled till exhaustion and leg fatigue or breathlessness exhaustion differed significantly between groups. The differences in mean time and distance cycled till exhaustion between groups were 23.70 min (95% CI 2.63 to 44.77) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>) and 9.70 km (95% CI 1.51 to 17.89) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>), respectively. The distance walked until exhaustion was measured in the shuttle walking test and was 78.00 m more for the training group (95% CI -144.86 to 300.86) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.6</LINK>). The primary outcome in the second myotonic dystrophy type I trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 2011</LINK>) was the distance walked in the six-minute walk test. A difference above or equal to 6% in distance walked between the baseline measurement and the measurement after the intervention period of 14 weeks was considered as a minimally clinically important change. After 14 weeks, the differences in mean distance walked in the six-minute walk test was 11.00 m (95% CI -66.92 to 88.92), in favour of the training group (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>).</P>

In the myotonic dystrophy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>), serum myoglobin levels were assessed just before and one hour after the measurement session at the baseline visit and at the final visit. Changes in serum myoglobin activity one hour after a standardised test should reflect changes in muscle fibre permeability due to muscle damage. The mean rise in serum myoglobin levels did not differ significantly between the training and the non-training group (-21.00 ng/l, 95% CI -48.35 to 6.35) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.8</LINK>). In the inflammatory muscle disease trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesinger-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesinger 1998a</LINK>), serum levels of creatine kinase and aldolase were measured weekly on Monday after a weekend recovery phase without exercise. There was no statistically significant change in serum creatine kinase level and serum aldolase level during the observation period either in the control group (mean -13.9%, 95% CI -41.34 to 13.54) or in the training group (mean -6%, 95% CI -22.66 to 10.66) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the mitochondrial myopathy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cejudo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cejudo 2005</LINK>), the authors state that the participants' serum creatine kinase levels remained unaltered after the intervention period.

In the FSHD trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>), one participant stopped training because of recurring, training-related muscle soreness and fatigue. A diagnostic work-up revealed a mitochondrial myopathy as well as FSHD. In the mitochondrial myopathy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cejudo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cejudo 2005</LINK>), cancellations of exercise sessions by participants happened because of muscle soreness associated with the exercise activity. However, every participant was able to tolerate the exercise training regimen without complications. In the first myotonic dystrophy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>), a few participants complained of muscle soreness and transient strength reduction after eight weeks. However, no signs of muscle damage were found at the final visit after 24 weeks. In the second myotonic dystrophy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 2011</LINK>), one person had periods of atrial arrhythmia; however, this was not in connection with the training and the participant was allowed to complete the study by a cardiologist.

Five people mentioned a period with elbow complaints. However, the number of people with neck-shoulder and elbow complaints did not differ between treatment groups at baseline nor at the final visit. Moreover, the number of participants with neck-shoulder and elbow complaints slightly decreased in both groups. RR at the final visit was 1.02 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.58) for neck-shoulder and 1.82 (95% CI 0.17 to 19.13) for elbow complaints in favour of the non-training group.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-06-26 09:28:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only six out of the 60 identified studies on the effect of training in people with muscle disease used a randomised controlled design (<LINK REF="STD-Cejudo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cejudo 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dawes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dawes 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiesinger-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesinger 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 2011</LINK>). The randomised controlled strength training combined with aerobic exercise trial which compared eight weeks of walking and strengthening exercises versus no training in 20 participants with different muscle diseases (<LINK REF="STD-Dawes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dawes 2006</LINK>) has been excluded because the outcome measures were not presented separately for each different muscle disease. Moreover, no specific details about the exercise programme were provided and the risk of bias of the trial was judged as 'high'.</P>
<P>The strength training trial in FSHD participants (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>) had minor methodological shortcomings. One of the main secondary outcome measures, the 1RM strength measurement, was performed by a physical therapist not blinded to the allocation to training or non-training. The overall risk of bias was, therefore, judged as 'low'.</P>
<P>The dermatomyositis and polymyositis trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesinger-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesinger 1998a</LINK>) had several uncertainties regarding the generation of the randomisation list, allocation concealment and blinding of the assessor. No primary or secondary outcome measures were defined. The overall risk of bias was, therefore, judged as 'unclear'.</P>
<P>In the myotonic dystrophy strength training trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>) diagnoses were not adequately verified. Furthermore, analysis was not by intention-to-treat partly due to the matched-pair design. Because of these major methodological shortcomings, we judged the overall risk of bias as 'unclear'.</P>
<P>In the mitochondrial myopathy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cejudo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cejudo 2005</LINK>), clinical evaluators were not blinded, which may have led to an overestimation of the training effect on muscle strength and aerobic capacity. Analysis in this trial was not by intention-to-treat. The overall risk of bias was therefore judged as 'unclear'.</P>
<P>Most differences in mean muscle strength outcomes (isometric, dynamic and endurance) between groups in all trials showed small, non-significant beneficial effects in favour of the training groups. In the first myotonic dystrophy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>), only changes in the endurance measure (13.10 s longer maximum duration of an isometric contraction (95% CI 2.20 to 24.00)) and in the FSHD trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>) only the dynamic strength measure for the elbow flexors (concentric contraction with 1.20 kg heavier weight (95% CI 0.18 to 2.16)) reached statistical significance. However, no adjustments were made for multiple comparisons.</P>
<P>The absent or limited positive effects of strength training on muscle strength could reflect the inability of the diseased muscular system to respond with normal neural and trophic adaptations to the applied training stimuli. However, part of this lack of response could be due to the specificity of the training (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>). All adaptations to training are specific to the stimuli applied. Specific strength training essentially involves exercising the muscles in the same manner as the expected use (<LINK REF="REF-Kraemer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraemer 2002</LINK>). This means that a training programme with dynamic exercises increases dynamic strength more than isometric strength, and vice versa. This phenomenon of specificity of training has implications for the sensitivity of the outcome measures; for example, the positive effect of a dynamic strength training programme may be captured by using a dynamic evaluation technique, but might be missed using an isometric strength measure. The size of the carry-over effect from, for example, dynamic strength to isometric strength cannot be predicted and it may be that there is a diminished ability of the diseased muscular system to transfer effects of a specific training programme from one strength modality to another (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the FSHD trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>), training did not influence strength of the ankle dorsiflexors, in contrast to the elbow flexors. The authors thought that a difference in grade of muscle weakness at baseline between elbow and ankle dorsiflexors might provide the explanation for the difference in their response to training. In this study elbow flexors were eligible for testing and training when strength according to the MRC scale grade was three or more, whereas ankle dorsiflexors were eligible when the muscles moved the ankle joint in a position between dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, which potentially includes MRC grades less than three (<LINK REF="REF-Medical-Research-Council-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medical Research Council 1981</LINK>). Therefore, pre-exercise weakness might have been more severe in ankle dorsiflexors compared to elbow flexors. In people with a muscle disease, it is assumed that absolute gain in muscle strength resulting from strength training is probably related to pre-exercise muscle strength, and that severely weakened muscles (&lt; 10% of normal strength) may not be able to improve. However, this widely reported assumption is based on one published observation only (<LINK REF="STD-Milner_x002d_Brown-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Milner-Brown 1988a</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the mitochondrial myopathy trial (<LINK REF="STD-Cejudo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cejudo 2005</LINK>), the MD in aerobic capacity as measured in a submaximal cycle test differed significantly between the training and non-training group after the study period. Participants in the training group cycled on average 23.70 min (95% CI 2.63 to 44.77) and 9.70 km longer (95% CI 1.51 to 17.89) than participants in the control group. The distance walked in the shuttle walking test did not differ between groups. This could be explained by the specificity of training, because training consisted of cycling rather than walking exercises.</P>
<P>The timed-scored functional assessments did not demonstrate any relevant or significant changes between treatment groups in the two myotonic dystrophy trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 2011</LINK>), the dermatomyositis and polymyositis trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesinger-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesinger 1998a</LINK>) or the FSHD trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>). This may be due to the small number of muscle groups trained, the absent or limited effects on muscle strength, and the specificity of the training stimuli applied.</P>
<P>In all trials no signs of overuse were reported. This is of major clinical importance because these findings do not support the notion of increased risk of muscle strain in slowly progressive muscular dystrophies. However, adverse events were only mentioned in general and not compared between groups. Only in the dermatomyositis and polymyositis trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesinger-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesinger 1998a</LINK>), were serum levels of enzymes mentioned for both groups. Moreover, several participants in all trials experienced muscle soreness. An enhanced liability for overwork weakness in more severely affected FSHD patients cannot be excluded, because patients unable to walk independently were not included in the FSHD trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>). Furthermore, all training studies, including the studies included in this review, imposed a controlled strain for a relatively short period. Hence, exertion of longer duration may still have an undetermined effect on disease progression.</P>
<P>Based on the evidence of the five selected RCTs in this review concerning myotonic dystrophy (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>) and myotonic dystrophy type I (<LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 2011</LINK>), dermatomyositis and polymyositis (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesinger-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesinger 1998a</LINK>), FSHD (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>) and mitochondrial myopathy (<LINK REF="STD-Cejudo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cejudo 2005</LINK>), people with these specific disorders can be advised that 'normal' participation in sports and work appears not to harm their muscles. Yet there is still insufficient evidence for general prescription of strength training and aerobic exercise programmes in myotonic dystrophy, polymyositis and dermatomyositis and FSHD. Nevertheless, there is some evidence for training effects in mitochondrial myopathy. Unfortunately, no clearly defined exercise protocols can be drawn from the current research evidence.</P>
<P>Evidence from non-randomised studies and other designs, such as pre-post studies or case-control studies showed that aerobic exercise training appears to be safe and effective in adults with various muscle diseases and that strength training appears to be safe and effective in adults with slowly progressive muscle diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Cup-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cup 2007;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Ansved-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansved 2008</LINK>) but limitations in the design of these studies prevent valid conclusions. The number of recent studies lacking a randomised controlled design is striking. At least for the relatively frequent muscle diseases, one should aim for randomised controlled training studies. Preferably, homogeneous groups of people with the same muscle disease should be included. When people with different neuromuscular disorders but with similar distribution and severity of muscle weakness participate in the same study, the data should also be presented for each major type of muscle disease separately to detect possible disease-specific trends. Because we cannot pool the results of the trials in different muscle diseases in this review, it is not possible to define the optimal exercise duration for people with a specific muscle disease.</P>
<P>Specific diagnostic criteria should be given for all muscle diseases included.Information on the severity of the muscle disease in participants should also be presented so as to allow readers to assess the generalisability of the results to other people with the similar type and severity of muscledisease. In trials with a small sample size, participants should be stratified for disease severity. Another related characteristic that may influence outcome is the level of activity (sedentary versus active) at baseline, because in the healthy population untrained persons respond with higher percentages and rates of gain in strength, compared to trained individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Garber-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garber 2011</LINK>). Activity level and change in activity level for each participant should be monitored objectively during the trial period, for example with an accelerometer.</P>
<P>Participants in an active training group may experience additional non-specific benefits (that is, Hawthorne effects), for instancefrom regular interaction with a skilled therapist, in contrast to those in a non-treatment or usual care group. As it is well known that such Hawthorne effects may affect outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Parsons-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons 1974</LINK>), future studies should preferably have an appropriate control intervention rather than 'no training' in order to assess the specific benefits of aerobic exercise and strength training. For example, the control group might receive weekly counselling sessions with general information about exercise.</P>
<P>In strength training and aerobic exercise intervention studies, the training programme should be described in detail, just as the prescription of drugs would be. Authors should provide information about the type(s) of exercises, the intensity (including progression rate), frequency, duration per exercise session, the duration of the entire programme, as well as the trained muscle groups, and the supervision of training.</P>
<P>The recommendations from the ACSM Position Stand on 'The recommended quantity and quality of exercise for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, and flexibility in healthy adults' (<LINK REF="REF-Garber-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garber 2011</LINK>) can be used as requirements for an effective, safe and individualised exercise prescription, taking into account the pre-training level of fitness. The ACSM recommendations were almost all adhered to by most of the included and excluded studies in this review. The only criterion that was rarely met was that eight to 10 major muscle groups should be exercised in strength training programmes. This is probably partly due to limitations in time available to evaluate the effects of training by multiple assessments covering the different outcome measures. In addition, expenses for (adjusted) training equipment can be high. Thirdly, investigators were perhaps too cautious in order not to strain participants too much. Moreover, strength training for fewer than eight muscle groups could be adequate in people with a muscle disease, who are generally untrained.</P>
<P>More studies that evaluate the level of basic muscle function and aerobic capacity are needed on the effects of aerobic exercise and strength training programmes in people with specific muscle diseases. There are well-validated outcome measures that are able to assess positive and, at least equally important, negative effects on the diseased muscular system. The expertise to deliver training programmes in healthy individuals is already present in sports medicine and experts in exercise physiology should be consulted.<BR/>
</P>
<P>If strength training and aerobic exercise training programmes prove to be effective for people with a muscle disease, we can then aim to develop and evaluate programmes adjusted to each different muscle disease. In people with muscular disorders, combinations of muscle weakness, fatigue, pain and difficulty exercising can all lead to reduced physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2002</LINK>). Physical inactivity negatively impacts quality of life and health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In healthy young adults, in the elderly, and in cardiac patients, increasing physical activity and participation by comprehensive exercise programmes incorporating aerobic activities, strength training and flexibility exercises has been shown to reduce the risk of several chronic diseases (for example, coronary heart disease, obesity, diabetes and osteoporosis) (<LINK REF="REF-Garber-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garber 2011</LINK>). Therefore, indicators of chronic disease risk such as blood pressure, resting heart rate, body mass, glucose tolerance and bone density could be useful as additional outcome measures (<LINK REF="REF-Kilmer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilmer 2002</LINK>), although little is known about the risks of comorbidity in people with a muscle disease. Cost-benefit analyses are only relevant if the benefit of training is much higher than studies have shown so far.</P>
<P>In summary, the authors' recommendations for future studies are as follows.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Participants with different muscle disorders can participate in one study, but data should be presented for each major type of muscle disease separately.</LI>
<LI>Randomised controlled comparisons should be made with participants having the same muscle disease. The effect of training in people with a muscle disease should be compared to a non-exercising control group of people with the same muscle disease and not to healthy individuals, or to contralateral non-exercised limbs.</LI>
<LI>An appropriate placebo intervention is recommended in order to measure exercise-specific benefits.</LI>
<LI>Stratified randomisation is strongly advised with regard to disease severity, particularly in studies with a small sample size. It should also be considered for pre-training level of activity (sedentary versus active), particularly in aerobic intervention studies.</LI>
<LI>The following aspects of the training intervention should be specified: type(s) of exercise training, intensity and progression rate, frequency, duration per exercise session and of the entire programme, trained muscle groups, and supervision of training. Duration of the training intervention should be at least six weeks.</LI>
<LI>Outcomes should at least include measures of muscle function (for example, strength, endurance measured by the maximum duration of contraction) and aerobic capacity (for example, work capacity measured by an incremental cycle test), and functional assessments such as a six-minute walk test. Researchers should be aware of the specificity of training effects in their choice of outcome measures. The following evaluations are strongly advised: measures of quality of life, pain and experienced fatigue.</LI>
<LI>Outcomes assessors should be blinded to interventions, to avoid measurement bias.</LI>
<LI>Activity level of participants in the control group should be monitored objectively in order to assess the specific benefits of aerobic exercise and strength training exercise.</LI>

<P>Based on the evidence from five RCTs in this review, moderate-intensity strength training in myotonic dystrophy (<LINK REF="STD-Lindeman-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lindeman 1995</LINK>) and FSHD (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Kooi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van der Kooi 2004</LINK>), aerobic exercise therapy in dermatomyositis and polymyositis (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesinger-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesinger 1998a</LINK>) and a combination of strength and aerobic exercise training in myotonic dystrophy type I (<LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 2011</LINK>) show no harm, but there is insufficient evidence to conclude that they offer benefit. A combination of aerobic exercise and strength training in mitochondrial myopathy shows no harm and could be beneficial for aerobic capacity (<LINK REF="STD-Cejudo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cejudo 2005</LINK>). The small number of included studies and limitations in study design of the other studies prevent general conclusions in other muscle diseases.</P>

<P>As stated in a previous update, we excluded all studies using a within-subjects design with the non-exercised limb as a control (<LINK REF="STD-Aitkens-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Aitkens 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Lateur-1979" TYPE="STUDY">De Lateur 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kilmer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kilmer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCartney-1988" TYPE="STUDY">McCartney 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tollb_x00e4_ck-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tollbck 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>At this update (2012) additional changes were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>inclusion of exercise programmes with a minimum duration of six, rather than 10 weeks as previously specified. Because of this change of protocol, we included one trial which was excluded in the previous update (<LINK REF="STD-Wiesinger-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Wiesinger 1998a</LINK>) and one new trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kierkegaard-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kierkegaard 2011</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>we added a statement that we would exclude studies in which outcomes were not presented separately for each muscle disease. One randomised controlled strength training combined with aerobic exercise trial has been excluded for this reason. No specific details about the exercise programme were provided and the methodological quality of the trial was considered poor (<LINK REF="STD-Dawes-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Dawes 2006</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>we updated the definitions in <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>;</LI>
<LI>we have updated and changed the diagnostic criteria to 'confirmed by muscle biopsy or genetic testing';</LI>
<LI>we have updated the exercise guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Garber-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garber 2011</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>we searched the Cochrane Rehabilitation and Related Therapies Field Register in October 2002, August 2008 and July 2009. As, in the past, it yielded no results and is no longer available, it has been removed from the <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK> section.</LI>
