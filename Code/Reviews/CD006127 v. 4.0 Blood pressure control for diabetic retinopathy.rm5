<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-01-28 16:21:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of blood pressure control to prevent diabetic retinopathy and/or to slow progression of diabetic retinopathy.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Diabetes is characterized by high levels of blood glucose (sugar circulating in the blood) and is classified as either type 1 or type 2, depending on the underlying cause of increased blood glucose. A common complication in people with diabetes is diabetic retinopathy, often called 'diabetic eye disease,' which affects the blood vessels in the back of the eye. Diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of poor vision and blindness worldwide among adults of working age. Research has shown that control of blood glucose reduces the risk of diabetic retinopathy and prevents worsening of the condition once it develops. However, the current diabetes epidemic suggests that the rates of new and worsening diabetic retinopathy will increase without effective means of prevention and treatment in addition to blood glucose control. Simultaneous treatment to reduce blood pressure among diabetics has been suggested as one approach.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>We found 15 randomized controlled trials, conducted primarily in North America and Europe, to investigate the effects of methods to lower blood pressure (drug-based in 14 trials; lifestyle change in 1 trial) in 4157 type 1 and 9512 type 2 diabetics, ranging from 16 to 2130 participants in individual trials. The follow-up period ranged from one to nine years for included trials. Of the 15 trials, six were funded in full by one or more drug companies. Seven more studies received drug company support, usually in the form of study medications. The remaining two studies were conducted with support from government-sponsored grants and institutional support. The evidence is current to April 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>Overall, the included trials provided modest support for lowering blood pressure to prevent diabetic retinopathy, regardless of diabetes type or baseline blood pressure level. However, the evidence did not indicate that lowering blood pressure kept diabetic retinopathy from worsening once it had developed or that it prevented advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy that required laser or other treatment of affected eyes. Treatment to reduce the blood pressure of people with diabetes is warranted for other health reasons, but the available evidence does not justify reduction of blood pressure solely to prevent or slow diabetic retinopathy.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>Overall, the quality of the evidence was low to moderate based on the reported information. The quality was downgraded mainly because some studies did not report outcomes for all or most participants at follow-up time points, and results from different studies were not highly consistent.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-12-12 00:56:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes and a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness. Research has established the importance of blood glucose control to prevent development and progression of the ocular complications of diabetes. Simultaneous blood pressure control has been advocated for the same purpose, but findings reported from individual studies have supported varying conclusions regarding the ocular benefit of interventions on blood pressure.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-10-06 17:34:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary aim of this review was to summarize the existing evidence regarding the effect of interventions to control or reduce blood pressure levels among diabetics on incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy, preservation of visual acuity, adverse events, quality of life, and costs. A secondary aim was to compare classes of anti-hypertensive medications with respect to the same outcomes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-01-28 19:02:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We searched a number of electronic databases including CENTRAL as well as ongoing trial registries. We last searched the electronic databases on 25 April 2014. We also reviewed reference lists of review articles and trial reports selected for inclusion. In addition, we contacted investigators of trials with potentially pertinent data.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-08-19 16:35:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included in this review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which either type 1 or type 2 diabetic participants, with or without hypertension, were assigned randomly to intense versus less intense blood pressure control, to blood pressure control versus usual care or no intervention on blood pressure, or to different classes of anti-hypertensive agents versus placebo.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-12-19 14:17:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pairs of review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts from electronic and manual searches and the full text of any document that appeared to be relevant. We assessed included trials independently for risk of bias with respect to outcomes reported in this review. We extracted data regarding trial characteristics, incidence and progression of retinopathy, visual acuity, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness at annual intervals after study entry whenever provided in published reports and other documents available from included trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-21 16:57:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 15 RCTs, conducted primarily in North America and Europe, that had enrolled 4157 type 1 and 9512 type 2 diabetic participants, ranging from 16 to 2130 participants in individual trials. In 10 of the 15 RCTs, one group of participants was assigned to one or more anti-hypertensive agents and the control group received placebo. In three trials, intense blood pressure control was compared to less intense blood pressure control. In the remaining two trials, blood pressure control was compared with usual care. Five of the 15 trials enrolled type 1 diabetics, and 10 trials enrolled type 2 diabetics. Six trials were sponsored entirely by pharmaceutical companies, seven trials received partial support from pharmaceutical companies, and two studies received support from government-sponsored grants and institutional support.</P>
<P>Study designs, populations, interventions, and lengths of follow-up (range one to nine years) varied among the included trials. Overall, the quality of the evidence for individual outcomes was low to moderate. For the primary outcomes, incidence and progression of retinopathy, the quality of evidence was downgraded due to inconsistency and imprecision of estimates from individual studies and differing characteristics of participants.</P>
<P>For primary outcomes among type 1 diabetics, one of the five trials reported incidence of retinopathy and one trial reported progression of retinopathy after 4 to 5 years of treatment and follow-up; four of the five trials reported a combined outcome of incidence and progression over the same time interval. Among type 2 diabetics, 5 of the 10 trials reported incidence of diabetic retinopathy and 3 trials reported progression of retinopathy; one of the 10 trials reported a combined outcome of incidence and progression during a 4- to 5-year follow-up period. One trial in which type 2 diabetics participated had reported no primary (or secondary) outcome targeted for this review.</P>
<P>The evidence from these trials supported a benefit of more intensive blood pressure control intervention with respect to 4- to 5-year incidence of diabetic retinopathy (estimated risk ratio (RR) 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.92) and the combined outcome of incidence and progression (estimated RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97). The available evidence provided less support for a benefit with respect to 4- to 5-year progression of diabetic retinopathy (point estimate was closer to 1 than point estimates for incidence and combined incidence and progression, and the CI overlapped 1; estimated RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.05). The available evidence regarding progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy or clinically significant macular edema or moderate to severe loss of best-corrected visual acuity did not support a benefit of intervention on blood pressure: estimated RRs and 95% CIs 0.95 (0.83 to 1.09) and 1.06 (0.85 to 1.33), respectively, after 4 to 5 years of follow-up. Findings within subgroups of trial participants (type 1 and type 2 diabetics; participants with normal blood pressure levels at baseline and those with elevated levels) were similar to overall findings.</P>
<P>The adverse event reported most often (7 of 15 trials) was death, yielding an estimated RR 0.86 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.14). Hypotension was reported from three trials; the estimated RR was 2.08 (95% CI 1.68 to 2.57). Other adverse ocular events were reported from single trials.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-12-19 05:16:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hypertension is a well-known risk factor for several chronic conditions in which lowering blood pressure has proven to be beneficial. The available evidence supports a beneficial effect of intervention to reduce blood pressure with respect to preventing diabetic retinopathy for up to 4 to 5 years. However, the lack of evidence to support such intervention to slow progression of diabetic retinopathy or to prevent other outcomes considered in this review, along with the relatively modest support for the beneficial effect on incidence, weakens the conclusion regarding an overall benefit of intervening on blood pressure solely to prevent diabetic retinopathy.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Introduction and epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Diabetic retinopathy is a complex disorder of the retinal vasculature that is characterized by increased vascular permeability, retinal ischemia and edema, and new blood vessel formation. The National Eye Institute reports age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy to be the leading causes of visual impairment and blindness among Americans older than 40 years (<LINK REF="REF-EDPRG-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">EDPRG 2004a</LINK>). Similar findings have been reported for older Americans over the age of 75 years (<LINK REF="REF-Desai-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 2001</LINK>) and from other epidemiologic studies from Western Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Buch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grey-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grey 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krumpaszky-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krumpaszky 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Globally, diabetes mellitus is a significant public health problem. Some estimates predict that the worldwide prevalence of diabetes will exceed 366 million people by 2030 (<LINK REF="REF-Wild-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wild 2004</LINK>). Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication among individuals with diabetes and an important cause of loss of vision (<LINK REF="REF-Sivaprasad-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sivaprasad 2012</LINK>). A diabetic individual has a three-fold increased risk of blindness compared with the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Hayward-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayward 2002</LINK>). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 25.8 million people in the US were living with diabetes in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2011</LINK>). In the US alone, it is estimated that 4.1 million adults over the age of 40 have diabetic retinopathy (any level of severity) and that 899,000 adults have vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (<LINK REF="REF-EDPRG-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">EDPRG 2004b</LINK>). Among Americans with type 1 diabetes, the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy of any severity is 74.9% and 82.3% in black and white persons respectively; the prevalence of vision-threatening (severe non-proliferative and proliferative) retinopathy is 30% and 32.2% (<LINK REF="REF-EDPRG-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">EDPRG 2004c</LINK>). The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy among type 1 and type 2 diabetics in Wales recently was reported to be 56% and 30.3%, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2014</LINK>). People with impaired visual acuity or legal blindness secondary to diabetic retinopathy face enormous challenges in pursuing activities of daily life. Visual impairment is defined as best-corrected visual acuity worse than 20/40 in the better-seeing eye; blindness is defined as best-corrected visual acuity of 20/200 or worse in the better-seeing eye as measured on the original Bailey-Lovie or modified Bailey-Lovie (also known as the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)) visual acuity chart or other charts that use a logMAR scale.</P>
<P>The duration of diabetes and the severity of hyperglycemia are major risk factors associated with the development (incidence) and progression of diabetic retinopathy (<LINK REF="REF-DCCT-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">DCCT 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DRS10-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">DRS10 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ETDRS18-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ETDRS18 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harris-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1984a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1984a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1984b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1984b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krakoff-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krakoff 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kullberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kullberg 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leske-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leske 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Porta-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porta 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKPDS33-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS33 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Leiden-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Leiden 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2001</LINK>). After retinopathy develops, persistent hyperglycemia has been reported to be a more important factor than duration of diabetes for progression of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-ETDRS18-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ETDRS18 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Giuffre-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giuffre 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (<LINK REF="STD-DCCT" TYPE="STUDY">DCCT</LINK>) and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) demonstrated lower incidence and slower progression of diabetic retinopathy with tight blood glucose control (<LINK REF="REF-DCCT-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">DCCT 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKPDS33-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS33 1998</LINK>). The Diabetic Retinopathy Study (<LINK REF="REF-DRS2-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">DRS2 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DRS5-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">DRS5 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DRS8-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">DRS8 1981</LINK>) and the ETDRS (<LINK REF="REF-ETDRS1-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">ETDRS1 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ETDRS9-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">ETDRS9 1991</LINK>) demonstrated a decrease in the progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema with more than 1200 applications of 'pan-retinal' (for proliferative retinopathy) or with 'focal' (for macular edema) laser photocoagulation. However, the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy observed in recent epidemiologic studies (<LINK REF="REF-EDPRG-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">EDPRG 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EDPRG-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">EDPRG 2004c</LINK>) conducted after the <LINK REF="STD-DCCT" TYPE="STUDY">DCCT</LINK> and UKPDS continued to be high. Recently, investigators participating in trials conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCRnet) have reported that other treatments, either alone or combined with laser treatment, can slow progression of diabetic retinopathy (<LINK REF="REF-DRCR.net-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">DRCR.net 2010</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Diabetic retinopathy progresses sequentially from a mild non-proliferative stage to a severe proliferative disorder. Increased retinal vascular permeability occurs early, at the stage of mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). Moderate and severe NPDR are characterized by vascular closure, which results in impaired retinal perfusion (ischemia).</P>
<P>Diabetic retinopathy typically is diagnosed during ophthalmoscopy. Fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms may be used to monitor progression. Signs of NPDR include microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, and occasional 'cotton wool spots' caused by closure of small retinal arterioles, resulting in localized ischemia and edema, with consequent damage to nerve fibers leading to reduced axonal transport. Signs of increasing ischemia include extensive intraretinal hemorrhages, venous abnormalities such as wide variations in caliber ('beading') and looping ('reduplication'), capillary non-perfusion, and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities. Severe NPDR, also known as pre-proliferative retinopathy, is diagnosed when these changes progress to pre-defined thresholds.</P>
<P>Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is characterized by neovascularization, which is the growth of abnormal blood vessels in response to severe ischemia. The new vessels grow into the vitreous and often are seen at the optic disc (NVD) and elsewhere in the retina (NVE); they are prone to bleeding, which results in vitreous hemorrhage and vision loss. Furthermore, these vessels may undergo fibrosis and contraction and, along with other fibrous proliferation, may lead to epiretinal membrane formation, vitreoretinal traction bands, retinal tears, and either tractional or rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (that is, those due to a retinal hole or tear). It is said that proliferative diabetic retinopathy is at the high-risk stage when NVE that occupy a total area of 0.5 optic disc area or more in size throughout the retina are accompanied by pre-retinal or vitreous hemorrhage, or when NVD occupy an area greater than or equal to about one-third disc area, even in the absence of vitreous hemorrhage, or when NVD of any size are accompanied by vitreous hemorrhage. People in the 'high risk' stage of PDR who do not receive prompt pan-retinal laser treatment have a 30% to 50% probability of progressing to severe visual acuity loss and blindness (less than 5/200 best-corrected visual acuity) in three years (<LINK REF="REF-DRS8-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">DRS8 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ETDRS10-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">ETDRS10 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ETDRS12-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">ETDRS12 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Increased retinal vascular permeability, which can occur at any stage of diabetic retinopathy, may result in retinal thickening (edema) and lipid deposits (hard exudates). Retinal thickening, hard exudates, or both that occur at or within 500 microns (approximately one-third an optic disc diameter) of the center of the macula, and which therefore threaten, or actually cause, loss of central visual acuity, are referred to as clinically significant macular edema.</P>
<P>The major reasons for vision loss in diabetic retinopathy include macular edema, macular capillary non-perfusion (which can be demonstrated by fluorescein angiography), vitreous hemorrhage, distortion or tractional detachment of the retina (<LINK REF="REF-PPP-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">PPP 2012</LINK>), and neovascular glaucoma (new blood vessels in the iris), which usually is associated with very late-stage PDR (<LINK REF="REF-Fong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fong 2004</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Pathogenesis</HEADING>
<P>Several biochemical pathways have been investigated for the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. Apart from the well-documented role of chronic hyperglycemia, none of the other biochemical pathways has been shown conclusively to be relevant (<LINK REF="REF-Frank-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frank 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the exact mechanism for the pathogenesis of hypertensive damage in eyes with diabetic retinopathy is unknown, scientists have hypothesized that an increase in blood pressure damages the retinal capillary endothelial cells (<LINK REF="REF-Klein-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 2002a</LINK>). In eyes with diabetic retinopathy, chronic hyperglycemia leads to endothelial cell damage, pericyte loss, and breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier. Such changes to the structure of the microvasculature lead to dysregulation of retinal perfusion, thereby making eyes with diabetic retinopathy more susceptible to hyperperfusion damage from hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Gillow-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillow 1999</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-01-06 14:36:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The current standard of care for the prevention and treatment of diabetic retinopathy consists of strict glycemic control and regular ophthalmologic screening for diabetic retinopathy among diabetics, the use of focal laser treatment or intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections for diabetic macular edema, and the use of pan-retinal scatter laser photocoagulation for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Virgili-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Virgili 2014</LINK>). Strict blood pressure control has been recommended as part of the standard of care for diabetics, primarily because of its known beneficial effect on the prevention of cardiovascular events, stroke, and nephropathy, rather than for its effect on diabetic retinopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Hansson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HOPESI-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">HOPESI 2000</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-12-19 14:17:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Blood pressure control may be beneficial in preventing the development or slowing the progression of diabetic retinopathy by reducing the damage to endothelial cells, blood vessels, and surrounding tissues from hyperperfusion. Diabetic retinopathy leads to endothelial cell dysfunction, loss of pericytes, and breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier. Hypertension may cause additional vascular damage because of shearing that occurs with hyperperfusion. Blood pressure control may prevent hyperperfusion and decrease the likelihood of shearing damage to the blood vessels from hypertension.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-01-21 17:18:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Diabetic retinopathy remains an important cause of vision loss even with good blood glucose control (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferris-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferris 1993</LINK>). At the end of the <LINK REF="STD-DCCT" TYPE="STUDY">DCCT</LINK>, with participant follow-up of 6.5 ± 1.6 years (mean ± standard error), 10% of type 1 diabetic patients in the intensive glycemic control group had developed diabetic retinopathy despite strict glycemic control (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2001</LINK>). Similarly, in the UKPDS, tight blood glucose control decreased but did not eliminate the risk of diabetic retinopathy (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS33-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS33 1998</LINK>). Diabetic retinopathy is a substantial public health problem (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2010</LINK>). Because studies of retinal physiology suggest a role for blood pressure in pathological changes in diabetic retinopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Sj_x00f8_lie-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sjølie 2011</LINK>), a systematic review of the effectiveness of blood pressure control with respect to diabetic retinopathy is warranted (<LINK REF="REF-Sleilati-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleilati 2009</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study design and sample size</HEADING>
<P>A majority of included trials were multicenter, with participants enrolled in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Trials varied in size; the largest trial randomized 2130 participants (<LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK>); the smallest randomized 16 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Chase" TYPE="STUDY">Chase</LINK>). In total, 4157 type 1 and 9512 type 2 diabetics were randomized in the included trials. Among the trial participants, 4036 type 1 and 8251 type 2 diabetics had baseline ophthalmic evaluations (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Most trials reported diabetic retinopathy outcomes only for participants who had both baseline and follow-up photographs. Two trials reported findings from randomized participants at a subset of participating centers where baseline and follow-up retinal examinations were performed (<LINK REF="STD-BENEDICT" TYPE="STUDY">BENEDICT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DEMAND" TYPE="STUDY">DEMAND</LINK>); another two trials analyzed a subset of participants randomized in a larger parent study who agreed to participate in additional retinal examinations (<LINK REF="STD-ACCORD-EYE" TYPE="STUDY">ACCORD EYE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK>). Two trials were conducted within the Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes Trial (ABCD), one for initially normotensive participants and one for hypertensive participants. For the purposes of this review, we have labeled the two trials <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (1)</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_2_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (2)</LINK>, respectively. Although conducted within one parent study, <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Prevent-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Prevent 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 1</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-2" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 2</LINK> were designed, published, and analyzed as three RCTs.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study participants</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Type 1 diabetes</HEADING>
<P>Five trials reported data for 4036 type 1 diabetics (<LINK REF="STD-Chase" TYPE="STUDY">Chase</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Prevent-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Prevent 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EUCLID" TYPE="STUDY">EUCLID</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RASS" TYPE="STUDY">RASS</LINK>). Participants in these trials were young (average age about 30 years) and had blood pressure in the normal range at baseline (normotensive). The majority of participants had either no retinopathy, microaneurysms only, or mild non-proliferative retinopathy at baseline. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chase" TYPE="STUDY">Chase</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RASS" TYPE="STUDY">RASS</LINK>) enrolled a few participants with more severe forms of retinopathy at baseline (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Participants in <LINK REF="STD-EUCLID" TYPE="STUDY">EUCLID</LINK> had a lower HbA1c than those in the other four trials (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Type 2 diabetes</HEADING>
<P>Ten trials reported data for 8251 type 2 diabetics. The average age of participants in these trials ranged from 51 to 66 years. Four trials reported findings for 3683 type 2 diabetics who were either normotensive or hypertensive with adequately controlled blood pressures at baseline (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (1)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ACCORD-EYE" TYPE="STUDY">ACCORD EYE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-2" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pradhan" TYPE="STUDY">Pradhan</LINK>). Six trials reported findings for 4568 type 2 diabetics with hypertension at baseline (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_2_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (2)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BENEDICT" TYPE="STUDY">BENEDICT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DEMAND" TYPE="STUDY">DEMAND</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>). In addition to differences in blood pressure, other variations with respect to baseline retinopathy status, history of cardiovascular disease, and other participant characteristics were observed between normotensive or treated hypertensive and hypertensive type 2 diabetics (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study interventions</HEADING>
<P>Ten trials compared anti-hypertensive medication to placebo or no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BENEDICT" TYPE="STUDY">BENEDICT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chase" TYPE="STUDY">Chase</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DEMAND" TYPE="STUDY">DEMAND</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Prevent-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Prevent 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-2" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EUCLID" TYPE="STUDY">EUCLID</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pradhan" TYPE="STUDY">Pradhan</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RASS" TYPE="STUDY">RASS</LINK>). One trial incorporated lifestyle modification in addition to anti-hypertensive medications (<LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK>). Different anti-hypertensive interventions and different anti-hypertensive agents were evaluated within included trials. In three trials (<LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (1)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_2_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (2)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>), the same anti-hypertensive medications were administered to each treatment arm, but different blood pressure targets were specified for each arm. In three trials (<LINK REF="STD-ACCORD-EYE" TYPE="STUDY">ACCORD EYE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>), participants were randomized to different blood glucose control strategies in addition to blood pressure control strategies. In five trials, outcomes following assignment to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) were compared with outcomes following assignment to calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, or a combination of an agent with an ACEi (<LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (1)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_2_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (2)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BENEDICT" TYPE="STUDY">BENEDICT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DEMAND" TYPE="STUDY">DEMAND</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RASS" TYPE="STUDY">RASS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five trials reported additional variation in the trial interventions, such as anti-hypertensive medications that could be added at the discretion of the treating clinicians (<LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (1)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BENEDICT" TYPE="STUDY">BENEDICT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DEMAND" TYPE="STUDY">DEMAND</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy</HEADING>
<P>Of the 15 included RCTs, nine trials used either the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) final 11-step scale or a modification of it in which the most severe levels of retinopathy were combined into a single category to create an 8- or 6-step scale to describe diabetic retinopathy. Two trials used the EURODIAB 5-step scale. Two trials used a condensed version of the ETDRS final scale. The remaining trials did not specify the grading scale used (<LINK REF="STD-DEMAND" TYPE="STUDY">DEMAND</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pradhan" TYPE="STUDY">Pradhan</LINK>).</P>
<P>The investigators of four trials reported the incidence of diabetic retinopathy as a 2-step or greater progression on the ETDRS scale from no retinopathy or microaneurysms only at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (1)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Prevent-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Prevent 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>). One trial defined incidence as a 1-step progression on the EURODIAB scale (<LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK>) and another as a 2-step progression on the same scale (<LINK REF="STD-EUCLID" TYPE="STUDY">EUCLID</LINK>). In all six trials, the definition of incidence equated to development of mild non-proliferative (or more severe) diabetic retinopathy. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-DEMAND" TYPE="STUDY">DEMAND</LINK>) did not describe criteria for incident diabetic retinopathy. Among the four trials that used the ETDRS scale to evaluate progression of diabetic retinopathy, the investigators of two trials reported a 3-step change (<LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-2" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 2</LINK>); the investigators of the other two trials reported a 2-step change (<LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Chase" TYPE="STUDY">Chase</LINK> reported individual participant data from which changes of 1 to 6 steps could be derived.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (1)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_2_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (2)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-ACCORD-EYE" TYPE="STUDY">ACCORD EYE</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-EUCLID" TYPE="STUDY">EUCLID</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-RASS" TYPE="STUDY">RASS</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK> investigators reported only a composite end-point of incidence and progression of retinopathy.</P>
<P>The protocol for the <LINK REF="STD-BENEDICT" TYPE="STUDY">BENEDICT</LINK> trial described progression of retinopathy as the outcome of interest, but the publication of trial findings omitted that protocol-specified outcome and instead introduced a new outcome, regression of retinopathy.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Visual acuity</HEADING>
<P>Only two included trials reported change of visual acuity from baseline as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-ACCORD-EYE" TYPE="STUDY">ACCORD EYE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>). Both trials reported change as three or more logMAR units (lines on a logMAR visual acuity chart). <LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK> reported incident blindness. <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK> investigators reported blindness as an adverse event.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or clinically significant macular edema (CSME)</HEADING>
<P>The investigators of six trials reported the incidence of PDR or CSME (<LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-2" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RASS" TYPE="STUDY">RASS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>).

Seven trials were conducted with partial support from industry and additional support from governmental agencies and foundations (<LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (1)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_2_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (2)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ACCORD-EYE" TYPE="STUDY">ACCORD EYE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chase" TYPE="STUDY">Chase</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RASS" TYPE="STUDY">RASS</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>). Partial support from industry was either in the form of study drugs and supplies, support for conducting specific analyses, or unspecified. Two trials were conducted with support from governmental agencies and institutions with which the investigators were affiliated (<LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pradhan" TYPE="STUDY">Pradhan</LINK>). Although the main trial for <LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK> was sponsored by a pharmaceutical company, the substudy of ocular outcomes was reported to have been investigator-initiated and supported by the investigator-affiliated institution and a government agency.</P>

<P>We provide the primary reasons for excluding each of the 23 studies selected during initial screening in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table. We excluded 13 RCTs of blood pressure control in 3788 people with diabetes because no data were available for diabetic retinopathy outcomes. We contacted trial investigators who were first authors of primary reports from the 13 trials to ascertain whether retinopathy outcomes were available. None of the 11 respondents provided data because diabetic retinopathy outcomes had not been evaluated in the trials; investigators of two studies did not respond.

We judged allocation concealment methods to provide low risk of bias for 10 trials that employed methods such as assignments made by a central coordinating center; unclear risk of bias for four trials that did not report random allocation method (<LINK REF="STD-BENEDICT" TYPE="STUDY">BENEDICT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chase" TYPE="STUDY">Chase</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pradhan" TYPE="STUDY">Pradhan</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RASS" TYPE="STUDY">RASS</LINK>); and high risk of bias for one trial that did not describe an allocation concealment method and did not mask treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Masking (performance bias and detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>The descriptions of 12 of the 14 trials in which the primary outcome for this review was reported indicated that the diabetic retinopathy outcome assessors were masked to the assigned treatment. We judged these 12 trials to be at low risk and the other two trials to be at unclear risk of performance and detection biases for retinopathy outcomes (Figure 2). Of the eight trials that reported information about secondary outcomes, we judged five trials to have low risk of performance and detection biases based on proper methods of masking (<LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-2" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EUCLID" TYPE="STUDY">EUCLID</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RASS" TYPE="STUDY">RASS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK>); one trial to have high risk due to lack of masking for visual acuity assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Pradhan" TYPE="STUDY">Pradhan</LINK>); and the remaining two trials to have unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-ACCORD-EYE" TYPE="STUDY">ACCORD EYE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>).</P>

Similarly, the estimated effects for the 1659 trial participants who were normotensive or under treatment for hypertension at the time of enrollment and the 1394 trial participants who were hypertensive, all of whom were type 2 diabetics, are consistent with the overall estimates for the 4- to 5-year period (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>: 0.84 (0.73 to 0.98) for normotensives/treated hypertensives and 0.72 (0.56 to 0.93) for hypertensives).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Progression of retinopathy</HEADING>
<P>Four trials reported progression of retinopathy among patients in whom retinopathy already was present at time of trial enrollment among 1905 type 1 diabetics (<LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 1</LINK>) and among 2684 type 2 diabetics (<LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-2" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>). The estimated overall RR for progression during this period was 0.88 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.05), suggesting a possible 12% reduction in progression as a result of intervention on blood pressure (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). However, the CI on the estimated overall RR and for the RRs estimated for three of the four trials are consistent with no effect on progression of diabetic retinopathy as a result of blood pressure intervention. Four trials reported data for this outcome during 1.5 to 2 years: <LINK REF="STD-Chase" TYPE="STUDY">Chase</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-2" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 2</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>. The estimated RR was 1.08 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.31), indicating no benefit of blood pressure intervention on the risk of progression during this shorter period (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>A beneficial effect of blood pressure intervention on progression of diabetic retinopathy was suggested only for type 2 diabetics (estimated RR 0.81 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.01)) who accounted for more than two-thirds of the total number of trial participants for whom this outcome was reported at 4 to 5 years (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). However, the upper limit of the CI is consistent with no benefit of blood pressure intervention among type 2 diabetics. Among trial participants for whom progression was reported for 1.5 to 2 years (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>), blood pressure intervention was not beneficial in either type 1 or type 2 diabetics during this shorter period (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). The findings for subgroups defined by blood pressure at baseline were consistent with overall findings (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>); a beneficial effect of blood pressure intervention was not supported for either participants who were normotensive or treated hypertensives at baseline (estimated RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.09)) or who were hypertensive (estimated RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.51 to 1.06)) because both CIs include 1.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Combined incidence and progression of retinopathy</HEADING>
<P>Reports from six RCTs contained data regarding 4- to 5-year rates of combined incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy from baseline (<LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (1)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_2_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (2)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-ACCORD-EYE" TYPE="STUDY">ACCORD EYE</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-DEMAND" TYPE="STUDY">DEMAND</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-RASS" TYPE="STUDY">RASS</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK>); however, only five of the trials reported data in a form that could be used in a meta-analysis.The effect of intervention on blood pressure for this combined outcome (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) has an estimated RR of 0.78 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.97), supporting a reduction of 22% with blood pressure intervention despite heterogeneity among the trials. The estimated effect from <LINK REF="STD-ACCORD-EYE" TYPE="STUDY">ACCORD EYE</LINK> favors less intensive intervention on blood pressure, but the evidence from the remaining trials supports more intensive intervention. Investigators from two trials (<LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (1)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-EUCLID" TYPE="STUDY">EUCLID</LINK>) reported this outcome for participants treated and followed for 1.5 to 2 years; the estimated RR was 0.54 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.98) during this shorter period (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-DEMAND" TYPE="STUDY">DEMAND</LINK> investigators reported a hazard ratio of 0.27 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.99) over 4 years for this outcome.</P>
<P>Findings from trials for type 1 diabetics were statistically heterogeneous, with an I<SUP>2</SUP> value of 60%, largely due to the difference between the effect estimated for <LINK REF="STD-ACCORD-EYE" TYPE="STUDY">ACCORD EYE</LINK> compared with the other three trials. As a result, the CI on the summary RR estimated for type 1 diabetics included 1 (estimated RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.03)). For subgroups based on blood pressure status at baseline, the evidence did not support a beneficial effect of blood pressure among either baseline hypertensives (estimated RR 0.72 (95% CI 0.48 to 1.08)) or baseline normotensives or hypertensives controlled by treatment (estimated RR 0.81 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.16)), although the effect estimates for both subgroups favored blood pressure control (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). Findings were heterogeneous in both subgroups, with I<SUP>2</SUP> values of 73% and 62% for the subgroups and 60% for the overall estimate.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Incidence of PDR and CSME</HEADING>
<P>Data regarding the incidence of PDR or CSME during a 4- to 5-year period were available from six trials (<LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-2" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RASS" TYPE="STUDY">RASS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>). These outcomes typically were reported together because the presence of either one indicated the need for laser photocoagulation or some other treatment. There was no evidence of a beneficial effect of blood pressure intervention on this outcome: estimated RR 0.95 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.09). During 1.5- to 2-year treatment and follow-up of baseline normotensive or treated hypertensive type 1 diabetics enrolled in <LINK REF="STD-Chase" TYPE="STUDY">Chase</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-EUCLID" TYPE="STUDY">EUCLID</LINK>, the evidence favored blood pressure intervention to reduce the incidence of PDR, but the CI was wide and included 1: estimated RR 0.58 (95% CI 0.04 to 9.07). Furthermore, the direction of the effect differed in the two studies, as noted by I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 64%. These two studies did not report the incidence of CSME.</P>
<P>Blood pressure intervention was not beneficial for reducing 4- to 5-year incidence of PDR and CSME among either type 1 or type 2 diabetics (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) or for participants who were normotensive at baseline or whose hypertension was controlled at baseline (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>); all CIs included 1. There was a suggestion of benefit among baseline hypertensives: estimated RR 0.76 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.02); the estimated effect differed from that for normotensives/treated hypertensives: estimated RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.16) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>. The available evidence thus supports no benefit to intervention on blood pressure with respect to incidence of PDR or CSME during a 4- to 5-year period of treatment and follow-up, except possibly among hypertensive type 2 diabetics (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two trials, <LINK REF="STD-ACCORD-EYE" TYPE="STUDY">ACCORD EYE</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>, reported visual acuity loss of 3 or more lines from baseline levels during 4 to 5 years of blood pressure intervention; participants in both trials had type 2 diabetes. The estimated RR was 1.06 and the 95% CI was 0.85 to 1.33. No evidence of a beneficial effect of the intervention was found in either trial with respect to prevention of moderate or severe loss of visual acuity, defined as loss of 3 or more lines on a chart with a logMAR scale.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Summary</HEADING>
<P>Available evidence from randomized trials for both short-term (1.5 to 2 years) and long-term (4 to 5 years) intervention on blood pressure support a beneficial effect on incidence of diabetic retinopathy in comparison to no or less intervention on blood pressure, with an estimated reduction in incidence of 20%. This effect was consistent across type 1 and type 2 diabetics and among both trial participants who were hypertensive and those who were normotensive or whose hypertension was controlled by treatment at time of trial enrollment.</P>
<P>Overall findings for 4 to 5 years suggest a possible 12% reduction in the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy with blood pressure control among RCT participants with retinopathy at baseline, but we did not observe a benefit early or among type 1 diabetics, all of whom were normotensives at baseline, nor among all participants who were normotensives or controlled hypertensives initially.</P>
<P>The RRs estimated for the combined outcome of incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy are similar to those for incidence during 4 to 5 years, both overall and among type 1 diabetics and trial participants who were normotensive or under treatment for hypertension initially, consistent with a reduction in the risk of this outcome with blood pressure intervention of about 20%. A larger benefit was estimated for hypertensive participants, all of whom were type 2 diabetics (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>We did not find a benefit for intervention on blood pressure with respect to incidence of PDR or CSME or for moderate or more severe loss of visual acuity, either overall or within any major subgroup of participants examined.</P>
<P>In order to examine further the possible small benefit of more intensive blood pressure intervention among type 2 diabetics, we analyzed outcomes by whether these participants were normotensives/treated hypertensives at baseline or were hypertensives. As shown in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>, only among hypertensive type 2 diabetics did the estimated RRs favor intensive blood pressure control on both incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy, whether considered as individual outcomes or in combination. Furthermore, the evidence was also consistent with a benefit of intensive blood pressure control on progression to PDR or CSME and death from all causes among participants in this subgroup (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Quality of life (QOL)</HEADING>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK> investigators reported a cross-sectional QOL assessment conducted at eight centers (<LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK> report 37). A subset of participants completed a "domain specific" questionnaire (n = 636) and/or the EQ-5D questionnaire (n = 747) at mean times since randomization to tight or less tight blood pressure control of 5 and 8 years, respectively.. Of the specific measures (work satisfaction, mood state, symptoms, cognitive mistakes), median scores for the tight blood pressure control group differed from those of the less tight control group by 1 or 2 points for anger, symptoms, and both patient- and relative-reported cognitive mistakes; however, interquartile ranges were similar. Total scores on the mood state scale differed by 3.5 points, with the tight control group having better score. However, the authors reported that the difference was not statistically significant; this statement was supported by substantial overlap of the confidence intervals. With respect to the EQ-5D scale, scores in the two groups were similar except for the anxiety dimension, for which respondents in the tight blood pressure control group had worse scores (P &lt; 0.05). Within the tight blood glucose control arm, scores for respondents assigned to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) were compared to scores of those assigned to a beta-blocker. The authors stated that "a lower proportion of patients who were allocated to &#946;-blockers reported anxiety, on the generic questionnaire, than those allocated to ACE inhibitors (28% vs. 40%, Fisher's exact test, P = 0.010)."</P>
<P>The ACCORD Study Group reported the rationale and design of health-related QOL and cost-effectiveness components, but we did not find any published data after an intensive search and queries to <LINK REF="STD-ACCORD-EYE" TYPE="STUDY">ACCORD EYE</LINK> investigators.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Cost-effectiveness</HEADING>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK> investigators evaluated the cost-effectiveness of tight blood pressure control in participants with hypertension and type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK> reports 40 and 63). The trial investigators performed an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis in which they calculated the net costs and net effectiveness of tight control versus less tight control based on outcome data from their trial. Costs included treatment fees for blood pressure control, visits to doctors at diabetes centers, tests obtained at medical visits, and the costs of treating diabetic complications. Investigators estimated that the total costs for less tight blood pressure control was GBP6145 per patient over an 8.4-year period compared to GBP6381 per patient with tight control, which represented a difference of GBP237. Although there was a higher cost of anti-hypertensive treatment in the tight blood pressure control group than in the less tight control group, the analysis based on <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK> data indicated that this increment was offset by reduced complication costs, longer survival, and greater interval without complications in the tight blood pressure control group than in the less tight blood pressure control group. The value of this finding is limited by the outdated definitions of hypertension and its control that were used by the UKPDS investigators.</P>
<P>The UKPDS investigators also compared the cost-effectiveness of an ACE inhibitor (captopril) to a beta-blocker (atenolol) (<LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK> 54). Although the two agents used to treat hypertensive type 2 diabetics were found to have similar effects, atenolol was associated with lower overall costs due to lower drug costs and fewer and shorter hospitalizations.</P>
<P>Data from the <LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK> study were used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of intensive versus conventional multifactorial interventions in type 2 diabetics. However, the cost of photography, ophthalmologic examinations, or other clinical procedures were not considered part of the "annual cost of consultation" (<LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK>). Similarly, blindness or impaired visual acuity were not included under complications, and neither photocoagulation, vitrectomy, nor other interventions for diabetic retinopathy were included in the model.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Reporting of adverse events associated with blood pressure control was inconsistent in the included trials. The most frequently reported adverse event for participants in the included trials was death from all causes, reported from seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (1)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_2_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (2)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DEMAND" TYPE="STUDY">DEMAND</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Prevent-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Prevent 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-2" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK>). As shown in <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>, the estimated RR for this adverse outcome was 0.86 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.14), indicating no important difference due to intervention on blood pressure. The effect of blood pressure intervention on deaths from all causes was similar among type 1 diabetics (estimated RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.50 to 2.29)) and type 2 diabetics (estimated RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.12)); <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). However, the effect for trial participants who were hypertensive at baseline is consistent with a substantial reduction in mortality: estimated RR 0.51 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.89).</P>
<P>Three trials reported hypotension (<LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Prevent-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Prevent 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK>). As expected and shown in <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>, significantly more hypotension was reported among participants in the trial arm in which there was more intense intervention on blood pressure: estimated RR 2.08 (95% CI 1.68 to 2.57). The findings were similar among type 1 diabetics (<LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Prevent-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Prevent 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 1</LINK>) and type 2 diabetics (<LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK> investigators reported the only ocular complications we could find for the included trials. The <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK> investigators reported blindness among 18 of 758 versus 12 of 390; vitreous hemorrhage among 3 of 758 versus 2 of 390; and cataract surgery among 36 of 758 versus 14 of 390 participants in the tight blood pressure control arm and less tight control arm, respectively. <LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK> investigators reported blindness, defined as Snellen chart visual acuity of 6/60 or worse by the World Health Organization criteria, in one eye for 1 of 80 participants in the intensive group and 7 of 80 participants in the standard group (estimated RR 0.14 (95% CI 0.02 to 1.13)).</P>
<P>A major difficulty we encountered in our efforts to identify adverse events of blood pressure intervention was attributable to the fact that many of the included trials were ancillary to a larger parent study (<LINK REF="STD-ACCORD-EYE" TYPE="STUDY">ACCORD EYE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RASS" TYPE="STUDY">RASS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>), and that the adverse events reported were the cardiovascular or renal events that were the outcomes of the parent trial. Another difficulty was that participants in several trials were also randomized to concurrent intervention, primarily on blood glucose as in <LINK REF="STD-ACCORD-EYE" TYPE="STUDY">ACCORD EYE</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>, but also on lipids as in <LINK REF="STD-RASS" TYPE="STUDY">RASS</LINK>.</P>

The trial identifiers, test anti-hypertensive medication compared to an ACEi, outcome for which the medications were compared, and the relative effectiveness of the test medication are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>. Another class of anti-hypertensive agent was compared to an ACEi within more than one trial for only one outcome, combined incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy over 4 to 5 years.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-21 18:29:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found 15 randomized controlled trials that had evaluated the use of blood pressure-lowering interventions in participants with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes and that reported diabetic retinopathy outcomes. There was considerable variability among the trials with respect to sample size, interventions evaluated, eligibility criteria, diabetic retinopathy outcomes reported, and length of follow-up of participants. Among the six trials that reported the incidence of diabetic retinopathy among 3053 participants, findings supported intensive blood pressure intervention among both type 1 diabetics (one trial) and type 2 diabetics (five trials). The evidence yielded an estimated 20% reduction in the risk of incident retinopathy with intensive intervention compared to no or less intense intervention on blood pressure. Data regarding progression of retinopathy were reported from four trials in which 4195 diabetics had participated. Although some statistical heterogeneity, as well as clinical and methodologic heterogeneity, was observed among the findings from the four trials, overall the evidence indicated no benefit, or at best a small benefit, of more intense intervention on blood pressure with respect to progression of diabetic retinopathy. Findings from the five trials that reported only combined incidence and progression of retinopathy were similar to those for incidence alone: approximately a 20% reduction in risk with more intense intervention on blood pressure. However, there was substantial statistical heterogeneity among the effect estimated from individual trials that reported this outcome. Six trials with a total of 6573 participants reported data regarding incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy or clinically significant macular edema, or both, and two trials (2326 total participants) reported moderate to severe loss of visual acuity. Neither the findings for incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy nor for clinically significant macular edema favored intense blood pressure intervention; the findings were consistent within subgroups of participants defined by type of diabetes and by blood pressure status at time of trial enrollment.</P>
<P>Although evidence from four trials supports intensive control of blood pressure to reduce the risk of incident diabetic retinopathy, and evidence from five trials that reported only a combined outcome for incidence and progression provide similar support, only among the 3816 type 2 diabetics who were hypertensive at baseline and participated in the included trials does the evidence provide consistent support for a benefit of intensive blood pressure control with respect to progression, including progression to retinopathy that requires laser photocoagulation or another intervention. The evidence favoring tight blood pressure control may thus not be sufficient to convince all diabetic patients and their physicians of the beneficial effect of blood pressure control on retinopathy outcomes.</P>
<P>The investigators of the clinical trials included in this review did not report systematically on adverse events related to tight blood pressure control. Therefore, the incidence of serious adverse events, both systemic and ocular, associated with the use of anti-hypertensive medications in the diabetic population, cannot be estimated reliably from the data provided by the included trials.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-01-21 18:32:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although we limited this review to consideration of findings reported from RCTs, the included trials differed from one another in several important respects. In recognition of these differences, we must consider a number of points when interpreting the available evidence.</P>
<P>1. Baseline laboratory data differed in the participant cohorts that participated in the various trials (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). In particular, in both the <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (1)</LINK> trial and the <LINK REF="STD-Pradhan" TYPE="STUDY">Pradhan</LINK> trial, baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values were quite high, approximately 11% in the intensively treated and control groups. In the other studies, HbA1c values were approximately 8% or lower (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Although the target of intervention in these studies was blood pressure, the separate influence of blood glucose, which differed in the various studies, may have had a greater effect on the retinopathy outcome.</P>
<P>2. Clinical centers in these trials were established in numerous geographic locations. For example, <LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK> was carried out in 20 countries, and the Diabetic Retinopathy Candesartan Trials (DIRECT) program had centers in 30 countries. While this dispersion surely resulted in considerable ethnic and genetic variation among the participants, specific racial or ethnic distribution was not reported in the description of any of the study cohorts. Centers in India and China participated in <LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK>, and centers in South Africa participated in the DIRECT trials. Although <LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK> reported a comparison of retinal lesions at baseline among white and Asian participants, none of the trials provided data to suggest that diabetic individuals from different racial or ethnic groups differed in their responses to blood pressure control with respect to the development or progression of retinopathy or to adverse events.</P>
<P>3. Trials varied widely in size, from as few as 16 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Chase" TYPE="STUDY">Chase</LINK>) to more than 2000 (<LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK>). The data reporting thus ranged from a listing of individual participant data to outcome rates estimated using statistical models. Not surprisingly, rates of incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy sometimes were not reported in a form amenable to the methods of analysis suitable for a systematic review using grouped data.</P>
<P>4. Although most trials used the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) or the EURODIAB scale for grading retinopathy, the different trials had different definitions for progression of diabetic retinopathy (from one to three steps on a scale, counting progression in one or both eyes). Only 5 of the 15 trials clearly distinguished participants without retinopathy at baseline, in whom incidence could be assessed, from those with retinopathy detected at baseline. It is possible that the effect of hypertension or its control varies with the level of severity of retinopathy initially present or that is being considered as the end point.</P>
<P>5. The blood pressure goals of several of the trials included in this review do not reflect current practice. For example, in <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>, the tight blood pressure control group aimed for a blood pressure less than 150/85 mm Hg, with the less tight control group aiming for a blood pressure of 180/105 mm Hg or less. However, in the ACCORD blood pressure intervention trial (<LINK REF="REF-Cushman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cushman 2007</LINK>), the goal for the less intensive control group was a systolic blood pressure less than 140 mm Hg, and for the intensive control group the goal was less than 120 mm Hg.</P>

<P>1. Most studies evaluated the presence and severity of retinopathy using standard photographic protocols that provided objective documentation of the status of the retina, evaluation by observers masked to treatment status of participants, and reproducible evaluation by separate graders when necessary. In <LINK REF="STD-EUCLID" TYPE="STUDY">EUCLID</LINK>, there was only a single grader, thus providing no mechanism to check for consistency or reproducibility of the grading.</P>
<P>2. The <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-RASS" TYPE="STUDY">RASS</LINK> did not have a true baseline for assessing diabetic retinopathy. In these studies, "baseline" retinal photographs could have been taken as much as three years before (<LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>) or one year after (<LINK REF="STD-RASS" TYPE="STUDY">RASS</LINK>) randomization to the study arm.</P>
<P>3. Several studies embedded in parent studies with different goals restricted analysis and reporting of retinopathy data to participants who had both baseline and follow-up assessments of retinopathy, without any attempt to impute data for missing assessments or to account for missing data otherwise, so as to provide or estimate outcomes for the full participant population studied. Missing follow-up assessments are common in trials with clinical outcomes, particularly those conducted among participants who are elderly or who have multiple medical problems. No totally satisfactory method has been identified to account for missing clinical outcome data due to deaths of trial participants.</P>
<P>4. Included studies did not employ the same time points for assessment of retinal photographs for retinopathy status. In most studies, photographs were taken only at baseline and a single follow-up time or when needed to document retinal status before treatment.</P>
<P>5. The trials used various strategies for intervening on blood pressure. For this review, we have pooled the data from the more intense strategy in each trial for comparison with the less intense strategy.</P>
<P>6. Attrition was an issue in some trials. Denominators for percentages often were not reported. When we could find sufficient information about deaths and other losses to follow-up, we calculated denominators based on the number of participants enrolled; otherwise, we estimated rates based on the total number randomized.</P>

<P>The protocol for this review did not specify subgroup analyses for participants with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and for participants characterized by blood pressure levels at baseline (<LINK REF="REF-Sleilati-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleilati 2009</LINK>). The decision to examine findings in these subgroups was made after we began screening the results of electronic searches. Our familiarity with diabetic retinopathy and randomized trials for this condition suggested that it would be inappropriate to conduct analyses specified in the protocol without considering effects of blood pressure intervention in these different subgroups of participants. Although we examined the available data for these subgroups, subgroup findings usually were consistent with overall findings.</P>
<P>We searched extensively for all trials that evaluated blood pressure control for diabetic retinopathy in individuals with and without retinopathy at baseline. We included trials where the effect of blood pressure control on diabetic retinopathy was evaluated in a subset of all patients randomized into the study, for example <LINK REF="STD-ACCORD-EYE" TYPE="STUDY">ACCORD EYE</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-RASS" TYPE="STUDY">RASS</LINK>. We excluded 13 trials of blood pressure control in people with diabetes because data regarding diabetic retinopathy outcomes were not available. We designed our searches to identify all trials of blood pressure control in people with diabetes; we screened the resulting listings for any mention of diabetic retinopathy or other ocular findings. In addition, we contacted the authors of reports from trials that suggested that data regarding ocular outcomes might have been available.</P>
<P>Of the 13 trials that reported either incidence or progression (or a combination of incidence and progression) (<LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_1_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (1)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_2_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (2)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ACCORD-EYE" TYPE="STUDY">ACCORD EYE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ADVANCE_x002f_AdRem" TYPE="STUDY">ADVANCE/AdRem</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chase" TYPE="STUDY">Chase</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DEMAND" TYPE="STUDY">DEMAND</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Prevent-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Prevent 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-1" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DIRECT-Protect-2" TYPE="STUDY">DIRECT Protect 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EUCLID" TYPE="STUDY">EUCLID</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-RASS" TYPE="STUDY">RASS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS_x002f_HDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS/HDS</LINK>), six trials reported data for 2-step changes from baseline on the ETDRS final scale or a modification of it that provided comparable data. Three trials reported 3-step changes as progression; in the absence of data for 2-step changes, we analyzed these data together with 2-step changes. Similarly, for the three trials that used more condensed scales for grading diabetic retinopathy, we used the data as reported, that is 1-step or 2-step changes. One trial reported incidence of diabetic retinopathy only as change from no retinopathy to any retinopathy. We elected to pool the available data, reasoning that the same definition was used in trial arms compared within individual RCTs and that the goal was to estimate relative effects of blood pressure intervention rather than absolute risks. Furthermore, some 1-step changes on the condensed grading scales undoubtedly were equivalent to 2-step changes on the more detailed ETDRS scale.</P>
<P>We could not obtain sufficient data from all included trials to incorporate their findings into all our meta-analyses, particularly those for adverse events and complications. Although some large parent studies of which some included RCTs were part have reported adverse events, we usually were not able to identify events among participants in the trials of blood pressure intervention or in the subgroup participating in the retinopathy substudy..</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-01-21 18:39:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Among the outcomes examined for benefit of tight or intensive blood pressure control, only incidence of diabetic retinopathy, reported alone or in combination with progression, has been demonstrated by our analysis of the available evidence to provide benefit regarding retinopathy in either type 1 or type 2 diabetics, irrespective of whether normotensive or hypertensive at baseline based on the classification used by the trial investigators. Available evidence indicates that administration of anti-hypertensive agents does not decrease progression of retinopathy. Furthermore, the evidence regarding the reduction in incidence estimated for intervention on blood pressure is relatively modest. Insufficient evidence is available regarding the adverse effects of interventions to achieve current blood pressure targets to permit comparison of benefits and risks. Some physicians use angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to prevent or delay the development or to slow progression of diabetic nephropathy and anticipate benefit regarding diabetic retinopathy. Physicians should be aware that data on adverse events related to tight blood pressure control in diabetics are sparse; patients on these medications require close monitoring because they may be at risk for serious adverse events.</P>
<P>Our findings should not be interpreted to preclude treatment of hypertension in diabetics; such treatment has been demonstrated to have substantial benefit on survival and other outcomes. However, the currently available evidence does not support blood pressure control for the sole purpose of slowing progression of diabetic retinopathy or for avoiding the need for treatment for advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-12-19 14:17:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Additional randomized controlled trials are needed to define subgroups of type 1 and type 2 diabetics likely to benefit from the use of current anti-hypertensive medications to achieve current blood pressure targets with respect to reduced incidence and progression of retinopathy. If future trials are undertaken, the designers should specify not only the type of diabetics they wish to enroll (type 1 or type 2), but also whether the goal is prevention of diabetic retinopathy (that is only diabetics without retinopathy eligible for enrollment) or slowing progression of existing retinopathy; the blood pressure status of diabetics eligible to participate (normotensive without treatment, hypertensives with blood pressure controlled with treatment, untreated hypertensives); the blood pressure goals of each trial arm; and vision outcomes, which were rarely reported in the current trials. Furthermore, target sample sizes should be large enough to provide precise estimates of outcomes. Although we found data regarding hypotension in reports from only 3 of the 15 included trials, designers of future trials may wish to consider restricting enrollment to diabetics with hypertension to achieve a more favorable benefit-risk comparison in the more intensely treated arm.</P>
<P>The evidence from 15 randomized controlled trials conducted among thousands of diabetics may be interpreted to mean that additional trials designed to address this issue may not be justifiable. It may be more cost-effective to focus on research to explain why blood pressure control affected incidence of retinopathy but not progression, for example, by analyzing individual participant data from completed trials. In the absence of more consistent and convincing data regarding the subgroup of diabetics likely to benefit from intervention on blood pressure, it may be more useful to conduct trials that focus on interventions for other modifiable risk factors for diabetic retinopathy.</P>

<P>"We calculated that a patient-level randomised trial would have required enrolment of 2700 individuals (1350 per treatment group) to detect a 30% reduction in the risk of the primary endpoint at a 5% significance level, and with 90% power. This calculation allowed for 10% loss to follow-up and assumed an event rate in the routine care group of 3% per year, on the basis of the results of the UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group (UKPDS). We expected a minimum effect of clustering within general practice, with the estimated within-cluster correlation coefficient being 0·01. We assumed that the average number of participants per general practice would be 10 and, therefore, the design effect was 1·09. Thus, we inflated the estimated sample size for this cluster trial to 3000 patients in total."</P>
