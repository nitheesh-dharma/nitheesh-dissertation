<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Abstinence-only programs for preventing HIV infection in high-income countries (as defined by the World Bank)</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Abstinence-only programs are widespread and well-funded, particularly in the United States and countries supported by the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. On the premise that sexual abstinence is the best and only way to prevent HIV, abstinence-only interventions aim to prevent, stop, or decrease sexual activity. These programs differ from abstinence-plus designs: abstinence-plus programs promote safer-sex strategies (e.g., condom use) along with sexual abstinence, but abstinence-only programs do not, and instead often highlight the limitations of condom use. An up-to-date review suggests that abstinence-only programs do not affect HIV risk in low-income countries; this review examined the evidence in high-income countries.</P>
<P>This review included thirteen randomized controlled trials comparing abstinence-only programs to various control groups (e.g., "usual care," no intervention). Although we conducted an extensive international search for trials, all included studies enrolled youth in the US (total baseline enrollment=15,940 participants). Programs were conducted in schools, community centers, and family homes; all were delivered in family units or groups of young people. We could not conduct a meta-analysis because of missing data and variation in program designs. However, findings from the individual trials were remarkably consistent.</P>
<P>Overall, the trials did not indicate that abstinence-only programs can reduce HIV risk as indicated by behavioral outcomes (e.g., unprotected vaginal sex) or biological outcomes (e.g., sexually transmitted infection). Instead, the programs consistently had no effect on participants' incidence of unprotected vaginal sex, frequency of vaginal sex, number of sex partners, sexual initiation, or condom use.</P>
<P>One trial favored an abstinence-only program over usual care for incidence of vaginal sex (n=839), but this was limited to two-month follow-up and was offset by measurement error and six other studies with non-significant effects (n=2615).</P>
<P>One evaluation found several significant adverse (harmful) program effects: abstinence-only program participants were more likely than usual-care controls to report sexually transmitted infections (n=2711), pregnancy (n=1548), and increased frequency of vaginal sex (n=338). These effects were offset by high attrition and other studies showing non-significant effects.</P>
<P>We concluded that abstinence-only programs do not appear to reduce or exacerbate HIV risk among participants in high-income countries, although this evidence might not apply beyond US youth. Trial limitations included underreporting of relevant outcomes, reliance on program participants to report their behaviors accurately, and methodological weaknesses in the trials.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Abstinence-only interventions promote sexual abstinence as the only means of preventing sexual acquisition of HIV; they do not promote safer-sex strategies (e.g., condom use). Although abstinence-only programs are widespread, there has been no internationally focused review of their effectiveness for HIV prevention in high-income countries.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of abstinence-only programs for HIV prevention in high-income countries.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched 30 electronic databases (e.g., CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, AIDSLINE, PsycINFO) ending February 2007. Cross-referencing, handsearching, and contacting experts yielded additional citations through April 2007.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials evaluating abstinence-only interventions in high-income countries (defined by the World Bank). Interventions were any efforts to encourage sexual abstinence for HIV prevention; programs that also promoted safer-sex strategies were excluded. Results were biological and behavioral outcomes.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Three reviewers independently appraised 20,070 records and 326 full-text papers for inclusion and methodological quality; 13 evaluations were included. Due to heterogeneity and data unavailability, we presented the results of individual studies instead of conducting a meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Studies involved 15,940 United States youth; participants were ethnically diverse. Seven programs were school-based, two were community-based, and one was delivered in family homes. Median final follow-up occurred 17 months after baseline.</P>
<P>Results showed no indications that abstinence-only programs can reduce HIV risk as indicated by self-reported biological and behavioral outcomes. Compared to various controls, the evaluated programs consistently did not affect incidence of unprotected vaginal sex, frequency of vaginal sex, number of partners, sexual initiation, or condom use. </P>
<P>One study found a significantly protective effect for incidence of recent vaginal sex (n=839), but this was limited to short-term follow-up, countered by measurement error, and offset by six studies with non-significant results (n=2615). </P>
<P>One study found significantly harmful effects for STI incidence (n=2711), pregnancy incidence (n=1548), and frequency of vaginal sex (n=338); these effects were also offset by studies with non-significant findings. </P>
<P>Methodological strengths included large samples, efforts to improve self-report, and analyses controlling for baseline values. Weaknesses included underutilization of relevant outcomes, underreporting of key data, self-report bias, and analyses neglecting attrition and clustered randomization. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Evidence does not indicate that abstinence-only interventions effectively decrease or exacerbate HIV risk among participants in high-income countries; trials suggest that the programs are ineffective, but generalizability may be limited to US youth. Should funding continue, additional resources could support rigorous evaluations with behavioral or biological outcomes. More trials comparing abstinence-only and abstinence-plus interventions are needed.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Although over two decades have passed since the first AIDS diagnosis, an effective and accessible HIV vaccine remains a distant hope. More than 7,600 people died from AIDS-related causes each day in 2005, while an estimated 38.6 million people worldwide were living with HIV (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2006</LINK>). Poverty and structural violence, insufficient prevention efforts, and rapid viral evolution contribute to the spread of this "modern plague" (<LINK REF="REF-Farmer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farmer 2001</LINK>); approximately 4.1 million new infections occurred in 2005 alone (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2006</LINK>). In the absence of a vaccine, HIV prevention programs demand continued attention. <BR/> <BR/>The HIV pandemic is most devastating for middle- and low-income nations, but new infections continue mounting even in countries with many resources for prevention. The World Health Organization estimated in 2004 that 1.6 million people in high-income countries were living with HIV (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2004</LINK>); by 2005, 2.0 million individuals in North America, Western Europe, and Central Europe alone were living with HIV, and 65,000 became newly infected in these three regions (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2006</LINK>). The widespread availability of antiretroviral treatment (ART) allows many individuals in high-income countries to live longer and healthier lives than their counterparts in resource-poor countries, but ART is not a cure. Furthermore, even if ART could eliminate the virus, it would still be desirable to prevent the spread of HIV. Primary prevention efforts are still necessary in high-income countries, particularly among high-risk groups. </P>
<P>High-income economies are defined by the World Bank as those with a gross national income per capita of $10,726 or higher: Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Australia, Austria, the Bahamas, Bahrain, Belgium, Bermuda, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Cayman Islands, Channel Islands, Cyprus, Denmark, Faeroe Islands, Finland, France, French Polynesia, Germany, Greece, Greenland, Guam, Hong Kong (China), Iceland, Ireland, Isle of Man, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea Rep., Kuwait, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macao (China), Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Qatar, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, US Virgin Islands (<LINK REF="REF-World-Bank-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Bank 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sexual behavior outpaces drug injecting as the major cause of HIV infection in many high-income countries. Studies from the United States suggest that over 70% of HIV-positive men and women may remain sexually active, and a substantial percentage continue to engage in unprotected sex (<LINK REF="REF-Crepaz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crepaz 2002</LINK>). The rising prevalence of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as gonorrhea and chlamydia, indicates increased risky sexual behavior in Australia, Western Europe, Japan, and the US. Although sex between men still accounts for most new infections in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Greece, New Zealand, and the US, evidence suggests that heterosexual sex is responsible for an increasing proportion of seroconversions (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2004</LINK>). For example, according to UK figures, heterosexual sex accounted for 66% of all new infections in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-AVERT-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">AVERT 2005</LINK>). Major risk groups vary by region (<LINK REF="REF-Rivers-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivers 2000</LINK>), but evidence suggests that HIV is now disproportionately concentrated among youth, ethnic minorities, women, recent immigrants, and men who have sex with men (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Berry-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berry 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-AVERT-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">AVERT 2005</LINK>). In the current socio-epidemiological climate, primary prevention programs targeting sexual risk behavior are essential for all risk groups. </P>
<P>Description of the intervention<BR/>Various behavioral interventions have proven effective in reducing HIV-risk behaviors in high-income countries, but a number of prevention strategies still require rigorous evaluation. Abstinence-only programs are one such approach. </P>
<P>Abstinence-only programs primarily encourage participants to refrain from sexual activity. They are designed to teach the social, health-related, and psychological benefits of abstaining from sexual activity; at the same time, most programs note the potential harms of sexual activity outside marriage (<LINK REF="REF-Devaney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devaney 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Haskins-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haskins 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Rector-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rector 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Young-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1998</LINK>). They often target family involvement and community norms, as well as individual behaviors, addressing multiple influences on knowledge, attitudes, and values (<LINK REF="REF-Devaney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devaney 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Young-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1998</LINK>). Their theoretical underpinnings include social learning theory, the health-belief model, cognitive-behavioral theory, the theory of social inoculation, the culture of poverty perspective, and utility maximization perspectives (<LINK REF="REF-Devaney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devaney 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2000</LINK>). The interventions encourage both primary abstinence (remaining a virgin) and secondary abstinence (returning to abstinence after sexual activity) (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2000</LINK>). The primary targets of these programs are young people who may not yet have initiated sexual activity. </P>
<P>Unlike abstinence-plus programs, abstinence-only interventions emphasize abstinence as the exclusive means of HIV prevention. If abstinence-only programs discuss contraception or condom use, they generally highlight the limitations of these strategies (Besharov 1997, Brown 1997, HRW 2002). In contrast, abstinence-plus programs promote abstinence as the best HIV prevention option, but also actively promote condom use and other safer-sex strategies. This review is limited to abstinence-only interventions, as a counterpart to an upcoming review of abstinence-plus interventions in high-income countries.</P>
<P>Terminology complicates discussions of abstinence-only programs. Specific definitions of "abstinence" and "sex" differ, and these terms are not always defined clearly (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 2002</LINK>). In a survey of federally funded abstinence-based education programs in all 50 US states, only six program coordinators reported defining "sexual activity" for program purposes (<LINK REF="REF-Sonfield-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonfield 2001</LINK>). "Sex" and "abstinence" also have many definitions among clinicians and the general public (<LINK REF="REF-Haglund-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haglund 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Horan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horan 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Pitts-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitts 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Remez-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Remez 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sanders-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 1999</LINK>). But despite this variation, abstinence-only programs share the goal of discouraging sexual activity rather than making it safer. This common interest permits a systematic review.</P>
<P>Why it is important to do this review<BR/>Existing evaluations of abstinence-only programs are often US-focused, mixed in results, and inconsistent in methodology. For example, one review of abstinence-only programs reported significant reductions in sexual activity (<LINK REF="REF-Rector-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rector 2002</LINK>); however, it was limited to US adolescents and included studies not designed to assess effectiveness (e.g., survey-based longitudinal studies without control groups). In contrast, another review concluded that "no evaluated program with an exclusive abstinence message has been evaluated in such a way as to show a significantly positive impact on behavior" (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2000</LINK>); however, this review focused on adolescent pregnancy prevention, analyzed only programs endorsed by the US federal government, and included non-controlled studies. An exceptionally rigorous review of pregnancy prevention programs has also included that there is little to no evidence for the effectiveness of abstinence-only interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Kirby-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 2001</LINK>). Many reviews include other types of programs alongside abstinence-only interventions, making separation difficult (<LINK REF="REF-DiCenso-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiCenso 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Pedlow-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pedlow 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Robin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robin 2004</LINK>). Reviews may also be limited to adolescents and may focus only on pregnancy prevention instead of HIV risk reduction (<LINK REF="REF-Franklin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklin 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kirby-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 2001</LINK>). Although further analyses of abstinence-based programs are planned in high-income countries, these appear to be limited to adolescent groups in the US.</P>
<P>Abstinence-only programs have received considerable political attention, particularly in the US, making objective assessment difficult. As a strategy to reduce teen pregnancy, abstinence-only programs received nearly $900 million in US funding between 1999 and 2005, of which $168 million in federal funds was allocated for 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Connolly-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connolly 2004</LINK>). However, the issue is polarized. For example, Representative Henry A Waxman reviewed the 13 most popular abstinence-only curricula receiving federal funding; this 2004 report stated that over 80% contained "false, misleading, or distorted information about reproductive health" (<LINK REF="REF-Waxman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waxman 2004</LINK>). Groups such as Focus on the Family and the Government Affairs for Family Research Council disagreed, suggesting that the report "attempt[ed] to discredit highly successful abstinence programs" (<LINK REF="REF-Phan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phan 2004</LINK>). The debate has intensified during the summer of 2007, which has seen several Congressional decisions regarding abstinence-only program funding. In this setting, a systematic and apolitical review of effects without geographical limitations is essential to determine the utility of abstinence-only interventions. </P>
<P>To date, there has been no systematic analysis of the effects of abstinence-only programs on HIV prevention among all residents of high-income countries. This review seeks to identify, synthesize, and evaluate the effects of abstinence-only interventions on HIV-risk behavior and HIV transmission among participants in high-income countries. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effects of abstinence-only programs for preventing HIV infection among participants in high-income countries. </P>
<P>The interventions were any planned efforts intended to increase rates of abstinence as an exclusive means of HIV prevention. The participants were anyone in high-income countries. Included outcomes were behavioral and biological. We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing abstinence-only programs to any control groups. These included no intervention; HIV-unrelated programs comparable in time and format (i.e., "attention controls;" for example, these might include a program involving the same activities and the same number of sessions, but focused on abstinence from drugs, not sex); abstinence-plus HIV prevention programs; and HIV prevention programs that did not emphasize abstinence. </P>

</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Following the Cochrane Handbook and the precedent of previous HIV-AIDS related reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Siegfried-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegfried 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Grimwade-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimwade 2003</LINK>), we included only randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials. Quasi-randomized controlled trials had randomization sequences that were unlikely to lead to consistent bias, such as allocation by date of birth, coin flip, or alternation of individuals. </P>
<P>Included trials evaluated the effects of abstinence-only programs designed to influence behavior change on at least one behavioral or biological outcome measure related to HIV transmission. This limitation was practical because many of the primary outcomes were self-reported, and random allocation is important to control for both known and unknown confounders. If a meta-analysis had been feasible, we would have conducted a separate analysis on randomized controlled trials to determine the effects of methodological quality. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included studies comprising participants in high-income countries, as defined by the World Bank. Participants did not need to be born in or hold citizenship in a high-income country, but they must have been present in a high-income country when the intervention took place. No exclusions were made by intervention setting (e.g., clinic, school, community center, faith-based organization) or primary risk group. No exclusions were made by gender, age, sexual orientation, language, occupation, or racial or ethnic group. </P>
<P>Since our focus was primary prevention, studies restricted to participants who were already HIV-positive were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>"Abstinence" may be clinically defined as refraining from vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Given inconsistent definitions, this review included studies encouraging abstinence from any one of these behaviors or a combination of these behaviors. We made no exclusions by type of organization delivering the programs.</P>
<P>Criteria for abstinence-only interventions included the following:<BR/>1. the intervention was a planned effort to encourage sexual abstinence or a return to sexual abstinence;<BR/>2. specific outcomes of interest were presented;<BR/>3. HIV prevention was a stated goal of the intervention;<BR/>4. the program did not promote condom or contraception use (i.e., it had an exclusive abstinence focus).</P>
<P>We made no exclusions by type of comparison group. These could have included the following examples:<BR/>1. no intervention;<BR/>2. attention control: interventions that were equal in format and time, but targeted HIV-unrelated behaviors; for example, a comparison group might have received an intervention with the same number of sessions and the same activities, but the control intervention could have focused on refusing gang membership instead of abstaining from sexual activity;<BR/>3. interventions that did not encourage abstinence as a primary outcome (e.g., condom promotion programs);<BR/>4. abstinence-plus programs;<BR/>5. comparisons between enhanced and non-enhanced versions of the same program;<BR/>6. usual care as defined by the trialist.</P>
<P>Trials of programs that focused exclusively on pregnancy prevention (without aiming to prevent HIV) were excluded, as they may differ from programs with an HIV prevention component. Pregnancy-focused programs may have been less likely to accommodate the HIV-related risks of oral sex, anal sex, same-sex sexual behaviors, or non-sexual means of HIV transmission.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Studies reporting outcome measures directly related to HIV transmission (i.e. ,self-reported risk behavior and biological outcomes) were included. Examples of risk behavior outcomes included condom use, number of sexual partners, and frequency of unprotected intercourse. Biological outcomes included the incidence of HIV, STIs, and pregnancy. If reports included a summary measure of sexual risk, authors were contacted for data on specific outcomes. </P>
<P>Primary outcomes were those most indicative of HIV-risk behavior (although we recognized that pregnancy outcomes do not account for a number of HIV transmission mechanisms); by limiting these to biological outcomes only, we hoped to reduce the likelihood of achieving significance on multiple primary outcomes by chance. Where they were provided, we also examined outcome measures relevant to HIV knowledge, adverse outcomes, program fidelity, cost-effectiveness, and intervention acceptability. </P>
<P>Trials that did not report a behavioral or biological outcome measure were excluded. </P>
<P>Biological (primary) outcome measures <BR/>HIV incidence<BR/>STI incidence <BR/>Pregnancy incidence</P>

</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>We refined our search strategy with recommendations from the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Review Group. No language restrictions were imposed and translations were sought where necessary. No restrictions on journal of publication were imposed, and no country names or other geographical terms were used in the search. Most databases were searched from 1980 onward. Databases were initially searched in May 2005, with all searches updated in February 2007. Full search strategies for each database are included in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. </P>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Selection of studies<BR/>All reviewers independently examined citations reviewed by the search strategy. KU obtained full articles of potentially relevant papers. All reviewers independently assessed their eligibility using an eligibility form based on pre-specified inclusion criteria. Reasons for excluding potentially relevant trials are specified in the "Characteristics of Excluded Studies." We contacted the authors for clarification when necessary. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and, if necessary, referral to the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Review Group. </P>
<P>Data extraction and management<BR/>All reviewers independently extracted data on study design, participants, interventions, outcomes and methodological quality, using pre-designed data collection forms. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion. </P>
<P>The extracted data included the following measures: citation, study design, methodological criteria, inclusion and exclusion criteria, comparison group intervention, participant characteristics, trial setting, theoretical basis for intervention, elements of intervention, all relevant outcome measures, and results. We expected the programs and trial settings to vary widely (e.g., schools, clinics, prisons, community centers, and churches), and examined this carefully when considering the heterogeneity of our data set. We also examined any process or cost-effectiveness data reported, including training, monitoring, acceptability, costs, and sustainability. </P>
<P>Where reports were uncertain or included summary measures, authors were contacted for clarification. We noted any data that were consistently underreported, and highlighted this deficit along with future research needs in the discussion.</P>
<P>Assessment of methodological quality of included studies<BR/>Depending on study design, we evaluated the following methodological components, since there is evidence that these may be associated with biased estimates of effects:<BR/>1. similarity of the intervention and control groups (whether groups were treated equally except for the intervention); <BR/>2. method of generation of the randomization sequence;<BR/>3. generation of allocation concealment;<BR/>4. blinding (participants, intervention staff, and outcome assessors);<BR/>5. intention-to-treat analysis;<BR/>6. loss to follow-up. (In our results and discussion sections, we highlight attrition as a particular limitation of any studies with a total dropout exceeding one-third of baseline enrollment.)</P>
<P>Measures of treatment effect<BR/>To investigate the feasibility of a meta-analysis, all eligible studies were summarized in RevMan to the fullest extent possible. All reviewers assisted in abstracting the data, with KU entering all data into RevMan and DO and PM rechecking all entries. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. A narrative synthesis was provided for all results, but we determined that a statistical meta-analysis was not appropriate for this review due to differences in program and evaluation design, underreporting of key data, and inability to retrieve unpublished or missing data from authors. Had the studies been comparable and more completely reported, our meta-analysis would have measured the weighted average effect size for each outcome measure, weighted mean differences (for continuous outcomes), odds ratios of effects (for dichotomous outcomes), and 95% confidence intervals. Odds ratios less than one express a protective intervention effect. </P>
<P>Unit of analysis issues<BR/>Studies with multiple treatment groups<BR/>A meta-analysis was not conducted for this version of the review. However, had meta-analysis been possible, we would have dealt with multiple treatment groups in the following way: when studies had more than two treatment groups, we planned to accept only two groups for the meta-analysis. In keeping with procedures used by the US HIV/AIDS Prevention Research Synthesis project (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2002</LINK>), we planned to take the arm with the greatest or most intense exposure (as identified by the trialist), compared to the arm with the least or least intense exposure, thereby giving each study the most favorable chance to yield significant program effects. When different trial arms emphasized sexual abstinence to a differing extent, we would have accepted the arm that emphasized abstinence the most, compared to the arm that emphasized abstinence the least. </P>
<P>Crossover trials<BR/>We did not anticipate dealing with these trials in the review, and no crossover trials were recovered by the search. If we had identified any studies using this design, we would have analyzed only the follow-up data from the period before the crossover.</P>
<P>Cluster-randomized trials<BR/>When studies use cluster randomization, analyzing the data at the level of the individual participant has two implications: first, p-values may be artificially small, suggesting significant effects where none occurred (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Second, the confidence intervals for these results may appear artificially narrow, which would cause the studies to receive disproportionately more weight in the context of a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2002</LINK>). The second concern was unimportant for this version of the review because no meta-analysis was conducted. However, the first remained relevant because wherever possible, we reported the individual study results as calculated in RevMan. </P>
<P>Before entering the results of cluster-randomized studies into RevMan, we transformed these data according to the procedure in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>, supported in <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2004</LINK>), dividing the number of events and number of participants by the design effect [1 + (1 - m) * r]. We used the details provided by each study (total n and number of clusters) to calculate the average cluster size (m), and we decided upon consultation with the review group and a number of statistical experts to use the intra-class correlation coefficients (r) recommended in <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2002</LINK>. These were ICC=0.015 for school-based studies and ICC=0.005 for community-based studies (regardless of cluster size); these values were calculated respectively from school-based studies of youth smoking behavior and community-based studies of HIV prevention for men who have sex with men. </P>
<P>We acknowledge that we are uncertain about the applicability of these values to the context of this review. However, insufficient data were available for us to estimate a reliable ICC from the studies in this review. Since no meta-analysis was conducted, we report the results of cluster-randomized trials analyzed both before and after controlling for clustering. Insufficient data were available for us to calculate average cluster size for <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, so these results are reported on an individual level.</P>
<P>Dealing with missing data<BR/>Missing data arose from two sources: participant attrition and missing statistics. </P>
<P>Attrition<BR/>To deal with participant dropout, we accepted studies that used any type of analysis, including complete case analyses (i.e., participants were analyzed according to original assignments, and no data were imputed for drop-outs). If a meta-analysis had been possible, we would have conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate attrition as a source of heterogeneity and possible bias. </P>
<P>Missing statistics<BR/>Where statistics were missing (e.g., numbers of participants per group, attrition rates, means and standard deviations, or percentages), we contacted primary study authors on two separate occasions to supply the information. Where the information was unavailable due to data loss or non-response, we reported the results as stated in the trial report.</P>
<P>Assessment of heterogeneity<BR/>If a meta-analysis had been possible for this version of the review, we would have assessed heterogeneity using the chi square test of heterogeneity, visual inspection of the data, and the I2 statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>). The I2 statistic determines the percentage of variability that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error, where a value greater than 50% suggests moderate heterogeneity. If any of these methods indicated heterogeneity, we would have investigated possible explanations, including clinical and methodological characteristics. Even when tests for heterogeneity were non-significant, we planned to conduct sub-group analyses to explore other potential moderators.</P>
<P>Assessment of reporting biases<BR/>If a meta-analysis had been possible for this version of the review, we would have used funnel plots (plotting effect size against standard error) to detect potential bias. Additional analyses may have included the planned Egger regression approach with a weight-function model. Asymmetry can be due to publication bias, but it can also be due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity. In the event that a relationship had been found, these sources of heterogeneity would also have been examined as possible explanations (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data synthesis<BR/>If a meta-analysis had been possible for this version of the review, we would have considered conducting analyses according to both fixed-effects and random-effects models. The random-effects model would have been used where there was indication of heterogeneity and the source of such heterogeneity could not be explained. The random-effects model would also have been used for analyses incorporating small numbers of studies, for which tests of heterogeneity may be underpowered. If there were no sources of heterogeneity beyond differences in the observed covariates, we would have conducted both fixed-effects and random-effects analyses and investigated differences between the two procedures. </P>
<P>The narrative synthesis was conducted according to the following methods. First, we entered each individual study in RevMan. Next, we prepared the supplemental Charts of Effects appended to this review (see Figures 1-10, <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). These charts are organized by outcome, and each chart shows the effects of individual studies according to RevMan analyses (where possible) or as reported in the primary study. The charts also integrate key methodological features of each study (e.g., control group, attrition), along with each study's definition of the outcome of interest (e.g., condom use was variously defined as condom use at last sex among sexually experienced participants, or condom use in the last month among sexually active participants). The charts were then explained in text format for the description of studies and results.</P>
<P>Sub-group analyses <BR/>If we had conducted a meta-analysis, we would have stratified our analysis by intervention setting (e.g., school, clinic) and by participants' age, country, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Sub-group analyses would only have been conducted if data had allowed, with the knowledge that using a number of sub-groups can lead to statistically misleading conclusions.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis<BR/>If we had conducted a meta-analysis, we would have performed separate analyses for studies using complete case, per-protocol, and intention-to-treat methods, with a sensitivity analysis to investigate disparities between the three groups. </P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Results of the search<BR/>See <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. </P>
<P>A total of 20070 citations were assessed for inclusion (of these, 19,892 were recovered from electronic database searches ending February 2007, 99 were from handsearching, 17 were from personal contacts, and 62 were from cross-referencing). After the screening process, 330 papers were deemed potentially relevant evaluation studies. Full-text copies (or sufficient information) for 326 of these citations were obtained. </P>
<P>Of the four papers we could not obtain, two were conference abstracts of unclear relevance whose authors could not be located. One was an in-press paper of unclear relevance that could not be obtained from the authors. One was no longer available in print and the authors could not be located; this appeared to be a non-random evaluation of an abstinence-only program.</P>
<P>Of the 326 papers for which sufficient study information was obtained, 318 were excluded for the following reasons: 16 were not program evaluations; 69 duplicated other papers; 130 did not evaluate an abstinence-only program; 91 evaluated an abstinence-only program but did not meet the criteria for study design; two evaluated abstinence-only programs using randomized controlled designs, but the programs did not list HIV prevention as a program goal (<LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell_x002d_DiCenso-97" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell-DiCenso 97</LINK>); five evaluated an abstinence-only HIV prevention program and possibly used a randomized controlled design, but did not present outcomes of interest (<LINK REF="STD-Lage-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lage 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Donnell-2005" TYPE="STUDY">O'Donnell 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pallone-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pallone 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Roberts_x002d_Gray-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts-Gray 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Tobin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tobin 2005</LINK>), and five were ongoing trials (<LINK REF="STD-Borawski-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Borawski 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller_x002d_Heyl-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Miller-Heyl 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nagel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nagel 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Markham-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Markham 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>After these studies were excluded, analyses were limited to eight separate papers reporting 13 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>). One paper described three evaluations (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>), and two supplementary papers duplicated these reports (<LINK REF="REF-Kirby-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cagampang-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cagampang 1997</LINK>). Another paper described four evaluations (<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>), and was also supplemented by two reports (<LINK REF="REF-Devaney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devaney 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Maynard-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maynard 2005</LINK>). One paper was included on the basis of unpublished information about the method of allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Included studies<BR/>Detailed information about individual studies may be found in the Table of Included Studies. </P>
<P>Design<BR/>All of the abstinence-only evaluations were randomized controlled trials; no quasi-randomized controlled trials evaluating abstinence-only programs were retrieved by the search. Of the 13 evaluations included, three were part of the same report (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>), which used separate evaluation designs to assess Postponing Sexual Involvement (PSI) program. These differed by units of randomization (which were classroom, school, and individual, respectively). Four evaluations were included in another report (<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>); these differed by site and experimental program.</P>
<P>Six of the evaluations involved cluster randomization. The unit of randomization was the school for two evaluations (<LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>), the classroom for three evaluations (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>), the individual for six evaluations (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>), the family for one evaluation (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK> - it appeared that only one "target teen" per family was included), and "naturally occurring groups" in the final evaluation (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>; this designation included the school unit). </P>
<P>Control groups varied. One study compared an abstinence-only program to a non-intervention control (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>); the control group also received the intervention after the 12-month follow-up assessment.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK> compared an enhanced version of a program against a non-enhanced version of the same program. The control group was exposed to the Managing the Pressures before Marriage (MPM) curriculum only, while the other received the curriculum plus extra homework assignments to facilitate parental involvement. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK> involved four arms: abstinence-only (i.e., "Abstinence," which presented abstinence as the best and only strategy for avoiding HIV), abstinence-plus (i.e., "Protection," which presented abstinence as the safest alternative and safer sex as another alternative, focusing on condoms), safer-sex (i.e., "Decision," which focused on safer sex and personal decision-making), and a non-intervention control. University students were randomized to each of the four arms. All programs took place in the same setting and used the same one-session delivery format.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK> used a three-arm design to assess the effect of a video-based intervention intended to enhance parent-child communication about sex and abstinence. Families were randomized to receive one of three programs: videos plus mailed newsletters suggesting further family discussions, videos alone, and no intervention. </P>
<P>Nine effectiveness studies compared an abstinence-only program against usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>), with "usual care" defined as the HIV-prevention intervention normally delivered by the school. Since few details were provided to describe what "usual care" consisted of, it was impossible to clarify whether these control groups received safer-sex programs, abstinence-plus programs, other abstinence-only interventions, or any combination of the above. The available details were as follows:</P>
<P>An unpublished report for <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK> states that "the vast majority of students in the control groups did not receive another sexuality education curriculum instead of PSI. Instead, they received instruction in some other topic area ... many students in both the PSI groups and the control groups did receive some type of instruction on sexuality either before or during the time period of this evaluation." Although the published report of <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK> states that the study used a no treatment control, the unpublished evaluation states that control group participants received the "standard curriculum" delivered by the community agencies. </P>
<P>The report for <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK> provides some detail about "usual care" in each trial. For <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, controls received a nine-week physical education class that did not discuss abstinence or HIV, as well as a health class emphasizing abstinence but providing no details about HIV. Controls in <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK> received a week-long unit on human growth and development, as well as a curriculum covering HIV and abstinence. Controls in <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK> received "units on abstinence and contraceptive use" beginning in fifth grade. Finally, controls in <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK> received "heath, family-life, and sex education curricula," but it was unclear what these classes entailed.</P>
<P>Sample sizes<BR/>At baseline, the studies together enrolled approximately 15940 participants. Sample sizes for the abstinence-only evaluations at the time of baseline assessment ranged from 248 (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>) to 5244 (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>); baseline enrolment was not specifically reported and could not be computed for <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>. The median baseline enrolment was approximately 551.

<P>After attrition at each study's longest follow-up, the analyses reported in this review encompassed approximately 11879 participants. Again, this value is somewhat uncertain due to unclear reporting in several of the primary studies, and it is an overall estimate (i.e., it does not account for non-response on any specific outcome measure). </P>
<P>Setting<BR/>All 13 trials enrolled adolescents in the United States.

<P>Participants<BR/>All participants were adolescents or young adults in the US. All but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>) targeted youth between ages 9-13 years; the remaining study targeted young people aged 18 to 21 years. The mean participant ages in the 13 studies ranged from 10.6 years (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>) to 19.25 years (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>), the median of these average ages was 12.8 years. Participant groups in all but one study included both males and females; one trial included females only (<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Participants were primarily African-American in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>), largely of minority ethnicity in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>), "high minority" in another study (<LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>), equally representative of white and minority ethnicity in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>), and primarily white in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>). One study took place in a community with a high proportion of Mormon families, who were described as having a "highly abstinence-valued culture" (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four studies reported little or no information about the socio-economic status of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>), although the Kirby studies took place in areas with elevated teen pregnancy rates, potentially indicating lower socioeconomic status. The communities of two studies were described as "middle-class" (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>), and five were of lower socioeconomic status (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>). One evaluation mentioned that participants' mothers' education varied between high school graduation and some college coursework (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>). In the family-based study, 38% of mothers and 56% of fathers were college-educated (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Parental consent procedures were relevant ethical concerns for this review, since 12 of the studies involved legal minors as participants. Eight studies used active parental consent procedures (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>); three studies required parental notification, with permission forms used by 54% of the contractors hired to deliver the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>); and one study used passive parental consent procedures (<LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>). Rates of parental opposition in every study were low. Incentives for participation were offered in one study that granted its university-level participants course credits (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>), one study that gave participants prizes for homework completion (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>), one study that gave participants $5 for each survey completed (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>), and three studies for which contractors often had "reunions" or pizza parties to facilitate the administration of post-test surveys (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>).</P>
<P>Interventions<BR/>The 13 abstinence-only programs evaluated in this review had many similarities. All of the programs stressed sexual abstinence as the best and only means of HIV prevention, and no program promoted condom or contraceptive use as a viable alternative to abstinence. Eleven of the programs were at least partially school-based (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK> were the exceptions), and most of the programs emphasized communication and decision-making. Five of the interventions were based on the same program model: <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK> assessed the effects of Postponing Sexual Involvement (PSI), which was modified slightly to form the curriculum Managing the Pressures before Marriage (MPM) as evaluated in <LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>. All but one of the programs were designed for adolescents and delivered to middle-school-aged youth. <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK> also involved components of the Sex Can Wait program, which was evaluated in the study by Goldfarb, et al. (Goldfarb 1999).</P>
<P>Although the interventions did appear similar enough to permit a systematic review, the information reported about intervention design and implementation was variable and generally limited. Although most reports specified basic information about intended delivery format, subject material, activities, and exposure, very few collected or reported data on adherence, implementation fidelity, actual exposure, context, or modifications to the original design. Additionally, it was often difficult or impossible to quantify the extent to which the subject matter of a program focused on abstinence (and excluded information regarding contraception and condom use), which made the recognition of abstinence-only programs somewhat difficult. There is a need for more detailed information on intervention design and actual implementation in primary trial reports. </P>
<P>Importantly, 12 of the interventions emphasized pregnancy prevention to an equal or greater extent than HIV prevention. One experimental program was limited to HIV prevention (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>). It is unclear how this evidence generalizes to programs with an exclusive HIV prevention focus.</P>
<P>All but one of the evaluations (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>) involved multiple sessions, and every program aimed to stop, decrease, or postpone sexual activity within the participant population. Six programs appeared to be delivered exclusively in a large-group classroom format (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>). These programs may also have utilized small-group activities, but this was not stated explicitly. One of these interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>) supplemented classroom activities with parent-child homework for completion in the family home. Trial reports for five programs mentioned both classroom and small-group activities (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>). Two programs were media-based: one included videos and pamphlets delivered in a university classroom (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>), while the other included videos viewed in the family home (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>Trial reports indicated that at least eleven of the interventions aimed to improve communication between parents and adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>). Strategies for parent involvement included homework assignments (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>), parent meetings or "parent nights" (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>), home visits by social workers (<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>), a parent curriculum (<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>), and videos for parental viewing (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>). However, reports acknowledged that parental uptake of these activities was often low. Parent-child activities were not mentioned in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Program exposure (i.e. dosage) varied from one session (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>) to 720 sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>), with a median exposure of 8 sessions across trials. </P>
<P>Staff members for most interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>) were adults, including teachers and public health personnel. One design randomized classrooms to peer-led PSI, adult-led PSI, or a control group (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>), while another intervention was delivered entirely by peer leaders (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>). The two media-based interventions had minimal staff involvement by adults (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four of the evaluation reports stated theoretical bases for the interventions; these included cognitive behavioral theory (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>), social learning theory (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>), social cognitive theory (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>), and the theory of possible selves (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>). Four additional evaluations used a program based on social inoculation theory (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>, original PSI program design reported in <LINK REF="REF-Howard-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Howard-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 1992</LINK>). </P>
<P>Specific intervention details are as follows:</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK> evaluated Reaching Adolescents and Parents (RAP), which targeted students in grades 5-7 and their parents. The eight-session curriculum focused on puberty, self-esteem, communication, relationships, and decision-making. Six sessions involved the youth alone; one involved joint parent-child activities focusing on communication (e.g. discussions, video viewing); and the final session was a discussion forum for parents.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK> assessed the effects of Managing the Pressures before Marriage (MPM), a five-session curriculum for middle school students modeled on PSI, but with an additional emphasis on delaying sex until marriage. The five sessions were delivered by slightly older peer leaders (i.e., high-school aged) in a classroom setting. The independent variable in this evaluation was the addition of five parent-child homework assignments to the curriculum; these assignments aimed to improve parent-child communication and focused on concepts such as personal values, HIV-related myths, reasons to postpone sex, sex in the media, self-esteem, and peer pressure.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK> evaluated the Adult Identity Monitoring program, a 10-session program delivered by a male-female pair of African-American adult facilitators. The program targeted African-American adolescents, and it attempted to change behavior by helping participants to envision their future selves and understand how risk-taking might affect their goals. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK> evaluated Project C.A.R.E. (Creating Awareness through Relationship Education), a classroom initiative with the primary focus of delaying sexual activity. The curriculum focused on communication, factual information about sexual behavior, the consequences of sex, goal-setting, social support, and decision-making. Participants in this study received slightly different programs depending on their grade levels: sixth grade students received 23 sessions based on the "upper elementary" Sex Can Wait curriculum, seventh grade students received 24 sessions from the "middle school" Sex Can Wait curriculum, and eighth grade students received 24 of the 45 sessions in the Abstinence Pick and Choose Activities curriculum. All participants were grouped together for analysis, which made it impossible to isolate the effects of each program. It was unclear how many students were in each grade level.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>, the only intervention to take place in a university setting, compared three active intervention groups to a non-intervention control. In a large group setting, participants in each arm received a separate seven-page health education curriculum with information about the biology, symptoms, and transmission of HIV. Participants then viewed a 20-minute AIDS prevention film that included commentary and interviews; each intervention arm watched a separate video. Lastly, participants in each arm received a separate brochure highlighting transmission modes, symptoms, and prevention of HIV. The content of the three programs varied, with the intent of following three "prototypes of programs advocated by boards of education, health organizations, or health educators." One program focused on abstinence only ("Abstinence"), one prioritized abstinence but also promoted safer sex behaviors ("Protection"), and one focused on safer sex ("Decision"). This was the only study to explicitly compare an abstinence-only program against an abstinence-plus or a safer-sex design. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK> assessed the effects of Postponing Sexual Involvement (PSI), a five-session curriculum for middle school students focusing on the risks of early sex, reasons to delay sex, resisting social pressures, limit-setting, and communication. This program was implemented as part of the California initiative ENABL (Education Now and Babies Later). <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK> systematically varied the staff delivering the intervention between adult health educators and peer leaders, comparing each to a usual care control group. <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK> each used adult staff to deliver the intervention. The PSI curriculum has been evaluated elsewhere as an abstinence-plus program with the addition of a curriculum including contraception instruction (<LINK REF="REF-Aarons-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aarons 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Howard-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Howard-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 1992</LINK>), but it functioned as an abstinence-only intervention in this study (<LINK REF="REF-Kirby-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The one intervention not delivered in a group setting was Facts and Feelings, a video-based curriculum designed for weekly viewing by parents and adolescents in the home (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>). Six 15- to 20-minute videos were distributed to parents for the duration of three months, with biweekly follow-up calls by intervention staff to collect usage data. Videos focused on puberty, sexual values, facts about sexual anatomy and reproduction, the media's portrayal of sex, the consequences of sex, and refusal skills. The study compared two active treatment groups to non-intervention controls; one treatment group received the videos along with supplementary newsletters designed to suggest further family discussions and discussions, while the other group received the videos only. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK> compared a mandatory school-based abstinence-only program to usual care. The program, entitled My Choice, My Future! was a composite of three curricula: Reasonable Reasons to Wait (30 classroom sessions over the eighth-grade year focusing on character development, relationships, and abstinence), The Art of Loving Well (eight classroom sessions over the ninth-grade year focusing on healthy relationships), and WAIT Training (14 sessions over the tenth-grade year focusing on relationships skills, risks, and a slide show about STDs and abstinence).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK> assessed an elective program for 8th-grade girls entitled "ReCapturing the Vision," comparing the program to usual care. The program met daily throughout one school year (180 sessions), and was a composite of two programs. "ReCapturing the Vision" focused on personal and career goals and included home visits by social workers, tutoring, community service, a retreat, a Teen Abstinence Rally, and a symposium with celebrity speakers. "Vessels of Honor" was added to this curriculum; this program focuses on "honorable behavior," communication, relationships, physical development, sexual abuse, and "strategies for choosing a mate and the benefits of a committed marital relationship." Once girls elected to join the program, attendance was mandatory.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK> assessed an elective program entitled "A Life Options Model Curriculum for Youth," which met for 2.5 hours daily during the school year, for four consecutive years (approximately 720 program sessions). The program focused on self-esteem, values, decision-making, risks, communication, relationships, sexuality, development, sexually transmitted infections, and social skills. The program also included parent workshops and mentoring programs. Attendance was voluntary.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK> compared the Teens in Control program to usual care. Teens in Control was a composite of Postponing Sexual Involvement (also evaluated in <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>) and Sex Can Wait (also evaluated in <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>). The program met for two hours weekly throughout one school year (approximately 36 program sessions), and focused on risks, pressures, puberty, self-esteem, values, communication, career goals, and skills to facilitate abstinence.</P>
<P>Outcomes<BR/>All outcomes were assessed via written self-report questionnaires, which were bilingual (English/Spanish) in four of the evaluations (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>). Questionnaires were generally completed in the intervention setting and administered to groups (or, in <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>, to parents and children separately) by project staff or intervention facilitators. Questionnaires in four trials were sometimes administered by phone (<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>). One report mentioned modifying questionnaires in response to opposition from concerned parents by removing questions from the survey (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>). Nine of the evaluations described piloting the surveys (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>); three used or slightly modified surveys developed by others, but did not explicitly describe piloting procedures (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>), and one did not explicitly report how the survey was developed (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>). No evaluations confirmed the results of questionnaires with medical records or biological assessments, making all data vulnerable to recall bias and the limitations of self-report.</P>
<P>The studies used a variety of techniques to improve the validity of self-reported data. These included having bilingual (English/Spanish) staff assist students during the interviews (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>), reading questionnaires aloud (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>), allowing students to fill in the questionnaires anonymously (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>), emphasizing the confidential and voluntary nature of the exam before questionnaire administration (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>), seating participants far apart during survey administration (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>), asking participants to sign consent forms that highlight confidentiality (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>), monitoring the survey room to prevent talking or participant wandering (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>), using ID numbers and cover sheets to protect participants' identities (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>), not placing any personal identifying information on any survey form or data file (<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>), giving students papers to cover their answers (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>), and placing surveys in unmarked envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>Data were generally reported as statistical tests and/or group percentages (with or without the numbers of participants per trial arm); no study reported effect sizes. One study provided statements of significance without group means or other specific data (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Timing of follow-up assessments ranged from six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>) to approximately 65 months (<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>) after baseline. For the purposes of this review, follow-up data were blocked into short-term (0-5 months after baseline), medium-term (6 through 11 months), and long-term (12 months or more). Ten of the 13 studies reported long-term follow-up data (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>); the other three were limited to short-term follow-ups (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>). The median final follow-up assessment occurred 17 months after baseline.</P>
<P>The recall periods for self-reported outcomes varied. Outcomes such as STI, pregnancy, number of partners, and sexual initiation tended to be reported for participants' lifetimes, while recall periods for outcomes such as recent vaginal sex or condom use included 1 month (<LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>), 1.5 months (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>), 3 months (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>) 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>), time since baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>), and ever (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>).</P>
<P>The biological outcomes of interest for this review were underutilized. No study evaluated HIV incidence, and seven evaluations, conducted by two groups of trialists, assessed the incidence of STI. Eight studies assessed pregnancy incidence. </P>
<P>The behavioral outcomes of most interest (i.e., unprotected oral, anal, and vaginal sex) were also underutilized. Five studies assessed the incidence of unprotected vaginal intercourse among all participants. No evaluation separated sexual behavior outcomes into vaginal, oral, and anal behaviors; we entered the non-specific outcomes "intercourse" and "sex" as vaginal sex. Seven studies reported incidence of vaginal sex. Four studies evaluated the frequency of recent vaginal sex, and eight evaluated number of partners . Condom use and sexual initiation were reported in eight and ten trials respectively; these were the most commonly reported behavioral outcomes. </P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>) created a sexual behavior index for outcome observation, asking participants to report lifetime behaviors ranging from "holding hands" to "the sexual act by which pregnancy can occur." Data on vaginal intercourse could not be disaggregated from this index, making the result less relevant for this review.</P>
<P>Excluded studies <BR/>Excluded studies consist of all evaluations produced by the search that evaluated abstinence-only programs using non-randomized controlled, quantitative designs among any population group in high-income countries. Cross-sectional studies and comparisons of program participants against national survey samples were included. These abstinence-only programs could focus on preventing pregnancy or preventing HIV, and the studies could report any outcomes. Details of the excluded studies, including results for behavioral and biological outcomes only, are provided in the Table of Excluded Studies. The results mentioned in this table are those reported by the trialists, with no further analysis by the reviewers. </P>
<P>Ongoing studies<BR/>Information regarding ongoing studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Markham-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Markham 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller_x002d_Heyl-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Miller-Heyl 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nagel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nagel 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Borawski-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Borawski 2007</LINK>) is provided in the Table of Ongoing Studies. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Allocation<BR/>Four trials reported the method of randomization (via a random number generator, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>). One study did not report in the published version that it was a randomized controlled trial, but this was discovered upon communication with the trialist (<LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>). Overall, the potential for inadequate randomization and allocation concealment is a severe limitation of this data set. </P>
<P>Randomization was made particularly difficult by the need to contain the potential for contamination; this led <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK> to use cluster randomization, which heightened the potential for baseline differences. Seven trials reported at least one significant baseline difference (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>), and each of these studies statistically controlled for these differences in analyses. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>) did not provide an explicit statement of group equivalence at baseline.</P>
<P>Contamination and threats to program differentiation were openly acknowledged in the three studies that evaluated the same program (PSI) in California (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>). This three-study design may have allowed control-group participants for one evaluation to receive the intervention in another setting (e.g., a control participant in a school-based study could have received the intervention as an experimental participant in the community-based study). Threats to program differentiation could also have occurred in <LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, for which the same personnel delivered both the experimental and control interventions. This study monitored program leaders to assess program differentiation and the potential for performance bias. The potential for contamination was unclear in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>), as it was not stated who delivered the experimental and control programs.</P>
<P>Allocation concealment was not specifically addressed by any study, suggesting that every study may be prone to selection bias. We gave every study the "B" designation for quality of allocation concealment, indicating that procedures for allocation concealment were not reported. </P>
<P>Blinding<BR/>Given the time and human contact required for these interventions, the blinding of participants and intervention staff was generally not feasible. The impossibility of blinding intervention staff may have led to performance bias.</P>
<P>The blinding of assessors and data collectors was not entirely crucial for this group of studies, because every study utilized written self-reported questionnaires for data collection. As mentioned, questionnaires were administered in group settings by trained data collectors; blinding of these data collectors was not reported in any study. Notably, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK> used students' own teachers as monitors for data collection, which may have affected self-report if students had confidentiality concerns.</P>
<P>Follow-up and exclusions <BR/>Attrition was not known for one study, which did not report the number of participants randomized at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>). Final attrition rates in the other nine studies ranged from 5% (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>) to 45% (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>), with a median final attrition rate of 20%. Four studies had a final attrition above 33%, which must be considered when judging both internal and external validity; these included the following: <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK> (38.0%), <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK> (37%), <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK> (33.7%), and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK> (45.0%). </P>
<P>Five studies reported attrition analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, participants who dropped out of the program were older by one year, more likely to be male, and less likely to report skipping school than the participants retained. <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK> reported attrition analyses for the entire three-study design; approximately 1% more participants were lost from the intervention than the control group. Using two-way ANOVAs, the study found no significant interaction effects between treatment group and remaining in the study (i.e., survey completion at 17-month follow-up) in relation to age, gender, family background, risk factors such as alcohol use or low grades, mediating variables, or outcome variables. In <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, there was no difference in attrition by group; this report further specified that there were no differences by age, sexual initiation, sexual activity, birth control, or condom use. </P>
<P>Attrition analyses were not available for <LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, but the study reported that non-completion of homework assignments in the MPM-enhanced group was significantly higher among males, students reporting recent sexual intercourse, students who did not receive "mostly A's in school," and black or Hispanic students (as opposed to non-Hispanic whites). <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK> also did not provide attrition analyses; however, although groups were reportedly comparable on all variables at baseline, follow-up comparisons on demographic variables showed several differences. Fewer control group participants were in the oldest age group or highest grade in school, and there were significant differences in living arrangements (the majority of control group participants lived in an apartment, while the majority of intervention participants lived in a house). </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK> did not report attrition analyses. The studies by Trenholm et al (<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>) also did not report attrition analyses; attrition was slightly higher in the control group in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>), and slightly higher in the intervention group in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>).</P>
<P>All 13 evaluations employed complete case analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>), although one study had 0% attrition at short-term follow-up, allowing analyses for that follow-up to follow intention-to-treat procedures (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>). Since several studies reported that dropouts may have been at higher risk than those who were assessed at follow-up; the use of a complete case analysis may obscure intervention effects for the most at-risk participants.</P>
<P>Selective reporting <BR/>The quality of outcome reporting varied across studies, as did the statistical methods of analysis and the sub-groups for which data was reported. The variable reporting among the 13 trials suggests that no standard set of outcomes exists for the evaluation of sexual behavior for this population. </P>
<P>One trial collected data on number of sex partners and regularity of condom use, but did not report these data due to the small size of the subset of participants reporting sex (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial originally collected data on frequency of sex, but the item was removed from the survey at follow-up due to parental objections, resulting in de facto selective reporting of a pre-defined outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study aggregated data into a sexual behavior index (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>), but did not disaggregate individual risk behaviors; this resulted in the data being less useful for the evaluation of HIV-related risk. </P>
<P>A common source of potential confusion was the use of non-specific self-report outcome measures, such as "sexual intercourse," "sex," or "virginity." Given that these terms may be difficult to understand, or may have many different definitions among adolescents, adults, medical practitioners, program coordinators, and the general public (<LINK REF="REF-Haglund-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haglund 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Horan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horan 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Pitts-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitts 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Remez-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Remez 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sanders-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sonfield-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonfield 2001</LINK>), these constructs may require more specific definitions. No study separated oral, anal, and vaginal behaviors. </P>
<P>Some results, particularly those for outcomes such as condom use or number of partners, were analyzed only among participants with certain levels of sexual experience. Eight studies made these distinctions (<LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK> limited condom use to participants reporting sex (either in the past month or the past year, although this was unclear), while <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK> limited analyses for frequency of vaginal sex, number of partners and condom use to participants reporting sexual experience at baseline or follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK> appropriately assessed sexual initiation among participants who reported never having had sex at baseline. The trials by Trenholm, et al (<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>) only assessed STI, pregnancy, and condom use among participants reporting sex ever. All other outcomes were assessed among all participants. </P>
<P>The data were reported in a variety of formats, many of which were unsuitable for meta-analysis in RevMan due to missing data. We made repeated attempts to contact trialists for missing statistical data; while many authors were helpful in providing additional data, further information was often unavailable due to data loss or non-response. </P>

We had insufficient data to control for cluster randomization for <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>. This study evaluated pregnancy and observed only one event in each trial arm at 12-month follow-up (a non-significant effect), so controlling for cluster randomization was unlikely to change the results. <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK> provided sufficient information to enter dichotomous outcome data, but we could not enter continuous outcomes because we lacked standard deviations for group means. We had sufficient information to dichotomize outcomes for number of partners for four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>); however, we are unaware of any consensus on a clinically meaningful difference (e.g., did or did not have more than three lifetime sex partners), so we have accepted the trialists' analyses according to frequency distribution.</P>
<P>Although controlling for baseline values was a strength of these reports, some of the statistical analyses reported did not control for the unit of randomization or correct for multiple tests. Of the six studies that used cluster randomization (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>), two performed analyses on an individual level without reporting statistical procedures to accommodate the unit of assignment (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>). The other four studies incorporated multi-level analyses to control for cluster randomization (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>). Only three studies used a correction to accommodate multiple statistical tests, accepting a significance level of p&lt;0.01 instead of p&lt;0.05 (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>). The lack of control for multiple statistical tests makes the remaining papers more vulnerable to Type I error (i.e., believing that programs significantly affected behavior, when significance occurred due to chance). </P>
<P>Other potential sources of bias <BR/>The reliance on self-reported data is a salient but inevitable source of bias for all studies evaluating sexual behavior. The limitations of self-report for sexual behavior have been analyzed elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Binson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binson 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Brener-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brener 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Catania-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catania 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lauritsen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauritsen 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Meston-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meston 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Newcomer-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newcomer 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Rosenbaum-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenbaum 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Zabin-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zabin 1984</LINK>), particularly with respect to adolescents, and these data are also vulnerable to misreport due to the variety of definitions for terms such as "sex" or "partner." Self-report biases may be heightened in evaluations of abstinence-only programs due to the nature of the interventions; recent survey data suggest that youth who take virginity pledges may be more likely to retract their sexual histories at a later date (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenbaum-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenbaum 2006</LINK>). Furthermore, there are demonstrable limits to the use of sexual behavior as a proxy for HIV/STI risk (<LINK REF="REF-Peterman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterman 2000</LINK>). The most robust data for abstinence-only program evaluations would be medical evaluations of HIV or STI incidence; however, due perhaps to the young age of the participants, resource limitations, or logistical complications, no study was able to evaluate outcomes in this way. </P>
<P>Due to the limited space allocated to program design and implementation in published journals, the majority of studies reported little data on these aspects of the evaluation. A lack of specific definitions of "abstinence" and "sex" leaves programs vulnerable to varying interpretations by participants and staff. Different programs may emphasize abstinence to differing extents or provide different amounts of information regarding the limitations of condom use; however, we could not uncover these differences from the available data. Some of our difficulty identifying abstinence-only programs and program similarities may be partly due to the controversial political climate surrounding such programs, along with confusion regarding the difference between abstinence-only and abstinence-plus designs.</P>
<P>All 13 of the evaluations attempted to some extent to monitor program dosage, promote treatment adherence, or assess the quality of implementation, but few details regarding actual implementation were provided. Efforts to promote implementation fidelity included monitoring attendance, homework completion, or video exposure (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>); making trial staff available to assist in the conduct of program sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>); having independent evaluators observe program delivery (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>); requiring quarterly implementation reports from program facilitators (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>); interviewing program facilitators, program contractors, and participants (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>); conducting site visits and observing program sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>); using standard intervention materials; and using treatment manuals. Seven studies reported to any extent on training for program facilitators (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>). Two programs were media-based and used standard materials (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>). It is unclear whether strategies for monitoring and enhancing adherence were successful; few studies provided details on the actual extent of implementation fidelity (e.g., proportion of core components actually delivered, participant attendance rates). </P>
<P>In the trials by Trenholm, et al, attendance data suggested that the two elective programs (<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>) were poorly attended. In <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, 35% of participants assigned to the experimental group chose not to participate; however, they were appropriately analyzed according to original assignment. In <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, 43% of these participants chose not to participate in any of the program activities. Of the 57% experimental-group participants who did participate in <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, 55% participated in less than half of the daily program sessions available in the first year (a total of approximately 720 daily program sessions were offered over the course of four years).</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>The protocol for this review specified that a meta-analysis would be conducted if appropriate. After a thorough investigation of the data set, we determined that a statistical synthesis of the given data would be uninformative for several reasons. </P>
<P>Incomparability of interventions: One compelling reason to refrain from meta-analyzing the results was clinical heterogeneity; there were differences among the 13 programs in terms of intervention design, delivery, exposure, staff, and extent of emphasis on abstinence. These differences made the programs unsuitable for aggregation, since a meta-analysis aggregating disparate interventions may not provide useful insight regarding which types of programs are effective. Furthermore, the evaluations utilized a number of different control groups, recall periods, and follow-up times. Grouping such different comparisons together could have been misleading, but separating the evaluations into sub-comparisons rendered the groupings too small for an informative meta-analysis. </P>
<P>Data availability: Another major obstacle to meta-analyzing these results was the underutilization and underreporting of primary outcomes and difficulty entering some results into RevMan. Data unavailability also made it difficult to assess publication bias.</P>
<P>Statistical: There were several statistical reasons why a meta-analysis may have been misleading. Meta-analyzing primary studies with analyses that did not account for dropouts may have compounded this error, particularly since dropouts sometimes differed significantly from trial completers. Other statistical obstacles included accommodating cluster randomization, adjusting results for baseline differences, and handling trials with more than two arms, although these could have been overcome had we decided to proceed with the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>For these reasons, we present results from individual trials instead of providing a quantitative synthesis. RevMan analyses are provided where possible. Where possible, we transformed the results of cluster-randomized trials (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>) before entering them into RevMan. Since <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK> did not report numbers of participants enrolled at baseline, average cluster size was calculated using the number of participants analyzed at follow-up; we calculated average cluster size for <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK> using the available baseline enrollment numbers. </P>
<P>Analyses were impossible in RevMan for the following comparisons: <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>; continuous outcomes for <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>; and number of partners for <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>. These results are reported as available in the primary studies. All results are summarized in Figures 1-9 (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Throughout these results, odds ratios less than one indicate a protective effect of the abstinence-only programs. Odds ratios are displayed with 95% confidence intervals. Results were significant at p&lt;0.05.</P>
<P>Biological outcomes<BR/>Sexually transmitted infection<BR/>See <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>. Seven trials, with analyses representing 9779 participants at any time point, assessed participants' reports of ever having been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection by a doctor or nurse (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>). All compared an abstinence-only curriculum against usual care. No trial found a protective effect at any time point, and one trial found significant adverse effects compared to usual care. </P>
<P>Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>) assessed STI diagnosis among participants who reported never having been diagnosed with an STI at baseline. <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK> observed no significant findings at long-term follow-up (n=4133). <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK> systematically varied the staff delivering the intervention between adult and peer leaders; participants who received the intervention from adult leaders were significantly more likely than controls to report having been diagnosed with an STI at three-month follow-up (n=2711, OR=4.16 [1.16, 14.94], p=0.03) and 17-month follow-up (n=2313, OR=2.73 [1.05, 7.14], p=0.04). It was unclear, however, whether this was due to changes in reporting, frequency of testing, or actual risk behavior. The youth-led arm of <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK> did not report significantly different rates of STI infection at three-month (n=1895, OR=3.04 [0.59, 15.73], p=0.18) or 17-month (n= 1545, OR=2.06 [0.67, 6.32], p=0.21) follow-up. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK> assessed pregnancy since baseline among all participants, finding no significant effect compared to no treatment at short-term follow-up (n=405) or long-term follow-up (n=251).</P>
<P>Three trials assessed pregnancy incidence ever, among participants who had reported never having been pregnant or caused a pregnancy at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK> found no significant effects at long-term follow-up compared to usual care (n=4129). In <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, classrooms who received the intervention from peer leaders were significantly more likely than usual care controls to report having been pregnant at 17-month follow-up (n=1548, OR=2.35 [1.12, 4.95], p=0.02). However, this effect was largely influenced by the affirmative reports of six males from the seventh-grade class of a single school, and it was not mirrored by significant changes in any measured sexual behavior. There was no significant program effect for the adult-led sub-group of <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK> (n=2295, OR=1.35 [0.73, 2.52], p=0.34). </P>

In analyses that controlled for clustering, no trial found a significant program effect at short-term or long-term follow-up.</P>
<P>Goldfarb assessed unprotected sex among all participants in the past month, and results were limited to two-month follow-up. When we conducted analyses on the level of the individual, results significantly favored the program group over usual care (n=839, OR=0.54 [0.34, 0.84], p=0.007). However, when we re-analyzed these data using ICC=0.015 to control for cluster randomization, the effect was no longer significant (OR=0.56 [0.25, 1.23], p=0.15).</P>

<P>Number of sex partners<BR/>See <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>. Eight trials reported participants' number of sex partners, with analyses representing 4483 participants at any time point. No trial found a significant effect at any time point.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK> compared an abstinence-only program to an abstinence-plus program, a safer-sex program, and no treatment; the trial assessed participants' number of partners since baseline at six-week follow-up (n=388).

<P>Lack of condom use<BR/>See <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>. We transformed condom use data to reflect lack of condom use, so that all odds ratios less than 1 would continue to indicate a protective effect.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK> compared an abstinence-only program to usual care and reported the following at two-month follow-up: "For those reporting intercourse, 47% of controls and 50% of the intervention group reported using a condom." It was unclear whether this referred to condom use at last sex, condom use in the past month, or condom use ever. It was also unclear whether this referred to participants who had sex in the past month or participants who had ever had sex. We transformed this analysis to reflect "lack of condom use," and we analyzed this data first among participants who reported sex in the past month (n=171, OR=0.98 [0.33, 2.91], p=0.97), and then among participants who reported sex ever (n=167, OR=0.75 [0.26, 2.23], p=0.61). Neither finding was significant.<BR/>Three trials assessed lack of condom use at last sex among sexually experienced participants, and found no significant effect compared to usual care at short-term follow-up (n=810, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>) or long-term follow-up (n= 2043, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>).

<P>Four trials found no significant effect on lack of condom use at first sex at long-term follow-up, among participants who reported ever having had sex (n=1040, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>). </P>

<P>Additionally, one trial assessed the absolute number of times participants used condoms in the past six weeks, and found no significant difference between participants in abstinence-only, abstinence-plus, safer-sex, and no-treatment conditions (n=388, <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>). However, this outcome does not indicate the proportion of sex acts for which condoms were used; it simply reports the number of times participants used condoms at all.</P>
<P>Sexual initiation<BR/>See <LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>. Ten studies reported the incidence of sexual initiation (i.e., whether participants had ever had sex), with analyses representing 11298 participants at any time point.

<P>Sexual risk behavior index<BR/>See <LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK> was the only study to use a risk behavior index, which included behaviors ranging from hand-holding to sexual intercourse or "the sexual act by which pregnancy can occur." The study was a three-arm trial: the three arms received (1) a video-based intervention complete with periodic newsletters, (2) the video-based intervention alone, or (3) no intervention. At 12-month follow-up, no significant group-by-time interaction was observed (p=0.662) according to a 3 (group) x 3 (time) repeated measures ANOVA. Reports of vaginal sex could not be disaggregated from this outcome, although the incidence of vaginal sex reportedly ranged from 3% to 5% in the three intervention arms, with a total of 503 participants at follow-up. </P>
<P>Knowledge<BR/>See <LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK>. Seven trials reported any measure of knowledge, but none of these specifically assessed knowledge related to HIV/AIDS (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>).</P>
<P>Blake, et al assessed whether participants knew "the effectiveness of abstinence" and the risk of pregnancy at first intercourse (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>), and found no significant difference compared to a non-enhanced program version (without parent-child homework) at immediate post-intervention (n=351).</P>
<P>Goldfarb, et al assessed "sex knowledge" with a usual care control group at two-month follow-up (n=839), but did not report a measure of between-group significance (<LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>). As the study reports, "the intervention group showed significant increases in the number of correct answers to all four knowledge questions ... the control group showed no significant change."</P>
<P>Miller assessed knowledge of sexual facts, including "physical development, myths about teen sex, risks of sex, [and] interpersonal respect" (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>). The trial compared an abstinence-only program with newsletters, a program without newsletters, and a no-treatment control, with assessments at immediate post-intervention and 12 months. Again, between-groups tests of significance were not provided. As the trial reports, intervention groups had "a significant increase in knowledge from pre-test to post-test, with a plateau thereafter," while controls "showed a gradual increase in knowledge, with their delayed post-means having caught up with the treatment post-means."</P>
<P>The four trials by Trenholm, et al compared different abstinence-only programs to usual care. These trials assessed three outcomes: identification of "true and false STDs," knowledge of the risks of unprotected sex, and knowledge of the consequences of STDs (<LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>). One trial found significantly protective effects for all three outcomes at 62.5-month follow-up (n=447; Trenholm 2001); the remaining three trials found no protective effects at long-term follow-up (n=1606; <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>) Additionally, an analysis of all four trials together suggested that the programs may have led to a significant adverse effect on knowledge of condoms. At long-term follow-up, the overall analysis showed that a larger proportion of intervention youth reported that condoms "never prevent HIV" compared to usual care controls (21% vs 17%); intervention youth were also significantly less likely than controls to report that condoms "usually" prevent HIV (34% vs. 38%).</P>
<P>Cost data and participant satisfaction<BR/>None of the evaluations reported cost-effectiveness, although PSI/ENABL, as evaluated in <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK> was reportedly "expensive" (<LINK REF="REF-Saunders-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 1996</LINK>, cited in <LINK REF="REF-Cagampang-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cagampang 1997</LINK>). Overall, the PSI/ENABL program received $15 million for the first three-year funding cycle, including the cost of evaluation (<LINK REF="REF-Cagampang-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cagampang 1997</LINK>). The three-part evaluation was presented to state administrators, including the governor, before the removal of state funding from the PSI program (<LINK REF="REF-Cagampang-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cagampang 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Four studies collected data on participant satisfaction; <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK> reported that participant surveys, ethnographic observations, interviews, and focus groups indicated high levels of satisfaction and youth participant engagement. <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK> collected participant satisfaction data from focus groups, interviews, and surveys, and similarly reported high levels of satisfaction (along with political popularity). Of the participants surveyed, 82% reported that the program was "good or excellent," while 88% stated that the program information was helpful. However, participants who had a "serious boyfriend or girlfriend" reported significantly lower levels of satisfaction than youth who had not had a serious relationship; additionally, 82% of participants who suggested additional program topics recommended that the program contain more information about "how to keep from getting STDs and HIV." </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Summary of main results<BR/>As this review has highlighted, methodologically rigorous assessments of abstinence-only interventions for HIV prevention are hindered by a number of obstacles. Foremost among these are the scarcity of randomized controlled designs, the methodological deficiencies of included trials, the relatively homogeneous nature of participant groups, the underutilization of outcomes relevant to HIV risk, and incomplete reporting by primary trials. Even with these caveats, however, the evidence from this review has critical implications for research and practice. </P>
<P>Behavioral outcomes<BR/>The data from this review show no indications that abstinence-only programs can effectively reduce HIV risk as indicated by self-reported sexual behavior. Evidence from these primary trials suggests that when compared to a variety of control groups, the evaluated programs did not protectively or adversely affect incidence of unprotected vaginal sex, the frequency of vaginal sex, participants' number of sex partners, condom use, rates of sexual initiation, or overall sexual behavior according to a risk index. </P>
<P>Notably, findings do not suggest that abstinence-only programs can effectively encourage abstinent behavior; although programs did not appear to cause harm, the bulk of the evidence suggests that the programs are ineffective for preventing or decreasing sexual activity. This was true for both primary abstinence (i.e., preventing sexual initiation) and secondary abstinence (i.e., decreasing the incidence and frequency of recent sex). Although an isolated protective effect was observed for incidence of vaginal sex (n=839, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>) it was offset by possible reporting error, a lack of long-term follow-up data, and non-significant findings in six other trials among 2615 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>). A significant adverse effect for frequency of recent sex (n=338, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>) was likewise limited to short-term follow-up and offset by non-significant findings in other trials (see "Harms" below).</P>
<P>The evidence of behavioral effects is limited by several factors: quantitative synthesis of the available results was impossible; reporting bias or differing definitions of behavioral terms may impede reliable self-reports of behavior; behavioral outcomes are somewhat limited in their ability to indicate HIV risk (<LINK REF="REF-Peterman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterman 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Leary-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Leary 1997</LINK>); floor effects may constrain the possibility of finding significant behavior change in participant populations with low levels of sexual activity (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>); three of the evaluations reporting behavioral outcomes were part of the same three-study design; three of the studies reporting behavioral outcomes had overall attrition rates exceeding 33%; and attrition was unavailable for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Biological outcomes<BR/>There appears to be no evidence that abstinence-only programs can effectively reduce HIV risk as indicated by self-reported STI and pregnancy incidence. Eight trials offer some evidence to suggest that abstinence-only programs are ineffective in reducing these events on both a short-term and long-term basis, and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK> provided some evidence of adverse program effects for both outcomes; however, these were offset by non-significant findings in the remaining seven trials (see "Harms" below). </P>
<P>The evidence of biological effects faces many of the same limitations: floor effects constrain the possibility of finding significant effects where prevalence is low; quantitative synthesis of the available results was impossible; reporting bias or the lack of diagnosis may impede reliable self-reports of STI and pregnancy (i.e., relying on diagnosis does not capture undiagnosed conditions, especially given that many STIs are asymptomatic); STI incidence and especially pregnancy incidence are somewhat limited in their ability to indicate HIV risk; seven of the eight evaluations reporting either of these outcomes were conducted by just two groups of trialists; and three of the studies reporting biological outcomes had overall attrition rates exceeding 33%.</P>
<P>Knowledge<BR/>Because no trial in this review specifically assessed the knowledge of HIV/AIDS facts, there is insufficient information from this review to gauge how abstinence-only programs may affect HIV/AIDS knowledge.</P>
<P>Harms<BR/>Several iatrogenic effects were observed throughout the review on STI incidence, pregnancy incidence, and the frequency of recent vaginal sex, all of which were documented in <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>. As clarified in <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>, and <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>, each of these harms is offset by studies showing evidence of no effect, and long-term harms for STI incidence and pregnancy were offset by high attrition. Because the significant harms do not appear consistently, we conclude that abstinence-only programs do not appear to reliably cause harm on the behavioral and biological outcomes of interest. This review does not address psychological or attitudinal harms, which merit attention in future investigations; such studies might specifically investigate program effects on participants with baseline sexual experience, participants who have been subject to coerced sex, or participants experiencing same-sex attraction. </P>
<P>Specific behavioral harms observed in this review were as follows:</P>
<P>"Participants in the adult-led intervention arm were significantly more likely than usual care controls to report having ever been diagnosed with an STI at three-month follow-up (n=2711, OR=4.16 [1.16, 14.94], p=0.03) and 17-month follow-up (n=2313, OR=2.73 [1.05, 7.14], p=0.04). These effects did not correspond to increases in self-reported sexual behavior, and it is unclear whether this resulted from differences in rates of testing, diagnosis, or actual STI incidence. This was offset by non-significant findings in the youth-led arm of <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK> (total n=7068).</P>
<P>"Participants in the peer-led intervention arm were significantly more likely than usual care controls to report having been pregnant or caused a pregnancy at long-term follow-up (OR=2.47 [1.18, 5.17]). This outcome did not mirror any corresponding long-term change in self-reported sexual behavior, and further analyses revealed that effects could be tracked to male participants in the same class of a single school, suggesting possible reporting inaccuracies or other alternative explanations (see <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>). This was offset by non-significant findings in <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, the adult-led arm of <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK> (total n=7869).</P>
<P>"At short-term follow-up, sexually experienced participants in the peer-led arm reported a significantly greater increase in the number of sex acts in the last three months than their usual care counterparts. This effect was not sustained at long-term follow-up, and it was offset by non-significant findings in <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK>, the adult-led arm of <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK> (total n=2038).</P>
<P>Overall summary<BR/>In sum, the 13 trials reviewed here show no evidence that abstinence-only programs effectively decrease or exacerbate HIV risk among participants in high-income countries, as measured by self-reported biological and behavioral outcomes. There is some evidence to suggest that the programs are ineffective for improving biological and behavioral outcomes, but the generalizability of this evidence may be limited to the US youth populations represented in the included trials.</P>
<P>Additional findings of ongoing and recently completed trials<BR/>Beyond the included results, our search discovered mid-term findings of two ongoing trials (<LINK REF="STD-Miller_x002d_Heyl-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Miller-Heyl 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nagel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nagel 2007</LINK>) and long-term findings of a recently completed trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2006</LINK>), but full reports were not yet available. No results were available for another two ongoing trials (<LINK REF="STD-Borawski-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Borawski 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Markham-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Markham 2007</LINK>). All trials enrolled US adolescents and are classified as "ongoing" in Figure 1 and the Table of Ongoing Studies. Based on preliminary results, we do not believe that including full reports of the three trials with follow-up data would have changed the conclusions of our review. At the time of this review, there was insufficient information available to assess the methodological quality of these ongoing studies, so this must be kept in mind when comparing their results to the findings of this review.</P>
<P>One ongoing cluster-randomized trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nagel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nagel 2007</LINK>) is based in Toledo, Ohio, and randomized 510 adolescents to an eight-session school-based abstinence-only program or no treatment. Chi-square analyses at immediate post-test found no significant difference in participants' reports of vaginal sex in the past two months. No other behavioral outcomes were presented. These findings reinforce the non-significant results of six included trials from our review (n=2,615), compared to one included trial with significant findings (n=839).</P>
<P>A multi-site ongoing trial (<LINK REF="STD-Miller_x002d_Heyl-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Miller-Heyl 2007</LINK>) randomized the families of 189 adolescents in Denver and Montezuma County, Colorado, to a 22-hour community-based abstinence-only program or no treatment. At six-month follow-up (n=132), there was no significant difference in whether participants had ever had sex (p=0.15 from a group-by-time interaction, using a repeated-measures ANOVA). This aligns with the non-significant findings of ten included trials from our review (n=11,298). Results of the ongoing trial at 12-month follow-up favored the intervention group for this outcome, but significance was not stated. </P>
<P>The recently completed trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2006</LINK>) allocated 662 adolescents to ten trial arms spanning four conditions: abstinence-only (two arms), abstinence-plus (four arms), safer sex (two arms), and attention control (two arms). At 24-month follow-up (n=559), logistic regression found that abstinence-only program participants were less likely to report ever having had sex than participants in the attention control (p=0.02), abstinence-plus (p=0.05), and safer-sex (p=0.007) conditions. With analyses limited to participants who reported never having had sex at baseline (n&lt;559), effects remained significant compared to the attention control (p=0.01) and the safer-sex program (p=0.007), but not compared to the abstinence-plus program (p=0.07). These findings are offset by the non-significant results of ten included trials in this review (n=11,298). The trial also found no significant differences between the abstinence-only program and the attention control in consistent condom use or condom use at last sex at 24-month follow-up (n&lt;224, p-value not reported), which aligns with non-significant findings in eight trials in this review (n=3,254). Condom use comparisons to the abstinence-plus and safer-sex arms were not reported and could not be obtained; however, previous trials evaluating variants of the abstinence-plus program have found significantly protective effects for condom use and unprotected sex compared to attention controls (<LINK REF="REF-Jemmott-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemmott 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Jemmott-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemmott 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Jemmott-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemmott 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Jemmott-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemmott 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Quality of the evidence: internal validity and methodological rigor<BR/>Overall, the methodological quality of the 13 included studies was difficult to judge due to incomplete reporting of key methodological and clinical features. Reporting deficiencies may obscure important methodological strengths or weaknesses, and it was often difficult to obtain additional information by contacting the trialists. </P>
<P>As a group, the studies had several important strengths; these included controlling for baseline assessment values, describing the development or piloting of data collection tools, enrolling relatively large samples at baseline (median baseline enrolment=626), acknowledging the need for long-term follow-up data, and making efforts to improve the validity of self-reported data. The trial results for outcomes of interest were also remarkably consistent across studies. However, these strengths were partially overshadowed by the following methodological weaknesses or ambiguities: </P>
<P>"Underreporting of key methodological features: No evaluation specified procedures for allocation concealment, and few reported method of randomization. Randomization procedures may be questioned for the two studies that had unequal distributions of participants among trial arms, but did not specify an intention to do so (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>); one published trial report did not state clearly that randomization was used (<LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>), although this was discovered in correspondence with the trialist. No study reported procedures for blinding the personnel who administered outcome surveys.</P>
<P>"Missing data: Commonly missing values across studies included the number of participants per trial arm at baseline and follow-up, means and standard deviations for continuous outcomes, percentages for dichotomous outcomes, effect sizes, and attrition analyses. Several trials were also missing statements of baseline equivalence (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>), total attrition and baseline enrolment (<LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>), and data for the estimation of average cluster size (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>). Only five trials reported statistical power in relation to sample size (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007d" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007d</LINK>); however, median sample size was fairly large, and we do not perceive this to be a major limitation. </P>
<P>"Attrition at last follow-up: Dropout exceeded 33% in four of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>) and was not reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>). No trial used an intention-to-treat analysis. </P>
<P>"Unit of analysis problems: Of the six trials that used cluster randomization, two studies did not report controlling for clustering in analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK>), potentially leading to Type I errors. Our inability to estimate a reliable ICC from available study data is a possible source of bias for the review as a whole. </P>
<P>"Limitations of outcome measures: All outcome data in this review are vulnerable to self-report bias. While biological outcomes are the best indicators of HIV risk, there are obstacles to using these outcomes among youth populations. These include resistance from schools or parents, logistical difficulties, and floor effects (i.e., a recent study suggests that overall HIV prevalence in young adults in the US is 1.0 per 1000, <LINK REF="REF-Morris-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2006</LINK>). For these reasons, self-reported behavioral outcomes were a necessary proxy for HIV risk. As discussed elsewhere, there are many limitations to self-reported sexual behavior data, which is an inevitable source of bias. The results of this review highlight the need for a standardized set of outcome measures with unambiguous and explicit definitions, consistent follow-up times and recall periods, and clinically meaningful implications for HIV risk. Reaching a consensus on a set of behavioral outcomes, follow-up times, recall periods, sub-groups of interest, and reporting formats would transform researchers' ability to make comparisons across primary trials. As this review demonstrates, behavioral outcomes of HIV prevention trials are often non-specifically defined (particularly for terms known to have varying meanings); different studies use differing follow-up times and recall periods; the most clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g. STI incidence, incidence of unprotected vaginal sex) are rarely used; outcomes are rarely separated into oral, anal, and vaginal sex, which carry different levels of HIV risk; outcomes are reported for various subsets of participants across studies; and long-term follow-up data are sometimes not collected. Assessing the incidence and frequency of unprotected oral and anal sex acts may be particularly relevant for participants of abstinence-only programs; recent research on virginity pledge programs (<LINK REF="STD-Bruckner-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bruckner 2005</LINK>) suggests that pledgers may delay vaginal sex, but do not differ significantly from non-pledgers in rates of STI due to oral and anal sex. Long-term follow-up data are also particularly relevant for studies of youth sexual behavior, which is often characterized by intermittent periods of activity (<LINK REF="REF-Rotheram_x002d_Borus-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rotheram-Borus 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>"Insufficient reporting on program design and implementation: Incomplete reporting on the design and implementation of both experimental and control interventions has been previously noted as a limitation of behavioral HIV prevention trials (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Leary-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Leary 1997</LINK>); ideally, reports of implementation should be sufficiently detailed to permit replication, or at least to permit reviewers to judge whether programs are similar enough to combine their evaluations in a systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 2005</LINK>). Additionally, detailed reporting on implementation characteristics can allow the tracking of particular program components across studies, leading to the identification of potentially effective program characteristics. Few of the trials in this review reported this level of detail on intervention design, program delivery by staff, uptake by participants, and unique features of the trial context. <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007b" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007b</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Trenholm-2007c" TYPE="STUDY">Trenholm 2007c</LINK> were exceptions to this trend; however, information on program design and implementation for these studies was contained in unpublished reports. Journals may wish to consider dedicating more space to the reporting of key implementation data for studies of behavioral HIV prevention programs. Details on the treatment of control groups were rarely reported, although these are crucial to understand trial comparisons. To address the current debate over abstinence-only programs, comparisons of abstinence-only programs against abstinence-plus, condom promotion, or safer-sex programs may provide the most relevant data. It is possible that studies with "usual care" control groups may have made some of these comparisons, but unclear reporting of what control group participants actually received made this difficult to determine. </P>
<P>Overall completeness and applicability of evidence<BR/>External validity<BR/>The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of abstinence-only programs for HIV prevention among all possible participants in high-income countries. The evidence gathered by our search is somewhat able to address this objective, but several factors limit the generalizability (external validity) of these results. </P>
<P>First, relatively little data were available for the primary outcomes of interest. Data were also insufficient to inform assessments of cost-effectiveness, participant satisfaction, implementation fidelity, intervention mechanisms, and the effectiveness of specific program characteristics across studies. The included program designs were consistent with our background research, but they may not represent the entire realm of abstinence-only approaches in high-income countries.</P>
<P>Second, the population represented in this review is limited to adolescents and young adults in the US. These participants may not be representative of the universe of high-income country populations; no evaluations were discovered in high-income countries other than the US. Even within the realm of US adolescents and young adults, a number of vulnerable groups are not represented in these trials. For example, data were unavailable or could not be disaggregated for gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender youth; youth with disabilities; youth who have immigrated to the US; substance-dependent youth; or homeless young people. Sub-group analyses by gender, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, family structure, religion, baseline sexual experience, or other variables were impossible. No data were available for participants younger than 9 or older than 21 years, and no study focused exclusively on youth in high school (aged 14-18 yrs). Several regions of the US were underrepresented, particularly the South and Midwest. </P>
<P>Third, one of the most salient research deficits in this review is the lack of direct comparisons of abstinence-only against abstinence-plus, condom-promotion, or safer-sex programs. According to our criteria for abstinence-only interventions, only <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 1990</LINK> provided this type of comparison. Beyond these results and the findings of one ongoing study (<LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2006</LINK>), this review cannot directly address the differential effectiveness of abstinence-only and abstinence-plus strategies for HIV prevention. We will discuss this issue further in our Cochrane review of abstinence-plus programs for HIV prevention in high-income countries. </P>
<P>An additional study has compared an abstinence-focused program, a condom-focused program, and an attention control, suggesting that the condom-focused program had longer-lasting effects and more promising results among sexually experienced participants (<LINK REF="REF-Jemmott-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemmott 1998</LINK>). However, the abstinence-focused program in this evaluation acknowledged that condoms were an effective prevention strategy, which caused us to classify the program as an abstinence-plus intervention. This study has been incorporated into our review of abstinence-plus programs. </P>
<P>Evidence in the practice context<BR/>As mentioned in our Background section, examining the evidence from high-income countries is illuminating for several reasons. As compared to their counterparts in resource-poor countries, abstinence-only program participants in high-income countries have relatively higher levels of gender equality, lower levels of discrimination and structural violence, and greater access to education, employment, and healthcare resources. It is also relevant for this review that abstinence-only programs receive a great deal of federal, state, and private funding in the United States. We hypothesized that these conditions may offer abstinence-only programs in the US and other high-income countries the best possible chances of affecting risk behavior. A 2004 editorial in the Lancet concurred, suggesting that "abstinence only works where women have the means to make it work - an unobtainable position for many, if not most women living in some of the poorest regions of the world" (<LINK REF="REF-Lancet-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancet 2004</LINK>). However, the results of this review suggest that even with relative material and social advantages, participants of the abstinence-only programs examined here did not alter their risk behavior as a result of the interventions.</P>
<P>Examining the evidence from the US might also allow a more informed assessment of current US policy with regard to abstinence-only interventions. In light of these results, it could be productive for policymakers and practitioners to reconsider current resource allocation. Although abstinence-only programs do not appear to consistently cause harm among participants in high-income countries, program evaluations also do not appear to show short-term or long-term reductions in risk behavior. This lack of protective effect may be cause to question the costs and benefits of abstinence-only approaches. To give some idea of abstinence-only funding levels, the 2007 budget provided by the White House allocates $204 million to domestic abstinence-only approaches, with the goal of increasing annual funding to $270 million by 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-OMB-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">OMB 2006</LINK>). This estimate does not include state funding ($3 for every $4 in federal contributions), private contributions, or the funding for abstinence-only interventions in 15 at-risk countries via the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. PEPFAR regulations require 33% of the $3 billion allocated to prevention funding to be spent on abstinence-only interventions during the five-year plan (<LINK REF="REF-US-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">US 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Should the funding of abstinence-only interventions continue at its current levels, policymakers and practitioners might consider allocating more of these resources to methodologically rigorous program evaluations with behavioral and biological outcomes. It is striking that, despite an exhaustive and highly sensitive search strategy, this review discovered randomized controlled evaluations of only 11 separate programs. Considering the political popularity, funding, and widespread implementation of abstinence-only programs, especially in the US (i.e., a recent three-wave survey of 15,170 young adults in the US found that 20% reported having taken a virginity pledge at one or more survey waves (<LINK REF="STD-Bruckner-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bruckner 2005</LINK>)), we were surprised by the scarcity of rigorous evaluations with behavioral outcomes. We were especially concerned by the complete absence of evaluations of programs implemented by faith-based organizations, since these are among the most widespread channels for abstinence-only program delivery in the United States and elsewhere. Behavioral data from ongoing studies will help remedy some knowledge gaps, but the variety in abstinence-only program designs (see <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2005</LINK>) suggests that additional studies may be necessary for a clear and nuanced understanding of program effectiveness. </P>
<P>Potential biases in the review process<BR/>Although we have mentioned the limitations of our review throughout the previous sections, they are consolidated here for clarity. First, despite our extensive search for unpublished and ongoing trials (which included searching grey literature, handsearching conference abstracts, and contacting experts), our review remains vulnerable to publication bias. This review does not include studies indexed after February 2007. Our search for unpublished literature was somewhat hampered by non-response and the political connotations of terms such as "abstinence-only" and "abstinence-based;" it is possible that additional unpublished evaluations of abstinence-only programs exist, but were not called to our attention due to political concerns or varying definitions of these terms. Additionally, our electronic search utilized an HIV filter, which means that it did not reliably uncover evaluations of abstinence-only programs focused exclusively on pregnancy prevention. Several randomized controlled evaluations of abstinence-only pregnancy prevention programs were recovered by cross-referencing, but we classified these as excluded studies after determining that HIV prevention was not a stated goal. We suggest that users consult the pregnancy prevention literature for further evidence of the effectiveness of abstinence-only programs for preventing pregnancy. </P>
<P>While assessing trials for inclusion, it was frequently difficult or impossible to assess the extent to which interventions emphasized abstinence, or how they discussed condom use or contraception. It is possible that we have omitted abstinence-only interventions that did not include any terms such as "postpone sex" or "abstain" in their titles or abstracts; key words for these evaluations may have been broad terms such as "sex education" or "family life education." Including terms with this broad scope in our search strategy would have made the review unfeasible due to the large number of search hits, so we have accepted this as a limitation of the review. We welcome suggestions to correct any errors of omission in future updates.</P>
<P>Beyond the limitations of our search strategy, we were often unable to obtain relevant missing data, including methodological characteristics, clinical characteristics, and outcome data. This led to several systematic gaps in the review, such as the inability to enter some comparisons into RevMan or to assess publication bias. </P>
<P>We also had difficulty finding a reliable intra-class correlation coefficient when computing the design effect for cluster-randomized trials. Although analyses investigated a range of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), we report analyses according to previously published ICCs. To limit potential bias, we ultimately reported two sets of results for cluster-randomized trials in our charts: one set unadjusted for cluster randomization, and one set using the ICCs recommended for school-based studies in <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2002</LINK>. This affected the significance of results for <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK> (sexual initiation at short-term follow-up), <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK> (lack of condom use at last sex at short-term follow-up) and <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK> (sexual initiation and recent vaginal sex). All differences were in the direction of non-significance in the cluster-adjusted findings. </P>
<P>Perhaps due to differences in analysis strategies or software, our methods of controlling for clustering, or our lack of original data sets, our re-analyzed results differed slightly from results published in several trials. These included <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2005</LINK> (incidence of vaginal sex at 4.4-month follow-up), <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK> (condom use at last sex at three-month follow-up for the adult-led arm), and <LINK REF="STD-Goldfarb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Goldfarb 1999</LINK> (incidence of vaginal sex, sexual initiation). All differences were in the direction of non-significance in our re-analyzed results.</P>
<P>We did not use a Bonferroni or other correction to control for the examination of multiple statistical tests. In total, the results section of this review reports 79 discrete statistical tests (not including additional tests for cluster-randomized trials). Five of these tests (6%) reached significance at a p&lt;0.05 level, which is what might be expected to achieve significance by chance.</P>
<P>Finally, we must acknowledge the potential for bias due to dominant cultural norms: two reviewers (KU and DO) are originally from the United States, while the third (PM) is from the United Kingdom.</P>
<P>Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews<BR/>Previous reviews have reached varying conclusions regarding the effectiveness of abstinence-only programs for the reduction of sexual risk behavior. Our review adds to previous assessments by virtue of its international focus; pre-specified, systematic, and highly sensitive search for program evidence; inclusion of published and unpublished literature; exclusive focus on behavioral and biological outcomes; pre-approved Cochrane protocol; and acceptance of only the most rigorous trial evidence (i.e., data from randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials). </P>
<P>There is no evidence of abstinence-only program effectiveness in low- or middle- income countries.<BR/>First, our review found very similar results to the 2004 and 2006 reviews of abstinence-only programs for the prevention of HIV in developing countries. This review found only one abstinence-only program evaluation and "little or no evidence of effect on actual behavior" (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Reilly-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Reilly 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Reilly-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Reilly 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>There is no evidence of abstinence-only program effectiveness in high-income countries.<BR/>Next, our review concurs with reviews carried out by <LINK REF="REF-NHS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-DiCenso-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiCenso 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Franklin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklin 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kirby-1997R" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 1997R</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kirby-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kirby-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Manlove-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manlove 2004</LINK>, and <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2000</LINK>. Each of these reviews found no conclusive evidence from rigorous trials to suggest that abstinence-only interventions affect sexual risk behavior. We also agree with the assessment in <LINK REF="REF-DiCenso-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiCenso 2002</LINK> of the evidence from <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>, suggesting increased pregnancies in the partners of male participants. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2005</LINK> included evaluations of three abstinence-only programs. Results suggested that one of the programs (<LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1993</LINK>) had a significantly protective effect on sexual initiation; however, this program focused exclusively on pregnancy prevention. The two other abstinence-only evaluations in <LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2005</LINK> were <LINK REF="STD-Blake-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blake 2001</LINK> and the study encompassing <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997b</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Kirby-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Kirby 1997c</LINK>. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Grunseit-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grunseit 1997</LINK> included three abstinence-only trials: <LINK REF="STD-Christopher-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Christopher 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1993</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1993</LINK>. This review highlighted the iatrogenic effects observed in <LINK REF="STD-Christopher-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Christopher 1990</LINK>, but did not provide a summary of overall effects of abstinence-only programs.</P>
<P>This review disagrees with <LINK REF="REF-Rector-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rector 2002</LINK>, a non-systematic review of abstinence-only programs for US youth that concluded, "real abstinence programs can be highly effective in reducing early sexual activity." The methodological limitations of this review are summarized in <LINK REF="REF-Kirby-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 2002</LINK>. Likewise, our review disagrees with the conclusions of <LINK REF="REF-Napier-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Napier 1997</LINK>, another non-systematic review of abstinence-only curricula for pregnancy prevention.</P>
<P>Abstinence-only programs are rare in high-income countries outside the United States.<BR/>Like a number of previous reviews, this review is based on findings of trials that enrolled US youth. However, this is the first review to systematically search for methodologically rigorous evidence from all high-income countries. The fact that we did not find methodologically rigorous program trials outside the US might indicate that such evaluations are inaccessible by existing search methods, or that abstinence-only programs are not popular HIV prevention strategies in other high-income countries. The second possibility appears likely, given the sensitivity of our search and several previous reviews suggesting that abstinence-based approaches are rare outside the US (<LINK REF="REF-Berne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berne 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Jones-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>In general, HIV risk-reduction interventions have low rates of behavior change for abstinent behavior. <BR/>We concur with previous reviews suggesting relatively low rates of behavior change for abstinent behavior and the delay of sexual initiation as a result of HIV prevention interventions among adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Jemmott-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemmott 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kim-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Pedlow-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pedlow 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Robin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robin 2004</LINK>). Our review differs slightly from <LINK REF="REF-Silva-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silva 2002</LINK>, a meta-analysis of school-based programs for the promotion of abstinent behavior. This study included randomized and quasi-experimental trials of abstinence-only, abstinence-plus, and other school-based programs; it found a statistically significant effect for abstinent behavior, but the overall effect size was d=0.05 (95% confidence interval 0.01, 0.09) (<LINK REF="REF-Silva-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silva 2002</LINK>). In sub-group analyses, <LINK REF="REF-Silva-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silva 2002</LINK> found no significant differences between "abstinence-oriented" programs (including abstinence-only and abstinence-plus designs) or safer-sex programs.</P>
<P>In general, HIV risk-reduction interventions do not significantly increase sexual risk behavior. <BR/>Finally, our review also concurs with a recent review and meta-analysis by Smoak, et al, which found that interventions targeting sexual risk behavior do not lead to systematic increases in sexual activity or number of partners (<LINK REF="REF-Smoak-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smoak 2006</LINK>). This review summarized 174 trials of diverse HIV risk reduction interventions; it was not limited to abstinence-only interventions or to high-income countries.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>"Given the methodological limitations of the evidence, the homogeneity of the trial populations, the underutilization of primary outcomes, and the potential variety of abstinence-only strategies, this review cannot draw unequivocal conclusions about all abstinence-only programs in all high-income countries. We also cannot comment on program effectiveness in participant populations outside adolescents and young adults in the United States.</P>
<P>"With these caveats, the available studies show no evidence that abstinence-only programs are effective or harmful for the prevention of HIV among US youth, as measured by self-reported behavioral and biological outcomes. The 13 included trials suggested that abstinence-only programs are ineffective for reducing HIV risk, but the generalizability of these data may be limited. </P>
<P>"Current resource allocation to abstinence-only interventions in the US may not reflect the limited evidence for program effectiveness. Should funding for abstinence-only approaches continue at its current levels, a larger proportion of these resources might be productively invested in rigorous program evaluations with behavioral and biological outcomes. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>

<P>Future research could consult the following methodological needs:<BR/>"Improved reporting of key methodological, clinical, and statistical information (e.g., method of randomization, allocation concealment, procedures for blinding data collectors, numbers of participants per trial arm at follow-up, attrition analyses, means and standard deviations for continuous outcomes). Use of the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).<BR/>"Standardized behavioral outcome measures with consistent follow-up intervals, recall periods, and clinical meanings. Increased use of HIV, STI, and pregnancy as primary outcomes. Disaggregation of oral, anal, and vaginal sex acts. Use of medical evaluation for biological outcomes instead of self-report.<BR/>"More complete reporting of implementation data (i.e., program design, program delivery, participant uptake, and trial context) for intervention and control arms<BR/>"Analyses that account for dropouts (intention-to-treat) and unit of randomization<BR/>"Correction for multiple statistical tests<BR/>"Incorporation of cost-effectiveness and participant satisfaction data<BR/>"Provision of data sets for IPD (individual patient data) analyses</P>

<P>1: "Reaching Adolescents and Parents," developed by the American Red Cross. an 8-session curriculum included 6 sessions for adolescents, 1 session for adolescents and parents, and 1 session for parents. Unclear how many weeks elapsed during the program. Goals were to increase student knowledge about puberty and reproduction, improve communication and decision-making skills, facilitate family communication, and prevent STIs and pregnancy by delaying the onset of sexual activity. Activities included small group discussions, video clips, question-and-answer sessions, discussion of media and peer pressure, confidence-building skill activities, and homework assignments.<BR/>Theoretical basis: Cognitive-behavioral therapy, social learning theory.<BR/>Setting: Community centers and schools.<BR/>Exposure: 8 sessions, duration of sessions unclear.<BR/>Staff: Trained teachers.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>1: "Managing the Pressures Before Marriage (MPM) - Enhanced," based on the Postponing Sexual Involvement curriculum. 5 class sessions over 5 weeks were taught by slightly older peer leaders recruited from local high schools. Sessions focused on understanding the risks of early sex, limit-setting, and assertiveness training. the program stressed abstinence specifically until marriage. Classroom activities included brainstorming, roleplays, skills training and rehearsal. Participants were assigned an additional 5 homework assignments (each with 3-5 activities) to complete with their parents. These assignments focused on understanding the pressures for early sex and improving parent-child communication. Homework completion was monitored.<BR/>Theoretical basis: Social learning theory, social cognitive theory.<BR/>Setting: Curriculum took place in middle school classrooms, and homework was completed outside of school.<BR/>Exposure: 5 class periods over 5 weeks, plus 5 homework assignments.<BR/>Staff: Pairs of youth leaders from local high schools.</P>
<P>2: MPM- non-enhanced. This intervention was the same as in condition 1, but participants were not assigned the 5 additional parent-child homework assignments. All other characteristics the same as 1. the same youth leaders facilitated both sets of programs, but they were not told why control group classes did not receive homework assignments.<BR/>

<P>Funding: US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs.</P>
<P>Random assignment resulted in unequal distribution: 11 intervention classrooms, 8 control classrooms.</P>
<P>Follow-up tests were administered at 7 weeks after baseline, but the recall period for "recent sexual intercourse" was 3 months. These data may therefore span the time period before the intervention was administered. </P>
<P>Very short follow-up.</P>
<P>Self-selection evident in the percentage of condition 1 students choosing to complete the homework: Non-completion of homework assignments in the MPM-enhanced group was significantly higher among males, students reporting recent sexual intercourse, students who did not receive "mostly As in school," and black or Hispanic students (as opposed to non-Hispanic whites).</P>
<P>Fidelity monitoring: a program staff member attended each intervention session, and the trial report states that there was no evidence that the youth leaders' program implementation differed systematically between the intervention and control groups.<BR/>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>1: Abstinence-only intervention ("Abstinence"). One session. Concepts included abstinence, the biology and symptoms of AIDS, transmission, and prevention. Participants received a 7-page written health education program (adapted from the North Carolina Board of Education senior high school AIDS curriculum); they then watched the video "AIDS: What everyone should know" (from Aims Media in Los Angeles). They also received a brochure about AIDS transmission and prevention (from the Fort Bragg Dependents' School System). <BR/>Theoretical basis: Not reported. <BR/>Setting: College classroom.<BR/>Exposure: 45 minutes.<BR/>Staff: Media-based, unclear what staff facilitated the program.</P>
<P>2: Abstinence-plus intervention ("Protection"). Format, staff, exposure, theory, and setting as above, but the intervention "presented abstinence as the safest alternative and safe sex as another alternative." Concepts also included explicit instructions on condom use and discussing safe sex with partners. the written education program amalgamated brochures written by the Duke University Student Health Service and the American College Health Association ("Making Sex Safer"). the video was "AIDS: You're Not Immune" from the Alpha Theta fraternity. the brochure was from HERO, entitled "Safer Sex for Men and Women Concerned About AIDS."</P>
<P>3: Safe-sex intervention ("Decision"). Format, staff, exposure, theory, and setting as above, but the intervention "presented safe sex and described it as an alternative to abstinence." the written curriculum was adapted from the American Red Cross AIDS program for senior high school students. the video was "Letter from Brian," from the American Red Cross. the brochure "AIDS: the Facts" was also from the American Red Cross.</P>

Students received instruction in human sexuality, and then received a 5-session curriculum in class delivered by either adult facilitators or peer leaders. Concepts included risks of early sex, reasons to have sex or wait, resisting social pressures, limit-setting, assertive responses to resist sexual pressures. Activities included class discussions, group activities, videos, slides, and roleplays.<BR/>Theoretical basis: Not reported, but original program was designed using social inoculation theory.<BR/>Setting: Middle school classes (courses included science, health, physical education, and others).<BR/>Exposure: 5 classes, 45-60 mins long. 4 sessions were designed for delivery over 4 consecutive weeks, with the 5th session delivered between one week and one month later.<BR/>Peer staff: Pairs of peer leaders (peer leaders were in high school, slightly older than the study participants). Peer leaders were always accompanied by adult leaders. Adult staff: Professional educators or college interns. Approximately 40% of adult leaders were health educators, 23% were classroom teachers, 23% were student interns, and the others were nurses, youth workers, or volunteers.</P>

Used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (like Bersamin 2005).<BR/>Intervention: Abstinence-only (reported virginity pledge) vs. No reported virginity pledge. <BR/>Findings: 88% of pledgers have sex before marriage, compared to 99% of non-pledgers. Used bio-marker data to test for STDs. No significant differences in STD infection rates between pledgers and non-pledgers. Among married respondents, STD rates also did not differ by pledge status. Pledgers married significantly earlier than non-pledgers. Pledgers were significantly less likely to have used a condom at first sex, but no significant differences were observed in condom use at most recent sex or condom use over the past 12 months before Wave 3 surveys. Pledgers reported sexual initiation at a later age, fewer partners, and lower numbers of non-monogamous partners than non-pledgers. Significantly more pledgers than non-pledgers reported having had oral sex with one or more partners but no vaginal sex. Significantly more male pledgers than male non-pledgers reported having had anal sex but no vaginal sex. Respondents reported condom use for first oral sex for only 4% of relationships involving oral sex. Respondents reported condom use for first anal sex for only 30% of relationships involving anal sex. Hypothesized that the unexpected higher STD acquisition among pledgers was due to the combination of low condom use for oral and anal sex and pledgers' higher likelihood of substituting these acts for vaginal sex.<BR/>

Interventions were aimed at youth with the target age 10-14; 12th-graders were actually too old to participate in the curricula.<BR/>Findings: In a cross-tabulation of the frequency of self-reported sexual activity (i.e., none, 1-2 times, 3 or more times - unclear what the recall period was) with the degree of program implementation by county (i.e., none, weak, strong), the relationship was significant for 12th grade students. Means suggest that students in counties with strong implementation were less likely to report any sex than participants in weak-implementation counties, who were less likely to report any sex than participants in no-implementation counties. This was true for males and females. Analyses were non-significant for 9th-grade students (i.e., the age group that was intended to participate in the curricula).<BR/>
