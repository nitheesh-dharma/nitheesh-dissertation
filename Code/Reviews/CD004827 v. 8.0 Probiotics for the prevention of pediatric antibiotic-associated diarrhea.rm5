<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-12-22 10:49:30 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>
<B>What is antibiotic-associated diarrhea?</B>
</P>
<P>Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) occurs when antibiotics disturb the natural balance of "good" and "bad" bacteria in the intestinal tract causing harmful bacteria to multiply beyond their normal numbers. The symptoms of AAD include frequent watery bowel movements and crampy abdominal pain.</P>
<P>
<B>What are probiotics?</B>
</P>
<P>Probiotics are found in dietary supplements or yogurts and contain potentially beneficial bacteria or yeast. Probiotics may restore the natural balance of bacteria in the intestinal tract.</P>
<P>
<B>What did the researchers investigate?</B>
</P>
<P>The researchers investigated whether probiotics prevent AAD in children receiving antibiotic therapy and whether probiotics causes any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to November 24, 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>What did the researchers find?</B>
</P>
<P>Twenty-three studies were reviewed and provide the best available evidence. The studies tested 3938 children (2 weeks to 17 years of age) who were receiving probiotics co-administered with antibiotics to prevent AAD. The participants received probiotics (<I>Lactobacilli spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp.</I>, or <I>Saccharomyces boulardii</I> alone or in combination), placebo (pills not including probiotics), other treatments thought to prevent AAD (i.e. diosmectite or infant formula) or no treatment. The studies were short-term, ranging in length from 1 to 12 weeks. Analyses showed that probiotics may be effective for preventing AAD. The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (163/1992) compared to 19% (364/1906) in the control group. Probiotics were generally well tolerated, and minor side effects occurred infrequently, with no significant difference between probiotic and control groups. The majority of side effects were reported in the placebo, standard care or no treatment groups. Side effects reported in the studies include rash, nausea, gas, flatulence, abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, vomiting, increased phlegm, chest pain, constipation, taste disturbance, and low appetite. Among the various probiotics evaluated, <I>Lactobacillus rhamnosus </I>or <I>Saccharomyces boulardii</I> at 5 to 40 billion colony forming units/day may be appropriate for preventing AAD in children receiving antibiotics. It is premature to draw conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of other probiotic agents for preventing AAD. Although no serious probiotic-related side effects were observed among the otherwise healthy children who participated in the studies, serious side effects have been observed in severely debilitated or immuno-compromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter (a flexible tube used to give medicines) use and disorders associated with bacterial or fungal translocation (the passage of bacteria from the gut to other areas of the body). Until further research has been conducted, probiotic use should be avoided in children at risk for side effects.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-17 13:23:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antibiotics are frequently prescribed in children. They alter the microbial balance within the gastrointestinal tract, commonly resulting in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Probiotics may prevent AAD via restoration of the gut microflora. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-09-29 18:27:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) used for the prevention of AAD in children.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-12-18 13:27:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, AMED, and the Web of Science (inception to November 2014) were searched along with specialized registers including the Cochrane IBD/FBD review group, CISCOM (Centralized Information Service for Complementary Medicine), NHS Evidence, the International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supplements as well as trial registries. Letters were sent to authors of included trials, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical companies, and experts in the field requesting additional information on ongoing or unpublished trials. Conference proceedings, dissertation abstracts, and reference lists from included and relevant articles were also searched.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-09-29 18:27:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Randomized, parallel, controlled trials in children (0 to 18 years) receiving antibiotics, that compare probiotics to placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment and measure the incidence of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use were considered for inclusion.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-12-18 13:27:12 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Study selection, data extraction as well as methodological quality assessment using the risk of bias instrument was conducted independently and in duplicate by two authors. Dichotomous data (incidence of diarrhea, adverse events) were combined using a pooled risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD), and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea, mean daily stool frequency) as mean difference (MD), along with their corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). For overall pooled results on the incidence of diarrhea, sensitivity analyses included available case versus extreme-plausible analyses and random- versus fixed-effect models. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, <I>a priori</I> subgroup analysis were conducted on probiotic strain, dose, definition of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, as well as risk of bias. We also conducted <I>post hoc</I> subgroup analyses by patient diagnosis, single versus multi-strain, industry sponsorship, and inpatient status. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-12-22 13:14:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Twenty-three studies (3938 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Trials included treatment with either <I>Bacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium butyricum</I>, <I>Lactobacilli spp.</I>, <I>Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc cremoris</I>, <I>Saccharomyces spp., </I>or<I> Streptococcus spp.,</I> alone or in combination. Eleven studies used a single strain probiotic, four combined two probiotic strains, three combined three probiotic strains, one combined four probiotic strains, two combined seven probiotic strains, one included ten probiotic strains, and one study included two probiotic arms that used three and two strains respectively. The risk of bias was determined to be high or unclear in 13 studies and low in 10 studies. Available case (patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 22/23 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show a precise benefit from probiotics compared to active, placebo or no treatment control. The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (163/1992) compared to 19% (364/1906) in the control group (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.61; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 55%, 3898 participants). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate. This benefit remained statistically significant in an extreme plausible (60% of children loss to follow-up in probiotic group and 20% loss to follow-up in the control group had diarrhea) sensitivity analysis, where the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 14% (330/2294) compared to 19% (426/2235) in the control group (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.89; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 63%, 4529 participants). None of the 16 trials (n = 2455) that reported on adverse events documented any serious adverse events attributable to probiotics. Meta-analysis excluded all but an extremely small non-significant difference in adverse events between treatment and control (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01). The majority of adverse events were in placebo, standard care or no treatment group. Adverse events reported in the studies include rash, nausea, gas, flatulence, abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, vomiting, increased phlegm, chest pain, constipation, taste disturbance, and low appetite.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-12-22 13:17:31 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Moderate quality evidence suggests a protective effect of probiotics in preventing AAD. Our pooled estimate suggests a precise (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.61) probiotic effect with a NNT of 10. Among the various probiotics evaluated, <I>Lactobacillus rhamnosus </I>or <I>Saccharomyces boulardii</I> at 5 to 40 billion colony forming units/day may be appropriate given the modest NNT and the likelihood that adverse events are very rare. It is premature to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of other probiotic agents for pediatric AAD. Although no serious adverse events were observed among otherwise healthy children, serious adverse events have been observed in severely debilitated or immuno-compromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter use and disorders associated with bacterial/fungal translocation. Until further research has been conducted, probiotic use should be avoided in pediatric populations at risk for adverse events. Future trials would benefit from a standard and valid outcomes to measure AAD.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-12-18 13:28:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>ANTIBIOTIC-ASSOCIATED DIARRHEA<BR/>More than 400 species of bacteria inhabit the human gut, and a balance of these micro-organisms is important for normal gastrointestinal function (<LINK REF="REF-Madsen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madsen 2001</LINK>). Antibiotic treatment may disturb the colonization resistance of gastrointestinal flora, resulting in a range of symptoms, most notably, diarrhea. In particular, antibiotics such as aminopenicillins, cephalosporins and clindamycin that act on anaerobes are most commonly associated with diarrhea (<LINK REF="REF-Wistrom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wistrom 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Owens-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owens 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McFarland-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 2008</LINK>). In addition to frequent watery bowel movements, urgency and crampy abdominal pain, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is associated with altered intestinal microflora, mucosal integrity and vitamin/mineral metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Saavedra-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saavedra 1999</LINK>). If severe, AAD may lead to electrolyte disturbances, volume depletion, pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon and rarely death (<LINK REF="REF-Berrington-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berrington 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arvola-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Arvola 1999</LINK>). Reports in the general population indicate that the incidence of AAD ranges from 5 to 62%, occurring at any point from the initiation of therapy to two months after the end of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-McFarland-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LaRosa-2003" TYPE="STUDY">LaRosa 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wistrom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wistrom 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McFarland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 1998</LINK>). The incidence of diarrhea in children receiving broad spectrum antibiotics has been reported in the range of 11 to 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Turck-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turck 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elstner-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elstner 1983</LINK>). The overgrowth of many enteropathogens has been associated with antibiotic-induced diarrhea. <I>Clostridium difficile </I>(<I>C. difficile)</I> overgrowth is the bacterial agent most associated with AAD (<LINK REF="REF-McFarland-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McFarland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bartlett-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartlett 1978</LINK>). <I>C. difficile</I> diarrhea is associated with the most serious adverse events, and occurs most often in older, immunocompromised, hospitalized adults, but also occurs in children (<LINK REF="REF-Gogate-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gogate 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The definition of AAD varies across trials. Although the World Health Organization (WHO) defines diarrhea as three or more loose or liquid stools per 24 hours, the definition in pediatric trials ranges from one to three abnormally loose stools per 24 to 48 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2010</LINK>). Additionally, stool frequency is more difficult to quantify in diaper-aged children with diarrhea and may vary substantially between infants and older children.</P>
<P>PROBIOTICS<BR/>Probiotics refer to so-called "friendly" non-pathogenic bacterial or yeast microbiota intended to benefit the host via altering the microflora by implantation or colonization (<LINK REF="REF-Schrezenmeir-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schrezenmeir 2001</LINK>). The rationale behind probiotic administration is based on re-inoculation and normalization of unbalanced indigenous microflora using specific probiotic strains. Probiotics have been administered both prophylactically and therapeutically in an attempt to modify the mucosal, epithelial, intestinal and systemic immune activity in ways that may benefit human health. Probiotics are reported to improve microbial balance in the intestinal tract and display both antibacterial and immune regulatory effects in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldin 1998</LINK>). Probiotics commonly administered in randomized controlled trials of AAD are: <I>Lactobacillus acidophilus</I>, <I>Lactobacillus bulgaris</I>, <I>Lactobacillus casei</I>, <I>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</I>, <I>Bifidobacteria bifidum</I>, <I>Bifidobacteria longum</I>, <I>Streptococcus thermophilus</I>, <I>Saccharomyces boulardii</I> and <I>Clostridium butyicum</I>.</P>
<P>PREVIOUS REVIEWS ON PROBIOTICS AND AAD<BR/>Nine meta-analyses have addressed the use of probiotics, alone or in combination, for the prevention of AAD in adults and children. The results of diverse probiotic agents co-administered with antibiotics favoured probiotics (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.58; <LINK REF="REF-McFarland-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 2006</LINK>; RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.65; <LINK REF="REF-Sazawal-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sazawal 2006</LINK>; RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.57; <LINK REF="REF-Cremonini-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cremonini 2002</LINK> and OR 0.37; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.53; <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Souza-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Souza 2002</LINK>). Additionally, meta-analyses addressing the use of a single probiotic agent to prevent AAD examining <I>Saccharomyces boulardii (S. boulardii) </I>and<I> Lactobacillus</I> have also favoured probiotic treatment (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.67; <LINK REF="REF-Kale_x002d_Pradhan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kale-Pradhan 2010</LINK>; RR 0.47, 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.63; <LINK REF="REF-McFarland-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 2010</LINK>; and RR 0.43; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.78; <LINK REF="REF-Szajewska-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szajewska 2005</LINK>). Three meta-analyses of randomized trials to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics for preventing antibiotic-induced diarrhea in children have also suggested benefit (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.75; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2006</LINK>; RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.77; <LINK REF="REF-Szajewska-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szajewska 2006</LINK>; and RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.72; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2011</LINK>). This systematic review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>SAFETY OF PROBIOTICS<BR/>The safety of diverse probiotic interventions does not appear to be a concern in healthy individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Hempel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hempel 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whelan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whelan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hammerman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammerman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Borriello-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borriello 2003</LINK>). Infections (e.g. bacteremia, endocarditis, septicemia, pneumonia, deep abdominal abscesses) resulting from probiotic use have been reported in neonates, severely debilitated and immuno-compromised individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Land-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Land 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salminen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salminen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mackay-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackay 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Piarroux-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piarroux 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rautio-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rautio 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McFarland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salminen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salminen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saxelin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saxelin 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hata-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hata 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sussman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sussman 1986</LINK>), and there is still debate on the safety of probiotics in these patients. Nevertheless, prospective studies have demonstrated the safety of probiotics in immuno-compromised adults and children with HIV and preterm neonates, with no infections secondary to probiotics reported (<LINK REF="REF-Bin_x002d_Nun-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bin-Nun 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salminen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salminen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cunningham_x002d_Rundles-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham-Rundles 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three systematic reviews have addressed the safety of <I>Saccharomyces boulardii</I> (<I>S. boulardii) </I>and other probiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Hempel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hempel 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McFarland-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whelan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whelan 2010</LINK>).  The first, a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), reports on a wide diversity of adult patients randomized to <I>S. boulardii </I>as part of a clinical trial (traveller&#8217;s diarrhea, n = 1596; AAD, n = 958; acute diarrhea, n = 156; enteral tube feeding, n = 103; IBD, n = 66; IBS, n = 16, HIV-related diarrhea, n = 18 and giardia infections, n = 50). These studies provide safety data for a total of 2963 adult patients. The only adverse reactions associated with <I>S</I>. <I>boulardii </I>were thirst (n = 5 patients) and constipation (n = 8 patients) in a trial of patients with <I>C. difficile </I>infections (<LINK REF="REF-McFarland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 1998</LINK>). No case of <I>S</I>. <I>boulardii </I>fungemia has been reported in these diverse patient populations (<LINK REF="REF-McFarland-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 2010</LINK>). </P>
<P>A systematic review of case reports, randomized and non-randomized trials of probiotic safety in patients receiving nutritional support, such as enteral nutrition or parenteral nutrition, included 53 trials involving 4131 patients receiving probiotics.  Most trials demonstrated either no effect or a positive effect on outcomes related to safety (e.g. infections, mortality). Three trials reported increased complications, which were largely noninfectious in nature and specific to patients with pancreatitis or undergoing transplant (<LINK REF="REF-Whelan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whelan 2010</LINK>).  The systematic review also reported 20 case reports of adverse events in 32 patients, 27 of which were infections due to <I>S. boulardii</I> (strain unspecified) or <I>Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG</I> (n = 5). Of the 32 patients having been administered <I>S. boulardii</I> with subsequent infections (i.e. fungemia, bacteremia), 11 of these were in children (either preterm neonates, severely debilitated or immuno-compromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter use and disorders associated with bacterial or fungal translocation). Each of the children recovered after <I>S boulardii </I>or<I> Lactobacillus GG</I> was discontinued, after removal of the central venous catheter (n = 7) and after an antibiotic or anti-fungal was administered (n = 11). The authors of the study reported that these case reports likely reflect the wide use of <I>S boulardii </I>and <I>Lactobacillus GG</I> in clinical settings, rather than increased virulence (<LINK REF="REF-Whelan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whelan 2010</LINK>). The third systematic review, the largest and most comprehensive to date, assessed the safety of probiotics and included both randomized and non-randomized studies (387 studies including 24,615 total participants). Based on short-term probiotic use (compared to control group participants) results of 208 RCTs showed no statistically significant difference in the overall number of adverse events (RR 1.00; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.07), including serious adverse events (RR 1.06; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.16; 66 RCTs primarily based on <I>Lactobacillus </I>species) (<LINK REF="REF-Hempel-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hempel 2011</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-12-18 13:28:23 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The screening, selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were done independently and in duplicate by two investigators.</P>
<P>STUDY SELECTION<BR/>Search results were screened using titles of papers, and when available, abstracts. The full-text of the selected articles was retrieved and assessed for inclusion according to pre-specified selection criteria. Disagreement was resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>DATA EXTRACTION<BR/>Using a standardized data extraction form we extracted the following data: author, year of publication, language, study setting, funding source, definition and diagnostic criteria for diarrhea, inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants, patient characteristics (age, gender, diagnosis, socioeconomic status), number of patients allocated to each group, presence/absence of intention to treat analysis (whether patients for whom data were available were analyzed as randomized), participants lost to follow-up (LTFU), if so, reasons for LTFU described and information about methods of imputation, measures of compliance, specified antibiotic, specified probiotic, duration, dosage and schedule of antibiotic, duration, dosage and schedule of probiotic, and outcome measures (incidence of diarrhea, number of adverse events, mean duration of diarrhea, mean stool consistency, and mean stool frequency).</P>
<P>QUALITY ASSESSMENTS<BR/>Quality components for each included RCT were assessed for selection, detection, performance, reporting and loss to follow-up bias. Each of the included studies was evaluated using the risk of bias instrument to assess sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Hartling-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartling 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>We also employed the GRADE system for rating overall quality of evidence for each of the outcomes. In particular, randomized trials begin as high quality evidence, but may be rated down by one or more of five categories of limitations: (1) risk of bias, (2) consistency, (3) directness, (4) imprecision, and (5) reporting bias.  The quality of evidence for each main outcome can be determined after considering each of these elements, and categorized as either <I>high</I> (we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect); <I>moderate </I>(we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different); <I>low</I> (our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect); <I>very low</I> (we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS<BR/>Results were combined unless diversity (clinical and/or statistical heterogeneity) suggested combination was unreasonable. Dichotomous data are presented as risk ratios (RR), and continuous data as mean difference, along with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Using control event risks from the included trials, the number needed to treat (NNT) or the number needed to harm (NNH) was calculated for statistically significant dichotomous outcomes. Adverse events were summarized using risk difference since these events were rare. Random-effects models were used and fixed-effect models were considered in sensitivity analyses. Heterogeneity was investigated using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Meta-regression or the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for heterogeneity - depending on the number of trials included - were used to address <I>a priori</I> hypotheses explaining heterogeneity. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, <I>a priori</I> subgroup analyses were subdivided by: probiotic strain(s) (when two or more trials administered the same strains), diagnostic criteria for diarrhea (e.g. &#8805; 3 watery/liquid stools per day for 2 consecutive days versus &#8805; 3 watery/liquid stools per day), dosage of probiotic (&#8805; 5 billion colony forming units of live bacteria/yeast, &lt; 5 billion colony forming units of live bacteria/yeast) and quality criterion (e.g. risk of bias instrument). We also explored heterogeneity with four <I>post hoc</I> subgroups including diagnosis, industry sponsorship, inpatient versus outpatient, and single strain versus multi-strain probiotics. To assess the potential influence of missing outcome responses (e.g. children lost to follow up) sensitivity analyses were applied for the primary outcome, incidence of diarrhea. Although many approaches exist for evaluating the sensitivity of results to missing responses (<LINK REF="REF-Akl-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akl 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>), we elected to make assumptions about the missing data which were extreme but still plausible (i.e. 60% of children loss to follow-up in probiotic group and 20% loss to follow-up in the control group had diarrhea). To evaluate the potential for publication bias, a funnel plot, was applied to the main efficacy outcome, incidence of diarrhea. If publication bias was apparent, adjustment of the pooled estimates was considered using the trim and fill method (<LINK REF="REF-Duval-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duval 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>A previous literature search conducted in August 2006 identified 10 relevant studies for inclusion (7 English, 2 Italian, 1 French) and is described in detail elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2007</LINK>). An updated search was conducted in November 2014. A total of 2382 studies were identified from the primary electronic databases (Medline 680, EMBASE 1025, CENTRAL 337, CINAHL 1, Web of Science 271, AMED 3, IBD/FBD SR 65). A grey literature search of EMBASE (limited to conference abstracts, conference papers, or conference reviews), ClinicalTrials.gov, Scopus (limited to conference papers and reviews), and NICE Evidence Services, as well as bibliographic review of relevant meta-analyses identified an additional 18 relevant studies. See <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Of all of these studies, 750 were identified as duplicates, leaving 1650 abstracts and titles identified as original publications. Independent review of these titles and abstracts identified 57 potentially relevant studies for full-text review. Three authors independently assessed these studies and identified 23 that met the inclusion criteria, seven of which were new since the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2011</LINK>).

<B>Incidence of diarrhea<BR/>
</B>To allow for a heterogeneous definition of diarrhea, data (as a binary outcome) were included based on the primary authors' definition of the presence or absence of diarrhea. Twenty-two studies (n = 3898) reported the incidence of diarrhea. Using an available case (i.e. patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) approach as the primary analysis, six placebo-controlled studies showed a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of AAD (P &lt; 0.05) (<LINK REF="STD-Ruszczynski-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ruszczynski 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kotowska-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kotowska 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LaRosa-2003" TYPE="STUDY">LaRosa 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanderhoof-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderhoof 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saneeyan-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Saneeyan 2011</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fox-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 2015</LINK>); one active-controlled study (formula) was statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Correa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Correa 2005</LINK>), and three 'no treatment-control' study demonstrated statistical significance (<LINK REF="STD-Erdeve-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Erdeve 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Shan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Shan 2013</LINK>).

The overall pooled results using an available case analysis showed that the use of probiotics produced a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of AAD. The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% compared to 19% in the active, placebo or no treatment control group (3898 participants; RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.61; random-effects). However, statistically significant heterogeneity was detected (P = 0.0009) and this was moderate with respect to percent variability due to between (or inter -) study variability (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 55%) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).

However, for each of the 14 events it was not clear in which group (treatment or control) the adverse events occurred. It appears that the 14 adverse events occurred in three participants (<LINK REF="STD-Tankanow-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Tankanow 1990</LINK>). It was assumed for the meta-analysis that the adverse events were in the treatment group. <LINK REF="STD-Correa-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Correa 2005</LINK> reported five participants with adverse events in the treatment group. These adverse events were related to the tolerability of the formula supplemented with probiotics. <LINK REF="STD-Merenstein-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Merenstein 2009</LINK> reported a case of emesis in the treatment group and a case of constipation in the control group. <LINK REF="STD-Szajewska-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Szajewska 2009</LINK> reported 18 adverse events in the treatment group and 13 in the control group.

However eight of the reported adverse events were diarrhea which we counted as our primary outcome. This left four participants with non-diarrhea adverse events in each group. No statistically significant difference in adverse events was found between groups. Meta-analysis of 16 trials (2455 participants) that included adverse events demonstrated no statistically significant differences in the incidence of adverse events (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of evidence for this outcome was very low due to sparse data (81 events), indirectness and potential selective reporting (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). </P>

<B>Mean duration of diarrhea<BR/>

The standard deviation (SD) for one of the trials was not reported and this information was requested from authors with no response (<LINK REF="STD-Vanderhoof-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderhoof 1999</LINK>). The SD was imputed for <LINK REF="STD-Vanderhoof-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderhoof 1999</LINK> from a study reporting a similar mean duration of diarrhea for treatment and control (<LINK REF="STD-Arvola-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Arvola 1999</LINK>). A post hoc sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the robustness of the mean duration results both before and after imputing data. The weighted mean differnce (WMD) was not statistically significant before including <LINK REF="STD-Vanderhoof-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderhoof 1999</LINK> (WMD -0.42; 95% CI -1.01 to 0.16), although it was statistically significant after imputing the SD data (WMD -0.60, 95% -1.18 to -0.02; 897 participants). Statistically significant heterogeneity was detected (P = 0.008) and this was high with respect to percent variability due to between (or inter -) study variability (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 79%) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of evidence for this outcome was low due to serious inconsistency (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). </P>

</B>Four RCTs reported mean stool frequency (<LINK REF="STD-Szymanski-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Szymanski 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arvola-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Arvola 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vanderhoof-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vanderhoof 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Contardi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Contardi 1991</LINK>). SD data were imputed for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Arvola-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Arvola 1999</LINK>). This study reported a range for the mean stool frequency for both treatment and control which was used to impute a SD for each study arm. A post hoc sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the robustness of the mean stool frequency results both before and after imputing data. The WMD excluding <LINK REF="STD-Arvola-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Arvola 1999</LINK> was -0.36 (95% CI -0.70 to -0.02). After imputing SD data the WMD was not statistically significant -0.30 (95% CI -0.60 to -0.00; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 78%; 425 participants). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of evidence for this outcome was low due to serious inconsistency (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). </P>

A test for interaction did not reveal any statistically significant dose-related heterogeneity (P = 0.05; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 74.4%), although it was of borderline significance. We conducted a <I>post hoc</I> meta-regression on dose which showed a statistically significant association between CFU/day and risk reduction, with higher level of CFUs/day associated with greater risk reduction. On average one billion additional CFUs/day is associated with 1.7% (95% CI 1.5% - 1.9%) increase in RRR and 0.46% (95% CI 0.41% - 0.50%) increase in ARR, both p-values &lt; 0.001.</P>

A subgroup analysis of those trials rated as a low risk of bias versus those rated as exhibiting a high risk of bias showed statistically significant results for the low risk studies (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.60) and high risk studies (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.77 ). A test for interaction was not statistically significant (P = 0.54). Additionally, summary statistics from the subgroups for high risk of bias and low risk of bias did not exhibit an inverse trend between quality and therapeutic effect. In other words, as quality (e.g. randomization, blinding, allocation concealment) increased, the therapeutic effect of probiotics did not decrease.</P>

<B>Incidence of diarrhea analysis</B>
</I>
<BR/>There were 4529 pediatric participants originally randomized in the 22 trials reporting on the primary outcome (incidence of diarrhea). Sixteen of 22 trials reported LTFU of which five reported substantial attrition concerns. Loss to follow-up was 20%, 21%, 28%, 28% and 36% in the <LINK REF="STD-Szajewska-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Szajewska 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arvola-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Arvola 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Benhamou-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Benhamou 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erdeve-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Erdeve 2004</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Tankanow-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Tankanow 1990</LINK> studies respectively. We elected to make assumptions about the missing data which were extreme but still plausible. If no information on the number of patients randomized to each group, or the number LTFU from each group (e.g. not reported in the published trial or unsuccessful contact with authors) was available, it was assumed that the LTFU in the treatment and control groups were as even as possible (block randomization). After imputing data for the missing responses, an extreme-plausible analysis (60% of children loss to follow-up in probiotic group and 20% loss to follow-up in the control group had diarrhea) resulted in a smaller but still statistically and clinically significant effect of intervention (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.89, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 63%). In this sensitivity analysis, the pooled incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 14% compared to 19% in the active, placebo or no treatment control group.</P>

<B>Adverse event analysis</B>
</I>
<BR/>Assuming that patients LTFU in each of the trials may have had adverse events, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the primary available case analysis.  To do so, we decided that a reasonable assumption to make for those who were LTFU was that LTFU had the same adverse event rate as those followed up in their respective randomization groups.  In particular, among the 16 trials that did report adverse events, the proportion of adverse events was 3.1% (39/1241) in the treatment group and 42/1214 (3.5%) in the control group.  For trials that reported LTFU, we assigned the same adverse event rate as those followed up in their respective randomization groups (3.1% and 3.5% assumed to have adverse events among treatment and control groups respectively) to those who were LTFU.  Our primary available case harms analysis (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01) yielded the same pooled estimate as the same event rate assumptions analysis (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01).</P>

Because of the heterogeneity in our sample (Tau² = 0.21), we followed recently proposed guidelines and chose not to run statistical tests of publication bias such as Egger's regression test (<LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2011</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-12-22 10:37:34 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The primary objective of this review was to determine if the co-administration of probiotics with antibiotics prevents or ameliorates AAD in children. Twenty-three eligible studies included treatment with <I>Bacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium butyricum, Lactobacilli spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc cremoris, Saccharomyces spp.,</I> or <I>Streptococcus spp.,</I> alone or in combination. Eight of 23 trials tested <I>S. boulardii</I> or <I>Lactobacillus rhamnosus spp</I>.  Available case (i.e. patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 22/23 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea, demonstrated a precise benefit from probiotics with an incidence of AAD of 8% compared to 19% in the control groups (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.61, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 55%). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one case of diarrhea is ten (NNT 10; 95% CI 8 to 12).</P>
<P>To test the robustness of our available case analysis, we elected to make assumptions about the missing outcome data which were extreme but arguably plausible. Sixteen of 22 trials which reported on our primary outcome reported LTFU (range 2% to 28%). After imputing data for the missing responses, an extreme-plausible analysis (60% of children loss to follow-up in probiotic group and 20% loss to follow-up in the control group had diarrhea) still indicated a statistically and clinically significant benefit for probiotics (4529 participants; RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.89; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 63%).</P>
<P>Statistical heterogeneity was moderate. We specified <I>a priori</I> subgroup hypotheses to explore the heterogeneity in our results that included probiotic species, probiotic dose, risk of bias (e.g., blinding, allocation concealment), and definition of diarrhea. We also conducted <I>post hoc</I> subgroup analyses which included diagnosis type, industry sponsorship, inpatient versus outpatient, and single versus multi strain interventions A test for heterogeneity was significant for one subgroup - definition of diarrhea - which may explain some of the statistical heterogeneity. In the previous version of this review high versus low dose probiotics (over or under 5 billion CFU/day) also had a statistically significant test for interaction. With the addition of seven new trials in this update this test for interaction was not statistically significant (P = 0.05), although higher doses were associated with larger effect sizes in our meta-regression (p &lt; 0.001). Using 11 criteria to evaluate the credibility of the subgroup analysis, the results indicate that the subgroup effect based on definition of diarrhea was convincing (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2010</LINK>); see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). This supports the importance of using consistent and clear definitions of diarrhea in clinical trials. This would reduce heterogeneity in future evidence synthesis. Alternatively, researchers could present their results using various definitions (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Fox-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 2015</LINK>), while also clearly stating their primary outcome definition in a study protocol to avoid bias.</P>
<P>Regarding safety, 16/23 trials reported on adverse events, and no trials reported any serious adverse events. Meta-analysis demonstrated no significant differences in the incidence of any adverse events between treatment and control (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01).</P>
<P>The quality of evidence for each outcome was determined using the GRADE criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>). For the main efficacy outcome, incidence of diarrhea, the quality of evidence was categorized as <I>moderate</I> (the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different) because of substantial heterogeneity which we were unable to explain completely with our <I>a priori</I> or <I>post hoc</I> analyses. For the incidence of adverse events the quality of evidence was categorized as <I>low</I> (our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect). However, probiotics were generally well tolerated and no serious adverse events attributable to probiotics were reported and we feel confident that the absolute effect, if it exists, is small.</P>
<P>Concerning the secondary outcome mean duration of diarrhea (five trials, n = 897), using an available case analysis, probiotics decreased the mean duration of diarrhea by almost three quarters of a day (WMD -0.60; 95% CI -1.18 to -0.02), a statistically significant difference. With respect to differences in mean stool frequency (four trials, n = 425), the available case results were not statistically significant (WMD -0.30 95% CI -0.60, 0.00). For the two secondary outcomes, mean duration of diarrhea and mean stool frequency, the quality of evidence was categorized as <I>low</I> owing to inconsistency (i.e. large statistical heterogeneity with I<SUP>2</SUP> of &gt; 77%, low P value [P &lt; 0.06], point estimates and confidence intervals vary considerably) and imprecision (e.g. confidence intervals include effect estimates that are of questionable patient importance). Furthermore, results for mean duration of diarrhea may be misleading given our suspicion of selective reporting bias. In particular, the majority of studies fail to report results for this key outcome that otherwise would be expected to have been evaluated.  A previous review of RCTs of acute diarrhea reported that duration of diarrhea was the most common primary outcome (72/138 trials, 52% of trials) and this was reported in almost all trials as either a primary or secondary outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2010</LINK>). In this review, only 5 of 23 trials reported duration of diarrhea as a primary or secondary outcome.</P>
<P>This systematic review has several strengths. We asked a clear clinical question and the search strategy for this review was comprehensive including any relevant trials irrespective of language or publication status (i.e. we included unpublished data from <LINK REF="STD-Destura-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Destura unpublished</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Georgieva-unpublished" TYPE="STUDY">Georgieva unpublished</LINK> and obtained pediatric specific data from <LINK REF="STD-Conway-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Conway 2007</LINK>). Additional strengths of the review include its rigorous application of the GRADE criteria for each of the outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>) and the rigorous evaluation of each of the subgroups (e.g. probiotic species, probiotic dose, antibiotic class, risk of bias and definition of diarrhea) using the 11 criteria for assessing subgroup credibility (<LINK REF="REF-Sun-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sun 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review also has some limitations. First, although we previously did a more comprehensive search of the grey literature, for our update search we did not search conference proceedings or dissertation abstracts. Second, some readers may question the pooling of different probiotic species. In keeping with the justification for the combining of probiotic species used in two trials included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Tankanow-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Tankanow 1990</LINK> administered both <I>L. acidophilus</I> with <I>L. bulgaricus</I>; <LINK REF="STD-Jirapinyo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jirapinyo 2002</LINK> administered both <I>L. acidophilus</I> with <I>B. infantis</I>; <LINK REF="STD-Szymanski-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Szymanski 2008</LINK> administered a cocktail of<I> B. longum, L. rhamnosus </I>and<I> L. plantarum</I>), data were pooled because the probiotics used in each trial share the recommended characteristics of a viable probiotic: non-pathogenic properties (noting that further study is needed on <I>L. sporogenes</I>), the ability to survive transit through the gastrointestinal tract, adherence to intestinal epithelium, colonization in the intestinal tract, production of antimicrobial substances, and a good shelf life in food or powdered form (<LINK REF="REF-Goldin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldin 1998</LINK>). To assess differences that may exist between species and strains, we conducted subgroup analyses. Third, our findings are based on an aggregate data meta-analysis and this does not allow us to fully explore patient and intervention level variables that may be associated with AAD. For example, we recently completed a prospective cohort study of 88 children at a large pediatric teaching hospital indicating that children exposed to 3 or more antibiotics are at the highest risk of AAD (34% vs 8%, p&lt;0.01). To explore this issue in meta-analysis, one would require individual patient data which we do not currently have access to.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-12-22 10:38:38 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Moderate quality evidence suggests a protective effect of probiotics in preventing AAD. Our pooled estimate suggests a precise (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.61) probiotic effect with a NNT of 10. Among the various probiotics evaluated, evidence suggests that <I>Lactobacillus rhamnosus </I>or <I>Saccharomyces boulardii</I> at 5 to 40 billion colony forming units/day may be appropriate given the modest NNT and the likelihood that adverse events are very rare. It is premature to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of other probiotic agents for pediatric AAD. Although no serious adverse events were observed among otherwise healthy children, serious adverse events have been observed in severely debilitated or immuno-compromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter use and disorders associated with bacterial/fungal translocation.  Until further research has been conducted, probiotic use should be avoided in pediatric populations at risk for adverse events.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-10-17 14:18:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall quality of the evidence for the primary endpoint of incidence of diarrhea was moderate. We rated the quality of evidence down due to substantial clinical heterogeneity which, for the most part, we were unable to explain via subgroup analyses. More refined trials are needed that test single or multiple strain specific probiotics among outpatients on oral antibiotics and inpatients on intravenous antibiotics. Trials are also needed to assess the safety of probiotics among immune-compromised children. Trials should define potential adverse events <I>a priori</I> and monitor for these adverse reactions according to available guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2004</LINK>). Finally, future trials would benefit from a standard, core set of outcomes in acute diarrhea trials that are valid and reliable (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 2010</LINK>). This would make trials more comparable and help avoid selective reporting bias.<BR/>

<P>Does interaction test suggest low likelihood that chance explains the apparent subgroup effect?</P>

<P>Yes (P = 0.0009). When Fox 2015 is limited to a single definition the test for interaction is still statistically significant (P = 0.02).</P>
