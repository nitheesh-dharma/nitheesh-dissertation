<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Salicylate for treating Kawasaki disease in children and to prevent long-term cardiac abnormalities</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Kawasaki disease is an inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis) which predominantly affects young children, under the age of five years. It was first recognised in children in Japan and is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries. Kawasaki disease can be difficult to diagnose because it has similar symptoms to many common childhood infections. The most important complication of Kawasaki disease is caused by inflammation of the heart (coronary) arteries supplying blood to the heart muscle. This may lead to immediate heart problems and damage to the coronary arteries can also have long-term effects. Salicylate (acetyl salicylate acid, aspirin) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are widely used to treat Kawasaki disease, although salicylate is generally avoided in children because of concerns about serious side effects, particularly the risk of Reye's syndrome causing swelling of the brain and liver. </P>
<P>The review authors identified only one randomised controlled trial, from Japan, reported in 1991. A total of 102 children were randomised to receive IVIG with or without salicylate. There was no clear benefit of adding salicylate to immunoglobulin treatment on the rate of coronary artery abnormalities observed, up to 30 days. The spread of findings was wide and could include a beneficial effect of salicylate. There are theoretical grounds for using salicylate to prevent damage to the coronary arteries. However, there are concerns that aspirin use in children to treat fever can have adverse effects and children with Kawasaki disease who are treated with immunoglobulins have a very low rate of coronary artery abnormalities. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Kawasaki disease is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries. The coronary arteries supplying the heart can be damaged in Kawasaki disease. The principal advantage of timely diagnosis is the potential to prevent this complication with early treatment. Salicylate (acetyl salicylate acid (ASA), aspirin) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are widely used for this purpose. Salicylate is largely otherwise avoided in children because of concerns about serious side effects, particularly the risk of Reyes syndrome.</P>

<P>The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of salicylate in treating and preventing cardiac consequences of Kawasaki disease in children.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-02-17 14:50:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group searched their trials register (last searched January 2009) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (last searched Issue 1, 2009). The authors searched MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2006), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2006), and CINAHL (1982 to July 2006), and reference list of articles. In addition, we contacted experts in the field.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-03 16:25:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>We found one trial involving 102 children which was described as randomised, but it was not possible to confirm the method of treatment allocation. A second comparative study, possibly with a randomised treatment allocation, was also identified. The one randomised trial reported no association between the addition of ASA to IVIG treatment on the rate of coronary artery abnormalities at follow up, but with wide confidence limits. The second, possibly randomised trial did demonstrate a reduction in duration of fever with high dose ASA compared with low dose ASA, but was insufficiently powered to establish the effect on coronary artery abnormalities at follow up.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Until good quality RCTs are carried out, there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether children with Kawasaki disease should continue to receive salicylate as part of their treatment regimen.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-04 15:32:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Kawasaki disease, or mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome is a systemic vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) which predominantly affects children under the age of five years (<LINK REF="REF-Royle-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royle 1998</LINK>). It was first described by Dr Tomisaku Kawasaki in 1967 (<LINK REF="REF-Kawasaki-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kawasaki 1967</LINK>). Despite subsequent advances in treatment and research exploring a superantigen-mediated role in the development of Kawasaki disease (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leung-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leung 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leung-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leung 1995</LINK>), the cause remains unknown. However, epidemiological studies support an infectious agent inducing the disease in a genetically susceptible minority (<LINK REF="REF-Harnden-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harnden 2002</LINK>). Reported incidence rates differ considerably throughout the developed world with rates in Japan 10 times those in the United States and 30 times those in the United Kingdom and Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Dhillon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhillon 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Royle-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royle 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yanagawa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yanagawa 2001</LINK>). Worldwide mortality rates also vary between 0.08% in Japan to 3.7% in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Dhillon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhillon 1993</LINK>). It is unclear whether mortality reflects intrinsic severity of disease, or early recognition and delivery of effective treatment.</P>
<P>The most important complication of Kawasaki disease, inflammation of the coronary arteries leading to formation of aneurysms, occurs in 20% to 30% of untreated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Kato-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kato 1995</LINK>). Thrombosis within an aneurysm, myocardial infarction, and dysrhythmias (defective heart rhythms) may occur in the acute phase of the illness. Patients may also suffer long-term illness or disease as a result of scarring of coronary arteries, thickening of the inner walls of the arteries, and accelerated atherosclerosis (progressive narrowing and hardening of the arteries).</P>
<P>There is no diagnostic test for the disease, and many cases are missed (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1995</LINK>). Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria such as that summarised by the American Heart Association (AHA) in 1993 (<LINK REF="REF-Dajani-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dajani 1993</LINK>). These include fever for five or more days; a polymorphous exanthem (a rash of indefinite or variable appearance); non-purulent conjunctivitis (inflammation of the membranes in the eye without pus); changes in the lips or within the mouth; redness and oedema with later desquamation (peeling of the skin) of the extremities; and at least one cervical lymph node that is &gt;1.5 cm in diameter. </P>
<P>The diagnosis is made when the child has had five days of fever, four of the other five findings, and no evidence of another disease with similar clinical features. However, many common childhood infections have similar clinical features. Furthermore, the diagnostic features of Kawasaki disease may appear sequentially rather than simultaneously. The two features that doctors most often remember are desquamation of the rash and thrombocytosis (increased numbers of platelets in the bloodstream). Unfortunately, these features are the least useful in reaching an early diagnosis because they usually occur later in the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1997</LINK>). Moreover, the clinical diagnostic criteria do not identify every case; "incomplete" or "atypical" cases have come to light because coronary artery aneurysms have been found on echocardiography or at autopsy (<LINK REF="REF-Rowley-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowley 1987</LINK>). One study has shown that more patients with partial findings developed coronary artery abnormalities than did those with a full clinical picture (<LINK REF="REF-Witt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witt 1999</LINK>). As a result of this, many feel justified in making a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease even when children do not meet all the AHA criteria.</P>
<P>The principal advantage of timely diagnosis of Kawasaki disease is the potential to prevent the complication of coronary artery abnormalities by early treatment. Salicylate (aspirin) is widely used for this purpose. Salicylate is now largely otherwise avoided in children because of concerns about serious side effects, particularly the risk of Reyes syndrome. The aims of this systematic review were (i) to identify all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which salicylate was used in the treatment of Kawasaki disease in children (ii) to assess the effectiveness and safety of salicylate.</P>
<P>One further Cochrane Systematic Review on Kawasaki disease has been completed: 'Intravenous immunoglobulin for the treatment of Kawasaki disease in children' (<LINK REF="REF-Oates_x002d_Whitehead-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oates-Whitehead 2003</LINK>), while another is still under way: 'Steroid hormone treatment for Kawasaki disease in children' (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2001</LINK>).</P>

Discrepancies will be resolved by discussion with a third author.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis</HEADING>
<P>One relevant study was found. In this trial (<LINK REF="STD-Furusho-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Furusho 1991</LINK>), the method of randomisation could not be determined despite attempts to contact the authors. In a second study (<LINK REF="STD-Melish-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Melish 1992</LINK>) it was not possible to determine if the trial met the inclusion criteria, despite attempts to contact the first two authors. The latter trial is described, but the results are not presented graphically.</P>
<P>In the one trial that was definitely eligible for inclusion, relative risk (RR) was used as the measure of effect for each dichotomous outcome. Results for this study were expressed as relative risk with 95% confidence intervals and combined for meta-analysis with RevMan software using the Peto-modified Mantel-Haenszel method (<LINK REF="REF-Mantel-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantel 1957</LINK>). If there were sufficient data, a summary statistic for each outcome was to be calculated using a fixed-effect model. Heterogeneity in the data was to be noted and cautiously explored using previously identified characteristics of the studies under the headings 'internal and external validity', particularly focusing on assessments of quality of allocation concealment. A random-effects model was to be used where heterogeneity was detected. The authors planned to perform a priori sensitivity analyses on results to look at the possible contribution of differences in methodological quality; trials of high quality only compared with all trials to examine the stability of the results. Wherever possible, the outcomes were to be pooled statistically.</P>
<P>Continuous outcomes were to be shown as mean differences, and if pooling was appropriate and possible weighted mean differences (WMD) were to be used, with a fixed-effects model.</P>
<P>For future updates of this review, if there are a sufficient number of trials of adequate size, it may be possible to conduct sub-group analyses. Ability to conduct sub group analyses will also depend on whether or not the required information is recorded in the trial publications. Possible sub-groups include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Comparison of the effect of salicylate across differing diagnostic criteria</LI>
<LI>Timepoint in the disease process when salicylate is first administered</LI>
<LI>Duration of salicylate treatment</LI>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Thirty-two abstracts identified in the search initially appeared to fit the criteria for the review. After obtaining the full papers, the reference lists indicated another thirteen papers that were of interest. However, after reviewing all of the papers, we excluded forty three papers leaving two possible papers for inclusion. One of these papers (<LINK REF="STD-Furusho-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Furusho 1991</LINK>) did state that the trial was randomised, however it failed to give a method of randomisation and the authors did not reply to requests for further information. The second of these papers (<LINK REF="STD-Melish-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Melish 1992</LINK>) did not indicate whether any randomisation was used. Again, the authors failed to reply to requests for further details. Both studies are reviewed, but in view of the uncertainties about method of treatment allocation, the <LINK REF="STD-Melish-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Melish 1992</LINK> study was excluded, and no formal meta-analysis of outcomes was undertaken. This decision will be reassessed if we receive clarification of the treatment allocation methods used.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Furusho-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Furusho 1991</LINK> study compared ASA alone with IVIG and ASA treatment, and with IVIG alone. The dose of IVIG was 200 mg/kg daily for five days, and of ASA was 30 to 50 mg/kg/day in three divided doses until the fever had subsided, then 10 to 30 mg/kg/day once a day until "the acute reaction had also disappeared." Sixteen centres took part, and children were enrolled if they presented within seven days of the onset of symptoms. Children with recurrent Kawasaki disease, with coronary artery abnormalities at presentation, and with incomplete criteria were excluded. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed three times a week until 60 days after the onset of symptoms, and any abnormalities on echocardiography were followed by selective coronary angiography. The appearance of coronary artery abnormalities was presented both for lesions appearing before day 30 of the illness and those present on day 30. The results of the children receiving ASA alone are not reported here. Children in the two groups did not differ significantly in respect to age at presentation, sex, or time from onset of symptoms to trial entry.</P>
<P>The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Melish-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Melish 1992</LINK>) was described as a multicenter trial but without any mention of random treatment allocation. It compared low dose (3 to 8 mg/kg/day for three months, LDA) and high dose (100 mg/kg/day until illness day 14, then 3 to 8 mg/kg/day, HDA) ASA in 85 children with Kawasaki disease presenting in the first 10 days of illness. All children received 2 gm/kg of intravenous gamma globulin. Patients were hospitalised until afebrile for at least 24 hours. Children were stated not to differ in entry parameters: age, illness duration, race, white blood cell count (WBC), platelets, or acute phase reactants. The abstract reported the number of children "enrolled to date" suggesting that trial recruitment was not complete. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Furusho-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Furusho 1991</LINK> study stated that the method of treatment allocation was random, but did not describe the method of randomisation, and it was therefore not possible to determine the adequacy of concealment prior to allocation. Although the care given appeared otherwise to be equivalent, there appeared to be 12 withdrawals after randomisation, and neither participants, care providers nor outcome assessors were blind to treatment following allocation. The measures of external validity were satisfactory.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Melish-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Melish 1992</LINK> study was only reported in an abstract. It did not state whether the method of treatment allocation was random. The location and number of treatment centres was not described. The degree of allocation concealment, and assessments of internal and external validity were all unclear. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Furusho-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Furusho 1991</LINK> study reported:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the incidence of new coronary artery lesions up to 30 days after the onset of symptoms (9 of 49 children receiving ASA and IVIG, 10 of 53 children receiving IVIG alone);</LI>
<LI>the prevalence of new coronary artery lesions at 30 days after the onset of symptoms (5 of 49 children receiving ASA and IVIG, 4 of 51 children receiving IVIG alone).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>No significant difference was found in the incidence of CALs prior to 30 days from onset of symptoms (RR 0.97; 95% Confidence intervals (CI) 0.43 to 2.19) or at 30 days post onset of symptoms (RR 1.30; 95% CI 0.37 to 4.56). </P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Melish-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Melish 1992</LINK> study reported the following outcomes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the existence of coronary artery abnormalities on admission (none of 45 children receiving LDA, 2 of 40 children receiving HDA);</LI>
<LI>the development of coronary artery abnormalities at follow up (1 of 45 children receiving LDA, 1 of 40 children receiving HDA);</LI>
<LI>the prevalence of fever (T &#8805; 38<SUP>o</SUP>C) on day three (40% of 45 children receiving LDA, 18% of 40 children receiving HDA; absolute numbers not reported);</LI>
<LI>the prevalence of fever (T &#8805; 38<SUP>o</SUP>C) on day six (9% of 45 children receiving LDA, 3% of 40 children receiving HDA; absolute numbers not reported);</LI>
<LI>the duration of hospitalisation (4.32 days in children receiving LDA, 3.32 days in children receiving HDA; standard deviations were not reported).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Salicylate levels were reported as being undetectable in children receiving LDA, whereas free (mean 2.6 mg/dl, range 1.6 to 11.5) and total (mean 10.8 mg/dl, range &lt; 4 to 34) serum salicylate levels were detected in children receiving HDA. The authors stated that "bilirubin and ALT values showed no difference. After treatment, thromboxane and prostacyclin metabolites were suppressed in both HDA and LDA groups." </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The included RCT <LINK REF="STD-Furusho-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Furusho 1991</LINK> had no information regarding the method of randomisation and as the other study <LINK REF="STD-Melish-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Melish 1992</LINK> did not state whether treatment was randomised, it was not included. </P>
<P>Results from three of the 43 excluded studies, including one non-randomised study and two reviews, may be of interest to clinicians and fuel further research.</P>
<P>A non-randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Akagi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Akagi 1991</LINK>) was excluded as treatment was "assigned alternatively by age and sex". Reported outcomes were duration of fever and incidence of CALs in low and high dose ASA groups; no IVIG treatment was used in this trial. The high dose group were given 100 mg/kg/day of ASA for 14 days; the low dose group received 30 mg/kg/day for 14 days. It was not stated in the paper how long after the onset of symptoms and treatment outcomes were measured. The authors found no significant difference between incidence of CALs between the high dose and low dose groups (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.25 to 2.00). There was however, a significant difference in favour of the high dose group in duration of fever (WMD -2.20; 95% CI -3.87 to -0.53) days. The results of this study cannot be extrapolated to children receiving IVIG treatment. </P>
<P>A 1997 meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Terai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Terai 1997</LINK>), reviewed fifteen US and Japanese multicentre, randomised controlled studies regarding the effect of various doses of intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) administered within the first seven days of illness on the prevalence of coronary artery abnormalities in Kawasaki disease. The authors state that the prevalence of coronary abnormalities was inversely related to the total dose of IVIG and was independent of the aspirin dose. However, none of the RCTs included actually directly compared ASA of different doses, ASA versus placebo or IVIG, or ASA versus IVIG alone. Therefore these results should be approached with caution. </P>
<P>A further meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Durongpisitkul-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Durongpisitkul 1995</LINK>), reviewed 24 articles (28 studies). These included both retrospective and prospective studies, and the only included RCTs randomised IVIG, not ASA. This meta-analysis pooled data from the sample populations from the various studies and analysed the resulting data set. Although the authors concluded that there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of CALs both at 30 and 60 days between the high IVIG and low ASA versus high IVIG and high ASA groups, this was based on non-random treatment allocation between high and low dose ASA. </P>
<P>The very limited evidence from the comparison studies above seem to concur that there was no demonstrable effect in reduction of CALs from salicylate treatment. However, the studies are underpowered, and important treatment effects are still possible. The non-randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Akagi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Akagi 1991</LINK>) and the possibly randomised comparison study (<LINK REF="STD-Melish-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Melish 1992</LINK>) did both find a relationship between increased ASA dosage and reduction in the duration of fever. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-11-03 16:25:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>We found one randomised controlled trial (RCT) examining the effect of ASA for the treatment of Kawasaki disease in children. This did not demonstrate any effect of salicylate in addition to IVIG on the rate of coronary artery lesions when compared with IVIG alone, but with very wide confidence limits. Although a non-randomised study and a study where the method of treatment allocation could not be confirmed, reported no association between ASA in combination with IVIG or ASA alone, or low dose ASA compared with high dose ASA with effect on CALs, they did find a reduction in duration of fever in children treated with high dose ASA. Neither reported any deleterious effects from ASA administration. Thus, until good quality RCTs are carried out, the existing evidence from RCTs does not permit any recommendation for or against treatment of children with Kawasaki disease with salicylate in combination with IVIG.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>As there are theoretical grounds for considering that ASA, with its anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet properties, might help to prevent coronary artery disease, high quality randomised controlled trials on the efficacy of aspirin (or other similar drugs) used as an adjunct to high dose IVIG in the treatment of Kawasaki disease need to be performed, especially in the light of concerns that aspirin use in children to treat fever can have adverse effects. Given the very low rate of coronary artery abnormalities in children treated with IVIG, and the low rate of serious adverse effects from aspirin use in children, any trial would need to be extremely large in order to achieve adequate power.</P>
