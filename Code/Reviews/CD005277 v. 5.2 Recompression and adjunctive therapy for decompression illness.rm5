<TITLE>Recompression therapy and adjunctive drug therapy for decompression illness (the bends)</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-03-20 03:32:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>Decompression illness (DCI) is due to the presence of bubbles in the tissues or blood vessels following the reduction of surrounding pressure (decompression). It is most commonly associated with breathing compressed gas while diving underwater. The effects of DCI may vary from the trivial to life-threatening and treatment is usually administered urgently. Recompression is applied while breathing 100% oxygen or a mixture of oxygen and helium (heliox), based on the reduction in bubble size with pressure and more rapid elimination of nitrogen from the bubbles when breathing nitrogen poor mixtures. Recovery without recompression can be slow and incomplete and DCI is responsible for significant health problems in geographical areas where recompression is unavailable. Recompression with 100% oxygen has become universally accepted as the appropriate therapy despite the lack of high quality clinical evidence of effectiveness. This review found only two randomized trials enrolling a total of 268 patients. One trial compared standard oxygen recompression to helium and oxygen recompression, while the other compared oxygen recompression alone to recompression and an adjunctive non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Both trials suggested that these additional interventions may shorten the course of recompression required. For example, the use of an NSAID reduced the median number of recompression sessions required from three to two. We conclude that there is little evidence for using one recompression strategy over another in the treatment of decompression illness and that the addition of an anti-inflammatory drug may shorten the course of recompression required. More research is needed.</P>

<P>Two randomized controlled trials enrolling a total of 268 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Pooling of data was not possible. In one study there was no evidence of improved effectiveness with the addition of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (tenoxicam) to routine recompression therapy (at six weeks: relative risk (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.20, P = 0.58) but there was a reduction in the number of compressions required when tenoxicam was added from three to two (P = 0.01, 95% CI 0 to 1). In the other study, the odds of multiple recompressions were lower with a helium and oxygen (heliox) table compared to an oxygen treatment table (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.00, P = 0.05).</P>

<P>Recompression therapy is standard for the treatment of DCI, but there is no randomized controlled trial evidence for its use. Both the addition of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug<B> </B>(NSAID) and the use of heliox may reduce the number of recompressions required, but neither improve the odds of recovery. The application of either of these strategies may be justified. The modest number of patients studied demands a cautious interpretation. Benefits may be largely economic and an economic analysis should be undertaken. There is a case for large randomized trials of high methodological rigour in order to define any benefit from the use of different breathing gases and pressure profiles during recompression therapy.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-03-21 10:43:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-03-21 10:43:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>Decompression illness (DCI) is the term given to the clinical manifestations of bubble formation in the blood or tissues following a reduction in ambient pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Brubakk-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brubakk 1999</LINK>). Decompression illness most commonly occurs in relation to compressed air or mixed gas diving, but it may also arise in aviators following rapid ascent to altitude or cabin decompression and in astronauts participating in 'space walks' (<LINK REF="REF-Moon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moon 2003</LINK>). The term covers two different problems, arterial gas embolism (AGE) caused by the presence of bubbles in the arterial blood vessels; and decompression sickness (DCS) caused by bubbles in the veins and tissues. Arterial gas embolism may arise with entry of bubbles into the pulmonary veins through damage to lung tissue from the air trapped in the distal airways during ascent (pulmonary barotrauma); or via an abnormal communication between the right and left sides of the heart, where blood can pass from the venous circulation to the arterial circulation without going through the lungs. Direct venous to arterial passage of bubbles in this way avoids the lung capillaries, which act as a very effective filter for bubbles and allow the safe evolution of gas into the expired breath. Decompression sickness may develop when venous and tissue bubbles form from dissolved inert gas that accumulated during the period of time under pressure. Bubbles may cause harm through mechanical distortion of tissues, vascular obstruction or stimulation of immune mechanisms that lead to tissue oedema, haemoconcentration and hypoxia. </P>
<P>Arterial blood vessels are a particular target for damage by intravascular bubbles, where they disrupt the luminal surfactant layers, damage the endothelium and stimulate intraluminal blood elements (particularly white blood cells and platelets) to clump together and obstruct the flow within the vessel. Secondary interactions between these elements result in leaking vessels and further reductions in flow (<LINK REF="REF-Helps-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helps 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hills-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hills 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nossum-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nossum 1999</LINK>). This mechanism does not seem to be important with regard to venous bubbles, possibly due to the low pressure nature of this system.</P>
<P>The two pathological entities (AGE and DCS) are difficult to distinguish clinically and are treated with similar strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1992</LINK>). It is, therefore, accepted practice to make the clinical diagnosis of 'DCI' in the understanding that one or both of the two pathologies may be operating. We will use the generic term of DCI in this review except when we refer to the specific pathological mechanisms that cause AGE and DCS.</P>
<P>Clinically, DCI has many possible manifestations, from mild, vague constitutional symptoms to sudden loss of consciousness, death or paralysis (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 2003</LINK>). The most important target tissues are the central nervous system and the musculoskeletal system, with musculoskeletal pain being the most common symptom in the early stages. More recently it has been suggested that constitutional symptoms similar to those experienced during viral illness may be a manifestation of DCI (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rudge-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudge 1991</LINK>). Without an objective method of determining whether symptoms are due to bubble formation these mild symptoms will sometimes result in misdiagnosis. Severe illness is now uncommon in the developed world, but severe DCI leading to permanent disability or death remains a significant problem for poorly trained indigenous commercial divers around the developing world (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moon 2003</LINK>). While the overall incidence of DCI in that setting has not been determined, a number of studies have reported both the incidence and prevalence of DCI and its long-term effects in individual diving populations. In one prospective study the proportion of divers who reported ever having DCI was 94.4%, and 10% had residual signs of spinal injury. Mortality was estimated at 4% of indigenous divers per year in another group (<LINK REF="REF-Bourke-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourke 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cross-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cross 1998</LINK>). In contrast, the incidence of DCI among recreational divers in Canada was estimated at 0.01% of dives over 14 months (<LINK REF="REF-Ladd-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ladd 2002</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-03-20 03:45:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>Recompression usually involves placing the patient in an airtight vessel, increasing the pressure within that vessel and administering 100% oxygen for respiration. Typically, treatments involve pressurization to between two and six atmospheres absolute (ATA) for periods between two hours and several days. The optimal treatment strategy for differing clinical presentations is not apparent however by far the most commonly used regimen is the United States Navy Treatment Table 6 (USN TT6), a 2.8 ATA maximum pressure, 100% oxygen breathing schedule which lasts a total of four hours and 45 minutes (<LINK REF="REF-DAN-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DAN 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The historical development of recompression treatment tables was well described by Moon and Gorman (<LINK REF="REF-Moon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moon 2003</LINK>). Pol and Wattelle first proposed recompression (while breathing air) as a treatment for DCI in 1854, but it was not used systematically in practice until 1896 during the construction of the Hudson river tunnel. This project involved many workers spending long shifts in a pressurized working chamber known as a caisson (<LINK REF="REF-Moir-1896" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moir 1896</LINK>). Mortality of 25% of cases recorded prior to institution of recompression was dramatically reduced with recompression. In a subsequent tunnel project in New York, Keays demonstrated a recurrence rate of symptoms of 13.7% in workers with DCI who were treated with analgesics and 'stimulants' compared to 0.5% when treated with recompression (<LINK REF="REF-Keays-1909" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keays 1909</LINK>). Recompression on air became the standard therapy for DCI until the introduction of 100% oxygen breathing during recompression in 1944, following the work of Yarbrough and Behnke (<LINK REF="REF-Yarbrough-1939" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yarbrough 1939</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-03-20 03:47:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>With the application of pressure and oxygen, or helium and oxygen breathing, there is a reduction in bubble size according to Boyle's Law (the product of pressure and volume is a constant, so if the pressure is doubled then the volume of any bubble is halved), as well as a greatly enhanced movement of nitrogen out of any bubbles down a steep diffusion gradient (<LINK REF="REF-Moon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moon 2003</LINK>). At the same time there is a greatly increased partial pressure of oxygen supplied to the tissues and this may have profound effects on the development of inflammatory changes, ischaemia-reperfusion injury and endothelial function in the tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Thom-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thom 2009</LINK>). Any or all of these mechanisms may contribute to the observed improvement in clinical symptoms and signs of DCI. Whatever the mechanism, a review of the effectiveness of the United States Navy oxygen treatment tables suggests complete relief of symptoms in 50% to 98% of individuals, apparently depending on the severity of illness and period of time elapsed between development of DCI and recompression (<LINK REF="REF-Thalmann-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thalmann 1996</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-03-20 03:49:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>Many variations of recompression on oxygen, air, and helium and oxygen mixtures have been proposed and used. Although recompression in some form remains the mainstay of treatment for DCI, it is not clear whether there is one particular recompression table to be preferred. In addition, a number of 'first aid' and adjunctive therapies have been applied in the hope of improving rates of complete resolution. Strategies suggested include the maintenance of a horizontal position (to prevent movement of intravascular bubbles into the cerebral circulation); 100% oxygen administration at one atmosphere; and the administration of intravenous or oral fluids, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, lignocaine and diazepam. These strategies (and others) have been recently summarized by Moon (<LINK REF="REF-Moon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moon 2003</LINK>). It is important to consider that any one of these strategies, when combined with recompression, might modify the outcome of DCS and AGE in opposite directions.</P>

<P>Although pooling of data was not appropriate in this review, the following is our plan for dealing with any such data in the future. For proportions (dichotomous outcomes), we would calculate relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). All analyses will be made on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, where possible; where not possible, this will be clearly stated. Where the 95% CI for the absolute risk difference does not cross zero, we will calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) from the standard recompression event rate and the experimental group rate. The 95% CI would be calculated from the 95% CI of the risk difference between the groups.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For this analysis of single trials, we examined any differences between treatment groups using a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> analysis. For the pooling of dichotomous outcomes we planned to calculate the summary estimate as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We would estimate the RR using the intention-to-treat (ITT) data of the treatment group (hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)) compared with the ITT of the control group. The dichotomous outcomes included the following.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Mortality rate.</LI>
<LI>Severe functional disability rate, or death.</LI>
<LI>Complete recovery rate.</LI>
<LI>Adverse events.</LI>
</OL>
<P>For these outcomes, we plan to analyse the number of reported events in each arm against the number of participants originally randomised to that arm at trial enrolment (ITT). We would then undertake sensitivity analyses to include people (events) potentially lost to follow-up (see <LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK>).</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2003</LINK>, 180 participants presenting for management of DCI, with exclusion of those with a clinical diagnosis of AGE, were randomized to either routine recompression therapy or routine recompression therapy with the addition of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (tenoxicam). Those with a firm clinical diagnosis of AGE were excluded on the basis of a lack of expectation of therapeutic benefit and some criticism that the administration of oral medication was not appropriate in this group (personal knowledge). The randomization schedule stratified those enrolled into five groups by disease severity using a clinical scoring system. The recompression schedule was not specified in the protocol but was prescribed at the discretion of the treating physician. In the active therapy arm, tenoxicam 20 mg was administered at the first air break during recompression and daily for seven days, while in the control arm a placebo medication was administered on the same schedule. Results were given for 164 of the 180 patients enrolled (91%). The primary outcome variable in this trial was complete recovery of symptoms and signs measured at completion of recompression therapy and at six weeks. Any mortality was also reported, as was the number of recompression sessions administered.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Drewry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Drewry 1994</LINK>, 88 patients with a clinical diagnosis of DCI were randomized to an initial recompression schedule of either 100% oxygen breathing at 2.8 ATA (equivalent to 18 metres of seawater) pressure, with subsequent higher pressure options on oxygen and nitrogen mixtures if the response was less than an 80% improvement, or a schedule involving breathing 50% oxygen with 50% helium at 2.8 ATA with similar higher pressure options breathing oxygen and helium mixtures in the event of less than 80% improvement. No details were given as to how an 80% improvement was calculated. To date, this trial has been reported as interim results in an abstract only. Eighteen of the 88 participants (20.5%) were withdrawn from analysis due to failure to meet the entry criteria (retrospectively) or because of protocol violations, and a further 14 had not reached final follow-up. Therefore only 56 participants (64% of those enrolled) had outcomes reported in the abstract. This trial reported the proportion of participants who required multiple compressions prior to discharge.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2003</LINK> reported no difference in the proportion of participants who were completely recovered at discharge or six weeks later (at discharge: 59/84 (70%) in the placebo group versus 53/84 (63%) in the tenoxicam group; at six weeks: 64/80 (80%) with placebo versus 70/84 (83%) with tenoxicam). The analysis of the chance of recovery with tenoxicam as part of this review confirmed the lack of a significant effect (at discharge: relative risk (RR) for recovery with tenoxicam of 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.11, P = 0.33); at six weeks: RR for recovery with tenoxicam 1.04, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.20, P = 0.58). However, this result was sensitive to the outcome of those lost to follow-up, with a best case analysis suggesting that the chance of recovering completely at six weeks was improved with tenoxicam (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.39, P = 0.03). See <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>.</P>
<P>This trial reported a difference in the number of recompressions required to reach these outcomes. The placebo group required a median of three treatments (range one to eight) while the tenoxicam group required a median of two treatments (range one to six); this difference was reported as significant (P = 0.01, 95% CI 0 to 1). Analysis of the proportion of participants, suggested a benefit from the administration of tenoxicam (55/90 (61%) of the placebo group versus 35/90 (39%) of the tenoxicam group). The RR for requiring more than two treatments with tenoxicam was 0.64 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.86, P = 0.005). A stratified analysis by the severity grade of DCI on presentation suggested this treatment effect was present across the range of severities tested. This analysis suggested a need to treat five patients to reduce the number of compressions required for one extra patient (NNT 5, 95% CI 3 to 18). See <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Drewry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Drewry 1994</LINK> reported that the proportion of participants requiring multiple recompressions was significantly smaller in the oxygen and helium group (heliox) (9/25 (36%) versus 20/31 (65%), P = 0.03). Analysis in this review identified that the chance of multiple recompressions was lower with heliox (RR 0..52, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.95, P = 0.03). This analysis suggested the need to treat four individuals with helium and oxygen in order to have one extra individual requiring only a single recompression (NNT = 4, 95% CI 2 to 31).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-03-20 06:44:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-03-20 06:26:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Michael H Bennett">
<P>This review included only two trials that together enrolled a modest 268 patients. The proportion of participants requiring more than one recompression was significantly reduced by the use of an aggressive helium and oxygen recompression regimen in which treatment depth and duration were determined by symptom response (RR 0.52) (<LINK REF="STD-Drewry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Drewry 1994</LINK>). The addition of the NSAID tenoxicam to a standard recompression treatment also reduced the requirement for recompression by one treatment (RR 0.64) (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2003</LINK>). This reduction in the number of compressions required to treat DCI is examined in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, along with a sensitivity analysis for the control group risk of a second treatment, assuming the RR is unchanged at different baseline risks. Our best estimate is that 391 extra compressions are avoided for each 1000 cases seen when the control group risk is 611 per 1000 cases (as for the control group in <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2003</LINK>). The median number of treatments required was 3 (range 1 to 8) in the recompression group versus 2 (range 1 to 6) in the tenoxicam and recompression group. Analysis suggested a modest treatment-sparing effect with an NNT of five patients to reduce the number of recompression treatments required by at least one. A subgroup analysis by severity score suggested this benefit may extend across all severity grades, but it was underpowered to produce a definitive result.</P>
<P>Neither trial was designed to address our primary outcome of the benefit of recompression versus an alternative therapy for the treatment of decompression illness, and in neither trial was the ultimate success of treatment significantly influenced by treatment allocation.</P>
<P>There are a few major adverse effects of recompression (pulmonary barotrauma, acute cerebral oxygen toxicity, or death related to chamber fire) and short courses of non-steroidal drugs (renal failure or significant gastric bleeding). While these are all rare enough not to be seen in the trials included in this review, they should be included in consideration of any benefit of these therapies. In practice, it is likely that a beneficial effect strong enough to be clearly identified in clinical trials would overwhelm the consideration of such rare events. There are, however, a number of more minor complications that may occur commonly and <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2003</LINK> reported six individuals with minor adverse effects. None of the six were withdrawn from therapy.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-03-20 06:35:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We did not find randomized controlled trial evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of recompression versus no recompression for the management of DCI. Recompression is a universally accepted therapy for DCI and, for ethical reasons, is most unlikely to be subject to randomized investigation against sham therapy in the future. The two trials considered in this review looked at alternative recompression strategies (<LINK REF="STD-Drewry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Drewry 1994</LINK>) and an NSAID drug as an adjunctive therapy to standard recompression (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2003</LINK>), respectively. The results could not therefore be pooled for meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The impact of the heliox regimen should be interpreted carefully in the context of local patient characteristics and the expected rate of multiple compressions. While calculation of the NNT with heliox using the control event rate in this study (65% required multiple compression) is four, this estimate is sensitive to the actual event rate in practice at other treatment facilities. For example, the data from 591 cases of DCI reported by the Divers Alert Network in 2001 suggest the proportion receiving multiple compressions is 50% (<LINK REF="REF-DAN-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DAN 2001</LINK>). Using this as the control event rate and an RR of 0.56 as our best estimate of effect suggests an NNT of five. Also of potential importance is the consideration that the treatment protocol was quite complex for both arms of the study and ultimately allowed for the participants to enter a saturation treatment that may have lasted for several days. This mode of treatment is unlikely to be a realistic prospect for most treatment facilities and the clinical relevance of this finding is therefore unclear. More information is needed on the actual profiles used and the clinical outcome of participants in this trial. This is important because it is possible that any benefit of heliox treatment may have arisen from an interaction with complex, long, high pressure recompression protocols that might be impractical in many hyperbaric units.</P>
<P>The methodology in <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2003</LINK> is more directly applicable to clinical practice. These authors reported the dichotomous outcome 'one or two treatments versus more than two treatments' on the basis that the standard recompression approach in many Australasian institutions is to continue recompression treatments until resolution of symptoms plus one further recompression session, or until symptoms plateau for two consecutive recompression sessions. Thus, for many physicians two recompression sessions is a minimal treatment course. Prior to conducting this trial the median requirement in our unit was three sessions, and this is probably representative of common practice (personal knowledge). Similar considerations concerning the interpretation of NNT apply here as well as to <LINK REF="STD-Drewry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Drewry 1994</LINK>, particularly as world practice suggests that single recompression therapy remains common. Once again, using the DAN data for comparison (<LINK REF="REF-DAN-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DAN 2001</LINK>) and the effect estimate from the study (RR 0.65), only 30% of patients received more than two compressions, suggesting an NNT with tenoxicam of 10 rather than five.</P>
<P>An informal economic analysis based on the results of <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2003</LINK> and using cost data from a contemporaneous cost analysis in the main contributing hyperbaric facility involved (<LINK REF="REF-Gomez_x002d_Castillo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomez-Castillo 2005</LINK>) suggests there may be modest cost savings associated with the administration of tenoxicam as an adjunctive measure for DCI. These data suggest a saving of AUD 720 (one session of HBOT for DCI) for every five patients treated for DCI (95% CI every 3 to 18 patients). This cost saving ignores the cost of the course of tenoxicam. While costs vary with the source of supply, a typical cost for 30 tablets in Australia is approximately AUD 13.00. The savings above would be reduced by approximately AUD 6.50 for each patient if they were issued with only a sufficient supply for the seven-day course (<LINK REF="REF-MIMS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">MIMS 2006</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-03-20 06:40:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The two trials included in this review involved a modest total of 268 patients. The <LINK REF="STD-Drewry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Drewry 1994</LINK> trial was never reported at completion and is probably underpowered to find a clinically significant difference between the two recompression strategies. While a preliminary 1992 report on trial methodology (referenced here as a duplicate of <LINK REF="STD-Drewry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Drewry 1994</LINK>) suggests a sequential analysis strategy with a stopping rule including a demonstrated difference between the groups at one month (P = 0.05 or less), it is not clear this rule was invoked. We believe the trial was abandoned shortly after the <LINK REF="STD-Drewry-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Drewry 1994</LINK> report because of continuing protocol violations (personal communication). There is a significant difference in the reported number of participants enrolled in each arm of this study (25 versus 31) and although this may be due to chance we consider the potential for selection bias to be high. One further problem is that this trial reported only the proportion of participants who required multiple recompressions and there were no available data on the clinical health outcomes at any stage.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2003</LINK> was powered to detect a difference between groups in the proportion of participants with complete resolution (30% placebo versus 20% tenoxicam predicted). This trial suggests that we can be reasonably confident that the addition of tenoxicam to recompression does not result in a clinically important improvement in the effectiveness of therapy.</P>
<P>We had also planned to perform subgroup analyses with respect to DCS type, time delay between symptoms and recompression, and dose of oxygen received. However, the paucity of eligible trials did not permit this approach. One further problem with research in this area is diagnostic uncertainty. There are no reliable diagnostic tests or clinical criteria for DCI and it is likely that all clinical trials will be contaminated by an unknown number of 'cases' that do not in fact suffer from a bubble-related injury. In general, this will tend to minimize the apparent effectiveness of specific, targeted therapies while magnifying the effect of symptomatic therapies with broad, non-specific activity. For the clinician, the included studies are pragmatic and likely to reflect the efficacy of interventions in the presence of this diagnostic uncertainty.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-03-20 06:43:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>This review is constrained by the paucity of data in this area. Of the two studies included, one of the review authors (MB) is the first author of one (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2003</LINK>) and it is possible this has introduced a bias in interpretation despite our methodology. However, our high level of involvement in this area and our comprehensive searching strategy give us confidence that we have located all relevant reports and data, both published and unpublished.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-03-20 06:44:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Recompression is universally accepted as the primary therapy for DCI and we are not aware of any previous reviews attempting to summarise the efficacy of recompression against alternative therapies. Our review does confirm the findings of previous authors that recompression is highly successful (<LINK REF="REF-DAN-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DAN 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moon 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thalmann-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thalmann 1996</LINK>). Non-systematic reviews of adjunctive therapy have in general failed to identify any strategies that improve the success of recompression, with the exception of reference to the findings of <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2003</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Moon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moon 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>Recompression therapy is universally accepted as standard practice for the treatment of DCI. While there is considerable evidence for good outcomes following recompression, this practice is not based on any randomized controlled trial evidence. There is some evidence that the addition of an NSAID to breathing 100% oxygen during recompression reduces the number of recompression sessions required to treat DCI, but there is no evidence for an improvement in the rate of complete recovery. Similarly, there is some evidence that helium and oxygen breathing during recompression may reduce recompression requirements, though the methodological problems in the single trial examining the use of helium and oxygen breathing should be noted. The use of an NSAID is likely to be associated with a modest reduction in the cost of therapy. Thus, the application of either of these strategies may be justified. The small number of studies and the modest numbers of patients included in this review demand a cautious interpretation. Given the lack of evidence for improved outcomes, benefits may be largely economic and an economic analysis should be undertaken.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-03-20 06:47:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the natural history of severe DCI and the well-documented clinical response to recompression, it is unlikely that any comparison of recompression therapy against a sham alternative can be justified. There is, however, a strong case for large randomized trials of high methodological rigour in order to define the extent of benefit (if any) from the use of different breathing gases and pressure profiles during recompression therapy. Specifically, information is required on the subset of disease severity that may justify the use of complex and expensive treatment tables. The diagnosis and classification of DCI is particularly problematic with the milder forms of the disease. Formal economic analysis is required to quantify the cost benefit of treatment with NSAIDs and heliox. Any future trials would need to consider the following, in particular.</P>
