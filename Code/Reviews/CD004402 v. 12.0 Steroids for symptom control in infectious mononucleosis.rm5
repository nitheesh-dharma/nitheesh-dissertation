<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-11-07 13:38:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz  Dooley">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed evidence about the effect of steroids on symptom control in people with glandular fever (infectious mononucleosis) when compared to placebo or different medications.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Glandular fever is caused by a virus. It spreads in saliva through kissing, coughing and sneezing. Symptoms vary in terms of how severe they are and for how long they persist. While young adults commonly suffer from severe symptoms, some people may have mild symptoms or none. Common symptoms include fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes and feeling tired.These symptoms usually last for two to three weeks, but can last for months. Symptom relief and rest are common treatments. Doctors commonly use prednisone, a steroid, to reduce the symptoms of sore throat or enlarged tonsils. However, there is no agreement on its use due to the possibility of little benefit and the chance of side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Our evidence is current to August 2015. We did not identify any new trials for the update of this review. The previous publication of this review included seven trials with 362 participants. Four trials compared the effect of a steroid to a placebo, one to aspirin, and two trials explored the effects of steroids in conjunction with an antiviral.</P>
<P>The length of treatment varied between a single dose and a 12-day course. The doses used also varied. The length of follow-up varied from short periods (i.e. days or weeks) to longer periods (i.e. six months and 12 months).</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Steroid treatment relieved sore throat in the short term (at 12 hours). The researchers noticed a benefit at two to four days when steroids were used in combination with an antiviral medication, but these findings are limited since researchers assessed them in one or two trials only. The findings on the effect of steroids alone or when used with an antiviral medication for other symptoms were less clear. We are unsure about adverse effects from using steroids. With the exception of two trials, most studies did not set out a prior plan to evaluate the occurrence of side effects, or other adverse events. None of the trials explored adverse effects in the longer term (over years).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the included trials was generally poor. We cannot know the exact effect of using steroids for glandular fever.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-29 11:27:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Infectious mononucleosis, also known as glandular fever or the kissing disease, is a benign lymphoproliferative disorder. It is a viral infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a ubiquitous herpes virus that is found in all human societies and cultures. Epidemiological studies show that over 95% of adults worldwide have been infected with EBV. Most cases of symptomatic infectious mononucleosis occur between the ages of 15 and 24 years. It is transmitted through close contact with an EBV shedder, contact with infected saliva or, less commonly, through sexual contact, blood transfusions or by sharing utensils; however, transmission actually occurs less than 10% of the time. Precautions are not needed to prevent transmission because of the high percentage of seropositivity for EBV. Infectious mononucleosis is self-limiting and typically lasts for two to three weeks. Nevertheless, symptoms can last for weeks and occasionally months.</P>
<P>Symptoms include fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, hepatosplenomegaly and fatigue. Symptom relief and rest are commonly recommended treatments. Steroids have been used for their anti-inflammatory effects, but there are no universal criteria for their use.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-10-20 18:10:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objectives of the review were to determine the efficacy and safety of steroid therapy versus placebo, usual care or different drug therapies for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-10-23 22:25:55 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this 2015 update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 7), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2015) and EMBASE (January 1974 to August 2015). We also searched trials registries, however we did not identify any new relevant completed or ongoing trials for inclusion. We combined the MEDLINE search with the Cochrane search strategy for identifying randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We adapted the search terms when searching EMBASE.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-27 20:16:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this 2015 update, we did not identify any new RCTs for inclusion. The previous version of the review included seven trials with a total of 362 participants. Four trials compared the effectiveness of a steroid to placebo for short-term symptom control in glandular fever, one to aspirin, and two trials explored the effects of steroids in conjunction with an antiviral. Heterogeneity between trials prevented a combined analysis.</P>
<P>Trials under-reported methodological design features. Three trials did not adequately describe sequence generation for randomisation. Four trials provided adequate details of allocation concealment. All trials were double-blind but four were not specific as to who was blinded. Loss to follow-up was under-reported in four trials, making it difficult to exclude attrition bias. The risk of selective reporting in the included trials was unclear.</P>
<P>Across the trials, no benefit was found in 8/10 assessments of health improvement. Two trials found benefit of steroid therapy over placebo in reducing sore throat at 12 hours (eight-day course odds ratio (OR) 21.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.94 to 227.20; one-dose OR 4.20, 95% CI 1.08 to 16.32), but the benefit was not maintained.</P>
<P>In combination with an antiviral drug, participants in the steroid group had less pharyngeal discomfort between days two to four (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.08) compared to placebo. Across the trials the effects on other common symptoms were less clear. Two trials set out to measure safety; they documented no major adverse effects. In two other trials adverse events were reported, including respiratory distress and acute onset of diabetes. However, the association of the events with the steroid is not definite.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-10-27 20:16:10 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence to the efficacy of steroids for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis. There is a lack of research on the side effects and long-term complications.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-12-08 08:57:21 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Infectious mononucleosis is also known as glandular fever, mono or the kissing disease. Pathophysiologically, infectious mononucleosis is considered to be a lymphoproliferative disorder that is caused by a virus. It is mostly asymptomatic, but symptoms typically include low-grade fever (although chills are uncommon), nausea and anorexia (without vomiting), lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, hepatosplenomegaly and fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Cunha-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunha 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hellwig-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellwig 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>In terms of aetiology, infectious mononucleosis is most commonly caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is one of the herpes viruses and also known as human herpes virus 4 (HHV-4). EBV occurs worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Hellwig-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellwig 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luzuriaga-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luzuriaga 2010</LINK>). Also, there is a significant genetic factor in the aetiology of infectious mononucleosis supported by the 'circumstantial evidence' from family studies of various Epstein-Barr virus-associated diseases and genome-wide association (GWA). Moreover, evidence of familial aggregation of infectious mononucleosis was found in a recent study (<LINK REF="REF-Rostgaard-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rostgaard 2014</LINK>). </P>
<P>Over 95% of adults worldwide have been infected with EBV (<LINK REF="REF-Hellwig-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellwig 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luzuriaga-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luzuriaga 2010</LINK>). While the infection in early childhood is often asymptomatic, adolescents or adults usually develop symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Hellwig-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellwig 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luzuriaga-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luzuriaga 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maki-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maki 1982</LINK>). In low-income countries or lower socioeconomic status (SES) populations, 80% to 100% of children test positive in serological EBV testing, when they reach the age of six years. Therefore, they generally do not develop symptomatic infectious mononucleosis when they are older. In high-income countries or higher SES populations, only half of children aged between one and five years test serologically positive for EBV; hence a larger number of these people present with symptomatic infectious mononucleosis around the ages of 10 to 30 years (<LINK REF="REF-Hellwig-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellwig 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luzuriaga-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luzuriaga 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overall incidence in the United States has been reported to be around 500 cases per 100,000 persons per year (<LINK REF="REF-Hellwig-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellwig 2013</LINK>). Symptomatic infectious mononucleosis infection has also been reported to be about 30 times higher in white people than in black people in the US (<LINK REF="REF-Aronson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aronson 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hellwig-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellwig 2013</LINK>). However, there are no predisposing differences in terms of gender. There is no evidence that seasonal changes affect its incidence (<LINK REF="REF-Hellwig-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellwig 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luzuriaga-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luzuriaga 2010</LINK>). Young adults, for example, college students living in crowded surroundings, have the highest rates of infectious mononucleosis (<LINK REF="REF-Aronson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aronson 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hellwig-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellwig 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maki-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maki 1982</LINK>). &#8220;Most symptomatic cases occur between the ages of 15 and 24 years&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Walther-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walther 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is transmitted when there is contact with saliva (e.g. kissing), or by sexual intercourse, blood transfusion or infected equipment, however, transmission actually occurs in less than 10% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Aronson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aronson 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hellwig-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellwig 2013</LINK>). As a large proportion of the population is already seropositive for EBV precautions are not needed to prevent transmission, as it is not a particularly infectious disease (<LINK REF="REF-Hellwig-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellwig 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>EBV infection results in a chronic, usually lifelong infection, as the virus resides in cells known as memory B cells, where it may later reactivate and spread through oropharyngeal secretions (<LINK REF="REF-Hellwig-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellwig 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luzuriaga-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luzuriaga 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Souza-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Souza 2005</LINK>). "Infectious mononucleosis is self-limiting and typically lasts for two to three weeks" (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 2003</LINK>). Nevertheless, symptoms can last for weeks and occasionally months, leading to discomfort and affecting the educational and professional life aspects of the patients (<LINK REF="REF-Candy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Candy 2002</LINK>). "Fatigue is the most common prolonged symptom" (<LINK REF="REF-Candy-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Candy 2002</LINK>), and &#8220;infectious mononucleosis is a risk factor for chronic fatigue syndrome" (<LINK REF="REF-White-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Young children infected with EBV commonly have no or only mild symptoms, which may remain undiagnosed. However, older children, teens and young adults commonly exhibit signs and symptoms. The disease begins with a prodromal period of symptoms such as headache, anorexia and fatigue for one to two weeks before the classical symptoms of the disease manifest (<LINK REF="REF-Aronson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aronson 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hellwig-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellwig 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although "EBV remains latent within cells&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Papesch-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papesch 2001</LINK>), infectious mononucleosis is considered an acute and transient disease; however, the severity and duration of symptoms vary widely. Some symptoms such as difficulty in breathing due to severe pharyngeal enlargement may require hospitalisation. In recent decades, the number of patients with infectious mononucleosis who require hospitalisation, especially adolescents and young adults, has increased in England and the US, even though there is no evidence of changes in its virulence (<LINK REF="REF-Tattevin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tattevin 2006</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-10-23 19:36:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Symptom relief and rest are commonly recommended treatments for infectious mononucleosis (<LINK REF="REF-AAFP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAFP 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Candy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Candy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2001</LINK>). Steroids have been used for their anti-inflammatory effects. Prescribing high-dose, short-term steroid therapy (that is, oral prednisolone 40 mg to 60 mg/day, tapered over a three- to 14-day period) for infectious mononucleosis can be traced back to the 1950s. At that time, a number of reports based on single cases or small series of people noted the favourable effect that steroids had on acute symptoms, such as sore throat (<LINK REF="REF-Bender-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bender 1953</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Creditor-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creditor 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doran-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doran 1953</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fiese-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiese 1953</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frenkel-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frenkel 1956</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mandel-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandel 1955</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mason-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 1958</LINK>). Steroids were also reported to be effective in treating complications or accompanying conditions, such as thrombocytopenia (<LINK REF="REF-Doran-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doran 1953</LINK>), hepatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Bender-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bender 1953</LINK>), pericarditis (<LINK REF="REF-Bender-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bender 1953</LINK>), myocarditis (<LINK REF="REF-Bender-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bender 1953</LINK>), and encephalitis (<LINK REF="REF-Fiese-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiese 1953</LINK>). More recently, steroid treatment has been combined with antivirals, such as acyclovir, with the aim of enhancing their effect (<LINK REF="STD-Tynell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tynell 1996</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-12-06 11:21:06 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The potential long duration of infectious mononucleosis and the age group most likely to be symptomatic is perhaps key in the prescription of steroids for symptom control. As it can affect adolescents and young adults at a time in their school or academic careers when they are expected to be continually productive, there is often a distinct personal need to resume normal life as soon as possible. In addition, it is a time in life where sports and social activities can be a major aspect of everyday life (<LINK REF="REF-Candy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Candy 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties of glucocorticoids are due to three main molecular mechanisms: the direct genetic expression modifying effects by first binding to glucocorticoids receptors then the binding of the previous combination to the GREs (glucocorticoid-responsive elements), the indirect genetic effects by the interactions of glucocorticoid receptors with other transcription factors, and lastly, the effects on second-messenger cascades. However, because these effects are not exclusive to inflammation signalling and affect physiological signalling as well, one should bear in mind that using glucocorticoids in treatment often accompanied with adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Rhen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rhen 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, since the 1960s, when formal trials of their effects began, the use of steroids for infectious mononucleosis has been considered controversial. Much of this controversy is due to the potential for adverse events and long-term effects in a disease that is largely self-limiting (<LINK REF="REF-Candy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Candy 2011</LINK>). In particular:</P>
<OL>
<LI>there are anecdotal reports of other adverse events associated with steroid use, such as myocarditis and encephalitis (<LINK REF="STD-Andersson-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Andersson 1988a</LINK>); given that these are also rare complications of EBV itself, the risks and benefits of steroids need to be determined accurately;</LI>
<LI>steroids suppress the normal immune response, which may predispose the person to a secondary infection, such as peritonsillar abscess (<LINK REF="REF-Handler-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handler 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnsen-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnsen 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Portman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Portman 1984</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>there are unknown long-term effects of using an immunomodulator for a virus that establishes intracellular latency; one possible effect is to contribute to the subsequent development of EBV-associated malignancies, such as Burkitt and Hodgkin lymphomas (<LINK REF="REF-Jenson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenson 2000</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>In addition, the effectiveness of steroids for symptom control is unclear for some indications, including fever, sore throat and swollen lymph glands. Trial results for these symptoms are conflicting while for other indications (enlarged liver and fatigue) data are scant. There is also the cost of drug therapy to be considered, in particular if the steroids are used in combination with antiviral drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Candy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Candy 2011</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>Two trials explored the effects of steroids in conjunction with an antiviral: these were acyclovir (<LINK REF="STD-Tynell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tynell 1996</LINK>), and valacyclovir (<LINK REF="STD-Simon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2003</LINK>). The steroids evaluated were prednisone (<LINK REF="STD-Bolden-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Bolden 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Collins-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Collins 1984</LINK>), prednisolone (<LINK REF="STD-Simon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tynell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tynell 1996</LINK>), paramethasone (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prout-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Prout 1966</LINK>), and dexamethasone (<LINK REF="STD-Roy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The duration of treatment varied. In four trials the tapered schedules were for more than five days. One trial involved one dose (<LINK REF="STD-Roy-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 2004</LINK>), and another used a schedule that was adjusted to the individual participant's responsiveness to treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Prout-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Prout 1966</LINK>). In Bolden's study there were two intervention arms: one a six-day and one a 12-day schedule. Dosages varied from a starting dose of 5 mg prednisone (or equivalent to) to 25 mg prednisone (or equivalent to). The dexamethasone trial used a dose of 0.3 mg per kg. Six trials were placebo-controlled, the other used aspirin as the comparative treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Bolden-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Bolden 1972</LINK>). Six trials used oral treatments. In one trial intravenous treatment was used if participants had difficulty swallowing (<LINK REF="STD-Tynell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tynell 1996</LINK>). The seventh trial did not specify how the treatment was administered (<LINK REF="STD-Simon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Simon 2003</LINK>).</P>

In one trial, all participants had a 12-day course of phenoxymethyl penicillin and partial bed rest until apyrexial, with an emphasis placed on early mobilisation (<LINK REF="STD-Bolden-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Bolden 1972</LINK>). Another provided a penicillin course, aspirin and throat gargles to all participants (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1969</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-20 18:10:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this 2015 update, we did not identify any new randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of steroid treatment on infectious mononucleosis.</P>
<P>The initial version of this review sought to determine the evidence for the efficacy of steroid treatment for symptom relief in infectious mononucleosis. Seven trials were identified, with the most recent being published in 2003. Across the seven trials there was little overlap in steroidal treatment schedules, diagnostic criteria or outcomes assessed and some data were inadequately reported.</P>
<P>The initial version of this review found evidence from two trials that steroids as a monotherapy are effective in reducing the symptoms of sore throat initially but not after 12 hours of treatment. Evidence on other symptoms was more limited. In two trials, three participants in the steroidal group developed severe complications that may have been related to steroidal therapy: specifically, in one participant empyema, in another peritonsillar cellulitis and in the third acute onset diabetes mellitus with acidosis.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-11-06 09:13:27 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>This 2015 update has not provided additional information. Results of the initial version of this review must be interpreted in light of the limitations of this review. In particular, the small number of studies and participants (especially as few studies included children in the early teenage years and younger, where infectious mononucleosis is not uncommon). Also, many of the results resulted in wide confidence intervals, probably due to small sample sizes, making it difficult to be sure that the sample sizes studied were adequate to exclude confidently the possibility of false positive results or negative results. Moreover, the reported differences in findings between trials post 12 hours may be related to lack of power, or also to differences in the population studied, diagnostic criteria and steroid treatment. For instance, the study that found no effects after 12 hours used a lower dose of steroids. Evidence from another study suggests that steroids are effective in combination with acyclovir at two to four days (<LINK REF="STD-Tynell-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tynell 1996</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-11-07 12:30:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz  Dooley">
<P>Various methodological limitations to the evidence provided in the included trials were noted in the initial version of this review. Not all trials fully reported key methodological characteristics, including randomisation sequence generation and allocation concealment, who was blinded and loss to follow-up. The two studies that explored the earlier effects of steroids on relief from sore throat were the only studies that presented positive findings to state a primary outcome. The other three trials that reported positive findings did not specify a primary outcome or which specific symptoms they were evaluating. This suggests that a multiple hypothesis analysis was undertaken.</P>
<P>Where outcomes overlapped, we did not pool trial results as the trials were heterogeneous in key characteristics. One reason for such heterogeneity is that these studies span nearly half a century, during which time diagnostic tests improved, leading some trials to include participants who, based on current virological tests, would not have been diagnosed with glandular fever. In addition to variable definitions of infectious mononucleosis, symptom severity at entry (although it was not always specified) is likely to have differed, as some trials only used hospitalised, as opposed to ambulatory, participants. In some trials, a participant's symptoms may have been less severe as the trial waited for a laboratory diagnosis before active treatment was started.</P>
<P>Studies were also heterogeneous in treatment: steroid therapy varied in dosage and type.</P>
<P>Another important limitation is that, apart from two trials, most studies did not set out a priori to evaluate the incidence of side effects, complications relating to infectious mononucleosis or other adverse events. None of the trials explored adverse effects in the longer term (over years).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-10-20 18:10:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not have previous knowledge of the past work in this area so any new RCTs found after the initial version of this review could not be biased in terms of how we managed or reported data. We do not feel that we have excluded any data that others would have used.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-10-27 20:21:27 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is not enough evidence to the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment for symptom control in people with otherwise uncomplicated glandular fever. Furthermore, there is no compelling reason to select corticosteroids over other effective therapeutic agents for short-term relief of sore throat.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-11-06 09:16:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>The initial version of this review did not provide a clear impetus for further primary research studies to measure overall improvement effects or common symptoms, in particular fever (<LINK REF="REF-Candy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Candy 2011</LINK>). The value of further research is clearer for relief of sore throat, if short-term benefit is felt to be clinically important. Any further evaluations of the effectiveness of steroids for symptom control in people with infectious mononucleosis need to evaluate what would be clinically significant effects, and to record adverse effects and complications in the short and long term.</P>
<P>For this 2015 update we agree with the authors of the initial version of this review.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2008, Issue 2), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to Week 4, April 2008); EMBASE (January 1974 to May 2008) and the UK National Research Register (September 2007).</P>
<P>The following search strategy was used to search MEDLINE and CENTRAL. The MEDLINE search was combined with the Cochrane search strategy for identifying RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Lefebvre-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefebvre 2011</LINK>). The search terms were adapted when searching EMBASE and the UK National Research Register.</P>
