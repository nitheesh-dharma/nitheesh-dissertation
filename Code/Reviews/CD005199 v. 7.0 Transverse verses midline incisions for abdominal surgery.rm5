<P>The choice of abdominal surgical incision is determined largely by access. However, a transverse incision may be superior to a midline incision in terms of recovery and complications. All randomised controlled trials comparing these incisions were identified. Outcomes included analgesic use, pulmonary function, complication rates and hospital stay. Marked variability in methodology made comparison difficult and potential biases in all of the studies suggests results should be treated with caution. Nevertheless a trend was seen toward less analgesic requirement, less effect on pulmonary function and lower wound dehiscence and incisional hernia rates with a transverse incision. However, the lower pain and reduced effect on pulmonary function were not translated into other clinical advantages as recovery times and other complication rates (except cosmetic appearance) were similar.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2011-02-15 14:35:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The choice of surgical incision in the abdomen is determined by access. It has been suggested that other parameters such as recovery and complication rate may be influenced by utilising a transverse or oblique rather than a midline incision. However, there is little consensus in the literature as to whether a particular incision confers any advantage.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether a midline incision or a transverse incision (including oblique incision) confers any recovery advantage to the patient.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Search terms include randomised trials containing combinations of the following: 'abdominal', 'incisions', 'horizontal', 'transverse', 'vertical', 'midline', 'laparotomy'</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All prospective randomised trials comparing midline with transverse incisions for abdominal surgery were included. Caesarian sections were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers assessed the methodological quality of potentially eligible trials and independently extracted data from the included trial. A wide range of outcome measures were considered.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-02-15 14:35:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to the differences in the method of assessment, the variability of data and the heterogeneity of the participant groups it was difficult to pool some of the outcome data. Despite these limitations and potentially significant biases related to methodological quality there was evidence to suggest that a transverse or oblique incision has less impact on pulmonary function particularly in the early post-operative period and is less prone to rupture (wound dehiscence/incisional hernia). The data on pain is less clear and should be interpreted with caution but some data suggests a transverse incision is less painful. There was no difference seen in other early or late post-operative complications and recovery times were similar although the transverse incision may be cosmetically more acceptable.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-02-15 14:35:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The analgesia use and the pulmonary compromise may be reduced with a transverse/oblique incision but this does not seem to be significant clinically as pulmonary complication rates and recovery times were the same. The likelihood of wound dehiscence and rupture appears to be reduced with a transverse incision and a transverse incision may look better. The methodological and clinical diversity and the potential for bias also mean that the results in favour of a transverse/oblique incision (particularly with regard to analgesic use) should be treated with caution. The optimal incision for abdominal surgery still remains the preference of the surgeon.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-15 15:20:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-15 15:05:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Major abdominal surgery is an important part of current medical practice. The surgery is common, and is also responsible for significant use of hospital resources both in terms of funding and bed usage. Within England there are around 250,000 abdominal operations performed each year (Hospital Episode Statistics 2003-4), and although an increasing number of these are performed laparoscopically, a significant proportion, particularly the larger more complex procedures are still performed by an open technique. Even with cholecystectomy, where laparoscopic access is very commonly employed, there still remains advocated of the open technique, albeit via a minimal incision technique (<LINK REF="REF-Purkayastha-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Purkayastha 2007</LINK>). Although the figures for laparoscopic colorectal resections have increased in England since the last review (<LINK REF="REF-Sheldon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheldon 2004</LINK>), the procedure is by no means universal even in centres of excellence. Finally complex pancreatic and vascular procedures are technically difficult to carry out laparoscopically and are still commonly carried out through open incisions.</P>
<P>In clinical practice the choice of incision is usually based on surgical preference rather than any patient criteria. Surgically, ease of access, time to open and close the abdomen, and incidence of post operative complications (burst abdomen, wound infection, postoperative pulmonary complications, incisional hernias) are important. For the patient, however, pain and rapid return to normal function are important. Economically the duration of operation and duration of hospital stay determine cost with time to return to normal activity determining overall cost to the community. The recent interest in accelerated discharge after abdominal surgery highlights the importance of a comparison of incision types as there is an assumption that transverse incisions contribute to more rapid recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Kehlet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kehlet 2003</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Surgical practice has evolved to include a variety of incisions to gain access to the abdominal cavity. Midline and transverse (including oblique) incisions are the two commonest forms of incision used. There have been a number of studies proclaiming the benefits of each type of incision. There have however been few direct comparisons of the incisions, with many papers being retrospective, non-randomised and therefore subject to considerable biases, or under powered to determine differences. There is a lack of heterogeneity within the better designed trials published in this arena with many studies measuring different outcomes in different ways. Attempts at combining the data from these studies in order to see if any incision confers any advantage have been made. In 2001 Grantacharov et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Grantcharov-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grantcharov 2001</LINK>) reviewed prospective (N=11) and retrospective (N=7) trials comparing incision types and reported an increased risk of both burst abdomen and incisional hernia following midline incision when compared with transverse incisions. This review included the retrospective data for the analyses which showed significant differences between the two incision types for post operative complications, but excluded them for other analyses. Burger et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Burger-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burger 2002</LINK>) published a systemic review of prospective randomised trials of abdominal incision types and complications. In this review transverse, oblique, paramedian and midline incisions were included. They reported an increased rate of incisional hernia with a midline incision, but no differences in infection and dehiscence rates compared with any other incision. This increased incisional hernia rate was only sustained in the group of patients undergoing what they defined as "larger laparotomies". They concluded that the use of the midline incision should be restricted to operations in which unlimited access to the abdominal cavity is useful or necessary, recommending instead the paramedian incision.</P>
<P>The majority of data available compares transverse and oblique with midline incisions. This certainly reflects the commonest incision types for abdominal access utilised in the UK. Although paramedian incisions are still utilised by some, data comparing this incision type has not been included in this review. Instead appropriately designed randomised controlled trials comparing midline with transverse incisions has been included to see if any incision confers any advantage.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objectives were the focus of the trials in the literature and concerned factors regarding patient recovery. These factors include;<BR/>Analgesic requirements<BR/>Pulmonary function<BR/>Recovery times (including hospital stay and time to return to work)<BR/>Complications both early (wound dehiscence with or without evisceration, wound infection and pulmonary complications) and late (incisional hernia)</P>
<P>Secondary objectives concerned comparison of more subjective issues. These factors include;<BR/>Operator convenience (including time to open and close the wound)<BR/>Wound cosmesis<BR/>Quality of life issues</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients undergoing all open abdominal incisions except caesarian section were included. The participants included all participants undergoing elective surgery as well as those undergoing emergency surgery and abdominal trauma. These participants are at potentially increased risk of wound infections and pulmonary complications but this was taken into account and the data for non-elective surgery analysed separately.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-02-15 15:18:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies that compared transverse and midline incisions were included in this review. Other longitudinal incisions include paramedian incisions. These can be conventional (medial) or lateral paramedian techniques. There are interesting data comparing paramedian techniques with transverse incisions (<LINK REF="STD-Ellis-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ellis 1984</LINK>,<LINK REF="STD-Halasz-1963" TYPE="STUDY">Halasz 1963</LINK>). These data are not included in the analysis as paramedian incisions are not within the remit of this comparison.</P>
<P>Transverse incisions include true transverse or oblique (subcostal) muscle splitting and muscle cutting techniques and may be bilateral or unilateral. These variations may confound any analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Burger-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burger 2002</LINK>) and have been taken into account by analysing subgroups according to the purpose of the operation. Diathermy skin incision compared with scalpel incision may reduce post-operative pain and enhance recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Kearns-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kearns 2001</LINK>). Other factors may influence the incidence of complications (particularly wound dehiscence and incisional hernia) and these include the suture technique and suture type (<LINK REF="STD-Stone-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Stone 1983</LINK>). The importance of these variations in the overall evaluation of incision type has been discussed. In addition, their relevance for inclusion in updates of the current review has been considered.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2011-02-15 14:35:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary and secondary outcome measures have been highlighted in the objectives section. Many of the endpoints with regard to analgesia use and pulmonary function are difficult to compare between studies since different scales, tests and timings of the tests are used in each of the studies in which they are employed. Therefore only those tests and those data which are common to more than one study have been analysed. Pulmonary complications were considered only if there was clinical or radiological evidence (pneumonia or atelectasis) requiring medical intervention. Wound infection was considered only if there was purulent discharge from the wound. Incisional hernia was considered absent only if there has been at least one year follow-up.</P>
<P>Many of the secondary outcome measures were not uniformly available for most studies. The importance of these parameters in the overall evaluation of incision type is discussed. In addition, their relevance for inclusion in updates of the current review have been considered.</P>

<P>Trials selection<BR/>Two reviewers (SB, Peter Goodfellow) examined all the citations and abstracts derived from the electronic searches up to 2008. Jim Tiernan (JT) replaced Peter Goodfellow for this update.<BR/>Reports of potentially relevant trials were retrieved in full. The reviewers independently applied the selection criteria to trials reports. Reviewers were not blind to the names of authors, institutions or journals. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>Quality assessment<BR/>The methodological quality of identified trials were assessed independently by the two reviewers taking into account the quality of random allocation concealment and the description of dropouts and withdrawals, as well as blinding of the patients and careers to the intervention. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion. Studies were excluded if they were not randomised controlled trials in adults. The excluded studies and the reasons for their exclusion are summarised in the Table of Excluded Studies.</P>
<P>Data extraction<BR/>Data extraction from the included trial was undertaken independently by the two reviewers. Only published data have been used. Data were processed as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Any difference of opinion was resolved by discussion between the reviewers. Some data required extraction from figures in the publications.<BR/>An attempt was made to get missing information from the trial's authors.</P>
<P>Analysis<BR/>Data were analysed using the RevMan Analyses statistical programme in Review Manager 5.</P>
<P>Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes using the Mantel-Haenszel method and a fixed effect model.

<P>A power calculation was carried out in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK> ). This was the only study that mentioned 'intention to treat'. Eight studies gave details with regard to withdrawals (<LINK REF="STD-Halm-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Halm 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sehnal-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sehnal 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenall-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Greenall 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenall-1980a" TYPE="STUDY">Greenall 1980a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindgren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lindgren 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Valdecasas-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Valdecasas 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Inaba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Inaba 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1990</LINK>). In one paper (<LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>) the concept of intention to treat and equivalence was approached in detail. A complex decision tree was created considering 3 populations based on the variance from protocol, particularly regarding analgesic requirements. The population utilised for each outcome measure is discussed in the results.</P>
<P>It is unclear in most studies as to how the patient was randomised. In eight studies the randomisation process was not described. In the remaining studies randomisation was by sealed envelope in seven (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenall-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Greenall 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenall-1980a" TYPE="STUDY">Greenall 1980a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindgren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lindgren 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fassiadis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fassiadis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halm-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Halm 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>), by selection of random digits in one (<LINK REF="STD-Stone-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Stone 1983</LINK>), by computer generated random numbers in 2 (<LINK REF="STD-Salonia-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Salonia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Proske-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proske 2005</LINK>) and by 'block randomisation' in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Seenu-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Seenu 1994</LINK>). Even in those trials that detail the method of randomisation, only two studies gives information that allocation was not known by the operator until at least the point of allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Lindgren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lindgren 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>) suggesting potential for selection bias (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The process of blinding the patient, the carers and the outcome assessor is obviously difficult in this situation. Nevertheless an attempt was made in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>). In both studies, the patient, the nursing staff and the medical staff caring for the patient as well as the patient were blinded by the use of strategically placed dressings that were consistent for the two groups of patients and that remained on the patient either for the duration of the hospital stay (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>) or until the primary end point assessment day (<LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>). These studies aside the results of the other trials, particularly in relation to analgesia use and hospital stay all potentially suffer from substantial performance and detection bias.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2011-02-15 15:08:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were 12 studies that investigated analgesic use. The method of assessment varied from visual analogue scales through to amount of opiate given, proportion of patients reporting pain or number of doses given over a period varying from 24 hours through to 7 days. This makes comparison difficult particularly as the type of procedure also varied. The influence of ward practice and local protocols on the delivery of analgesia as well as the expectations of the patient and the influence of ward staff on that expectation make it essential that carers (and indeed patients) are blinded to the intervention. The variability of analgesia use as well as patient perception of pain are illustrated in two studies that abandoned analogue assessment of pain as part of the trial due to the inconsistent results (<LINK REF="STD-Greenall-1980a" TYPE="STUDY">Greenall 1980a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lacy 1994</LINK>). This element of detection bias seriously weakens the confidence in the trials without blinding of the carer, particularly those that involve 'on demand' analgesia delivered by the carers (<LINK REF="STD-Lacy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lacy 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ali-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Valdecasas-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Valdecasas 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salonia-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Salonia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halm-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Halm 2009</LINK>). One trial suggested analgesia was given 'on demand' by the carers but that the carers were blinded to the type of incision (<LINK REF="STD-Inaba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Inaba 2004</LINK>). One trial gave standard analgesia for all and gave no details of extra analgesia given 'on demand' (<LINK REF="STD-Proske-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proske 2005</LINK>). Of the 4 remaining trials, 3 (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>) state analgesia was given via a patient controlled device (in the per protocol population for the <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK> trial). This removes some of the influence of the carers on patient analgesic use but not all. Ward staff may encourage patients to press the patient controlled device and indeed may even press the device themselves. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Lindgren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lindgren 2001</LINK> included a visual analogue assessment with patients receiving strong opioid analgesia only if a score of three or above was recorded. However, this subjective assessment was carried out by someone not blinded to the intervention, again introducing bias. Only two trials state carers and patients were blinded to the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bearing in mind the clinical and methodological diversity and the potential for bias it is possible to combine data on the total opioid analgesic delivered to the patient from all studies except <LINK REF="STD-Greenall-1980a" TYPE="STUDY">Greenall 1980a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Inaba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Inaba 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Proske-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proske 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Halm-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Halm 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Salonia-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Salonia 2005</LINK>. This requires some assumptions including conversion of merepidine (pethidine), piritramide and ketobemidon into dose equivalents of morphine (1mg merepidine=5mg morphine, 1mg of piritramide=0.65mg morphine, 1mg ketobemidon=1mg morphine) and multiplication of dose per kg body weight by mean body weight if given or 70kg if not given. The combined data shows a significant result in favour of the transverse incision (comparison data table 1,1 weighted mean difference -16.86; 95% confidence interval -20.32 to -13.39). However, there is significant statistical heterogeneity (p&lt;0.00001). In an attempt to reduce the methodological diversity 5 trials were excluded from the analysis. The <LINK REF="STD-Ali-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 1979</LINK> trial and the <LINK REF="STD-Lacy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lacy 1994</LINK> trial were excluded as they recorded data on analgesic use for the first 72 hours only. Similarly <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1990</LINK>'s trial gave data only on the first 24 hours before the patient controlled device was taken down and <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK> recorded data for a 24 hour period only. Data for all opioid analgesia given in these trials may not therefore be included. The <LINK REF="STD-Lindgren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lindgren 2001</LINK> trial was excluded because of the significantly different method of analgesia delivery mentioned previously. Combination of the 2 remaining trials that give data for total analgesic use during the hospital stay (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Valdecasas-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Valdecasas 1988</LINK>) reduces statistical heterogeneity and also favours a transverse incision (CDT 1,2 WMD(fixed) 95% CI -6.28 [-12.57,0.00]). However, it should be highlighted that the Garcia-Valdecasas trial included 22 (out of 129) emergency procedures.</P>
<P>Another analgesic comparison that was possible was the VAS score on the first or second post-operative day. Data on this parameter was available from 4 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lindgren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lindgren 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Proske-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proske 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salonia-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Salonia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>). Data was converted to a score of 0-10. No difference was seen (CDT 1,3 WMD(fixed) 95% CI -0.03 [-0.18,0.12]). Again heterogeneity was highly significant.</P>
<P>Ten trials focused on the effect of abdominal incisions on postoperative pulmonary function (<LINK REF="STD-Ali-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becquemin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Becquemin 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Valdecasas-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Valdecasas 1988</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Lacy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lacy 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindgren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lindgren 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massucci-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Massucci 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Proske-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proske 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salonia-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Salonia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>). The methods of assessment included spirometry (FEV1, VC), arterial blood gas analysis and oscillography (Mean inspiratory and mean expiratory pressures (MIP, MEP) and thoraco-abdominal respiratory synchronism). The timings of these assessments varied with each study from one assessment on the first post-operative day through to assessments every day up to 12 days after the operation. <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK> only gave information on pulmonary function 1 year after surgery and data could therefore not be pooled. This coupled with the varied reporting of the original data makes pooling of the data difficult. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Massucci-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Massucci 1989</LINK>) gave insufficient data for analysis. Four studies failed to show any difference in pulmonary function with incision type (<LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lacy 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindgren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lindgren 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salonia-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Salonia 2005</LINK>). Of the five studies that showed a significant difference all favoured the transverse approach. Pooling of the data was carried out for spirometry for the first day after the operation and for day 7 or the day nearest day 7 after the operation. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Massucci-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Massucci 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Valdecasas-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Valdecasas 1988</LINK>) gave insufficient data for analysis and the authors were not contactable. Pooling the other studies showed that a transverse incision had significantly less effect on vital capacity and FEV1 (CDT 2,1-2,4). Only one study assessed pulmonary function for those with and without chronic obstructive airways disease, showing a marked effect on spirometry with incision for the chronic obstructive group but no difference for the 'normal' group (<LINK REF="STD-Lacy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lacy 1994</LINK>). All the studies analysed included elective patients only.</P>
<P>Complications of surgery included pulmonary disorders. These were assessed in 12trials. However, in one (<LINK REF="STD-Ali-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 1979</LINK>) it was impossible to separate the data from the unrandomised data in another part of the study. Four trials gave a detailed definition of a pulmonary complication (<LINK REF="STD-Becquemin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Becquemin 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Valdecasas-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Valdecasas 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenall-1980a" TYPE="STUDY">Greenall 1980a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lacy 1994</LINK>) while others gave data that included pneumonia and atelectasis (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindgren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lindgren 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seenu-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Seenu 1994</LINK>). In four trials pneumonia was not defined (<LINK REF="STD-Inaba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Inaba 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halm-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Halm 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sehnal-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sehnal 2008</LINK>). Combining all 11 studies and including all pulmonary complications there was no significant difference between the two interventions (CDT 3.1OR(fixed) 95% CI 1.01[0.76,1.34]. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Greenall-1980a" TYPE="STUDY">Greenall 1980a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Valdecasas-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Valdecasas 1988</LINK>) included emergency and elective patients. If emergency patients were excluded from the data there was still no difference in pulmonary complications (CDT 3,2 OR(fixed) 95% CI 0.98 [0.72,1.34].</P>
<P>Wound infection rates were examined in 10 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Valdecasas-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Valdecasas 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenall-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Greenall 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halm-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Halm 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindgren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lindgren 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seenu-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Seenu 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sehnal-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sehnal 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stone-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Stone 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Proske-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proske 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Inaba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Inaba 2004</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Greenall-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Greenall 1980</LINK> study the infection rates were very high and possibly more related to the antibiotic prophylaxis regime. Antibiotics were not given at all in some patients (even those considered high risk for infection) and never included metronidazole. Whether this study with quality issues is included or excluded in a sensitivity analysis the infection rate does not significantly differ between interventions (CDT 4,1-2 OR (fixed) 95% CI 1.10 [0.76, 1.34], 1.04[0.72,1.51]). If emergency patients were excluded from the analysis there was still no difference in wound infection rates (CDT 4,3 OR(fixed) 95% CI 1.09 [0.68,1.76].</P>
<P>Evisceration is a rare occurrence with any incision. Only two randomised studies record any individual occurrence (<LINK REF="STD-Greenall-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Greenall 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>) in 2 patients with a midline incision and 1 patient with a transverse incision suggesting the incidence in the combined series is less than 0.1%. Five studies comment on subcutaneous wound disruption or wound healing by secondary intention (<LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Valdecasas-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Valdecasas 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindgren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lindgren 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Inaba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Inaba 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Proske-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proske 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sehnal-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sehnal 2008</LINK>). Again the recorded incidence is too low to comment on whether it is more common with a particular intervention. One further study (<LINK REF="STD-Stone-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Stone 1983</LINK>) combines the incidence of wound dehiscence, with or without evisceration, occurring in 7 patients in the midline group and 3 in the transverse group. The separated data is not available but the authors comment that no significant difference was seen between the groups. If the incidence of wound dehiscence with or without evisceration is combined there is a trend towards a lower incidence in the transverse group (CDT 5,1 OR(fixed) 95% CI 0.55 [0.25,1.20]). There was not enough data to analyse elective patients as a sub-group.</P>
<P>Seven trials comment on follow up for incisional hernias (<LINK REF="STD-Greenall-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Greenall 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Valdecasas-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Valdecasas 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halm-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Halm 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Inaba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Inaba 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salonia-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Salonia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fassiadis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fassiadis 2005</LINK>). There was a significant difference seen in favour of the transverse incision (CDT 6,1 OR(fixed) 95% CI 0.49 [0.26, 1.72]). Follow up ranged from 4 months to 4.4 years but in all studies except three (<LINK REF="STD-Fassiadis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fassiadis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halm-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Halm 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>) the follow up was less than 1 year. This is not long enough follow-up to pick up all incisional hernias (<LINK REF="REF-Hoer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoer 2002</LINK>). However, the potential for some incisional hernias to not be detected does not explain the significant heterogeneity which remains the same even after exclusion of studies with a short follow up.</P>
<P>Hospital stay was assessed in 10 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Valdecasas-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Valdecasas 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halm-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Halm 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lacy 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindgren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lindgren 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seenu-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Seenu 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sehnal-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sehnal 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Proske-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proske 2005</LINK>). Due to the heterogeneity of the surgical procedures carried out it is not appropriate to combine all of the trials. However, four trials looked at cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Garcia_x002d_Valdecasas-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Garcia-Valdecasas 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halm-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Halm 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seenu-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Seenu 1994</LINK>) One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Halm-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Halm 2009</LINK>) provided data that was unable to be pooled. This study reported no difference between incision groups. Pooling the other data there was a significant reduction in hospital stay for the transverse incision group (CDT 7,1 WMD(fixed) 95% CI -1.35[-1.57,-1.14]). However, the study with the greatest influence over hospital stay (<LINK REF="STD-Seenu-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Seenu 1994</LINK>) ) has some statistical issues, the main being lack of data requiring a crude estimate of standard deviation. There was also significant heterogeneity if this study was included (p=0.02). If the <LINK REF="STD-Seenu-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Seenu 1994</LINK> trial is excluded in a sensitivity analysis no difference was seen (CDT 7,2 WMD(fixed) 95% CI 0.32 [-0.97, 1.61]). It is not possible to analyse the elective patients separately, although only 22 of the 369 patients with data on hospital stay were emergency procedures.</P>
<P>Combining the 2 trials on right hemicolectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindgren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lindgren 2001</LINK>) showed no difference in hospital stay (CDT 7.3, WMD(fixed) 95% CI -0.69[-2.03, 0.65]). Combining the two trials on patients undergoing surgery for pancreatic and gastric conditions (<LINK REF="STD-Proske-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proske 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>) was not possible as the <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK> trial data could not be separated from other data. Individually, no study showed any difference between incisions. The remaining trial participants included those undergoing abdominal aortic surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Lacy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lacy 1994</LINK>) and those undergoing hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy for patients undergoing gender reassignment (<LINK REF="STD-Sehnal-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sehnal 2008</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK> study also included patients undergoing a heterogeneous group of colonic procedures. These trials also showed no significant difference in hospital stay. Like analgesic requirements, hospital stay is heavily influenced by local practice and the absence of blinding of the carers in most trials mean that the results may not be valid and may be an alternative explanation to the statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Data on time taken to complete the operation was given in 12 trials. Again the heterogeneity of the type of operation make comparison difficult but it was possible to combine the trials looking at the same participants with 4 trials looking at patients undergoing cholecystectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Ali-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Armstrong-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Armstrong 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halm-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Halm 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seenu-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Seenu 1994</LINK>), two trials looking at patients undergoing right hemicolectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindgren-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lindgren 2001</LINK>) and three trials looking at gastric or pancreatic surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Proske-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proske 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Inaba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Inaba 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>). Of the remaining trials one looked at patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Lacy-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lacy 1994</LINK>), one at hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy for patients undergoing gender reassignment (<LINK REF="STD-Sehnal-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sehnal 2008</LINK>) and one at patients undergoing surgery for prostate cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Salonia-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Salonia 2005</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK> study also included patients undergoing a heterogeneous group of colonic procedures.</P>
<P>Combining the cholecystectomy trials showed no difference in operation time (CDT 8,1 WMD(fixed) 95% CI -2.52[-6.81, 1.78]). Again there were statistical issues with the <LINK REF="STD-Seenu-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Seenu 1994</LINK> trial. There was also significant heterogeneity if this study was included (p=0.06). Even if this study was excluded in a sensitivity analysis no difference was seen (CDT 8,2 WMD(fixed) 95% CI 6.38[-2.82, 15.57]). There was no difference in operation time with incision for a right hemicolectomy (CDT 8,3 WMD(fixed) 95% CI 6.18 [-5.78, 18.14]). Of the trials on gastric or pancreatic surgery all gave data on opening and closing times and one gave data for the whole procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>). Unfortunately insufficient data was available to pool the results although all trials suggested the midline procedure took significantly less time to gain abdominal access (<LINK REF="STD-Proske-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proske 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Inaba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Inaba 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>) and to close (<LINK REF="STD-Inaba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Inaba 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>). No difference was seen with the remaining three trials for aortic, gynaecological and prostate surgery.</P>
<P>Incision length was investigated in 6 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halm-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Halm 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Inaba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Inaba 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Proske-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proske 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salonia-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Salonia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seenu-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Seenu 1994</LINK>). For the <LINK REF="STD-Seenu-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Seenu 1994</LINK> paper, although the incision was larger in the midline group insufficient data was available for analysis. For all of the other trials the midline incision was significantly longer in two (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halm-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Halm 2009</LINK>) and shorter in 2 (<LINK REF="STD-Inaba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Inaba 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Proske-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proske 2005</LINK>). Due to the heterogeneity of the operations it is only reasonable to combine the results of 3 trials requiring upper gastrointestinal access (<LINK REF="STD-Halm-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Halm 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Inaba-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Inaba 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Proske-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proske 2005</LINK>). This analysis showed the midline incision was significantly shorter (CDT 9,1 WMD(fixed) 95% CI 3.77 [3.67, 3.87]). However, the highly significant heterogeneity seen may be reflective if the slightly different surgical indications particularly pancreatic surgery for the <LINK REF="STD-Proske-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proske 2005</LINK> trial.</P>
<P>A number of trials concluded that both midline and transverse incisions provided equal exposure to most intra-abdominal structures but this convenience of incision was only subjectively assessed in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Becquemin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Becquemin 1985</LINK>). In this trial the convenience of incision was found to be poor in only one patient (from the transverse intervention group) of the 25 patients studied.</P>
<P>Other outcomes examined in individual studies included cosmetic score or assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Proske-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proske 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halm-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Halm 2009</LINK>). Different assessment criteria meant that data could not be combined but both studies significantly favoured the transverse incision even though this was significantly longer.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-02-15 15:09:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The choice of incision for abdominal access is controversial. Although many randomised controlled trials have favoured a transverse or oblique incision over a midline incision in terms of complication rates and recovery, the individual study results are by no means universal. When the data from all of these trials is combined there is a suggestion that a transverse incision may result in less pain. However, the lack of blinding in almost all trials is very likely to have introduced substantial bias. This coupled with the marked clinical and methodological diversity of the individual papers and the fact that there is no subjective evidence of less pain (according to the VAS assessment) suggests that these results should be treated with caution.</P>
<P>Caution when comparing outcomes should also be reinforced by the heterogeneity of the operations and techniques utilised in opening and closing abdominal wounds. Some of these techniques (for instance muscle cutting and bilateral transverse or oblique incisions) are likely to cause more pain and pulmonary compromise than others (muscle splitting and unilateral incisions). Unfortunately, data on access techniques is minimal in most of the included studies (with notable recent exceptions).</P>
<P>The effects on pulmonary function favouring a transverse approach appear to be real. Further data available from more recent trials add to the evidence, with all studies that analysed pulmonary function showing the advantage of a transverse incision approach. However, the clinical consequences of these statistically significant analgesic and pulmonary function differences for incision type were not seen. There were no differences in pulmonary complications or hospital stay with each incision. This perhaps draws into question whether the analgesic and pulmonary function differences are relevant. Indeed, spirometry is only a surrogate marker of pulmonary 'well being' that may not be related to the more important clinical outcomes.</P>
<P>The initial review suggested that the other short and long term complications of surgery were no different between incisions. The inclusion of some more recent trials may now confirm the cadaver and animal trials suggesting a transverse incision is more resistant to rupture (<LINK REF="REF-Grantcharov-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grantcharov 2001</LINK>). The updated review continues to illustrate a trend to a lower rate of wound dehiscence with transverse incisions. Additionally, bearing in mind the data from <LINK REF="REF-Hoer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoer 2002</LINK> et al suggesting that it takes more than 2 years for 75% of incisional hernias to occur, the review now includes three trials with longer (but not necessarily sufficient) follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Fassiadis-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Fassiadis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halm-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Halm 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cosmesis data is still lacking, but has been examined in 2 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Proske-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Proske 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halm-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Halm 2009</LINK>) both suggesting a significant difference in favour of a transverse incision despite a significantly longer incision. It is unfortunate the data cannot be combined to provide further evidence of this subjective outcome. Other outcome measures were similar for each incision. Although the data for convenience of incision is sparse, either incision is likely to give adequate exposure provided it is large enough. . Overall operating time seems to be minimally affected by incision type and the intervention giving the smallest incision seems to vary dependent on the indication for surgery.</P>
<P>To summarise, a transverse incision appears to affect pulmonary function less than a midline incision, although this does not appear to increase the likelihood of pulmonary complications or other recovery parameters. The wound dehiscence and incisional hernia rate appears to be less with a transverse incision and the cosmetic result may be better. Although some data would suggest a transverse incision is less painful, there are too many variables to be sure. All other outcome parameters appear no different.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-02-15 14:35:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Because of many similar clinical outcomes, the use of a transverse or midline incision remains the choice of the individual surgeon. A midline incision is still the incision of choice in the emergency situation, allowing rapid entry into the peritoneal cavity and access to all organs. It is also the incision of choice in patients where there is an increased probability of re-laparotomy (Crohn's disease) or where a potential stoma site would be compromised by a transverse incision in a patient who is likely to need one. However, the possible increased pain and compromise on pulmonary function with a midline incision may prompt the operating surgeon to use a transverse incision in high risk patients particularly obese patients or those chronic obstructive airways disease. The increased incidence of wound dehiscence and incisional hernia may also influence the surgeon to favour a transverse incision.</P>
<P>With the increasing use of laparoscopic techniques in all aspects of abdominal surgery, the need for a review on open access incisions could be questioned. However, each update has included several new studies (3 in the last update) and over 1000 more participants, continuing to give testament to the relevance of such a review.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-02-15 15:09:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Larger studies are required that concentrate on specific procedures and specific opening and closing techniques. It is, however, very difficult to standardise these parameters, particularly with the trend of more minimal access techniques.</P>
<P>The effect of incision on patients with chronic obstructive airways disease has not been studied fully. These are the patients most likely to develop respiratory compromise after abdominal surgery and indeed wound rupture and it may be in this group that a large difference in complications is seen.</P>
<P>Pulmonary compromise is undoubtedly related to the cranial extent of the incision with upper midline incisions for gastric surgery, for instance, affecting respiratory function more significantly than incisions for pelvic surgery. This cranial extent of the incision may be an alternative explanation to the heterogeneity seen in some comparisons. This was suggested as a relevant topic for future work in the earlier review particularly if a transverse incision allows a significantly lower incision and a more effective block with the common use of epidurals for pain relief. Such a study has now been carried out (<LINK REF="STD-Mimica-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mimica 2007</LINK>) and adds to the evidence that upper abdominal incisions are more painful and affect respiratory function more than lower abdominal incisions.</P>
<P>Cosmesis is almost universally quoted in the literature as being an important advantage of minimal access surgery. This outcome is particularly important to the younger body image conscious patient. There has been additional comparison data added from a recent trial but the data still remains limited regarding cosmesis and the transverse or midline incision. .</P>
