<P>
<B>Review question: </B>What is the effect of prophylactic administration of cromolyn sodium on the incidence of chronic lung disease at 28 days or 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA), mortality, or the combined outcome of mortality or chronic lung disease at 28 days or 36 weeks' PMA in preterm infants.<B>

</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Cromolyn sodium administered in the first few days of life has not been shown to prevent chronic lung disease in preterm infants. Preterm babies (babies born before 37 weeks' PMA) often need to be given oxygen for lung problems for many weeks because of chronic lung disease. This is due, in part, to inflammation (swelling) within the lungs. Theoretically, cromolyn sodium is a drug that might help prevent this inflammation. It is relatively safe and side effects are rare. It can be given by nebuliser or aerosol inhaler in the first few days of life to try to prevent chronic lung disease.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found only two studies enrolling 64 infants. In one of the two studies, there was a low risk of bias whereas in the second study there were concerns about how the infants had been put into treatment groups, and whether parents and doctors were aware of which treatment was given (random sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding of outcomes assessment).</P>
<P>
<B>Study funding sources</B>
</P>
<P>We found no studies that received funding from the industry.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Prophylaxis with cromolyn sodium did not result in an important effect on the combined outcome of mortality or chronic lung disease at 28 days of age, chronic lung disease at 28 days; chronic lung disease at 28 days or at 36 weeks' PMA; or chronic lung disease in survivors at 28 days or at 36 weeks' PMA. This review of trials found no strong evidence that cromolyn sodium can prevent or reduce chronic lung disease and further research does not seem to be justified.<B>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-01-02 12:29:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>This is an update of a review last published by Cochrane in June 2012 entitled "Cromolyn sodium for the prevention of chronic lung disease in preterm infants", which included two studies. This 2016 update identified no further studies.</P>
<P>Chronic lung disease (CLD) frequently occurs in preterm infants and has a multifactorial aetiology including inflammation. Cromolyn sodium is a mast cell stabiliser that inhibits neutrophil activation and neutrophil chemotaxis and therefore may have a role in the prevention of CLD.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-01-02 11:45:53 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>To determine the effect of prophylactic administration of cromolyn sodium on the incidence of CLD at 28 days or 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA), mortality, or the combined outcome of mortality and CLD at 28 days or 36 weeks' PMA in preterm infants.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-01-02 11:52:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 12 May 2016), Embase (1980 to 12 May 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to 12 May 2016). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-01-02 11:49:17 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials involving preterm infants. Initiation of cromolyn sodium administration was during the first two weeks of life. The intervention had to include administration of cromolyn sodium by nebuliser or metered dose inhaler with or without spacer device versus placebo or no intervention. Eligible studies had to include at least one of the following outcomes: overall mortality, CLD at 28 days, CLD at 36 weeks' PMA, or the combined outcome mortality and CLD at 28 days. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-01-02 11:50:27 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We used the standard method for Cochrane as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>. We reported risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous data. The meta-analysis used a fixed-effect model. We examined heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. We assessed the quality of evidence for the main comparison at the outcome level using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-02 17:07:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We identified two eligible studies with small numbers of infants enrolled (64 infants). Prophylaxis with cromolyn sodium did not result in a statistically significant effect on the combined outcome of mortality and CLD at 28 days (typical RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.52; typical RD 0.03, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.27; 2 trials, 64 infants; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% for both RR and RD); mortality at 28 days (typical RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.29; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 73% typical RD 0.06, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.26; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 87%; 2 trials, 64 infants) (very low quality evidence); CLD at 28 days (typical RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.64; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 40%; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.20; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 38%; 2 trials, 64 infants) or at 36 weeks' PMA (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.43 to 3.63; RD 0.08, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.44; 1 trial, 26 infants). There was no significant difference in CLD in survivors at 28 days (typical RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.63; typical RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.26; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% for both RR and RD; 2 trials, 50 infants) or at 36 weeks' PMA (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.87; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.43; 1 trial, 22 infants). Prophylaxis with cromolyn sodium did not show a statistically significant difference in overall neonatal mortality, incidence of air leaks, necrotising enterocolitis, intraventricular haemorrhage, sepsis, and days of mechanical ventilation. There were no adverse effects noted. The quality of evidence according to GRADE was very low for one outcome (mortality to 28 days) and low for all other outcomes. The reasons for downgrading the evidence was due to design (risk of bias in one study), inconsistency between the two studies (high I<SUP>2</SUP> values for mortality at 28 days for both RR and RD), and lack of precision of estimates (small sample sizes). Further research does not seem to be justified.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-01-22 12:22:46 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic lung disease (CLD), defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days or at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) is a pulmonary disorder that frequently occurs in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Northway-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Northway 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shennan-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shennan 1988</LINK>). It is the consequence of unresolved or abnormally repaired lung damage and has a multifactorial aetiology that has been described extensively by previous authors. These factors include exposure to high oxygen concentrations, volume-derived trauma, barotrauma, sepsis and inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paita-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paita 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rojas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas 1995</LINK>). In the past decades, the survival rate of very low birth weight infants has increased and the prevalence of CLD remains high (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 1992</LINK>). The incidence varies depending on the population studied, the diagnostic criteria used and variation between centres in clinical management (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hack-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hack 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brodovich-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brodovich 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shennan-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shennan 1988</LINK>). CLD may be associated with chronic respiratory difficulties, prolonged and recurrent hospitalisation, growth restriction and death (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brodovich-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brodovich 1985</LINK>). The administration of antenatal corticosteroids to mothers likely to give birth preterm reduces neonatal mortality and the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) but not the incidence of CLD (<LINK REF="REF-Crowley--2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowley 2000</LINK>). Administration of prophylactic natural surfactant extract does not reduce the incidence of CLD but does reduce the combined outcome of death or CLD (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Neonates who develop CLD have elevated levels of endothelin-1, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and high ratios of IL-1B to IL-1 receptor antagonists (IL-1ra) in tracheobronchial lavage when compared to neonates with RDS or controls (<LINK REF="REF-Bagchi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bagchi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Niu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rindfleisch-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rindfleisch 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tullus-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tullus 1996</LINK>). One study showed elevated levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha in neonates who subsequently developed CLD (<LINK REF="REF-Tullus-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tullus 1996</LINK>), but another study did not (<LINK REF="REF-Bagchi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bagchi 1994</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-01-02 12:27:15 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Cromolyn sodium was originally characterised as a mast cell stabiliser (<LINK REF="REF-Hoag-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoag 1991</LINK>). However, it also inhibits neutrophil activation (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1987</LINK>), neutrophil chemotaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Bruijnzeel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruijnzeel 1989</LINK>), macrophage activation, tachykinin action, eicosanoid and cytokine release, and adhesion molecule expression (<LINK REF="REF-Yazid-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yazid 2009</LINK>). Cromolyn sodium was, therefore, thought to modulate the inflammatory process in the lung.</P>
<P>One in vitro study showed that cromolyn sodium stimulates the anti-inflammatory intracellular protein annexin-A1 trafficking and release (<LINK REF="REF-Yazid-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yazid 2009</LINK>). Cromolyn sodium inhibits eicosanoid release due to inhibition of a phosphatase PP2A (phosphoprotein phosphatase; EC 3.1.3.16), which probably forms part of a control loop to limit annexin-A1 release (<LINK REF="REF-Yazid-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yazid 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In adults exposed to organic dust, cromolyn sodium attenuates the increase in neutrophils, IL-6, TNF-alpha, myeloperoxidase and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 in bronchoalveolar lavage (<LINK REF="REF-Larsson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsson 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In one small non-randomised cohort comparison study of cromolyn sodium use in infants with CLD, <LINK REF="REF-Viscardi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viscardi 1994</LINK> found that there was a decrease in peak inspiratory pressure, a reduction in intermittent mandatory ventilation requirements and an increase in dynamic compliance after two weeks of cromolyn sodium therapy. Total airway resistance did not change significantly. Compared to matched controls there were no differences in duration of need for supplemental oxygen, ventilation or hospitalisation. These results suggested that cromolyn therapy might improve pulmonary function in some infants with established CLD (<LINK REF="REF-Viscardi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viscardi 1994</LINK>). Initiating cromolyn sodium treatment in the first few days of life in infants at risk of CLD might inhibit the neutrophil influx and the release of inflammatory mediators in the lung and thereby decrease the lung injury leading to CLD.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-01-02 12:29:11 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Cromolyn sodium may be delivered by nebuliser or pressurised aerosol with or without a spacer device. With either method only 0.22% to 1.3% of the dose reaches the lungs (<LINK REF="REF-Fok-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fok 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grigg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grigg 1992</LINK>). Aerosolised products tend to be deposited in the central lung region rather than in the periphery (<LINK REF="REF-Fok-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fok 1996</LINK>). Humidification of the gas reduces lower respiratory tract deposition of aerosolised products (<LINK REF="REF-Diot-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diot 1995</LINK>). Addition of a spacer device between the nebuliser and the endotracheal tube (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 1995</LINK>), and synchronising nebulisation with inspiratory airflow (<LINK REF="REF-Diot-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diot 1995</LINK>), increase deposition. There is considerable intersubject variability in lung deposition (<LINK REF="REF-Fok-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fok 1996</LINK>). All these factors will modify therapeutic effects.</P>
<P>Cromolyn is thought to be a relatively safe drug. However, there are occasional reports in the literature of adverse effects. These include dermatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Settipane-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Settipane 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheffer-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheffer 1975</LINK>), urticaria (<LINK REF="REF-Menon-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menon 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheffer-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheffer 1975</LINK>), eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates (<LINK REF="REF-Lobel-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lobel 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheffer-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheffer 1975</LINK>), pulmonary allergic granulomatosis (<LINK REF="REF-Burgher-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgher 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheffer-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheffer 1975</LINK>), and anaphylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmad-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmad 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brown-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1981</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>For the update in 2016, we used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2013</LINK>) for the following (clinically relevant) outcomes: CLD (defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days of life or at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age with compatible chest x-ray signs), mortality within the study period and, the number of days on mechanical ventilation.</P>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the quality of the evidence for each of the outcomes. We considered evidence from RCTs as high quality but downgraded the evidence one level for serious (or two levels for very serious) limitations based upon the following: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates and presence of publication bias. We used the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool to create a 'Summary of findings' table to report the quality of the evidence (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT</LINK>).</P>
<P>The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the quality of a body of evidence in one of four grades.</P>
<UL>
<LI>High: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.</LI>
<LI>Low: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.</LI>

<P>In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Watterberg-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Watterberg 1993</LINK>, 38 infants needing ventilatory support at birth were randomised to receive cromolyn sodium or saline. The preterm infants had a mean GA standard deviation (SD) of 25.9 ± 0.9 weeks and a mean (SD) birth weight of 845 ± 81 g in the treatment group and a mean GA (SD) of 26 ± 1.5 weeks and a mean (SD) birth weight of 851 ± 150 g in the control group. Infants were stratified into groups weighing below 1000 g and weighing 1000 to 2000 g. <LINK REF="STD-Watterberg-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Watterberg 1993</LINK> stated that allocation to treatment groups was by sequential numbers, but it was unclear exactly what this involved and, therefore, whether blinding occurred was also unclear. The infants were comparable in severity of illness on entry into the study (defined as fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO<SUB>2</SUB>) and respiratory acuity score). Infants were enrolled into the study less than 12 hours after intubation for RDS. Cromolyn sodium 20 mg or normal saline 2 mL were given nebulised every six hours for the duration of intubation. The length of time that the infants were intubated and, therefore, received treatment, was lacking. The study was discontinued when 10 babies of birth weight under 1000 g and 28 babies of birth weight from 1000 to 2000 g had been enrolled. Although we had not specified subgroup analyses by birth weight, data from this study could be obtained only from babies over 1000 g for some outcomes.</P>
<P>In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Viscardi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Viscardi 1997</LINK>, 26 infants requiring ventilation on day one for RDS with a greater than 75% predicted probability of oxygen dependence at 28 days were randomised to receive either nebulised cromolyn sodium 20 mg or normal saline 2 mL every six hours. The 12-hour CLD predictive score was similar in the two groups. There was no difference between groups in FiO<SUB>2</SUB>, alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient or ventilatory settings on the day of study entry. The infants received the drug from day three to day 28 of life. One infant was withdrawn at day seven at parental request but was included in the analyses of outcomes. Seventy-seven per cent of infants in the cromolyn sodium group and 100% of infants in the placebo group received exogenous surfactant. The primary outcome was the concentration of cytokines in lung lavage in these infants.</P>
<P>Neither trial collected data regarding the amount and site of drug deposition in the lungs. Neither trials documented the numbers of infants receiving postnatal dexamethasone.</P>

<P>This is only commented on in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Watterberg-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Watterberg 1993</LINK>, who did not report days on mechanical ventilation for babies under 1000 g; therefore, this outcome was analysed only for babies over 1000 g. There was no evidence of effect (MD 1.00 day, 95% CI -6.41 to 8.41) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>). This result was based on one trial and 28 infants.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other effects: cytokines in lung lavage</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Viscardi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Viscardi 1997</LINK> showed that although the prestudy (day three) cytokine concentrations of cromolyn treated and control groups were similar, IL-8 concentration in lavage from cromolyn sodium-treated infants decreased 2.45-fold from day three to day seven, whereas IL-8 concentrations increased 1.7-fold in lavage of control infants during the same interval. IL-8 concentrations were 4.9-fold lower on day seven in lavage from cromolyn sodium-treated infants (median 2245 pg/mL) compared to levels in control infants (median 11,009 pg/mL) (P = 0.051). TNF-alpha was 3.6-fold lower on day seven in lavage from the cromolyn sodium-treated infants (median 19.95 pg/mL) compared with lung lavage from control infants (median 70.9 pg/mL) (P = 0.04). There was a trend towards lower lavage levels of IL-1B on day seven in cromolyn sodium-treated infants (median 46.75 pg/mL) compared to lavage levels in control infants (median 208.2 pg/mL) (P = 0.13) but IL-1ra concentrations were unaffected by cromolyn sodium treatment (day seven cromolyn sodium-treated infants median 21.5 ng/mL, day seven control-treated infants median 23 ng/mL). The IL-1B:IL-1ra ratio was lower in day seven lavage from cromolyn sodium-treated infants compared to the ratio in control infant lavage (cromolyn sodium median 0.002, control median 0.005) (P = 0.09). It is difficult to interpret these results since there were no clinical benefits noted.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-01-02 15:59:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-02 15:36:18 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Both included studies involved very small numbers of infants (26 (<LINK REF="STD-Viscardi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Viscardi 1997</LINK>) and 38 (<LINK REF="STD-Watterberg-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Watterberg 1993</LINK>)). The sample sizes were so small that no reliable estimate of treatment effect was provided. The wide CIs showed that clinically important effect sizes on major outcomes have not been excluded. Neither of these trials assessed drug deposition and it is possible that the drug was not received in effective doses at the correct sites.</P>
<P>Prophylaxis with cromolyn sodium did not result in a statistically significant effect on the combined outcome of mortality or CLD at 28 days, mortality at 28 days, CLD at 28 days or at 36 weeks' PMA. There was no significant difference in CLD in survivors at 28 days or at 36 weeks' PMA. Prophylaxis with cromolyn sodium did not show a statistically significant difference in overall neonatal mortality, incidence of air leaks, NEC, IVH, sepsis and days of mechanical ventilation. There were no adverse effects noted.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-01-02 15:37:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>To date only 64 infants have been enrolled in two studies that were published in 1993 and 1997.</P>
<P>Although the study by <LINK REF="STD-Viscardi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Viscardi 1997</LINK> showed a reduction in cytokines in lung lavage from infants treated with cromolyn sodium, this did not translate into clinical benefits. Neither of the two eligible studies found a reduction in CLD or mortality. There was moderate heterogeneity for the outcome of mortality to 28 days for RR (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 73%) but high for RD (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 87%). For all the other outcomes, there was no or low heterogeneity. Cromolyn sodium had no statistically significant effect on the outcomes of IVH, NEC, PDA, air leak, days on mechanical ventilation or sepsis. There were no adverse effects noted.</P>
<P>Cromolyn sodium was given for different duration in the two studies. In the <LINK REF="STD-Watterberg-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Watterberg 1993</LINK> study, cromolyn sodium was given for the duration of intubation. In the <LINK REF="STD-Viscardi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Viscardi 1997</LINK> study, it was given for 25 days. The age of entry to the studies differed. In the <LINK REF="STD-Watterberg-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Watterberg 1993</LINK> study, the age of entry was 12 hours after intubation and in the <LINK REF="STD-Viscardi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Viscardi 1997</LINK> study it was on day three of life.</P>
<P>The available evidence does not justify further trials using the protocols for cromolyn sodium administration used to date.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-01-02 15:58:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The quality of evidence according to GRADE was very low for one outcome (mortality to 28 days) and low for all the other reported outcomes (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The reasons for downgrading the evidence was due to design (risk of bias in one study), inconsistency between the findings of the two studies for one outcome (high I<SUP>2</SUP> values for mortality at 28 days for both RR and RD) and lack of precision of estimates due to small sample sizes.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2017-01-02 16:55:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The following issues were evaluated and entered into the risk of bias table.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:</P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment?</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk for participants;</LI>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk for personnel;</LI>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk for outcome assessors.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);</LI>
<LI>high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Selective reporting bias. Were reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (where it was clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review were reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk (where not all the study's prespecified outcomes were reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.<BR/>
