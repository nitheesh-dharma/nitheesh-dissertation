<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a condition where a blood clot forms in the deep veins (most commonly of the leg) and can travel up to block the arteries in the lungs (a life-threatening condition known as pulmonary embolism). Treating VTE requires injections of a drug called heparin, which stops further clots forming. Heparin comes in two forms: unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). UFH can be administered as a continuous intravenous (IV) infusion or intermittently as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous), while LMWH is injected subcutaneously. This review measures the effects of subcutaneous UFH versus IV UFH and LMWH for preventing recurrent clots, mortality and major bleeding. This is an update of a review published in 2009.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>After searching for relevant studies up to November 2016, we found one study to add to this update. In total, we included 16 randomised controlled trials in 3593 participants in this review. This update showed that there was no evidence of a difference between subcutaneous UFH versus intravenous UFH or subcutaneous LMWH for preventing recurrent clots, death or major bleeding.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>The quality of the evidence was low due to lack of blinding in the included studies and imprecision of the results due to the small number of reported events.</P>

<P>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a prevalent and serious condition. Its medical treatment requires anticoagulation, usually with either unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Administration of unfractionated heparin (UFH) is usually intravenous (IV) but can be subcutaneous as well. This is an update of a review first published in 2009.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-10-11 12:57:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (JS and LR) independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. We used meta-analyses when we considered heterogeneity low. The primary outcomes were symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism), VTE-related mortality, adverse effects of treatment including major bleeding, and all-cause mortality. We calculated all outcomes using an odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-09 15:30:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included one additional study in this update, bringing the total number of studies in the review to 16 randomised controlled trials, with a total of 3593 participants (1745 participants in the intervention group and 1848 participants in the control group). Eight trials used intravenous UFH as the control treatment, seven trials used LMWH, and one trial had three arms with both drugs as the controls. We did not identify trials comparing subcutaneous UFH with other anticoagulant drugs. We downgraded the quality of the evidence to low due to lack of blinding in studies, which led to a risk of performance bias, and also for imprecision, as reflected by the wide confidence intervals.</P>
<P>When comparing subcutaneous versus IV UFH, there was no difference in the incidence of symptomatic recurrent VTE at three months (odds ratio (OR) 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 3.10; 8 studies; N = 965; low-quality evidence), symptomatic recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at three months (OR 3.29, 95% CI 0.64 to 17.06; 1 study; N = 115; low-quality evidence), pulmonary embolism (PE) at three months (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.84; 9 studies; N = 1161; low-quality evidence), VTE-related mortality at three months (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.88; 9 studies; N = 1168; low-quality evidence), major bleeding (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.97; 4 studies; N = 583; low-quality evidence) or all-cause mortality (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.51; 8 studies; N = 972; low-quality evidence). There were no episodes of asymptomatic VTE occurring within three months of the commencement of treatment.</P>
<P>When comparing subcutaneous UFH versus LMWH, there was no difference in the incidence of recurrent VTE at three months (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.63; 5 studies; N = 2156; low-quality evidence), recurrent DVT at three months (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.63; 3 studies; N = 1566; low-quality evidence), PE (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.96; 5 studies, N = 1819; low-quality evidence), VTE-related mortality (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.67; 8 studies; N = 2469; low-quality evidence), major bleeding (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.20; 5 studies; N = 2300; low-quality evidence) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.07; 7 studies; N = 2272; low-quality evidence).

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-02-09 15:31:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) describes the formation of thrombus in the deep veins, most commonly in the legs (deep vein thrombosis, or DVT). VTE may also refer to the subsequent embolisation of all or part of the thrombus to the pulmonary circulation (pulmonary embolism, or PE). DVT of the lower limbs may be associated with localised pain, swelling and erythema as well as the development of pulmonary emboli and the later occurrence of post-thrombotic syndrome (persistent swelling, erythema and ulceration). PE presents acutely with shortness of breath, pain on inspiration, tachycardia and right heart overload, and if untreated, it can lead to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, acute circulatory collapse and death. Increasingly, in the era of more liberal central venous catheterisation, DVT may involve the upper extremities. Rarely, it may also affect other venous circulation (cerebral veins, portal and mesenteric veins, etc.).</P>
<P>In addition to DVT and PE, thrombus can also form in the superficial veins, where it is associated with local pain and inflammation (superficial venous thrombosis). This tends to be associated with lower mortality and morbidity rates than DVT, although some patients may be at a higher risk of DVT formation depending on the location of the clot (<LINK REF="REF-Chengelis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chengelis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nasr-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nasr 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is comprised of DVT and PE and can occur spontaneously. However, there are many risk factors for VTE, including periods of inactivity, dehydration, hospitalisation, trauma, clotting disorders and previous thrombosis, varicose veins with phlebitis, pregnancy, oral combined hormonal contraceptives, malignancy, obesity, smoking, and age (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of VTE in mostly white populations is between 100 and 200 per 100,000 person-years (<LINK REF="REF-Heit-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2003</LINK>). Of these, it is estimated that 45 to 117 cases per 100,000 person-years are due to DVT (without PE), and 29 to 78 are due to PE (with or without DVT) (<LINK REF="REF-Heit-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2015</LINK>). Recurrent VTE occurs in approximately 7.4% of patients at 1 year and up to 30.4% of patients by 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Cushman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cushman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heit-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-02-09 15:31:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Heparin is a heterogeneous mixture of branched glycosaminoglycans (GAG), discovered in 1916 (<LINK REF="REF-McLean-1916" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLean 1916</LINK>).</P>
<P>The anticoagulant action of heparin requires the binding of antithrombin (AT). Heparin binds to AT through a unique glucosamine unit that is contained within a pentasaccharide sequence present in a fraction of the GAG molecules. Currently, three therapeutic heparin preparations are available for clinical use: unfractionated heparin (UFH) with a molecular weight of approximately 15,000 daltons; its derivative low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), with an average molecular weight of 4000 to 5000 daltons; and the significantly more expensive pentasaccharide. Although LMWH has largely replaced UFH in the setting of acute VTE treatment, many people do not benefit from its use due to increased risk of complications, specifically bleeding in patients with severe renal failure.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-02-09 15:31:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Complications of heparin use may include bleeding; heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT); and in the long term, heparin-induced osteoporosis. Consequently, it is important to monitor coagulation factors, specifically the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), when using UFH. There are two preferred modes of administering this treatment: a continuous intravenous (IV) mode and an intermittent subcutaneous mode. Depending on the method chosen, pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrate differences in heparin bioavailability and early achievement of a therapeutic aPTT goal, favouring the intravenous route (<LINK REF="STD-Hull-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hull 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nevertheless, investigators have evaluated the subcutaneous route of administration for VTE due to its ease of application, early mobilisation and hospital discharge, and presumably less line-related complications. People have received the treatment either in weight-adjusted or aPTT-adjusted doses, and investigators have compared results with other available treatment modalities.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-02-09 15:31:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two meta-analyses comparing LMWH versus intravenous UFH have shown LMWH to be non-inferior to UFH with regards to recurrent DVT, PE, bleeding and thrombocytopenia (reduction in the number of platelets) (<LINK REF="REF-Dolovich-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dolovich 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quinlan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinlan 2004</LINK>). However, there were no trials utilising subcutaneous UFH for this indication in these analyses. The present review was originally completed in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Vardi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vardi 2009</LINK>), and an update is necessary to incorporate evidence from any new studies completed since then. Additionally, Cochrane has developed new methodology during that time that should be incorporated in the updated review.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of subcutaneous UFH versus intravenous UFH, LMWH or any other anticoagulant drug for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism. We included trials with more than two treatment groups and analysed them accordingly. We did not expect to find any cross-over trials in the setting of VTE. We included trials with interventions and follow-up periods of any duration.</P>
<P>We excluded randomised controlled trials without truly random allocation to the treatment or control group or without allocation concealment, in view of the fact that prior knowledge of treatment allocation may have led to biased participant allocation, treatment or reporting. After allocation, further concealment of treatment may be impossible due to the differences between preparations and routes of administration. Thus, despite recognising that this may lead to biased treatment or reporting, post-allocation blinding was not a prerequisite, and we addressed it in a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>We acknowledge that non-randomised studies or studies using other randomisation methods (for example cluster randomisation) may provide useful information about this problem. However, for this review, we did not consider such studies.</P>

Studies recruited participants upon diagnosis of VTE and randomised them to treatment groups. Eight of the included studies administered an initial intravenous heparin bolus prior to initiating subcutaneous heparin treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Andersson-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Andersson 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hull-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hull 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kr_x00e4_henb_x00fc_hl-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Krähenbühl 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leizorovicz-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Leizorovicz 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopaciuk-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lopaciuk 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopaciuk-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lopaciuk 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peternel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Peternel 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2004</LINK>). One study maintained the infusion for 24 hours before the first subcutaneous administration (<LINK REF="STD-Holm-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1986</LINK>).

Diagnostic modalities for DVT included venous occlusion plethysmography, thermography, phlebography, venography, and colour-duplex sonography; as well as lung scan or CT-angiography for PE. Follow-up length was as long as the intervention duration in eight studies and three months in seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Doyle-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Doyle 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hull-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hull 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kearon-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kearon 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopaciuk-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lopaciuk 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopaciuk-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lopaciuk 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2004</LINK>).

Five of these studies described the use of 'sealed envelopes' to maintain allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Bentley-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Doyle-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Doyle 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopaciuk-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lopaciuk 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopaciuk-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lopaciuk 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walker-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1987</LINK>). The <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> states that allocation concealment should be achieved through sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes, opened only after irreversible assignment to a participant. However, due to the age of the studies included in this review, we decided that studies describing the use of envelopes to maintain allocation concealment would be at lower risk of selection bias than those that did not and that we would deem them to be at low risk. Three studies described the use of central telephone randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Kearon-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kearon 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leizorovicz-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Leizorovicz 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Leizorovicz-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Leizorovicz 2011</LINK> specifically stated that "no allocation concealment mechanism was attempted as the study was open"; however, we still considered the study to be at low risk of selection bias, as this statement appeared to contradict the description of "central telephone randomisation". We therefore assumed that the authors were referring to the blinding of participants and personnel as "allocation concealment". Furthermore, authors also stated that "care was taken to ensure that outcome assessors and data analysts were kept blinded to the allocation".</P>
<P>We judged <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1986</LINK> to be at high risk of selection bias due to allocation concealment. Authors stated that participants' allocations to treatment groups depended on the order of participant admission: "the vials [of low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin] had been randomised in advance and numbered consecutively, the number of patient admission determining the number of vial used". As personnel potentially had knowledge of the order of the vials &#8211; allowing them to control the composition of the treatment groups by manipulating the order of participant admission &#8211; we deemed this study to be at high risk of selection bias.</P>
<P>No other studies provided descriptions of allocation concealment, so we deemed them to be at unclear risk for allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Andersson-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Andersson 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belcaro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Belcaro 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Faivre-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Faivre 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hull-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hull 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kr_x00e4_henb_x00fc_hl-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Krähenbühl 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peternel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Peternel 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pini-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pini 1990</LINK>).</P>

<P>For measuring the risk of detection bias, we decided that due to the subjective nature of certain criteria, we would rate studies as being at high risk of detection bias if they did not adequately blind for the following outcomes: recurrent VTE at three months; recurrent DVT at three months; PE &#8211; excluding PE found at autopsy; incidence of asymptomatic VTE at three months; quality of life; and incidence of HIT. However, we thought that VTE-related mortality at three months, all-cause mortality and major and minor bleeding (if they followed the definition provided by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis) were objective enough to not require blinding.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-02-09 15:41:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review assessed whether subcutaneous UFH reduced the rate of recurrent VTE, VTE-related mortality, major bleeding and all-cause mortality in participants with VTE. Eight studies used IV UFH as the comparator and seven studies used LMWH, while one three-armed trial compared all three of those treatment possibilities. We did not identify trials comparing subcutaneous UFH with other anticoagulant drugs. All trials included participants with deep vein thrombosis. Seven trials excluded people with a PE, four trials included PE participants, and the remaining trials did not clearly describe PE inclusion. With the exception of asymptomatic VTE at three months and health-related quality of life, the included studies measured and reported all of the addressed outcomes. As all the trials had strict inclusion criteria, resulting in an overall participant population with almost identical conditions, statistical heterogeneity was logically low for all outcomes. Furthermore, studies used similar concentrations for each particular drug.</P>
<P>We planned subgroup analyses by first or recurrent VTE, severity, age, renal function, underlying pathology, number of daily subcutaneous heparin injections, type of dose adjustment, initial intravenous bolus heparin given versus not given, concomitant oral anticoagulant use, and timing of oral anticoagulant initiation. However, we could not perform these subgroup analyses because of the lack of participant-level data.</P>
<P>Although many researchers consider DVT and PE to be manifestations of the same disorder, we elected to present them in the form of subgroups, as there is evidence of clinically significant differences between them. Most recurrent events occur at the same site as the original thrombosis (in other words, in a person presenting with a PE, a recurrent event after treatment is much more likely to be another PE). For comparisons and outcomes where subgroup analyses were possible, we did not observe any differences between studies recruiting participants that had DVT without PE and participants that had DVT with/without PE.</P>
<P>The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of VTE suggest UFH as the treatment of choice for patients with severe renal failure (<LINK REF="REF-Kearon-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kearon 2012</LINK>). This is a grade 2C recommendation, based on low-quality evidence that LMWH is associated with increased bleeding in patients with impaired renal function. Only one trial included in our review studied participants with impaired renal function (<LINK REF="STD-Leizorovicz-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Leizorovicz 2011</LINK>), comparing subcutaneous UFH versus LMWH tinzaparin in the treatment of acute DVT. The trial was terminated early due to a difference in mortality that favoured the group treated with UFH. However, rates of major bleeding and recurrent VTE were similar between the two groups.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-02-09 15:42:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The risk of bias was high in 15 out of the 16 included studies, reflecting low methodological quality (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). This was largely due to the lack of blinding in 14 studies, which led to a high risk of performance bias. The risk of detection bias was lower: 8 of the 16 included studies reported that outcomes assessors were blinded to the treatment and adjudicated by a central independent committee. We judged seven studies to be at high risk of attrition bias for failing to account for missing data, one study to be at high risk of selection bias because of insufficient reporting of the methods used to conceal treatment allocation, and another study to be at high risk of reporting bias because it reported a significant result on an outcome that was not pre-specified. We could not investigate publication bias because we could not assess asymmetry in a funnel plot with the limited number of studies included in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes in both comparisons, we downgraded the quality of the evidence to low due to the high risk of bias within each included study and also due to imprecision stemming from the small number of outcome events, as reflected by the wide confidence intervals.</P>

<P>The search was as comprehensive as possible, and we are confident that we have included all relevant studies. However, the possibility remains that we missed some relevant trials, particularly in the grey literature (for example conference proceedings). Two review authors independently performed study selection and data extraction in order to minimise bias in the review process. We performed data collection according to the process suggested by Cochrane. We also followed Cochrane processes as described by <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK> for assessing the risk of bias.</P>

<P>A meta-analysis comparing subcutaneous heparin with intravenous heparin published in 1992 concluded that the subcutaneous mode of administration was more efficacious and less toxic than the intravenous mode of administration (<LINK REF="REF-Hommes-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hommes 1992</LINK>). Another more recent review of the literature comparing subcutaneous UFH versus subcutaneous LMWH concluded that subcutaneous UFH was an attractive alternative to LWMH for VTE, being "cheap, effective and safe" (<LINK REF="REF-Munro-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munro 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since the introduction of LMWH, there has been a shift away from the older and less easy-to-use UFH. Several other meta-analyses of the medical literature have been published over the years, suggesting enhanced efficacy and safety profile for LMWH (<LINK REF="REF-Erkens-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erkens 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gould-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gould 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>Low-quality evidence suggests there is no difference in effectiveness between subcutaneous UFH, IV UFH and LMWH for preventing recurrent VTE at three months, VTE-related mortality, major bleeding and all-cause mortality. Therefore, for people with difficult venous access or people who could be treated at home, subcutaneous UFH appears to be an acceptable alternative to IV UFH. Futhermore, in patients with severe renal impairment, subcutaneous UFH can be used instead of LMWH.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-02-09 15:42:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further research is required to consolidate non-monitored subcutaneous administration of UFH in the setting of VTE. Future research should target specific patient groups, e.g. patients with chronic kidney disease and elderly patients, and specific VTE states (e.g. DVT versus PE), and researchers should analyse data separately for their response to the proposed intervention. Finally, studies should evaluate cost-effectiveness, comparing continuous infusions of UFH versus subcutaneous administration of LMWH.</P>
