<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-03-21 13:55:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>
<B>Background: </B>The majority of people with hip fracture are elderly and are treated surgically, which requires anaesthesia. The fracture usually results from a simple fall. These patients often have many other medical problems associated with ageing, which places them at high risk of mortality after anaesthesia. The most common types of anaesthesia are 'general' and 'regional anaesthesia'. General anaesthesia involves a loss of consciousness (induced sleep). Regional anaesthesia involves an injection of a solution containing local anaesthetic inside the spine (neuraxial block) or around the nerves outside the spine (peripheral nerve block) to prevent pain in the leg with the hip fracture. We reviewed the evidence about the effect of regional anaesthesia on patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>The evidence is current to March 2014. In total, we included 31 studies (with 3231 participants) in our review. Of those 31 studies, 28 (2976 participants) provided data for the meta-analyses. The mean age of the participants varied from 75 to 86 years. Those studies were published between 1977 and 2013 and so covering a wide range of clinical practices and improvements in techniques over time. Two studies were funded by the anaesthetic drug manufacturer or by an agency with a commercial interest, one received charitable funding, and one was funded by a government agency. We reran the search in February 2017. Potential new studies of interest were added to a list of "Studies awaiting Classification" and will be incorporated into the formal review findings during the review update.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results : </B>The trial reports of many of the studies indicated a sub-suboptimal level of methodological rigour and the number of participants included was often insufficient to allow us to draw a definitive conclusion on many of the outcomes studied. We did not find any difference in mortality at one month (11 trials with 2152 participants) between neuraxial blocks and general anaesthesia. We also did not find a difference for pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, pulmonary embolism, number of patients transfused with red blood cells, length of surgery and length of hospital stay between these two anaesthetic techniques in two to twelve studies. Likewise, when potent prophylactic drugs (such as low molecular weight heparin) were used against postoperative clot formation, we did not find a difference in the risk of deep venous thrombosis. Without prophylaxis with potent anticoagulant drugs the risk of deep venous thrombosis was less with neuraxial block.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence: </B>The level of evidence was very low for mortality, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, decrease in the incidence of deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent prophylaxis, and return of patient to their own home. This means that any estimate of effect is very uncertain.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-15 15:14:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In total, we included 31 studies (with 3231 participants) in our review. Of those 31 studies, 28 (2976 participants) provided data for the meta-analyses. For the 28 studies, 24 were used for the comparison of neuraxial block versus general anaesthesia. Based on 11 studies that included 2152 participants, we did not find a difference between the two anaesthetic techniques for mortality at one month: risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.06; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 24% (fixed-effect model). Based on six studies that included 761 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of pneumonia: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.31; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%. Based on four studies that included 559 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of myocardial infarction: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.22 to 3.65; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%. Based on six studies that included 729 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of cerebrovascular accident: RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.83; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%. Based on six studies that included 624 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of acute confusional state: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.40; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 49%. Based on laboratory tests, the risk of deep vein thrombosis was decreased when no specific precautions or just early mobilization was used: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.78; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 3, 95% CI 2 to 7, based on a basal risk of 76%) but not when low molecular weight heparin was administered: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.84; I<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity between the two subgroups = 58%. For neuraxial blocks compared to general anaesthesia, we rated the quality of evidence as very low for mortality (at 0 to 30 days), pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, decreased rate of deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent thromboprophylaxis, and return of patient to their own home. The number of studies comparing other anaesthetic techniques was limited.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-02-11 17:43:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not find a difference between the two techniques, except for deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent thromboprophylaxis. The studies included a wide variety of clinical practices. The number of participants included in the review is insufficient to eliminate a difference between the two techniques in the majority of outcomes studied. Therefore, large randomized trials reflecting actual clinical practice are required before drawing final conclusions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-02-18 12:09:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-02-18 12:09:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The term 'proximal femoral fracture', or 'hip fracture', refers to a fracture of the femur in the area of bone immediately distal to the articular cartilage of the hip, to a level of about five centimetres below the lower border of the lesser trochanter. The majority of these fractures occur in the elderly population, and more than 30% of the patients are 85 years or older (<LINK REF="REF-Brauer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brauer 2009</LINK>). In the United States, while the age-adjusted incidence of hip fracture increased from 1986 to 1995, a steady decline from 1995 to 2005 has been reported. In women, the incidence increased by 9.0% in 1995 compared to 1986, with a subsequent decline of 24.5% in 2005. In men, the increase in incidence from 1986 to 1995 was 16.4%, and the subsequent decrease to 2005 was 19.2% (<LINK REF="REF-Brauer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brauer 2009</LINK>). Despite this improvement, hip fractures in the elderly are still quite common, and this improvement may not apply to developing countries. Between 1986 and 2005, in the United States, the annual mean number of hip fractures was 957.3 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval (CI), 921.7 to 992.9) for women and 414.4 per 100,000 (95% CI, 401.6 to 427.3) for men (<LINK REF="REF-Brauer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brauer 2009</LINK>). The injury is usually the result of a simple fall.</P>
<P>The majority of these fractures are treated surgically; thus hip fracture surgery represents one of the most common emergency orthopaedic procedures. Surgical treatment may be either fixation of the fracture or replacement of the femoral head with an arthroplasty. Internal fixation involves using screws or pins, either alone, or in combination with a side plate applied to the femur, or by the use of an intramedullary nail with a cross screw inserted into the femoral head. Arthroplasty involves excision of the fractured area of bone and replacement with a partial or total hip replacement, which may be cemented in place.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-02-11 18:00:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The term 'regional anaesthesia' may include neuraxial blocks or peripheral nerve blocks. Neuraxial blockade refers to placement of a solution containing local anaesthetics close to the spinal cord. Neuraxial blocks may be executed by spinal or epidural or combined spinal/epidural blockade. For a spinal block, the solution containing the local anaesthetics is placed in the cerebrospinal fluid. For an epidural block, the solution containing the local anaesthetic is placed in the epidural space, outside the dura matter (membrane surrounding the cord and the cerebrospinal fluid). Peripheral nerve blocks refer to placement of local anaesthetics around peripheral nerves or plexus outside the spine. Peripheral nerve blocks for this indication are usually performed by a posterior lumbar plexus block (psoas compartment block), with or without additional blocks (sacral plexus block, iliac crest infiltration). For posterior lumbar plexus blocks and for sacral plexus blocks, the local anaesthetics are placed around the roots of the nerves, immediately after their exit from the spine at the lumbar level (posterior lumbar plexus block) or at the sacral level (sacral plexus block). An iliac crest infiltration is the deposition of local anaesthetics under the skin above the iliac crest along its superior border. Neuraxial or peripheral nerve blocks may be performed by a single shot injection or by incremental doses, with or without a continuous infusion thereafter. When a patient is having an operation under regional anaesthesia alone, he/she remains conscious, but insensitive to pain. The muscle relaxation obtained is also usually sufficient to allow the surgeon to repair the fracture. General anaesthesia refers to the use of a variety of intravenous and or inhalation drugs to render the patient unconscious, amnesic of the procedure and insensitive to pain. Neuromuscular blocking agents are often added for a hip fracture repair under general anaesthesia.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-02-11 18:03:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whilst the hip fracture is usually the only injury, the patients frequently have many other medical problems associated with ageing. Indeed, an increase in all comorbidities (except paralysis) in patients with hip fracture was recorded from 1986 to 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Brauer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brauer 2009</LINK>). Advanced age and frequent multiple associated comorbidities put these patients at high risk of mortality after anaesthesia. The 10-year probability of survival of patients with comorbidities (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status (ASA) III or IV undergoing major surgery is lower than that of patients without significant comorbidities (ASA I or II) (<LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 2010</LINK>). A recent Cochrane Overview, found that the 0 to 30-day mortality of patients undergoing high or moderate cardiac risk procedures is lower in patients having an operation under neuraxial blocks compared to those having an operation under general anaesthesia: risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.94; moderate quality of evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Guay-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2014</LINK>). Major orthopaedic surgeries such as hip fracture repairs are considered moderate cardiac risk procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Fleisher-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleisher 2007</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-02-11 18:09:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In a previous version of this review, we concluded that regional anaesthesia was associated with a borderline decreased mortality at one month: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.95 (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2004</LINK>). This finding however, is not corroborated with a recent large retrospective study, where the authors concluded that the use of regional anaesthesia compared with general anaesthesia was not associated with lower 30-day mortality, but only with a modestly shorter length of hospital stay (<LINK REF="REF-Neuman-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuman 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review is an update of previous versions (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Urwin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urwin 2000</LINK>).

<P>Two review authors (JG and SK) independently assessed the quality of the studies with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed the risk of bias based on the information presented in the reports, with no assumptions: low risk, high risk or unclear risk of bias. When there was not enough information in the report to make an assessment, we judged the item as high risk for blinding (blinding of participants and personnel and blinding of outcome assessment) and as unclear for all other items.

<P>We analysed data with Comprehensive Meta-analysis software (<A HREF="http://www.meta-analysis.com">http://www.meta-analysis.com</A>).

We expressed data as RRs (dichotomous), MDs (continuous data) or SMDs and their 95% CI.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Grading the body of evidence</HEADING>
<P>We judged the quality of the body of evidence using GRADEProGDT (<A HREF="http://ims.cochrane.org/revman/gradepro">http://ims.cochrane.org/revman/gradepro</A>) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011a</LINK>), and presented in a 'Summary of findings' table each major outcome: mortality at one month, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, deep venous thrombosis, and return of patient to their own home. For risk of bias, we judged the quality of evidence as low risk of bias when most information came from studies at low risk of bias, we downgraded by one level when most information came from studies at low or unclear risk of bias and downgraded by two levels when the proportion of information from studies at high risk of bias was sufficient to affect the interpretation of results.</P>
<P>For inconsistency, we downgraded the quality of evidence by one when the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was 50% or higher without satisfactory explanation and by two levels when the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was 75% or higher without an explanation. We did not downgrade the quality of evidence for indirectness as all outcomes were based on direct comparisons, were performed on the population at interest and were not surrogate markers (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011b</LINK>), except for deep venous thrombosis. In the included studies, the latter was evaluated by systematic venographies performed within 10 days after surgery. This was considered as a surrogate marker for clinically relevant events.</P>
<P>For imprecision (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011c</LINK>), we downgraded the quality of evidence by one when: the CI around the effect size was large or overlapped an absence of effect, and failed to exclude an important benefit or harm; and the number of participants was lower than the optimal information size. We downgraded the quality by two levels when the CI was very wide and included both appreciable benefit and harm.</P>
<P>For publication bias, we downgraded the quality of evidence by one when correcting for the possibility of publication as assessed by the Duval and Tweedie&#8217;s fill and trim analysis changed the conclusion. We upgraded the quality of evidence by one when the effect size was large (&lt; 0.5 or &gt; 2.0) and by two when the effect size was very large (RR &lt; 0.2 or &gt; 5) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011d</LINK>). We applied the same rules for OR when the basal risk was lower than 20%. For SMD, we used 0.8 as the cut-off point for a large effect (<LINK REF="REF-Pace-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pace 2011</LINK>). We also upgraded the quality by one when evidence of a dose related response was found.</P>
<P>We upgraded the quality by one when the possible effect of confounding factors would reduce a demonstrated effect or suggest a spurious effect when results showed no effect. When the quality of the body of evidence is high quality, further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. When the quality is moderate, further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. When the quality is low quality, further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. When the quality is very low, any estimate of effect is very uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>In total, we included 31 studies (with 3231 participants) in our review. Of those 31 studies, 28 (2976 participants) provided data for the meta-analyses. The reasons for not including three studies in the meta-analysis were: the time point at which mortality was measured was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Tasker-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Tasker 1983</LINK>); the time point did not correspond to the time points chosen for this review (mortality data provided at two weeks only; <LINK REF="STD-Ungemach-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ungemach 1993</LINK>); and results provided for our study population were mental tests (<LINK REF="STD-Wajima-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wajima 1995</LINK>).

<P>
<I>Mortality at one month</I>
</P>
<P>Based on 11 studies that included 2152 participants, we did not find a difference between the two techniques for mortality at one month: risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.06; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 24% (fixed-effect model) (<LINK REF="STD-Berggren-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Berggren 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biboulet-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Biboulet 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bigler-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bigler 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heidari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Heidari 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Juelsgaard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Juelsgaard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKenzie-1984" TYPE="STUDY">McKenzie 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLaren-1978" TYPE="STUDY">McLaren 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Racle-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Racle 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valentin-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Valentin 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Egger's regression intercept showed no significant evidence of a small-study effect. Duvall and Tweedie's trim and fill analysis showed that two studies might be missing to the left for an adjusted point of estimate: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.97. Accepting that a publication bias occurred, and considering a basal rate of mortality of 8%, the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) would be 42, 95% CI 26 to 339. A meta-regression with the year where the study was published showed that effect size favouring neuraxial blockade compared to general anaesthesia might be higher in older studies (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). The number of participants included here allows to eliminate a difference of 25% in the risk of mortality at one month with a power of 0.57 (&#945; 0.05; &#946; 0.2; one-sided test). A number of 4024 (2012 per group) would be required for a power of 0.8 (&#945; 0.05; &#946; 0.2; one-sided test) if a large study would be done.</P>
<P>For mortality at one month, we downgraded the level of evidence by two for risk of bias based on the fact that we judged 75% or more of the included studies as unclear or inadequate for allocation concealment and/or blinding of outcome assessors. We did not downgrade an absence of effect for inconsistency because the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was lower than 25%. We included direct comparisons only, and this outcome was not a surrogate marker. We downgraded the level by one for imprecision based on the fact that the optimal information size was not achieved. We downgraded the level by one for publication bias because correcting for this possibility would make the effect present instead of absent (RR after correction 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.97 versus RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.06 without correction). We did not change the level for amplitude of effect size (RR 0.78 and therefore &gt; 0.5). We did not identify any confounding factors justifying upgrading. We upgraded the level for a dose response effect because we concluded to an absence of effect, and the meta-regression showed that an effect was present only in older studies. We rated the quality of evidence as very low.</P>

Egger's regression intercept showed no significant evidence of a small-study effect. Duvall and Tweedie's trim and fill analysis showed no evidence of a publication bias. Excluding the <LINK REF="STD-Heidari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Heidari 2011</LINK> study, the RR would be 1.08,95% CI 0.75, 1.55); I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%. We classified <LINK REF="STD-Heidari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Heidari 2011</LINK> at low risk of bias for two items only (randomization and selective reporting). The study enrolled 400 participants and randomized them to either general anaesthesia, maintained with nitrous oxide and halothane, or to a neuraxial block (spinal or epidural (5.7% continuous)). Intravenous morphine was given at participants' request for postoperative analgesia in both groups. Results are provided as a per-protocol basis with 10 participants excluded from the neuraxial group and three excluded from the general anaesthesia group. Cognitive dysfunctions were noted before discharge from recovery room, and at 24 and 48 hours after the end of the surgery based on time, person, and place disorientation (unclear who assessed the participants and whether or not outcome assessors were blinded for this specific item). In the general anaesthesia group the number of participants who were classified as disorientated were 22 at the recovery room, six on first postoperative day, and three on the second postoperative day. For the neuraxial group, the number of participants classified as disorientated were seven, six, and one for the same periods. Halothane, an inhalational agent slowly eliminated from the body, is no longer in use in the vast majority of developed countries, and the choice of inhalational agent may influence mental function after general anaesthesia, particularly in the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Rortgen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rortgen 2010</LINK>). Furthermore, the choice of morphine as the primary mode of analgesia after a major hip surgery may also contribute to postoperative cognitive dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Hebl-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hebl 2005</LINK>). These two factors may have contributed to a higher effect size of regional anaesthesia compared with general anaesthesia in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Heidari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Heidari 2011</LINK>, especially considering that the main difference was found in the postanaesthesia care unit. Considering a basal rate of 17.7%, 1652 participants (826 per group) would be required to eliminate a 25% difference (&#945; 0.05; &#946; 0.2; one-sided test) if a large RCT would be done. Likewise, the power obtained with the number of participants included here is 0.46 (&#945; 0.05; &#946; 0.2; one-sided test).</P>
<P>For acute confusional state, we downgraded the level of evidence by two for risk of bias based on the fact that we judged more than 75% of the included studies as unclear or inadequate for allocation concealment and/or blinding of outcome assessors. We downgraded the level by one for inconsistency because the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was 49%%. We included direct comparisons only, and this outcome was not a surrogate marker. We downgraded the level by one for imprecision based on the fact that the optimal information size was not achieved. We found no evidence of a publication bias. We found no evidence of a large effect size, confounding factors justifying upgrading, or dose response effect. We rated the quality of evidence as very low.</P>
<P>3. <I>Deep vein thrombosis</I>
</P>
<P>The diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis was done by injection of 125-iodine fibrinogen (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1981</LINK>), or venography (<LINK REF="STD-Brichant-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Brichant 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKenzie-1984" TYPE="STUDY">McKenzie 1984</LINK>), or as diagnosed by the consultant specialist (<LINK REF="STD-Heidari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Heidari 2011</LINK>). Two studies including 116 participants did not use any potent thromboprophylaxis (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKenzie-1984" TYPE="STUDY">McKenzie 1984</LINK>). The risk of deep vein thrombosis decreased when no specific precautions except just use of early mobilization was used (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.78; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; NNTB = 3, 95% CI 2 to 7; based on a basal risk of 76%), but not when low molecular weight heparin was administered (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.84; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 58% for heterogeneity between the two subgroups) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). On the same basal risk the optimal information size for a large trial would be 152 participants (76 per group) for a 25% decrease (&#945; 0.05; &#946; 0.2; one-sided test).</P>
<P>For deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent thromboprophylactic agents, we downgraded the level of evidence by two for risk of bias based on the fact that we judged more than 75% of the included studies as unclear or inadequate for allocation concealment and/or blinding of outcome assessors. There was no evidence of inconsistency. We downgraded the level by one based on indirectness due to the fact that systematic venographies and injection of marked fibrinogen are surrogate markers for clinically relevant events. We downgraded the level by one for imprecision based on the fact that the optimal information size was not achieved. We found no evidence of a publication bias. We found no evidence of a large effect size, confounding factors justifying upgrading, or dose response effect. We rated the quality of evidence as very low.</P>

Considering a basal rate of 5.3% (<LINK REF="REF-Brauer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brauer 2009</LINK>), 7898 (3949 per group) would be required to eliminate a 25% difference (&#945; 0.05; &#946; 0.2; one-sided test) if a large RCT would be done. Likewise, the power obtained with the number of participants included here is 0.1 (&#945; 0.05; one-sided test).</P>
<P>For this outcome, we downgraded the level by two for risk of bias based on the fact that we judged the sole study included as unclear or inadequate for allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessors. Inconsistency could not be evaluated. The included study was a direct comparison. We downgraded the level by one for imprecision based on the fact that the optimal information size was not achieved.

Egger's regression intercept showed no significant evidence of a small-study effect. Duvall and Tweedie's trim and fill analysis showed no evidence of a publication bias. Considering a basal congestive heart failure of 6%, 5466 participants (2733 per group) would be required to eliminate a difference of 25% (&#945; 0.05; &#946; 0.2; one-sided test) if a large RCT would be done.

However, if the Peto odds ratio method was used (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>), the difference became statistically significant in favour of general anaesthesia: Peto odds ratio 7.51, 95% CI 1.51 to 37.38; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%. Egger's regression intercept did not show a small-study effect. Duvall and Tweedie's trim and fill analysis did not show any evidence of a publication bias. The classical fail-safe number was three. Because there was no event on the side of general anaesthesia a NNTH could not be calculated.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Neuraxial block versus general anaesthesia</HEADING>
<P>Many of the studies within this review involved small numbers of participants and reported only a few outcome measures. From the actual available RCTs, for adults undergoing hip fracture surgery, regional anaesthesia decreases the risk of deep venous thrombosis only in the absence of potent thromboprophylaxis (very low quality of evidence; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). A unilateral or incremental spinal anaesthesia decreases the incidence of operative hypotension. The optimal information size for an alpha error of 0.05 and a beta error of 0.2 (one-sided test) to eliminate a difference of 25% was not achieved for: mortality at one month, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, and return of patient to their own home. Data were available from only one study for return of patient to their own home. The trial reports of many studies indicated a suboptimal level of methodological rigour, in particular regarding the exact method used for randomization, concealment of allocation, assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Therefore, an absence of difference cannot be stated with certainty for the vast majority of the outcomes included in the present review.</P>
<P>The type of anaesthetic techniques used in many of the studies may not reflect current clinical practice, and this may have prevented us in finding clinically relevant differences between general anaesthesia and regional anaesthesia. For instance, for acute confusional state, one study used diazepam as the induction agent in the general anaesthesia group and as a sedative in the regional anaesthesia group (<LINK REF="STD-Bigler-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bigler 1985</LINK>). Residual blood concentrations of benzodiazepines have not been shown to correlate with postoperative cognitive dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Rasmussen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rasmussen 1999</LINK>). However, some authors reported a clear association between the risk of hip fractures and recently introduced benzodiazepines in the drug regimen of the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2001</LINK>), suggesting that newly introduced benzodiazepines will affect the elderly in someway. Therefore it is difficult to be certain that benzodiazepine administration in both groups did not mask an actual difference between general anaesthesia and regional anaesthesia. Likewise, halothane, an inhalational agent slowly eliminated from the body, that is no longer in use in the vast majority of developed countries, was administered in two of the studies and this may have increased the difference between the two anaesthetic techniques, this time favouring regional anaesthesia (<LINK REF="STD-Berggren-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Berggren 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heidari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Heidari 2011</LINK>). The choice of an inhalational agent may influence mental functions after general anaesthesia, particularly in the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Rortgen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rortgen 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The definitions of outcomes and the exact time points at which the participants were evaluated varied widely or were unclear (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). For example, we took as "acute confusional state" all various authors' definitions without any discrimination. Although statistical heterogeneity disappeared (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%) when <LINK REF="STD-Heidari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Heidari 2011</LINK> was withdrawn from the analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>), one can see from <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>, that the definition of "acute confusional state" varied widely, and included various level of a possible transient decrease in mental function (minus 2 points out of 30 on the Mini Mental Status for <LINK REF="STD-Casati-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Casati 2003</LINK> or a Mini Mental Status score lower than 5/30 for <LINK REF="STD-de-Visme-2000" TYPE="STUDY">de Visme 2000</LINK>), actual confusion (<LINK REF="STD-Berggren-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Berggren 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bigler-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bigler 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heidari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Heidari 2011</LINK>), delirium with or without agitation (<LINK REF="STD-Kamitani-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kamitani 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Racle-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Racle 1986</LINK>), or was unspecified (<LINK REF="STD-White-1980" TYPE="STUDY">White 1980</LINK>). A transient decline in the ability to perform a mathematical test may not be as relevant as mental deterioration preventing the person from participating in their rehabilitation (confusion/delirium/agitation). Finally, the exact time point where the outcome was taken also varies widely (up to four weeks: <LINK REF="STD-White-1980" TYPE="STUDY">White 1980</LINK>). Although, there may not be any clinically relevant difference between general anaesthesia and regional anaesthesia after seven days, when any type of mental evaluation is accepted (<LINK REF="REF-Guay-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guay 2011</LINK>), a transient decline in mental function sufficient to affect adequate communication between the patient and personnel taking care of her/him, may affect rehabilitation, or even put her/him at risk of further injury (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2001</LINK>). Further studies performed with short acting drugs may need to differentiate between the various levels of transient decline in mental function (enough to prevent adequate participation in own care and rehabilitation programme or not) and from delirium, with or without agitation (requiring restraining procedures or potent psychotropic drugs).</P>
<P>Studies included were published between 1977 and 2013 and clinical practice has changed during this period. The vast majority of centres will now preferentially use shorter acting drugs in the hope of decreasing the length of time during which patients may be under the residual influence of the anaesthetic agents. This may influence the person's ability to actively participate in their rehabilitation, and possibly their overall outcome. Therefore, we decided to explore the year when the study was published as a factor of heterogeneity and, indeed, we found a correlation between the effect size for mortality and the year when the study was published (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). This suggests that a lower mortality rate associated with regional anaesthesia compared with general anaesthesia might have been more pronounced in the oldest trials, before the widespread use of short acting anaesthetic drugs. Many of the included trials are relatively old and may not represent contemporary practice, nor account for the advances in safety in the field of anaesthesia. From 1986 to 2005, the one-year mortality rate after a hip fracture decreased by 8.8% for women and 20.0% for men (<LINK REF="REF-Brauer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brauer 2009</LINK>). This overall decrease in mortality associated with hip fractures probably reflects advances in the global care of this population. Among other factors, a reduction of the delay before surgery, improved surgical devices and movement toward replacement arthroplasty, combined with a push for earlier weight bearing exercise are all possible factors that may have contributed to this higher rate of survival. If the overall rate of mortality is lower, then the number of participants that will be needed to be included to eliminate a difference between regional and general anaesthesia will be higher.</P>
<P>Neuraxial block decreases the incidence of deep venous thrombosis compared to general anaesthesia only when potent antithrombotic agents such as low molecular weight heparin are not used (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). It is important to note however that none of the three studies included in the present review used clinical symptoms of deep venous thrombosis as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Brichant-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Brichant 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McKenzie-1984" TYPE="STUDY">McKenzie 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the present review, regional anaesthesia was associated with a higher risk of pulmonary embolism (its statistical significance depended on the technique of analysis used). It is important to note that an absence of event in the general anaesthesia group, such as found here, is quite exceptional. Particluarly considering the fact that the thromboprophylaxis used in these studies was below actual standards for at least four of them: dextran (<LINK REF="STD-Berggren-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Berggren 1987</LINK>), unfractionated heparin (<LINK REF="STD-Heidari-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Heidari 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Racle-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Racle 1986</LINK>), or unspecified (<LINK REF="STD-Bigler-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bigler 1985</LINK>). The rate of pulmonary embolism found here with regional anaesthesia (1.9%) is consistent with the rate found after lower limb arthoplasty with modern potent thromboprophylaxis: incidence 1.1%, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.9% (<LINK REF="REF-Samama-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samama 2007</LINK>). A meta-analysis performed on the efficacy of various regimen of thromboprophylaxis after hip arthroplasty found that compared with the risk obtained after a placebo (1.51%), only warfarin (0.16%), pneumatic compression (0.26%), and low molecular weight heparin (0.36%) were associated with a significantly lower risk of symptomatic pulmonary embolism (<LINK REF="REF-Freedman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freedman 2000</LINK>). Therefore, this finding cannot be considered a clear demonstrated effect of an intervention because the 0% rate of pulmonary embolism found with general anaesthesia and suboptimal prophylaxis is not consistent with the medical literature. We have to attribute this exceptionally low rate to an absence of systematic screening, unclear outcome definitions and/or inadequate period of follow-up.</P>
<P>Length of hospital stay can be considered as an indirect marker for cost. We did not find a difference in the mean length of hospital stay for hip fracture between these two anaesthetic techniques (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>). The length of hospital stay of patients operated for hip fracture has decreased from a median of 12 days (interquartile range (IQR), 8.0 to 16.0) between 1986 and 1988 to five days (IQR, 4.0 to 12.0) between 2003 and 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Brauer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brauer 2009</LINK>). This reduced length of hospital stay may however be falsely reassuring because it is associated with a decreased percentage of patients returning home after a hip fracture. In the <LINK REF="REF-Brauer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brauer 2009</LINK> study, 34.3% (95% CI 34.0% to 34.6%) of patients were going home with self care after a hip fracture between 1986 and 1988, while only 5.3% (95% CI 5.2% to 5.4%) were doing so between 2003 and 2005. Between 2003 and 2005, 52.8% of patients with hip fracture (95% CI 52.5% to 53.2%) were discharged to a skilled nursing facility. From limited data, we did not find a difference between the two techniques in the percentage of patients returning home after a fracture hip repair (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the past, operative hypotension associated with neuraxial blocks has been considered a major draw back to the use of neuraxial blocks in the aged population. One can see however, that this problem can be overcome with the use of a small dose unilateral spinal or incremental dose spinal anaesthesia (<LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>). Epidurals will not affect the incidence of operative hypotension compared to general anaesthesia (<LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Neuraxial block added to general anaesthesia compared to general anaesthesia alone</HEADING>
<P>The sole study to address this question involved only 20 participants in each group (<LINK REF="STD-White-1980" TYPE="STUDY">White 1980</LINK>). There was no statistically significant difference between techniques for any of the outcome measures reported. Because of the small numbers of participants involved, no conclusions about the lack of difference between the two techniques can be made.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Neuraxial block versus peripheral nerve block</HEADING>
<P>The three included trials involved only 139 participants in total (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Visme-2000" TYPE="STUDY">de Visme 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eyrolle-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Eyrolle 1998</LINK>). The limited results available suggest that the neuraxial anaesthesia is associated with a lower risk of incomplete or unsatisfactory analgesia (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.47), and this would be particularly true if a posterior lumbar plexus block is used alone, without the addition of a sacral plexus block plus an iliac crest infiltration. Altogether, the information available would suggest that peripheral nerve blocks could be used as the sole anaesthetic technique, but only when both neuraxial block and general anaesthesia pose special risks.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intravenous ketamine versus general anaesthesia</HEADING>
<P>The sole trial comparing ketamine with general anaesthesia involved only 60 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Spreadbury-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spreadbury 1980</LINK>). The numbers of participants were too small to show if the increase in 'unsatisfactory surgical results' in the ketamine group was a significant factor of ketamine use.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-12 19:40:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For adults undergoing hip fracture surgery, regional anaesthesia is associated with a decreased incidence of deep venous thrombosis only in the absence of potent thromboprophylaxis. Due to the inclusion of old trials that may not reflect actual clinical practice, an absence of clear definitions for many outcomes, and the small number of participants included for the vast majority of outcomes, we cannot make a clear statement on the presence/absence of difference in outcomes between regional and general anaesthesia for hip fracture repair for any other outcome.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-02-12 19:44:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A substantial part of the evidence is derived from old small studies with suboptimal methodology. Rare adverse events related to the anaesthetic techniques cannot be evaluated from these small studies. These studies however, suggest that results obtained with general anaesthesia or neuraxial blocks would be relatively similar.</P>

<P>Details of reasons for upgrading of downgrading the quality of evidence are given in the section effects of interventions (<LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK>).</P>
<P>For neuraxial blocks compared to general anaesthesia, we rated the quality of evidence as very low for mortality at 0 to 30 days, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, decreased rate of deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent thromboprophylaxis, and return of patient to their own home.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-02-16 14:17:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not find a difference between the two anaesthetic techniques, except for deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent thromboprophylaxis and reduced operative hypotension (if a unilateral or incremental spinal anaesthesia is used). The studies included a wide variety of clinical practices. The number of participants included in the review is insufficient to eliminate a difference between the two anaesthetic techniques for the majority of outcomes studied. These outcomes were often insufficiently defined and the exact time point at which they were measured was often unclear. Therefore, large randomized trials reflecting actual clinical practice are required before drawing final conclusions.</P>
<P>Limited evidence suggests that ketamine anaesthesia without neuromuscular blocking agents may increase the incidence of poor surgical results.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-02-12 19:58:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Research in this population is often limited by the fact that many of these patients may have declined mental function, impeding their ability to give informed consent.</P>
<P>New large high quality trials are required to re-evaluate the effect of the anaesthetic technique on the mortality rate of patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture repair.</P>
<P>Because aspirin has now become a choice for thromboprophylaxis for hip fracture surgery in some countries (<LINK REF="REF-Falck_x002d_Ytter-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falck-Ytter 2012</LINK>), and bears no contraindication with neuraxial blocks (<LINK REF="REF-Horlocker-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horlocker 2010</LINK>), trials evaluating the effect of a neuraxial block in patients receiving aspirin as their thromboprophylaxis could be relevant.</P>
<P>Finally, future studies should include a measure of the quality of life.</P>

<P>We made the following changes to the published protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 1997</LINK>)</P>
<P>Change in title: The first review (<LINK REF="REF-Urwin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urwin 2000</LINK>), and update (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2001</LINK>), were published under the title: "General versus spinal/epidural anaesthesia for surgery for hip fractures in adults". The title was changed in the second update to reflect an expansion in the scope of the review to include comparisons of all forms of anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Changes made in 2016 updated version</B>
</P>
<P>Background was updated</P>
<P>Objectives were reformulated from:</P>
<P>The following null hypotheses were tested within the trials included so far in this review:<BR/>(1) There is no difference in outcome between regional anaesthesia (spinal or epidural) and general anaesthesia.<BR/>(2) There is no difference in outcome between regional anaesthesia (spinal or epidural) supplemented with a &#8217;light&#8217; general anaesthetic and general anaesthesia alone.<BR/>(3) There is no difference in outcome between regional anaesthesia (spinal or epidural) and regional nerve blocks alone.<BR/>(4) There is no difference in outcome between anaesthesia using ketamine (with or without a benzodiazepine) and inhalation general anaesthesia.</P>
<P>To:</P>
<P>The main focus of this review is the comparison of regional versus general anaesthesia for hip fracture repair. More precisely we tried to determine whether there are any major advantages in using regional anaesthesia compared to general anaesthesia for hip fracture repairs. The scope of this review, originally published in 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Urwin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urwin 2000</LINK>), was expanded in the second update to also cover other methods of anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2001</LINK>). We did not consider supplementary regional blocks in this review as they have been studied in another review (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Study selection was changed from:</P>

<I>Types of interventions</I>
</HEADING>
<P>(1) Regional anaesthesia (if necessary supplemented by sedatives) achieved by injection of local anaesthetic into the epidural or subarachnoid spaces. This type of anaesthesia is also referred to as 'spinal' or 'epidural'<BR/>(2) General anaesthesia using intravenous or inhalation agents to render the patient unconscious. Unless otherwise stated, general anaesthesia refers to general anaesthesia using inhalation agents in this review.<BR/>(3) Intravenous ketamine.<BR/>(4) Local nerve blocks (if necessary supplemented by sedatives) when used as the primary method of anaesthesia.<BR/>
<BR/>Trials testing other methods of anaesthesia as the primary method of anaesthesia were considered for inclusion. Trials comparing the use of local nerve blocks in conjunction with general anaesthesia and the use of nerve blocks preoperatively, are evaluated in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2001</LINK>). Also not considered in this review were trials comparing different types of drugs or techniques of individual methods of anaesthesia.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of interventions</HEADING>
<P>We included studies that compared any combination of the following interventions:</P>

<LI>Neuraxial blocks: epidural (single shots or continuous), spinals (single shots or continuous), or combined spinal/epidural (single shots or continuous) with or without intravenous sedation;</LI>
<LI>Peripheral nerve blocks: posterior lumbar (psoas) plexus blocks with or without sacral plexus blocks or any other peripheral nerve blocks with or without sedation;</LI>
<LI>General anaesthesia based on inhalational agents (with or without opioids and/or neuromuscular blocking agents), or on total intravenous anaesthesia (ketamine-based technique or other). Any technique where an endotracheal tube or a laryngeal mask airway was used was considered as general anaesthesia.</LI>
