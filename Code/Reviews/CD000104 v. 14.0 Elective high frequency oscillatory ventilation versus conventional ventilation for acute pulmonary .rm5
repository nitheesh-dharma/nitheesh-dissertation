<P>Review question. Does the elective use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation as compared to conventional ventilation reduce lung damage and other complications associated with prematurity and assisted ventilation in preterm infants who are mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)?</P>
<P>Background. Respiratory failure due to lung immaturity is a major cause of deaths in preterm infants. Although the use of intermittent positive pressure ventilation in newborns with respiratory failure saves lives, its use is associated with lung injury and chronic lung disease. A newer form of ventilation called high frequency oscillatory ventilation has been shown in experimental studies to result in less lung injury.</P>
<P>Study characteristics. Nineteen eligible studies involving 4096 infants met our inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Results. Insufficient evidence exists to support the routine use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation instead of conventional ventilation for preterm infants with lung disease who are given positive pressure ventilation. High frequency oscillatory ventilation is a way of providing artificial ventilation of the lungs that theoretically may produce less injury to the lungs and therefore reduce the rate of chronic lung disease. This review of the evidence from 19 randomised controlled trials showed that although a small protective effect towards the lungs can be seen, this moderate benefit is highly variable between studies and should be weighed against possible harm.</P>

<P>The objective of this review was to determine the effect of the elective use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) as compared to conventional ventilation (CV) on the incidence of chronic lung disease (CLD), mortality and other complications associated with prematurity and assisted ventilation in preterm infants who were mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-03-01 20:03:00 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Searches were made of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conference and symposia proceedings; and from expert informants and handsearching of journals by The Cochrane Collaboration, mainly in the English language.

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-05-10 14:45:01 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials comparing HFOV and CV in preterm or low birth weight infants with pulmonary dysfunction, mainly due to RDS, who required assisted ventilation.

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-03-01 20:07:43 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of each trial was independently reviewed by the review authors. The standard effect measures were relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD). From 1/RD the number needed to benefit (NNTB) to produce one outcome was calculated. For all measures of effect, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used. For interpretation of subgroup analyses, a P value for subgroup differences as well as the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic for between-subgroup heterogeneity were calculated. Meta-analysis was performed using both a fixed-effect and a random-effects model. Where heterogeneity was over 50%, the random-effects model RR was also reported.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-01 20:17:20 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nineteen eligible studies involving 4096 infants were included. Meta-analysis comparing HFOV with CV revealed no evidence of effect on mortality at 28 to 30 days of age or at approximately term equivalent age. These results were consistent across studies and in subgroup analyses. The risk of CLD in survivors at term equivalent gestational age was significantly reduced with the use of HFOV but this effect was inconsistent across studies, even after the meta-analysis was restricted to studies that applied a high lung volume strategy with HFOV. Subgroup analysis by HFOV strategy showed a similar effect in trials with a more strict lung volume recruitment strategy, targeting a very low fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<SUB>2</SUB>), and trials with a less strict lung volume recruitment strategy and with a somewhat higher or unspecified target FiO<SUB>2</SUB>. Subgroup analyses by age at randomisation, routine surfactant use or not, type of high frequency ventilator (oscillator versus flow interrupter), inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio of high frequency ventilator (1:1 versus 1:2) and CV strategy (lung protective or not) could not sufficiently explain the heterogeneity. Pulmonary air leaks, defined as gross air leaks or pulmonary interstitial emphysema, occurred more frequently in the HFOV group, whereas the risk of severe retinopathy of prematurity was significantly reduced.</P>
<P>Although in some studies an increased risk of severe grade intracranial haemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia was found, the overall meta-analysis revealed no significant differences in effect between HFOV and CV. The short-term neurological morbidity with HFOV was only found in the subgroup of two trials not using a high volume strategy with HFOV. Most trials did not find a significant difference in long-term neurodevelopmental outcome, although one recent trial showed a significant reduction in the risk of cerebral palsy and poor mental development.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-03-01 20:19:47 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence that the use of elective HFOV compared with CV results in a small reduction in the risk of CLD, but the evidence is weakened by the inconsistency of this effect across trials. Probably many factors, both related to the intervention itself as well as to the individual patient, interact in complex ways. In addition, the benefit could be counteracted by an increased risk of acute air leak. Adverse effects on short-term neurological outcomes have been observed in some studies but these effects are not significant overall. Most trials reporting long-term outcome have not identified any difference.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2015-03-11 08:25:44 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-10 09:51:32 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pulmonary disease continues to be the major cause of morbidity and mortality in very preterm infants. Although assisted ventilation with intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) has decreased mortality, morbidity from lung injury is high. Acute injury such as pulmonary air leak was common prior to the availability of surfactant. Chronic lung disease (CLD) develops in up to one third of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) who receive IPPV (<LINK REF="REF-Ehrenkrantz-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrenkrantz 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Northway-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Northway 1992</LINK>). In addition to immaturity, over distention of the lung and oxygen toxicity are thought to be important factors in the pathogenesis of CLD (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>In order to avoid distortion of the lung caused by the large swings in pulmonary pressures during conventional ventilation (CV) at rates of 30 to 80 breaths per minute, high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) at rates of 600 to 800 breaths per minute was developed. In animal models, the use of HFOV results in more uniform lung inflation, improves oxygenation and reduces the severity of lung pathology produced by IPPV (<LINK REF="REF-Truog-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Truog 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Lemos-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Lemos 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>As discussed by <LINK REF="REF-Clark-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2000</LINK>, there are strategies that reduce lung injury with both HFOV and CV. Animal studies show that lung volume maintenance with HFOV prevents lung injury (<LINK REF="REF-McCulloch-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCulloch 1988</LINK>). The effectiveness of HFOV might also be enhanced by the use of more powerful piston driven ventilators compared with those that generate the oscillations by flow interruption (<LINK REF="REF-Jouvet-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jouvet 1997</LINK>) and even by certain settings with the same type of ventilator (inspiratory to expiratory ratio of 1:1 versus 1:2) (<LINK REF="REF-Pillow-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pillow 1999</LINK>). Various strategies with CV appear to reduce acute lung injury. These include avoiding high tidal volumes, using positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and using short inspiratory times and faster rates. Allowing carbon dioxide blood levels to rise (permissive hypercapnia) rather than increasing ventilation may also reduce lung injury in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Woodgate-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodgate 2006</LINK>). Many of these treatment strategies and their effects on lung injury are based on pathophysiological studies in animal models (increased cytokine release with higher tidal volumes and reduced PEEP) (<LINK REF="REF-Meredith-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meredith 1989</LINK>) or trials in adults with RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Petrucci-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrucci 2007</LINK>). There is evidence in preterm infants that strategies to synchronise ventilation (higher rates and patient triggered ventilation) reduce the rate of pneumothorax and the duration of ventilation, although there is no evidence that these strategies reduce CLD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (<LINK REF="REF-Greenough-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenough 2008</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-03-04 12:23:15 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objective of this review was to determine the effect of the elective use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) when compared to conventional ventilation (CV) on the incidence of chronic lung disease (CLD), mortality and other complications associated with prematurity and assisted ventilation in preterm infants who were mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).</P>
<P>The following subgroup analyses were pre-specified.</P>
<P>(1) Management of HFOV: a strategy to maintain lung volume has the potential for better alveolar recruitment compared to a strategy to maintain low volume and thus might result in better outcomes in terms of CLD. A 'high volume strategy' (HVS) with HFOV was defined as one in which two or more of the following treatment approaches were explicitly stated in the methods: initial use of a higher mean airway pressure than on CV; initial weaning of fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO<SUB>2</SUB>) before weaning mean airway pressure; or use of alveolar recruitment manoeuvres. The FiO<SUB>2</SUB> is considered as being a useful clinical parameter for lung volume recruitment. Optimal alveolar recruitment is reflected by the ability to wean the FiO<SUB>2</SUB> below 0.30 or even 0.25. Therefore, trials were classified either as 'no high lung volume strategy', 'high lung volume strategy with a target FiO<SUB>2</SUB> &gt; 0.3 or not specified', and 'high lung volume strategy with a target FiO<SUB>2</SUB> &#8804; 0.30'.</P>
<P>(2) Surfactant replacement: surfactant replacement therapy would increase alveolar recruitment, attenuate RDS, and lead to less lung injury and CLD. A similar pulmonary benefit could occur in infants whose mothers received antenatal corticosteroids.</P>
<P>(3) Birth weight and gestational age: outcomes might differ in groups of infants born at different weights and gestational ages. Infants born at very low gestation or with very low birth weight, or both, have a higher incidence of CLD and may benefit more from HFOV. On the other hand, these infants are more susceptible to neurological complications such as intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL).</P>
<P>In order to explain persisting heterogeneity in the meta-analyses in previous versions of this review, the following subgroup analyses were added for the 2007 update.</P>
<P>(4) Type of HFOV ventilator: true (piston) HFO ventilators might be more effective in maintaining lung volume and lead to different effects compared with those ventilators that use flow interruption. Also, differences in inspiratory to expiratory times on HFOV may affect the incidence of lung injury.</P>
<P>(5) Management of CV: lung protective strategies on CV (short inspiratory times, rates of &#8805; 60/minute, PEEP of 4 to 6 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>0, limiting tidal volume, patient triggering or permissive hypercapnia) may affect the differences between HFOV and CV.</P>
<P>(6) Duration of ventilation prior to randomisation or age at randomisation: the treatment that infants receive prior to randomisation could alter outcomes and this could be measured by duration of ventilation prior to randomisation or age at randomisation, or both.</P>

<P>Additional information was obtained from <LINK REF="STD-Ogawa-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ogawa 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerstmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gerstmann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rettwitz_x002d_Volk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rettwitz-Volk 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thome-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Thome 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Plavka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Plavka 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moriette-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moriette 2001</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2002</LINK> regarding trial methodology. <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2003</LINK> re-analysed their trial data on the use of nitric oxide to evaluate outcomes related to HFOV and CV to which the infants were also randomised. <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Plavka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Plavka 1999</LINK> provided information on infants excluded post-randomisation, which allowed for an intention-to-treat analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Plavka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Plavka 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moriette-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moriette 2001</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Van-Reempts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Reempts 2003</LINK> provided additional outcome information from their trials (see the table 'Characteristics of included studies' for details).</P>
<P>Results for outcomes requiring survival to a given age were reported with survivors as the denominator (IPPV, CLD). Survival was used as the denominator for ROP, where the number examined was not given (<LINK REF="STD-HIFI-1989" TYPE="STUDY">HIFI 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Reempts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Reempts 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The standard method of the CNRG was used to analyse the data. Treatment effects were expressed using relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD). From 1/RD the number needed to benefit or to harm (NNTB or NNTH, respectively) to produce one outcome was calculated. For each measure the 95% confidence interval (CI) was routinely given. Between-study heterogeneity was considered statistically significant if the P value for heterogeneity was &lt; 0.10. Since some degree of variation between studies can be due to chance alone, the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (%) was used to express the proportion of the observed variation between studies that was due to true between-study differences instead of chance. Subgroup analyses were interpreted in a similar way, using a P value and I<SUP>2</SUP> for between-subgroup heterogeneity. Meta-analysis was performed using both a fixed-effect and a random- effects model. Where considerable true heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 50%) was present, the random-effects model RR was also reported.</P>
<P>Because lung volume recruitment (high volume strategy or HVS) with HFOV is now considered as being the most appropriate strategy for HFOV in preterm infants, meta-analyses were performed both including all trials as well as after exclusion of trials that failed to use an HVS. For the same reason, trials that did not use an HVS were not included in the subgroup analyses, except for the subgroup analysis by HFOV strategy.</P>

Two trials used more than one type of ventilator: Van Reempts used either the Sensormedics 3100 (83%) or Infant Star (17%) (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Reempts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Reempts 2003</LINK>) and in the United Kingdom Oscillation Study (UKOS) (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2002</LINK>) a variety of ventilators (Sensormedics, SLE, Dräger) were used.

<P>The three criteria used to define a high volume strategy (HVS) with HFOV are given in the objectives. All 17 trials with a HVS used a higher mean airway pressure (MAP) on HFOV than on CV.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Not all outcomes were reported in each study. The definitions of CLD at 28 days differed between studies.

In five studies, the definition of CLD at 28 days of age was based on oxygen therapy alone (<LINK REF="STD-Rettwitz_x002d_Volk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rettwitz-Volk 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thome-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Thome 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Plavka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Plavka 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moriette-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Moriette 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2003</LINK>) while in the remainder both oxygen therapy and an abnormal chest x-ray were required.</P>

The criterion for CLD at term equivalent age was based on use of oxygen therapy in nine trials, on clinical score (oxygen plus signs) in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Plavka-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Plavka 1999</LINK>), on oxygen or use of assisted ventilation in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Courtney-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Courtney 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Reempts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Van Reempts 2003</LINK>) and on oxygen use plus an abnormal chest radiograph in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In most trials, cross-over to the other treatment was allowed when predetermined failure criteria were reached. These criteria (hypoxaemia or hypercarbia, or both) were similar in each trial and for each treatment group, but the decision to cross over was left to the clinician. In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rettwitz_x002d_Volk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rettwitz-Volk 1998</LINK>) the additional criterion for cross-over of severe pulmonary interstitial emphysema was applied only to the CV group. Because of the variable definition of 'failure of assigned treatment' between treatment groups, this outcome has not been included in the meta-analysis. When cross-over occurred, the participants were analysed in the groups as randomised. In the <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2014</LINK> trial, cross-over was not allowed.</P>

<P>Randomisation: the majority of the studies had an adequate, documented method of random sequence generation. In only seven studies sufficient information was provided to assess the quality of allocation concealment.</P>
<P>Blinding of treatment: due to the nature of the intervention blinding of the experimental and control interventions was not possible for care-givers. This could possibly introduce bias in all the trials. Blinding of participants was not relevant.</P>
<P>Blinding of outcome assessment was not relevant for most outcomes (death, oxygen dependency). For outcomes that needed interpretation of images, such as head ultrasound or chest x-ray, and for long-term neurodevelopmental assessment, blinding was variable between outcomes and studies.

<P>CLD in survivors at 28 to 30 days of age, based on the use of oxygen or mechanical ventilation and the presence of an abnormal chest x-ray, was reported for 820 infants in four trials (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerstmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gerstmann 1996</LINK>) showed a significantly lower incidence of this outcome in the HFOV group and there was a trend towards a reduced incidence in the overall analysis (summary RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.01). This latter meta-analysis showed significant heterogeneity (P = 0.02; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 71.3%), and when a random-effects model was used the summary RR was 0.66 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.07). When only trials that used HVS were considered for analysis (thereby excluding the High Frequency Ventilation in Premature Infants (HIFI) trial), heterogeneity disappeared (I² = 0%) and a significant reduction in the need for oxygen at 28 to 30 days was shown (summary RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.76).</P>

In the overall analysis using a fixed-effect model, there was a significant reduction of CLD in the HFOV group (summary RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.96; summary RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.08 to -0.02; NNTB 20, 95% CI 12 to 50). There was significant heterogeneity in this meta-analysis (P = 0.002; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 59%), and using a random-effects model the summary RR was 0.80 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.99), which was borderline significant.

<P>The subgroup analysis by high volume strategy (HVS) on HFOV (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>) showed similar results in the subgroups: HVS with target FiO<SUB>2</SUB> &#8804; 0.30 (8 trials, 1483 infants; summary RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.99) and HFV with target FiO<SUB>2</SUB> &gt; 0.30 or unspecified (8 trials, 1216 infants; summary RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.00). Only one trial not using HVS reported CLD at 36 weeks PMA and had no cases of CLD to contribute to the overall analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Rettwitz_x002d_Volk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rettwitz-Volk 1998</LINK>). The test for subgroup difference was not significant (P = 0.50; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%) and heterogeneity persisted within the subgroups.</P>
<P>In the subgroup analysis by use of routine surfactant (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>) only 1 small trial of 51 infants (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1992</LINK>) reporting CLD at 36 weeks did not use surfactant. This trial showed a significant and marked reduction in the HFOV group (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.73). This result was significantly different from the subgroup analysis of the 15 trials involving 2648 infants in which surfactant was used. The latter result is similar to the overall analysis of CLD at 36 weeks PMA (summary RR using fixed-effect model 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.97) with persisting heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 48%).</P>
<P>Subgroups by use of different types of oscillator (flow interrupters, true piston oscillators, or both) only showed a statistically significant difference between the summary RRs of the subgroups when a fixed-effect model was used (test for subgroup difference P = 0.06; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 64.4%), not when a random-effects model was used (test for subgroup difference P = 0.14; I² = 50%) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). For the subgroup of 11 trials involving 1737 infants that used HF piston oscillators (including the Van Reempts trial, where 83% of study patients were ventilated with an HF oscillator and 17% were ventilated with a flow interrupter) there was a significant reduction in CLD in the HFOV group (summary RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.90; summary RD -0.07, 95% CI -0.11 to -0.03; NNTB 14, 95% CI 9 to 33). However, significant heterogeneity persisted within this subgroup (P = 0.003; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 63%), and using a random-effects model the summary RR was 0.77 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.90).</P>
<P>Similarly, for the subgroup analysis based on lung protective strategies (LPS) on CV (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>), the outcome was significantly different between subgroups when using a fixed-effect model (test for subgroup difference P = 0.008; I² = 74.9%) but not when using a random-effects model (test for subgroup difference P = 0.15; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 43.5%). The largest benefit was seen in the subgroup of trials that definitively did not use LPS (fixed-effect model summary RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.75; summary RD -0.24, 95 CI -0.37 to -0.10; NNTB 4, 95% CI 4 to 10; random-effects model summary RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.02). There was persisting heterogeneity within the subgroups, with I² varying from 52% up to 77%.</P>
<P>The subgroup analysis by age at randomisation (less than 2 hrs, 2 to 6 hrs, greater than 6 hrs) showed a significant difference between the summary RRs of the subgroups using the fixed-effect model (P = 0.01; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 78.3%) but not using the random-effects model (P = 0.29; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 18.2%) (<LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Subgroups by inspiratory:expiratory time ratio on HFOV (I:E = 1:1, 1:2 or variable or unknown) showed no statistically significant difference (test for subgroup difference P = 0.49; I² = 0% using fixed-effect model and P = 0.77; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% using random-effects model) between the summary RRs of the subgroups (<LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>).</P>

There was significant heterogeneity for this outcome (P = 0.001; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 58%). The summary RR using a random-effects model was RR 0.85 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.99).</P>

In the subgroup analysis by surfactant use (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>), the one trial that did not use surfactant routinely (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1992</LINK>) showed a significantly larger reduction in the risk for death or CLD at 36 weeks PMA (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.94) as compared to the subgroup of trials that used surfactant (summary RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.01; 15 trials, 3168 infants) (test for subgroup difference using fixed-effect model P = 0.07; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 70%). For the subgroup analysis by type of HFO ventilator (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>) subgroup differences were not statistically significant when a random-effects model was used (test for subgroup difference P = 0.15; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 46.7%).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-03-10 09:39:12 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review, the search revealed 19 trials that met pre-specified eligibility criteria and 10 trials that were excluded. It is possible that there are other trials that have not been published or were published in a language not covered by this systematic review. The review authors would be most interested in hearing of other published, unpublished or ongoing trials.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Limitations of this review</HEADING>
<P>The studies have been carried out over a long time period (25 years), during which changing obstetric and neonatal practices may have influenced the conditions under study such as RDS, IVH and CLD. Participants in early trials could be up to 34 weeks gestational age or 2000 grams birth weight, whereas recent trials have been confined to more immature infants, for example of less than 30 weeks gestational age or less than 1200 grams birth weight, or to a more selected population of preterm infants who are at higher risk of developing CLD, for example preterm infants who did not receive antenatal corticosteroids or with more severe lung disease as expressed by an index of oxygenation.</P>
<P>Interventions varied markedly by type of ventilator and the strategy used for HFOV and CV. Over time it was more likely that HFOV was delivered using a HVS, which would be likely to improve the effect of HFOV, while CV was more likely to be delivered using lung protective strategies (LPS), which could reduce the comparative effectiveness of HFOV. In the light of the more recent discussion about the importance of obtaining an 'optimal alveolar recruitment' during HVS by aiming at a FiO<SUB>2</SUB> below 0.30 or even 0.25 during the phase of lung volume recruitment, the subgroup analysis by HFOV strategy was further refined by looking separately at HVS trials that targeted a FiO<SUB>2</SUB> &#8804; 0.30 and HVS trials that targeted a FiO<SUB>2</SUB> &gt; 0.30. However, this subgroup analysis is based on the intended or prescribed ventilation strategy, which might not always reflect the actually used ventilation strategy in the trial. This might be further explored in the individual patient data meta-analysis using multivariate analysis techniques. The LPS to prevent CLD in CV is difficult to define. There are variable manoeuvres that principally affect acute lung injury rather than CLD. In this review, four categories were used to evaluate trials that used most strategies ('definite LPS') compared with the other extreme of none ('definitively no LPS') and two intermediate groups. These summary data are based on mixed, soft evidence and might also be able to be explored further in the above mentioned individual patient data meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The quality of the studies was generally high, as most attempted to conceal the randomisation process. However, the interventions were not blinded in any study and this could be associated with bias regarding the use of co-interventions and the ascertainment of outcomes, such as duration of mechanical intervention and oxygen therapy. Ascertainment of outcomes was generally complete or made so by author clarification. Since the treatment could not be blinded in any study, outcomes that were care-giver dependent, such as the duration of oxygen therapy or diagnosis of CLD, may be less valid.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Pulmonary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>A ventilation strategy with HFOV aiming at optimal alveolar recruitment is now widely considered as being the most appropriate strategy for the use of HFOV in preterm infants in order to avoid lung injury. In this review, only two trials were identified that failed to use a high lung volume strategy (<LINK REF="STD-HIFI-1989" TYPE="STUDY">HIFI 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rettwitz_x002d_Volk-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rettwitz-Volk 1998</LINK>). Because of the clinical relevance of such a strategy, meta-analyses were not only performed including all trials but also after excluding trials that failed to use a lung volume recruitment strategy with HFOV.</P>
<P>Possibly, the use of HFOV is associated with short-term pulmonary benefits. Several studies report a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, although not always statistically significant. Unfortunately, meta-analysis was not possible for this outcome due to differences in reporting. The finding is supported by results from the individual patient data meta-analysis, showing a significant reduction in postmenstrual age at final extubation for the HFOV group (9 trials, 2480 infants; weighted mean difference -0.35 weeks, 95% CI -0.57 to -0.12) (<LINK REF="REF-Cools-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cools 2010</LINK>) and in the postmenstrual age at which CPAP could be discontinued in the HFOV group (4 trials, 737 infants; weighted mean difference -0.42 weeks, 95% CI -0.85 to 0.00) (<LINK REF="REF-Cools-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cools 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>This potential benefit, however, is counteracted by a possible increased risk of acute lung injury. A significantly increased risk in pulmonary air leaks was found in the HFOV group in the meta-analysis when both pulmonary interstitial emphysema and gross pulmonary air leaks were considered in a combined outcome. When only gross pulmonary air leak is considered, which consists mainly of pneumothorax, a non-significant trend towards an increased risk was found. This finding was consistent across trials.</P>
<P>Combining all trials that used a high volume strategy (HVS), a small but statistically significant reduction in the risk of CLD at term equivalent age (36 to 37 weeks gestation or at discharge) was seen with the use of HFOV. However, substantial heterogeneity existed between trials for this outcome, meaning that this benefit was not consistently reproducible in every trial. This was further explored with subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>Although the feasibility of achieving optimal alveolar recruitment with HFOV, thereby aiming at an FiO<SUB>2</SUB> &lt; 0.30, has been clearly demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-De-Jaegere-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Jaegere 2006</LINK>) and the importance of such a strict HVS has been advocated on many occasions, subgroup analysis by strictness of HFOV strategy ('strict' HVS with target FiO<SUB>2</SUB> &#8804; 0.30 versus 'less strict' HVS with target FiO<SUB>2</SUB> &gt; 0.30 or not specified) did not reduce this heterogeneity. This might be explained by the fact that the intended or prescribed ventilation strategy did not always reflect the strategy that was actually applied in the trial. Data from the individual patient data meta-analysis support this idea by showing that in several trials more than 50% of infants in the HFOV group never reached the FiO<SUB>2</SUB> that was set as a target for lung volume recruitment (unpublished data).</P>
<P>HFOV not only varied from trial to trial in terms of the ventilation strategy but also with regard to the type of ventilator (piston oscillators versus flow interrupters) and ventilator settings (I:E ratio of 1:1 versus 1:2). Experimental studies have shown that ventilators perform differently depending on the technique that is used (<LINK REF="REF-Pillow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pillow 2001</LINK>) and that changes in I:E ratio can affect intrapulmonary pressures (<LINK REF="REF-Pillow-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pillow 1999</LINK>). In this review, however, no consistently significant between-subgroup differences in effect were found in the subgroup analyses by type of ventilator or by I:E setting. In some trials (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2002</LINK>) more than one type of ventilator was used, making classification of such trials problematic. Although the individual patient data meta-analysis was able to overcome this limitation, it failed to show any significant subgroup interaction (<LINK REF="REF-Cools-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cools 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the subgroup analysis by CV strategy, no consistently significant difference in effect could be demonstrated between the subgroups, and considerable heterogeneity persisted between the trials within subgroups. Due to a lack of detailed information regarding the ventilation strategy, trials were difficult to classify. It should be noticed that the two trials that definitely did not use a lung protective ventilation strategy with CV (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerstmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gerstmann 1996</LINK>) both found a significant reduction in the risk for CLD at term equivalent age in the HFOV group.</P>
<P>The subgroup analysis by age at randomisation did not show a significant subgroup difference when the random-effects model was used. The two trials in the subgroup &gt; 6 hours, however, had contradictory results (a significant benefit in <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1992</LINK> versus a trend towards harm in <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 2003</LINK>) suggesting that these trials probably differed in many other aspects than just the age at randomisation. In contrast with the subgroup &lt; 2 hours, in the subgroup 2 to 6 hours a significant reduction in the risk for CLD at term equivalent age was found, and this result was consistent across the four trials in this subgroup. Although hypothetical, the fact that randomisation at 2 to 6 hours of age compared with 0 to 2 hours may have included infants with more definite lung disease, rather than a mixed group including those with hypoventilation at birth, might be a plausible explanation.</P>
<P>Probably many factors have been interacting in those trials, such as the use of antenatal steroids, the use of surfactant and the ventilation strategy. The individual patient data meta-analysis might be able to clarify the complex interaction of all these factors by using more elaborate multivariate analyses.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Neurodevelopmental outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Increased rates of IVH or PVL occurred in some individual trials but not overall. The pathophysiological factors that might have led to an increased rate of IVH or PVL are not certain. The authors of <LINK REF="STD-HIFI-1989" TYPE="STUDY">HIFI 1989</LINK> suggested that the nearly constant high mean airway pressure during HFOV might restrict venous return, increase intracranial venous pressure, and decrease cerebral blood flow. However, animal studies (<LINK REF="REF-Kinsella-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinsella 1991</LINK>) and human studies (<LINK REF="REF-Laubscher-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laubscher 1996</LINK>) failed to show these cardiovascular changes. The latter study reported that cardiac output fell when on HFOV. In a single centre involved in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2002</LINK>, echocardiography was carried out in 45 infants (Osborn 2003). Superior vena cava flow was reduced (&lt; 50 ml/kg/min) in more HFOV infants (48%) than CV infants (20%) but this difference was not significant. <LINK REF="STD-Cambonie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cambonie 2003</LINK> examined the haemodynamic changes during HFOV versus CV and found no difference in cardiac function but did find a lower end diastolic velocity and a higher resistance index in the anterior cerebral artery.</P>
<P>The tendency for higher rates of IVH or PVL found in this review in association with failure to use HVS was also shown in two other reviews of the evidence of effectiveness of HFV (both oscillation and jet ventilation) (<LINK REF="REF-Bollen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bollen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thome-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thome 2005</LINK>) and in a review of elective jet ventilation versus CV (<LINK REF="REF-Bhuta-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhuta 2003</LINK>). Failure to recruit lung volume and the consequent cardiorespiratory instability has been implicated (<LINK REF="REF-Bryan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryan 1991</LINK>). Whether it was one of these mechanisms or just lack of experience with a new technology at the time is difficult to say. The large <LINK REF="STD-HIFI-1989" TYPE="STUDY">HIFI 1989</LINK> trial dominated this analysis.</P>
<P>In five of the seven trials reporting long-term neurodevelopmental outcome no difference was apparent, although in some studies there was considerable loss to follow-up. In only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sun-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2014</LINK>) a significant benefit was seen from HFOV on the risk of cerebral palsy or having a poor mental development at 18 months corrected age.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Research questions raised by this review</HEADING>
<P>These include the following.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Is there a specific population of preterm infants at high risk of CLD that would benefit from early HFOV? The individual patient data meta-analysis failed to identify such a group based on gestational age at birth, antenatal treatment with corticosteroids or not, early oxygenation index, or intrauterine growth but has limitations because of its retrospective design. The most recent trials that were included in this update also aimed at answering this question by including only infants who did not benefit from antenatal corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Salvo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Salvo 2012</LINK>) or who had more severe lung disease (<LINK REF="STD-Sun-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2014</LINK>). Only one of those trials (<LINK REF="STD-Sun-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2014</LINK>) showed a significant benefit from HFOV, the other had a small sample size and the incidence of CLD in the control group was rather low (8%).</LI>
<LI>In the past decade, the early management of RDS in preterm infants has moved away from early invasive mechanical ventilation towards different forms of non-invasive respiratory support (nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), high frequency nasal CPAP, nasal IPPV, synchronised nasal IPPV) combined or not with early surfactant administration (INSURE method, minimally invasive surfactant administration). What are the effects of elective HFOV compared to CV when used as early rescue intervention after failure of these initial non-invasive respiratory interventions?</LI>
<LI>Are there differences in pulmonary outcomes and adverse effects by type of ventilator used to generate HFOV? Although the individual patient data meta-analysis did overcome some limitations of the aggregate data meta-analysis in addressing this question, possible confounding by other trial-related factors cannot be excluded. The question would be answered best by a head to head trial of HFOV using a true oscillator versus a flow interrupter.</LI>
<LI>Long-term neurological and pulmonary follow-up data from the trials are still limited. Therefore, it remains uncertain what the long-term growth and development of infants treated with HFOV versus CV are.</LI>
<LI>Are there differences in the costs compared to benefits of HFOV? Only one small study (<LINK REF="STD-Gerstmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gerstmann 1996</LINK>) suggested that HFOV reduced costs of care.</LI>

<P>There is evidence that the use of elective HFOV results in a small reduction in the risk of CLD when compared with CV, but the evidence is weakened by the inconsistency of this effect across trials. Probably many factors, both related to the intervention itself as well as to the individual patient, interact in a complex way. In addition, the benefit could be counteracted by an increased risk of acute air leak. So, presently the preference for a specific ventilation mode remains a matter of clinical judgement requiring a balance between a relatively small benefit and a possible short-term harm. Adverse effects on short-term neurological outcomes have been observed in some studies, but these effects are not significant overall. Most trials reporting long-term outcome have not identified any difference.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-03-02 19:41:31 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Any future trials on elective HFOV should target those infants who are at most risk of CLD (extremely preterm infants, infants who did not benefit from antenatal corticosteroids), compare different strategies for generating HFOV, examine the effects of elective HFOV as an early rescue intervention after failure of non-invasive respiratory support, and report important long-term pulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Economic analysis should also be incorporated.</P>

<P>In all 53 out of the 215 eligible infants could not be included because of unavailability of the designated ventilator. A total of 150 preterm infants (mean gestational age of 32 weeks) were randomised to receive either HFOV (66 infants) or SIMV (84 infants). After randomisation 40 infants were excluded from the analyses because ventilation was discontinued within 24 hours (17 in the HFOV group and 23 in the SIMV group). The reason for discontinuation was death in 15 cases and "left against medical advice" in 25 cases. HFOV strategy was aimed at recruiting lung volume, and adequate lung inflation was assessed by counting posterior ribs on chest x-ray. SIMV was aimed at keeping tidal volumes low. The study was excluded because of concerns about both selection bias (25% of eligible infants were not included) as well as attrition bias (post-randomisation exclusion of 27% of infants). In addition, clinically relevant outcomes were not measured</P>
