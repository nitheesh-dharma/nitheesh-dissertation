<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>NSAIDs used for pain relief after surgery may have only small, temporary negative effects on kidney function in adults with normal renal function</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used to try and relieve pain after surgery. However, there have been concerns about the possible harmful effects of these drugs on the kidneys. The review of trials found that NSAIDs can cause small, temporary negative effects on the kidneys in adults, but no one in the trials experienced renal failure or serious kidney problems. These results may not apply to children or adults with decreased kidney function</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can play a major role in the management of acute pain in the peri-operative period. However, there are conflicting views on whether NSAIDs are associated with adverse renal effects.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective of this review was to determine the effects of NSAIDs on postoperative renal function in adults with normal preoperative renal function.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-09-29 15:25:27 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Electronic searches for relevant randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and EMBASE were performed. Attempts were also made to identify trials from citation lists of relevant trials, review articles and clinical practice guidelines. Handsearching of conference abstracts published in major anaesthetic journals was also performed.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>The inclusion criteria were randomised or quasi-randomised comparisons of individual NSAIDs with either each other or placebo for treatment of postoperative pain, with relevant postoperative renal outcome measures, in adult surgical patients with normal renal function.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-09-29 15:56:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The data were extracted independently by two authors. The primary outcome measure was creatinine clearance within the first two days after surgery. Secondary outcome measures included serum creatinine, urine volume, urinary sodium level, urinary potassium level, fractional excretion of sodium, fractional excretion of potassium and need for dialysis. Mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for dichotomous outcomes were estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-09-29 15:55:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-three trials (1459 patients) fulfilled the selection criteria for this review. NSAIDs reduced creatinine clearance by 16 mL/min (95% CI 5 to 28) and potassium output by 38 mmol/day (95% CI 19 to 56) on the first day after surgery compared to placebo. There was no significant difference in serum creatinine on the first day (0 &#956;mol/L, 95% CI -3 to 4) compared to placebo. No significant reduction in urine volume during the early postoperative period was found. There was no significant difference in serum creatinine in the early postoperative period between patients receiving diclofenac, ketorolac, indomethacin, ketoprofen or etodolac. No cases of postoperative renal failure requiring dialysis were described. The trials were not heterogeneous for the primary outcome.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>NSAIDs caused a clinically unimportant transient reduction in renal function in the early postoperative period in patients with normal preoperative renal function. NSAIDs should not be withheld from adults with normal preoperative renal function because of concerns about postoperative renal impairment.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-29 15:55:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Optimal postoperative pain management can include the selective use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with or without supplemental opioids. The Royal College of Anaesthetists published Guidelines for the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the peri-operative period, an overview of the benefits and risks of using NSAIDs (<LINK REF="REF-RCA-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCA 1998</LINK>). It concluded that in patients who had undergone major surgery, NSAIDs were not sufficiently effective as the sole agent and that renal function should be monitored regularly in these patients and in at-risk patients (<LINK REF="REF-RCA-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCA 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The peri-operative use of NSAIDs may be limited because of concern with side effects relating to the gastrointestinal, coagulation and renal systems (<LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Romsing-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romsing 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strom-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strom 1996</LINK>). More recently, there has been intense interest in the cardiovascular effects of the selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 2. Recent evidence from a meta-analysis of observational studies of selective and nonselective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 2 (<LINK REF="REF-McGettigan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGettigan 2006</LINK>) suggest that there is an increase cardiovascular risk associated with rofecoxib and diclofenac, but not with celecoxib, naproxen, piroxicam or ibuprofen. For anaesthesiologists, particular attention has been given to the possibility of renal toxicity caused by the use of NSAIDs during the peri-operative period (<LINK REF="REF-Myles-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myles 1998</LINK>). NSAIDs may produce either acute, reversible or permanent renal toxicity and a variety of effects on electrolyte and water homeostasis (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1993</LINK>). The most important renal complication after surgery is acute renal failure. Acute renal failure is characterised by a deterioration of renal function over a period of hours to days, resulting in the failure of the kidney to excrete nitrogenous waste products and to maintain fluid and electrolyte homeostasis (<LINK REF="REF-Thadhani-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thadhani 1996</LINK>). Morbidity and mortality are highly associated with postoperative acute renal failure (<LINK REF="REF-Novis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novis 1994</LINK>). While the definition of acute renal failure and renal insufficiency varies among studies, one study showed that the overall incidence of postoperative renal insufficiency was 18% after major surgery, with a subsequent hospital mortality rate of 13% (<LINK REF="REF-Hou-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hou 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although there have been case reports describing adverse renal effects of NSAIDs (<LINK REF="REF-Sivarajan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sivarajan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1993</LINK>), the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is inconclusive. Several such studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aitken-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Aitken 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Irwin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Irwin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perttunen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Perttunen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Power-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Power 1992</LINK>) showed that NSAIDs caused changes in electrolyte balance and urine output. In contrast, others have failed to show any significant effect of NSAIDS on renal function (<LINK REF="STD-Brinkmann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brinkmann 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Laisalmi-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Laisalmi 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perttunen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perttunen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varrassi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Varrassi 1994</LINK>). Most of these RCTs were limited to the effects of NSAIDs on the renal system within the first 48 hours in adults with normal renal function, and did not address the longer term effects on renal function or the safety of NSAIDs in patients with impaired renal function. In some of these trials, the results may have been imprecise because the sample size was insufficient to detect important differences. More recently, in a meta-analysis of trials examining the use of adjunctive use of NSAIDs with narcotic analgesia in cardiothoracic surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Bainbridge-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bainbridge 2006</LINK>) showed no significant risk of renal dysfunction (odds ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.46). Therefore, it is unclear whether there is a clinically significant effect of NSAIDs on renal function in the early postoperative period.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-09-29 15:56:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The selection of trials for inclusion in the review was performed independently by the authors (AL and MC). Trials were examined for duplicate data. Data was abstracted independently, by AL and MC, using a standardised data collection form. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion, or, if no consensus was reached, advice was sought from a third party (JC). The quality of eligible trials were assessed independently, under open conditions. The quality of allocation concealment was graded as A-adequate, B-unclear, or C-inadequate, as previously described (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Blinding, losses to follow-up, method of randomisation, intention-to-treat analysis and power calculations were recorded.</P>
<P>The duration of treatment, type, and dose of NSAIDs, patient population, type of surgery, and anaesthetic details were collected. The primary outcome was change in creatinine clearance on Day 1 (0 to 24th hours) and Day 2 (24th to 48th hour) after surgery. A creatinine clearance reduction of 50% was chosen a priori as the threshold for a clinically important change. If the article reported measurements taken at multiple time points, the values at or near 24 or 48 hours after surgery were selected for analyses, because the 24 and 48 hour time points were most often reported in these studies. In cases where results were presented in graphs and no actual data were given, the data were extracted from the graphs or the primary author was contacted for clarification.</P>
<P>The DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used to combine data for both continuous and dichotomous outcomes, because we expected that the treatments and conditions in these studies would be heterogeneous. This model incorporates both between-study (different treatment effects) and within-study (sampling error) variability (<LINK REF="REF-Mosteller-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mosteller 1996</LINK>). The pooled risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated for dichotomous data (need for dialysis). Number needed to harm estimates (1/RD) were calculated to compare the harmful effects of NSAIDs.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, the mean and standard deviation for each treatment group, before and after the operation, were collected. The mean change from baseline to follow-up, between treatment groups, was not given in trials. Therefore, as the correlation coefficient between preoperative and postoperative measures was unknown, we assumed a correlation of 0.50 (<LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>). A sensitivity analysis was carried out assuming zero correlation. The standard deviation between preoperative and postoperative measures for each treatment group was estimated using a method outlined in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. When the median and interquartile range were reported, we assumed that the mean was equivalent to the median and estimated the standard deviation to be interquartile range/1.35 (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Rourke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Rourke 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>For each continuous outcome, the mean difference in each study was defined:</P>
<P>mean difference = [NSAIDs (post - pre)] - [Placebo (post - pre)]</P>
<P>where "post" represented a postoperative measure and "pre" represented a preoperative measure. A postoperative measure was either at Day 1 or Day 2 after surgery.</P>
<P>A mean difference (MD) method was used to pool continuous data for each of the following outcomes: creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, urine volume, sodium output, potassium output, fractional excretion of sodium and fractional excretion of potassium. These were analysed separately for Day 1 and Day 2. These results are reported as MD and 95% CI.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity was analysed using the Q-statistic with a threshold for the P value &lt; 0.10 and the I² test (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Subgroup analyses were done to estimate the robustness of results according to the type and dose (single versus multiple dose regimen, or comparison of two or more dosage regimen) of NSAID given. Subgroup analyses on trial quality, type of surgery (cardiac versus noncardiac) and cyclooxygenase inhibitor (selective versus nonselective) were not performed as there were insufficient number of trials for a meaningful interpretation to be made. Publication bias was to be assessed using a funnel plot, however there were insufficient studies to do so.</P>

The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Horneffer-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Horneffer 1990</LINK>) was excluded because NSAIDs (ibuprofen or indomethacin) were administered two days after cardiac surgery to treat post-pericardiotomy syndrome.

<P>Twenty-three RCTs (1459 patients) met the criteria for inclusion in the review. The trials were conducted between 1992 and 2006. The participants were all adults with normal preoperative renal function. Patients underwent various types of surgery, ranging from minor orthopaedic surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Irwin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Irwin 1995</LINK>) to major abdominal surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Castiglione-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Castiglione 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rao-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 2000</LINK>).

<P>All studies pooled for analysis had mild to moderate amounts of heterogeneity, except serum creatinine on Day 2. There were no reported cases of postoperative renal failure requiring dialysis. None of the studies estimated creatinine clearance based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula. When creatinine clearance was pooled from all trials, NSAIDs significantly reduced creatinine clearance by 16 mL/min (95% CI 5 to 28) on Day 1 (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>
<U>.1</U>). This was equivalent to 18% (95% CI 6% to 31%) reduction from the preoperative level. A sensitivity analysis (assuming zero correlation between measurements over time) showed that NSAIDs reduced creatinine clearance by 1 to 36% on Day 1. On Day 2, there was no significant reduction (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>
<U>.2)</U>. A subgroup analysis based on dosing regimen showed that multiple NSAID dosing was associated with a significant reduction in creatinine clearance on Day 1 (-25 mL/min, 95% CI -7 to -42). In comparison, single NSAID dose administration in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brinkmann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brinkmann 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slaven-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Slaven 1998</LINK>) was not significantly associated with a reduction in creatinine clearance (-10 mL/min, 95% CI -26 to +5). However, overall comparisons of the subgroups showed no significant difference (P = 0.23). The overall comparison of the subgroups (multiple versus single dosing) on Day 2 showed no significant difference (P = 0.71).</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in serum creatinine between NSAIDs and placebo on Day 1 or Day 2 (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

There was no significant reduction in urinary sodium levels on Day 1 or Day 2 (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-29 15:55:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review has shown that NSAIDs caused a clinically unimportant reduction in renal function on the first day after surgery in patients with normal preoperative renal function. The reduction in creatinine clearance on the first day by NSAIDs was up to 31% (up to 36% using sensitivity analysis of zero correlation of measurements over time), which is less than the clinically important reduction threshold set <I>a priori.</I> The fact that this reduction did not affect urine volume or that no patients required dialysis confirms that it is clinically unimportant. There was no evidence of a reduction in creatinine clearance by NSAIDs on the second day after surgery.</P>
<P>Overall, transient postoperative creatinine clearance and electrolyte homeostasis disturbances attributed to the use of NSAIDs were found. The mechanism by which NSAIDs affect the renal system is complex. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by NSAIDs can decrease distal tubular flow rate and sodium delivery, by reducing the glomerular filtration rate and increasing tubular reabsorption of sodium (<LINK REF="REF-Bugge-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bugge 1995</LINK>). Inhibition of prostaglandins leads to a moderate decline in aldosterone, which may contribute to potassium retention (<LINK REF="REF-Bugge-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bugge 1995</LINK>). The mode of action at the cellular level of NSAIDs in producing renal impairment is reviewed elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no strong evidence that NSAIDs caused postoperative renal failure in adults with normal preoperative renal function. None of the adults required dialysis for acute renal failure. A retrospective cohort (<LINK REF="REF-Feldman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldman 1997</LINK>) of inpatients receiving parenteral ketorolac and opioids for two days showed that the ketorolac group were at no greater risk of acute renal failure compared to the opioid group (adjusted RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.17). However, it is plausible that NSAIDs may cause postoperative renal failure in patients with pre-existing impaired renal blood flow, such as the elderly, those with heart failure or shock, or patients exposed to other nephrotoxic agents (<LINK REF="REF-Thadhani-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thadhani 1996</LINK>). The information about risk factors for postoperative renal impairment has mainly been derived from a qualitative systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Novis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novis 1994</LINK>) of observational studies and case reports (<LINK REF="STD-Reynolds-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Reynolds 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sivarajan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sivarajan 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>A limitation of this review was the use of several surrogate measures of renal function for postoperative renal failure. These renal function tests have varying sensitivity and specificity for predicting the onset of peri-operative renal dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Kellen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellen 1994</LINK>). Serial determination of creatinine clearance is one of the most sensitive tests for predicting the onset of peri-operative renal dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Kellen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellen 1994</LINK>). Creatinine clearance is a better alternative than serum creatinine in measuring renal function (<LINK REF="REF-Wijeysundera-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijeysundera 2006</LINK>) as the glomerular filtration rate may be reduced by 75% before serum creatinine becomes abnormal (<LINK REF="REF-Kellen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellen 1994</LINK>). This explains why we found a significant transient reduction in creatinine clearance but no significant increase in serum creatinine. Creatinine clearance involving urine collections over 24 hours overestimates the glomerular filtration rate by 13% (<LINK REF="REF-Waller-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waller 1991</LINK>). This confirms our view that the reduction in creatinine clearance was clinically unimportant. As testing creatinine clearance by urine collection is time-consuming and labour intensive (<LINK REF="REF-Kellen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellen 1994</LINK>), few studies included in this systematic review collected creatinine clearance for more than a day. <LINK REF="STD-Aitken-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Aitken 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Khalil-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Khalil 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Power-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Power 1992</LINK> suggest that there was a trend towards normal renal function on the second day after surgery after the use of NSAIDs. Although none of the NSAIDs versus NSAIDs trials examined creatinine clearance within 48 hours after surgery in this systematic review, the reduction in creatinine clearance from baseline was similar in diclofenac (10%) and etodolac (11%) groups on Day 4 (<LINK REF="STD-Immer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Immer 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another consideration is that the different NSAIDs were combined to assess the overall adverse renal effects caused by this class of drugs and there was little evidence of statistical heterogeneity between the studies. All trials used the recommended maximum doses of NSAIDs in adults with normal baseline renal function. While the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition ratios would be different for various NSAIDs (<LINK REF="REF-Cryer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cryer 1998</LINK>), there is no direct and current evidence to suggest that this makes a difference to the risk of renal impairment. Direct comparisons between diclofenac and ketorolac (<LINK REF="STD-Perttunen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Perttunen 1999</LINK>), diclofenac and indomethacin (<LINK REF="STD-Hynninen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hynninen 2000</LINK>) and diclofenac and etodolac (<LINK REF="STD-Immer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Immer 2003</LINK>) showed similar minor effects on serum creatinine. However, there was some evidence that ketoprofen may be associated with a 20% increase in serum creatinine compared with diclofenac (<LINK REF="STD-Hynninen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hynninen 2000</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>While the use of NSAIDs as sole analgesics has not been justified, the efficacy of NSAIDs as components of multimodal analgesia has been confirmed (<LINK REF="REF-ANZCA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ANZCA 2005</LINK>). In considering the adverse renal effects of NSAIDs, this review has shown that there was a clinically unimportant transient reduction in renal function in the early postoperative period in a wide variety of surgical settings in patients with normal preoperative renal function. It should be noted that the findings may not be transferable to paediatric patients (in whom the renal effects of postoperative NSAIDs have not been adequately studied) or to those patients with pre-existing abnormal renal function. NSAIDs should not be withheld in adults with normal preoperative renal function because of concerns about postoperative renal impairment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Recent work suggests that different types of NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) to a varying extent (<LINK REF="REF-Cryer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cryer 1998</LINK>). COX-1 is responsible for the production of prostaglandins in all tissues, while COX-2 is expressed only after trauma or inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Vane-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vane 1997</LINK>). NSAIDs that have a high COX-2:COX-1 ratio may have more potent anti-inflammatory activity with fewer side-effects than drugs with lower COX-2:COX-1 ratio (<LINK REF="REF-Vane-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vane 1997</LINK>). COX-2 selective inhibitors have not been available in many countries or been used widely by anaesthetists for postoperative pain management because of cardiovascular complications (myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, stroke). More trials comparing COX-2 selective inhibitors with older types of NSAIDs are needed in surgical patients to assess the cost-incremental benefit of using COX-2 selective inhibitors and risk reduction of adverse renal effects. </P>
