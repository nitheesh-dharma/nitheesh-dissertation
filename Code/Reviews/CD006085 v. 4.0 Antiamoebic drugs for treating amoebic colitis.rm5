<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-04 12:33:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Amoebic colitis is caused by the parasite <I>Entamoeba histolytica</I>.<I> </I>This protozoan is distributed throughout the world and is commonly acquired by ingestion of contaminated food or water. It is estimated that about 40 to 50 million people infected with <I>E. histolytica</I> develop amoebic colitis or extraintestinal abscesses, which result in up to 100,000 deaths per year.</P>
<P>Metronidazole is currently the drug of choice for treating invasive amoebiasis in adults and children, but it may not be sufficient to eliminate parasite cysts in the intestine. Combinations with other drugs are therefore also used. However, the evidence to support combination therapy has not been reviewed. Also, some unpleasant adverse effects associated with metronidazole in some patients, and the possibility of parasite resistance to metronidazole has to be considered.</P>
<P>This review compares different drugs used against amoebic colitis, alone or in combination, and also assesses single-dose regimens versus longer regimens.</P>
<P>Thirty-seven trials with 4487 participants were included, and only one was of high methodological quality. Tinidazole reduced clinical failure compared with metronidazole and was associated with fewer adverse events. Combination therapy resulted in fewer parasitological failures than metronidazole alone.</P>
<P>The authors conclude that tinidazole appears more effective at reducing clinical failures than metronidazole, and has fewer associated adverse events. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the efficacy of the other antiamoebic drugs. However, the trials' methodological quality was generally inadequate. Also, the choice of antiamoebic drugs would depend largely on the availability and accessibility of drugs.</P>
<P>Better quality randomized trials with standardized outcomes are needed to evaluate the efficacy of drugs for treating amoebic colitis. There is also a need for improved, reliable diagnostic tests that can be used in developing countries.</P>

<P>Two authors independently assessed the eligibility and methodological quality of trials, and extracted and analysed the data. We calculated clinical and parasitological failure rates, relapse, and adverse events as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using a random-effects model.

<P>Thirty-seven trials, enrolling 4487 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Only one trial used adequate methods for randomization and allocation concealment, was blinded, and analysed all randomized participants. Only one trial used a <I>E. histolytica</I> stool antigen test. Tinidazole reduced clinical failure compared with metronidazole (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.51; 477 participants, eight trials) and was associated with fewer adverse events. Compared with metronidazole, combination therapy resulted in fewer parasitological failures (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.86; 720 participants, 3 trials).</P>

<P>Tinidazole is more effective in reducing clinical failure compared with metronidazole and has fewer associated adverse events. Combination drug therapy is more effective in reducing parasitological failure compared with metronidazole alone. However, these results are based on trials with poor methodological quality so there is uncertainty in these conclusions. Further trials of the efficacy of antiamoebic drugs, with better methodological quality, are recommended. More accurate tests to detect <I>E. histolytica </I>are needed, particularly in countries where concomitant infection with other bacteria and parasites is common.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Amoebiasis is a parasitic disease caused by <I>Entamoeba histolytica</I>, a protozoan parasite distributed throughout the world. It is estimated that about 40 to 50 million people infected with <I>E. histolytica</I> develop amoebic colitis or extraintestinal abscesses, which result in up to 100,000 deaths per year (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petri-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petri 2000</LINK>). Amoebiasis is second only to malaria in terms of mortality due to protozoan parasites (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>). Prevalence rates of amoebiasis are highest in developing countries in Asia, particularly the Indian subcontinent and Indonesia, the sub-Saharan and tropical regions of Africa, and areas of Central and South America (<LINK REF="REF-Petri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petri 1999</LINK>). In these areas, the prevalence rates vary with the population studied, differing between countries and areas with different socioeconomic conditions, and with the diagnostic test used.</P>
<P>Antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 14.7% to 32.7% of asymptomatic preschool children in an urban slum in Bangladesh (<LINK REF="REF-Haque-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2001</LINK>), in 19.7% of individuals in a slum community in north-eastern Brazil (<LINK REF="REF-Braga-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braga 1996</LINK>), and in 12.7% of individuals in an urban area in Vietnam (<LINK REF="STD-Blessman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Blessman 2002</LINK>). In a rural area in Ecuador, antibodies were detected using various serologic tests in 64.6% of elementary school students (<LINK REF="REF-Gatti-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gatti 2002</LINK>). In 1998, during an outbreak of amoebiasis in Tblisi, Georgia, 9% to 14% of asymptomatic individuals were positive for antibodies (<LINK REF="REF-Barwick-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barwick 2002</LINK>). More recent studies that used an ELISA test or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reported that the incidence of intestinal amoebiasis in highly endemic areas ranged from 13% to 67% in individuals with diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Haque-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Abd_x002d_Alla-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abd-Alla 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tanyuksel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanyuksel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rivera-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivera 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Samie-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samie 2006</LINK>) and from 1.0% to 13.8% in asymptomatic individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Haque-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Braga-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braga 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rivera-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivera 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramos 2005</LINK>). In a four-year prospective study, 80% of asymptomatic schoolchildren aged two to five years and living in an urban slum in Bangladesh were infected with <I>E. histolytica</I> at least once, as determined by stool antigen detection test (<LINK REF="REF-Haque-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Infection is commonly acquired by ingestion of food or water contaminated with cysts of <I>E. histolytica</I>, but transmission also occurs through oral and anal sex, and contaminated enema apparatuses (<LINK REF="REF-Li-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 2003</LINK>). In developed countries, infection occurs primarily among travellers to endemic regions, recent immigrants from endemic regions, homosexuals, immunosuppressed persons, and institutionalized individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Reed-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reed 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petri 1999</LINK>). One study found that 0.3% of travellers returning from tropical regions had positive amoebic serology (<LINK REF="REF-Weinke-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinke 1990</LINK>), while another study found that 47% had positive stool cultures identified as <I>E. histolytica</I> by PCR and isoenzyme typing (<LINK REF="REF-Walderich-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walderich 1997</LINK>). Despite more frequent infection with nonpathogenic <I>E. dispar </I>in those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), <I>E. histolytica </I>remains an important diagnostic consideration in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presenting with bloody diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Reed-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reed 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ravdin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravdin 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Clinical manifestations</HEADING>
<P>About 90% of people infected with <I>E. histolytica</I> have no symptoms of disease and spontaneously clear their infection, while the remaining 10% develop invasive disease (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gathiram-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gathiram 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 2003</LINK>). About 3% to 10% of untreated individuals with asymptomatic infection coming from areas endemic for amoebiasis develop symptoms of invasive amoebic disease within one year (<LINK REF="REF-Gathiram-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gathiram 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blessman-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blessman 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Intestinal amoebiasis commonly presents as ulcers and inflammation of the colon. This results in a complete spectrum of colonic signs and symptoms ranging from non-bloody diarrhoea to dysentery (acute diarrhoea with bloody stools), and to necrotizing colitis (severe inflammation of the colon) with intestinal perforation and peritonitis (infection of the abdominal cavity membranes) (<LINK REF="REF-Patterson-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patterson 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petri 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ravdin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravdin 2005</LINK>). Clinical symptoms of amoebic colitis include abdominal pain or tenderness, urgency to defecate, fever, weight loss, and diarrhoea or loose stools with mucus, blood, or both (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Amoebic colitis includes two clinical forms defined by the WHO Expert Committee on Amoebiasis as "amoebic dysentery" and "nondysenteric amoebic colitis" (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1969</LINK>). Amoebic dysentery is diarrhoea with visible blood and mucus in stools and the presence of haematophagous trophozoites (trophozoites with ingested red blood cells) in stools or tissues; sigmoidoscopic examination reveals inflamed mucosa with or without discrete ulcers. Nondysenteric amoebic colitis presents as recurrent bouts of diarrhoea with or without mucus but no visible blood and presence of <I>E. histolytica </I>cysts or nonhaematophagous trophozoite (trophozoites with no ingested red blood cells) in stools, and the results of sigmoidoscopic examination are usually normal.</P>
<P>The most severe complication of amoebic colitis is fulminant or necrotizing colitis. It occurs in 0.5% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Petri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petri 1999</LINK>) and as many as 6% to 11% of people with symptomatic infection (<LINK REF="REF-Pelaez-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pelaez 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brooks-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 1985</LINK>). In necrotizing colitis, there is profuse bloody diarrhoea, fever, and widespread abdominal pain, frequently progressing to severe injury of the bowel wall, intestinal haemorrhage, or perforation with peritonitis (<LINK REF="REF-Haque-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 2003</LINK>). Among these people, the case-fatality rate is more than 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Ellyson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellyson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petri 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2004</LINK>). Young children, malnourished individuals, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, and those receiving corticosteroids are at higher risk for invasive disease (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ellyson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellyson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 2003</LINK>). Extraintestinal complications of amoebic infection include abscesses in various organs, empyema (accumulation of pus around the lungs), and pericarditis (inflammation of membranes surrounding the heart) (<LINK REF="REF-Petri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petri 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ravdin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravdin 2005</LINK>). In the treatment of necrotizing colitis and extraintestinal amoebiasis, surgery and additional antibiotics may be required aside from specific antiamoebic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Method of diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>In many countries where amoebiasis is endemic, diagnosis of amoebic colitis is commonly made by identifying cysts or motile trophozoites in a saline wet mount of a stool specimen. Finding trophozoites containing ingested red blood cells in the stool is considered by many to be diagnostic for amoebic colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Gonzalez_x002d_Ruiz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzalez-Ruiz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tanyuksel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanyuksel 2003</LINK>). The limitations of this method include its low specificity because it is incapable of differentiating <I>E. histolytica </I>from nonpathogenic species such as <I>E. dispar </I>or <I>E. moshkovskii </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Petri-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petri 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2003</LINK>). The accuracy of microscopic methods is highly dependent on the competence of the diagnostic laboratory. Specific and sensitive means to detect <I>E. histolytica</I> in stools include stool antigen detection test and PCR techniques based on the amplification of the target parasite RNA and DNA (<LINK REF="REF-Haque-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petri-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petri 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nesbitt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nesbitt 2004</LINK>). Ideally, stool samples positive for<I> E. histolytica</I> on microscopy should be confirmed with stool antigen or PCR before treatment starts. Unfortunately, these tests are not routinely used and are not widely available for the diagnosis of amoebic colitis in many developing countries.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Public health and socioeconomic impact</HEADING>
<P>In addition to being a potentially fatal disease, invasive amoebiasis has important social and economic consequences. The peak incidence of amoebic colitis is among children less than 14 years of age and a second increase is seen in adults more than 40 years old (<LINK REF="REF-Gathiram-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gathiram 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wanke-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wanke 1988</LINK>). Amoebic colitis is a temporarily incapacitating disease that may require hospitalization in some individuals presenting with severe diarrhoea or dysentery. Amoebic colitis affecting adults in the wage-earning group may require several weeks of hospitalization and up to two to three months for full recovery (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1986</LINK>). Pregnant and postpartum women appear to have an increased risk of severe disease and death (<LINK REF="REF-Li-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ravdin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ravdin 2005</LINK>). Persistent infection can impair physical and mental growth, and affect the nutrition and general development of children. Children with <I>E. histolytica</I>-associated diarrhoea during the first two years of life were 2.93 times more likely to be malnourished and 4.69 times more prone to be stunted (<LINK REF="REF-Mondal-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mondal 2006</LINK>). Another study demonstrated that malnutrition and amoebic dysentery were associated with cognitive deficiencies (<LINK REF="REF-Tarleton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarleton 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Antiamoebic drugs for treatment</HEADING>
<P>The goals of treatment for amoebic colitis are to treat the invasive disease and to eradicate intestinal carriage of the organism (<LINK REF="REF-Li-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1996</LINK>). <I>E. histolytica</I> may be found in the bowel lumen, in the bowel wall, and in tissues, including the liver (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1969</LINK>). Antiamoebic drugs vary in efficacy at the three sites where the parasites commonly exist and are generally divided into two classes based on their main site of activity. The luminal amoebicides act principally in the bowel lumen and the tissue amoebicides act principally in the bowel wall and the liver; see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for examples.</P>
<P>Metronidazole is considered as the drug of choice for treating invasive amoebiasis (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Medical-Letter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medical Letter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2006</LINK>). The standard regimen of metronidazole for the treatment of amoebic colitis is 500 to 750 mg given three times daily in adults and 30 to 50 mg/kg/day in children given for five to 10 days (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Medical-Letter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medical Letter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2006</LINK>). Although there are those who believe that this dose may have sufficient activity against both trophozoites and cysts (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1996</LINK>), others believe that metronidazole is not reliably effective in eliminating cysts in the colonic lumen (<LINK REF="REF-Powell-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell-1967a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1967a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell-1967b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1967b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-1969a" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1969a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powell-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powell 1969</LINK>). Thus, the general recommendation is that patients with invasive amoebiasis should receive a luminal amoebicide after treatment with a tissue amoebicide, in order to eliminate any surviving organisms in the colon (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Medical-Letter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medical Letter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2006</LINK>). This recommendation is based on the assumption that drugs acting on different protozoal processes may enhance each other's effect. However, the evidence to support combination therapy has not been reviewed, and it is not known whether drug combinations reduce clinical symptoms or eradicate parasites more effectively compared with giving a tissue amoebicide alone. Furthermore, the increased complexity of combination regimens, additional drug costs, and possible increased adverse events, coupled with the unavailability of luminal agents in the market, act as major deterrents to compliance with this recommendation.</P>
<P>Adverse effects may occur even with conventional doses of metronidazole and include headaches, loss of appetite, nausea, metallic taste, and vomiting (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tracy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tracy 2001</LINK>). Individuals should avoid alcoholic drinks during metronidazole therapy because of vomiting, headache, flushing, and abdominal pain that may occur. Dizziness, convulsions, poor co-ordination, and numbness of the extremities are less common but more serious adverse effects that warrant discontinuation of metronidazole (<LINK REF="REF-Tracy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tracy 2001</LINK>). Other nitroimidazole drugs with longer half lives, such as tinidazole, ornidazole, and secnidazole, allow shorter periods of treatment and appear to be better tolerated compared with metronidazole. These drugs have been used successfully when administered in shorter courses and have been recommended as alternative antiamoebic drugs to metronidazole (<LINK REF="REF-Haque-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Medical-Letter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medical Letter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2006</LINK>). Treatment failures have been reported with metronidazole with most failures attributed to incorrect diagnosis, unsuitable choice of drug, or failure to observe certain principles of treatment rather than drug resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wassman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wassman 1999</LINK>). However, the induction of metronidazole-resistant <I>E. histolytica </I>strains in the laboratory suggests that indiscriminate use of antiamoebic drugs can result in an increased minimum inhibitory concentration against <I>E. histolytica </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Samarawickrema-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samarawickrema 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wassman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wassman 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review summarized the effects of different drug treatments for amoebic dysentery in endemic areas (<LINK REF="REF-Dans-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dans 2006</LINK>). The systematic review included 12 randomized controlled trials and found that while ornidazole, secnidazole, and tinidazole were likely to be beneficial for treating amoebic dysentery, metronidazole was unlikely to be beneficial. The results of the trials were not combined, and no formal statistical methods were performed to determine summary measures of the effectiveness of the drugs.</P>
<P>Adequate therapy for amoebic colitis is necessary to reduce severity of illness, prevent the development of complicated disease and extraintestinal spread, and decrease infectiousness and transmission to others. In developing countries, where amoebiasis is common and most of the patients are treated in private practice or as hospital outpatients, the aim of treatment should be towards an effective, safe, and simple regimen that can be given on an outpatient basis.</P>
<P>A reliable summary of the evidence is needed to determine the best treatment for amoebic colitis. The occurrence of treatment failures and unpleasant adverse effects associated with metronidazole in some patients and the possibility of overt clinical resistance of <I>E. histolytica</I> to metronidazole make it imperative to investigate alternative treatment. The benefits of using combination regimens over monotherapy and single-dose regimens over longer regimens have to be determined. Furthermore, the effectiveness of potential new antiamoebic drugs has to be ascertained.</P>

<P>The main comparisons were between any single antiamoebic drug and metronidazole (current standard therapy), any antiamoebic drug and placebo, combination regimens and monotherapy, and any single-dose regimen and longer regimens. We included but did not pool data from other trials that compared any antiamoebic drug with another antiamoebic drug and did not address any particular pharmacological or clinical question relevant to this review.</P>
<P>For trials reporting results at multiple or varying time points, we performed separate analyses for outcomes measured from the end of treatment to 14 days and from 15 to 60 days after the end of treatment. In trials comparing drugs with different treatment durations, we measured the time point in relation to the last day of the longest treatment period. We did not consider outcomes that were measured during treatment or before completion of treatment. Likewise, we did not include outcomes measured beyond two months because this could be a reinfection rather than true failure or relapse.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We calculated summary RR from meta-analysis using both a fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel method), which assumes trial homogeneity, and a random-effects model (DerSimonian and Laird method), which accounts for trial heterogeneity.</P>
<P>We reported results using the random-effects model when there were differences between trials that may potentially influence the size of the treatment effect or when significant statistical heterogeneity was detected. We determined the presence of statistical heterogeneity among the same interventions by inspecting the forest plots for overlapping confidence intervals and by applying the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for heterogeneity (P value &lt; 0.10 considered statistically significant) and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to quantify inconsistency across trials (I<SUP>2</SUP> value of greater than 50% used to denote substantial heterogeneity). If heterogeneity was detected, but it was still considered clinically meaningful to combine trial data, we explored potential sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analysis. Only subtotals for each subgroup were presented if the pooled results showed significant heterogeneity. We determined clinical categories (amoebic dysentery, nondysenteric amoebic colitis, or unspecified amoebic colitis) and participant age (adults were those aged 15 years or more, and children were those aged less than 15 years) to be important subgroups even before data collection although we failed to specify this in the protocol. Subgroup analysis could not be undertaken as planned based on diagnostic tests because only one trial used a stool <I>E. histolytica</I> ELISA test. The post hoc sources of heterogeneity considered were types of intestinal infection (<I>E. histolytica</I> infection alone or mixed intestinal infection), criteria for determining outcome (based on <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1969</LINK> criteria or another criteria), and regimens used.</P>

Although pharmaceutical-sponsored trials may publish only where demonstrating positive treatment effects, it may also be possible that pharmaceutical-sponsored trials were conducted with better methodological quality because of adequate funds. We determined the effect of date of publication on the overall pooled effect in a sensitivity analysis when there were large differences in the publication dates. It was unclear if two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Misra-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Misra-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 1978</LINK>) reported the same results and attempts to contact the authors for clarification were not successful.

<P>Participant age ranged from seven months to 80 years; see <LINK REF="APP-07" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 7</LINK> for details. Adults only (ie those aged more than 15 years) were recruited in 15 trials, while 10 trials recruited only children. Both adults and children were recruited in the remaining 10 trials.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methods used to diagnose amoebic colitis</HEADING>
<P>Stool microscopy with direct smear was used as the predominant method for determining the presence of <I>E. histolytica</I> cysts or trophozoites in stools (details in <LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK>): concentration methods for better detection of cysts (16 trials); flotation technique (two trials); and polyvinyl alcohol fixative for the detection of trophozoites (one trial). One trial used stool culture for <I>E. histolytica</I> in addition to stool microscopy to evaluate parasitological response, but it was not used as an inclusion criterion in the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Batra-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Batra 1972</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Concomitant infection with other intestinal parasites</HEADING>
<P>Aside from <I>E. histolytica,</I> concomitant infection with other intestinal parasites was identified in 10 trials: giardiasis (<LINK REF="STD-Singh-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prasad-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tripathi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tripathi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 2001</LINK>); intestinal helminth infection (<LINK REF="STD-Pudjiadi-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Pudjiadi 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Panggabean-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Panggabean 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sitepu-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sitepu 1982</LINK>); and other intestinal protozoa and helminth infection (<LINK REF="STD-Pehrson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Pehrson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salles-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Salles 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davila-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Davila 2002</LINK>). Three trials explicitly stated that stool bacterial culture was done before enrolment and excluded those found to be positive for pathogenic bacteria (<LINK REF="STD-Toppare-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Toppare 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karabay-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Karabay 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 2007</LINK>). Concomitant infection with other intestinal pathogens or bacteria was not examined or not mentioned in the remaining trials. Since clinical symptoms may not have been exclusively caused by amoebiasis in those with concomitant intestinal parasites and the effect of concomitant infection on eradication of <I>E. histolytica</I> by antiamoebic drugs is not known, data for <I>E. histolytica </I>infection alone were used in assessment of outcomes except in those trials that did not separate the data for those with single and mixed infections. Separate analysis for clinical outcomes for those with <I>E. histolytica</I> alone and those with concomitant infection with <I>Giardia</I> and <I>E. histolytica</I> was carried out in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Prasad-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davila-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Davila 2002</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Drug comparisons</HEADING>
<P>The included trials contained a variety of comparisons and involved over 30 individual drugs and combinations. As shown in <LINK REF="APP-09" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 9</LINK>, we grouped the trials into the following categories (some trials are included in more than one category):</P>
<UL>
<LI>single agent alternative versus metronidazole (17 trials);</LI>
<LI>any antiamoebic drug versus placebo (four trials);</LI>
<LI>combination regimen versus monotherapy (seven trials);</LI>
<LI>single-dose regimens versus longer regimens (five trials); and</LI>
<LI>other amoebic drug comparisons (nine trials).</LI>
</UL>
<P>More than two interventions were compared in six trials. Three trials compared different doses of the same drugs with standard or control groups: three dosages of quinfamide with placebo in <LINK REF="STD-Huggins-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Huggins 1982</LINK>; two treatment durations of tinidazole with metronidazole in <LINK REF="STD-Awal-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Awal 1979</LINK>; and four dosages of MK-910 in <LINK REF="STD-Batra-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Batra 1972</LINK>. Ten different treatment groups were compared with placebo in <LINK REF="STD-Donckaster-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Donckaster 1964</LINK>, and three drugs used alone or in three different combinations were compared in <LINK REF="STD-Pamba-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pamba 1990</LINK>. Two brands of tinidazole and two brands of metronidazole were compared in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chunge-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Chunge 1989</LINK>). For trials with more than two intervention groups, we combined multiple treatment arms as appropriate in one group and compared them collectively with the standard or control group. This is the recommended approach to avoid a unit of analysis error by not counting the placebo or control participants more than once in the same meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). For the trial comparing two brands of tinidazole and two brands of metronidazole, the two brands of tinidazole were combined as one group and compared with the two brands of metronidazole in the other group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcomes in this review were clinical failure, parasitological failure, and relapse. Thirty-one trials evaluated both clinical and parasitological outcomes, and six trials evaluated parasitological outcomes only (<LINK REF="STD-Donckaster-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Donckaster 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nnochiri-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Nnochiri 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pehrson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Pehrson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pehrson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Pehrson 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Padilla-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Padilla 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davila-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Davila 2002</LINK>). The definition of clinical and parasitological cure or failure in the trials varied. Nine trials (<LINK REF="STD-Misra-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joshi-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Joshi 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathur-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mathur 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Misra-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swami-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Swami 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Misra-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Awal-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Awal 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tripathi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tripathi 1986</LINK>) used the definitions set by the WHO Expert Committee on Amoebiasis (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1969</LINK>) where 'cure' was defined as symptom-free, ulcers healed, stools negative for <I>E. histolytica, </I>'probable failure' was defined as persistent symptoms and rectal ulcerations despite disappearance of <I>E. histolytica</I> in stools or ulcer scrapings, and 'failure' was defined as positive <I>E. histolytica</I> with or without symptoms and rectal ulcers. For this review, 'probable failure' was interpreted as clinical failure and 'failure' was interpreted as parasitological failure based on the definitions given. Data for clinical and parasitological outcomes were presented as dichotomous data in most trials.</P>
<P>The duration of time from the start of treatment to resolution of diarrhoea and other clinical symptoms was also presented in seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Batra-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Batra 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naoemar-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Naoemar 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pudjiadi-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Pudjiadi 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toppare-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Toppare 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mansour_x002d_Ghanaei-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mansour-Ghanaei 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 2007</LINK>), and the duration of time from start of treatment to disappearance of <I>E. histolytica</I> in stools in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Naoemar-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Naoemar 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pudjiadi-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Pudjiadi 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karabay-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Karabay 1999</LINK>). Two trials reported on the number of stools passed during treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Botero-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Botero 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tripathi-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tripathi 1986</LINK>), and also on days seven and 21 after treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Botero-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Botero 1977</LINK>), while another reported average daily frequency of stools on admission and at the end of days five and 10 of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Asrani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Asrani 1995</LINK>). One trial reported on cumulative daily clearance of <I>E. histolytica</I> from stools during treatment and on days 15, 30, and 60 after the start of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Pamba-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pamba 1990</LINK>). One trial assessed clinical and parasitological outcomes jointly as 'cure' (<LINK REF="STD-Prasad-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 1985</LINK>). Only dichotomous outcomes were included in the analysis because of inconsistent data in trials also reporting continuous data. Relapse or recurrence was reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Naoemar-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Naoemar 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Botero-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Botero 1974</LINK>) and described but not reported in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pamba-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Pamba 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Measurements of clinical and parasitological outcomes were made at different time points. Thirteen trials reported outcomes between the end of treatment to 14 days, and 15 trials reported outcomes from 18 to 30 days after the end of treatment. Outcomes were measured repeatedly in nine trials and reported for two time points in six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Donckaster-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Donckaster 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nnochiri-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Nnochiri 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naoemar-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Naoemar 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joshi-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Joshi 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soedin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Soedin 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karabay-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Karabay 1999</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1.  Tinidazole versus metronidazole</HEADING>
<P>For clinical failure 15 to 60 days after the end of treatment, tinidazole reduced clinical failure by 72% compared with metronidazole (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.51; 477 participants, 8 trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). A sensitivity analysis evaluating quality in relation to allocation concealment and blinding was not possible.

<P>Results for parasitological failure did not show that tinidazole was more effective in eradicating <I>E. histolytica</I> compared to metronidazole (507 participants, 9 trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>), although there was significant heterogeneity in the trials. A subgroup analysis to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity showed reduced heterogeneity in those with nondysenteric amoebic colitis and unspecified amoebic colitis (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>) and in those trials that used the WHO criteria (<LINK REF="CMP-006.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.4</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.2. Other drugs versus metronidazole</HEADING>
<P>Other alternative drugs tested were ornidazole (128 participants, 3 trials), panidazole (44 participants, 1 trial), and satranidazole (40 participants, 1 trial). The number of trials was too small to detect any difference in clinical failure or parasitological failure compared with metronidazole (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>, and <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>For relapse, data were reported for two trials, and both compared ornidazole with metronidazole. There were more relapses in those given ornidazole compared with metronidazole (RR 4.74, 95% CI 1.07 to 20.99; 135 participants, 2 trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>), but there were insufficient data to draw definite conclusions.</P>

In another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Naoemar-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Naoemar 1973</LINK>), the daily dosage of ornidazole had to be reduced from 1500 mg to 1000 mg in two participants each in the ornidazole group and metronidazole group because of dizziness or nausea.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Any antiamoebic drug versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Any antiamoebic drug was compared with placebo in four trials: versus two different luminal agents, nitazoxanide (167 participants, 2 trials) and quinfamide (96 participants, 1 trial); and versus 10 different drugs belonging to six drug classes (367 participants, 1 trial &#8211; <LINK REF="STD-Donckaster-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Donckaster 1964</LINK>).</P>
<P>Compared with placebo, the other antiamoebic drugs reduced clinical failure one to 14 days after the end of treatment by 73% (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.57; 193 participants, 3 trials, <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) and reduced parasitological failure by 67% (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.50; 630 participants, 4 trials, <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). There was significant heterogeneity among the trials so only subtotals are presented. Subgroup analysis using clinical categories did not explain heterogeneity (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>), but heterogeneity was reduced in trials that included adults only (<LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-007.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.3</LINK>). Excluding the single trial that used stool antigen-based ELISA test for confirming <I>E. histolytica</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 2007</LINK>) also reduced heterogeneity in the remaining trials (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.56; 93 participants, 3 trials, analysis not shown). Sensitivity analysis was not possible using concealment and blinding because only one trial was concealed (<LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 2007</LINK>) and only two trials were blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Donckaster-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Donckaster 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rossignol-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rossignol 2007</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.1. Combination regimen versus metronidazole alone</HEADING>
<P>Three trials that compared combination therapy with metronidazole alone showed that combination therapy reduced clinical failure one to 14 days after the end of treatment by 67% (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.98; 1025 participants, 3 trials, <LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>). The heterogeneity seen in the trials could be due to the various combination regimens used: a combination of dehydroemetine, tetracycline, and diloxanide furoate (<LINK REF="STD-Rubidge-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Rubidge 1970</LINK>); a fixed-drug combination suspension of metronidazole and furazolidone (<LINK REF="STD-Prasad-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 1985</LINK>); and a fixed-drug combination tablet of metronidazole and diiodohydroxyquinoline (<LINK REF="STD-Asrani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Asrani 1995</LINK>). Excluding one trial that was funded by a pharmaceutical company (<LINK REF="STD-Rubidge-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Rubidge 1970</LINK>) reduced heterogeneity, and the analysis showed that combination therapy significantly reduced clinical failure compared with metronidazole alone (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.25; 986 participants, 2 trials, analysis not shown).</P>
<P>For parasitological failure, results showed a 64% reduction in parasitological failures one to 14 days after the end of treatment in those given the combination compared to metronidazole alone (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.86; 720 participants, 3 trials, <LINK REF="CMP-008.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.2</LINK>). There was no significant heterogeneity among the trials (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). Excluding the trial funded by a pharmaceutical company (<LINK REF="STD-Rubidge-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Rubidge 1970</LINK>) did not significantly change the results (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.46; 681 participants, 2 trials, analysis not shown).</P>
<P>For both clinical and parasitological failure, sensitivity analysis was not possible because none of the trials were adequately concealed and only <LINK REF="STD-Prasad-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 1985</LINK> was double-blind. The overall results for both outcomes were driven by one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Asrani-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Asrani 1995</LINK>) that analysed a large number of participants (896 participants analysed for clinical failure; 591 participants analysed for parasitological failure) compared to the other two trials. This trial was an open label trial with unclear allocation concealment and method of randomization, hence the high possibility of bias. A sensitivity analysis performed by excluding this trial significantly changed the overall results for both outcomes such that no difference between combination therapy and metronidazole alone was seen (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.73; 129 participants, 2 trials, analysis not shown). The change in the overall result weakens the strength of the evidence for the advantage of combination therapy over metronidazole alone.</P>

The third trial compared three different combinations (nimorazole and aminosidine, nimorazole and etophamide, and etophamide and aminosidine) with the same drugs given as monotherapy (400 participants, 1 trial).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effectiveness of antiamoebic drugs</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review examined the effectiveness of various antiamoebic drugs for treating amebic colitis by measuring improvements in both clinical and parasitological outcomes. The rapid relief of diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal symptoms associated with intestinal amoebiasis is an important concern of the individual with disease, while eradication of the parasite is important to prevent further invasion with damage to the intestinal mucosa and possible extraintestinal spread. The purpose of the review was to determine the best drug and treatment regimen required for effective treatment of amoebic colitis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Tinidazole versus metronidazole</HEADING>
<P>Metronidazole, the current recommended first-line drug for treating amoebic colitis, is a tissue amoebicide predominantly but with some activity against cysts in the bowel lumen. Among the other nitroimidazole drugs, only tinidazole had a sufficient number of trials to be able to draw any meaningful conclusions in the pooled results. The pooled results show that tinidazole demonstrated greater resolution of clinical symptoms, but there was inconclusive evidence of its advantage over metronidazole in eradication of <I>E. histolytica</I> in the stools. The comparable parasitological response could be attributed to similar activities of drugs belonging to the nitroimidazole drug class. In one trial, the poor eradication of parasites with tinidazole was attributed to its greater absorption and higher blood and tissue concentrations, possibly resulting in inadequate levels in the bowel lumen (<LINK REF="STD-Pehrson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Pehrson 1984</LINK>). Lower concentrations of tinidazole could also be explained by the suboptimal dosing interval used in some trials (<LINK REF="STD-Misra-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Misra 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joshi-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Joshi 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathur-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Mathur 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pehrson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Pehrson 1984</LINK>). Tinidazole is better given as a single dose than divided doses because of its longer half life of approximately 12 to 14 hours resulting in longer concentrations in the body (<LINK REF="REF-Monro-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monro 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Looke-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Looke 1987</LINK>). In contrast, metronidazole has a shorter half life of about six to eight hours and is better if given in divided doses. Also, longer courses may lead to its re-excretion through the bile resulting in higher concentrations within the bowel lumen (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tracy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tracy 2001</LINK>). This is supported by the summary report of nine trials conducted in India where tinidazole given once daily was more effective compared with divided doses, and was also more effective than metronidazole given once daily (<LINK REF="STD-Bakshi-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Bakshi 1978</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of mild to moderate gastrointestinal complaints was noted to be greater in those given metronidazole compared with tinidazole, particularly when it was given as a single dose. Again, this is similar to the summary report of <LINK REF="STD-Bakshi-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Bakshi 1978</LINK>, where the number of gastrointestinal adverse effects were greater in those given single-dose metronidazole compared with divided doses and compared with single daily administration of tinidazole. In both groups, the most frequently reported adverse effects were mild gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, and metallic or bitter taste.</P>
<P>The calculation of the risk difference for clinical failure in those given tinidazole and those given metronidazole would give an absolute change in risk of 0.16 that is attributable to tinidazole. The inverse of the risk difference for clinical failure gave a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 6.25. Thus, we will need to treat seven people with tinidazole to reduce clinical failure in one more individual. However, this could not be applied to the parasitological failure because there appears to be no significant difference in eradication of <I>E. histolytica</I> in those given tinidazole compared with metronidazole.</P>
<P>Relapse can only be evaluated if stools are examined several times after the end of treatment. Data for relapse were only reported in two trials comparing ornidazole with metronidazole, with an increased risk in the ornidazole group compared with metronidazole; however, the available data were too few to draw any conclusions regarding the result.  </P>
<P>The funnel plot constructed from the trials comparing any antiamoebic drug versus metronidazole and measuring parasitological failure demonstrated asymmetry. Selection bias may arise when small studies reporting greater treatment benefit for the experimental drugs are more likely to be published (publication bias) and found (language and citation). Asymmetry could also result from poor methodological quality of the trials since greater treatment effect of the experimental drugs was seen in the smaller studies. Heterogeneity in treatment regimens used could also explain the asymmetry in the funnel plot. There was a trend favouring the experimental drugs in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Singh-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swami-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Swami 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Awal-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Awal 1979</LINK>) where metronidazole was given at a dose of 2 g once daily for two or three days; a much lower dose compared to the recommended dose of 500 to 750 mg thrice daily in adults or 30 to 50 mg/kg/day in children for at least five days. This could account for the higher parasitological failure in those on metronidazole. When metronidazole was given at a dose of 2.4 g for five days, it was significantly more effective compared to tinidazole (<LINK REF="STD-Pehrson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Pehrson 1984</LINK>). The presence of asymmetry in the funnel plot could lessen confidence in the results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antiamoebic drugs versus placebo</HEADING>
<P>Antiamoebic drugs were shown to be more effective in reducing clinical symptoms of amoebic colitis and in eradicating <I>E. histolytica</I> in the stools compared with placebo. The significant heterogeneity in the pooled results could be attributed to factors such as differences in participant characteristics or the varied antiamoebic drugs used. Twelve different antiamoebic drugs were used and all, except for dehydroemetine, are more active for parasites found in the bowel lumen with no activity against invasive tissue forms. Since none of the participants were diagnosed as having amoebic dysentery, the significant response in those given these luminal drugs may result from the activity of these drugs against cysts in those with nondysenteric amoebic colitis or unspecified intestinal amoebiasis.</P>
<P>The disappearance of parasites in 50 out of 133 (38%) individuals while on placebo may result from spontaneous eradication of <I>E. histolytica</I> or infection with nonpathogenic amoeba. Several studies have shown that up to 90% of individuals with untreated <I>E. histolytica</I> infection spontaneously clear their infection within one year (<LINK REF="REF-Gathiram-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gathiram 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blessman-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blessman 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2002</LINK>). It may have been possible that <I>E. histolytica</I> was misidentified in the trials utilizing stool microscopy as the only means for diagnosis.</P>
<P>Use of placebo as a comparison drug for individuals with symptomatic amoebic colitis may draw objections. Even in those with asymptomatic infection, approximately 3% to 10% of untreated individuals may still develop symptoms of invasive amoebiasis (<LINK REF="REF-Gathiram-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gathiram 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blessman-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blessman 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2002</LINK>). For this reason, it is generally recommended that antiamoebic treatment be given to all individuals with definite <I>E. histolytica</I>, even those who are asymptomatic (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Medical-Letter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medical Letter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2006</LINK>). Therefore, unless the diagnosis of <I>E. histolytica</I> infection is uncertain in an asymptomatic individual, the use of placebo as a comparison drug, particularly in cases with symptoms of invasive disease, may not be justifiable nor ethical.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Combination regimen versus metronidazole alone</HEADING>
<P>For all forms of invasive disease, including amoebic colitis, the standard recommendation is to give a tissue amoebicide followed by a luminal amoebicide to eliminate surviving cysts in the bowel lumen (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Medical-Letter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medical Letter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2006</LINK>). The risk for parasitological failure was reduced by about one-third in those given combination therapy compared with metronidazole alone. The greater risk for failure with metronidazole when administered alone may result from its inconsistent effect in eliminating cysts in the bowel lumen and its failure to reach adequate therapeutic concentrations in the large intestines (<LINK REF="REF-Reed-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reed 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petri 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 2003</LINK>). The advantage of combination therapy is attributed to the distinct activities of the different drugs against the cysts and trophozoites found at the different sites (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tracy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tracy 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Medical-Letter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medical Letter 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adverse events were incompletely reported, and it is not known whether combination therapy would lead to increased adverse events. Uncertainty also remains over which luminal agent is preferred in combination with metronidazole or another nitroimidazole to achieve eradication of cysts in the stools and to prevent relapse, since none of the trials were of sufficient size to determine this.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparison with other reviews</HEADING>
<P>An earlier systematic review on amoebic dysentery concluded that metronidazole was "unlikely to be beneficial" since some ineffectiveness or associated harm was demonstrated in some trials and that ornidazole, secnidazole, and tinidazole were "likely to be beneficial", since effectiveness for these drugs, with no increased harms, was demonstrated in other trials (<LINK REF="REF-Dans-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dans 2006</LINK>). In this current review, we concluded that although tinidazole may be more effective than metronidazole in reducing clinical failure, and was probably associated with fewer adverse effects, it did not show any significant advantage over metronidazole in reducing parasitological failure. For ornidazole and secnidazole, there was insufficient data to be able to draw any definite conclusions. The difference in conclusions could be due to important differences in methodology. The systematic review on amoebic dysentery used the <I>Clinical Evidence</I> search strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Dans-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dans 2006</LINK>) and included 12 randomized controlled trials, defined therapeutic failure as persistence of symptoms or persistence of parasites or both, analysed outcomes reported at different time points together, and did not pool data to generate an overall summary measure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Applicability of results</HEADING>
<P>This review was limited only to symptomatic individuals with uncomplicated amoebic colitis. We did not study the effect of antiamoebic drugs on those with severe amoebic colitis, complicated disease, or extraintestinal amoebiasis. The potential effect of malnutrition, immune suppression, or AIDS on treatment is not known. Although asymptomatic infection with <I>E. histolytica </I>is more common than symptomatic disease, treatment of these individuals remains controversial because most will clear their infection within one year and only about 3% to 10% will manifest invasive disease (<LINK REF="REF-Gathiram-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gathiram 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blessman-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blessman 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haque-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haque 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The limited availability of many antiamoebic drugs must be addressed in the light of reports that newer nitroimidazole drugs may be as effective as, and better tolerated than, metronidazole and that there may be fewer clinical and parasitological failures when luminal agents are given in conjunction with tissue amoebicides. Metronidazole is widely used and may be the only available antiamoebic drug in many countries. Tinidazole and the other nitroimidazole drugs, such as ornidazole and secnidazole, and luminal agents such as diloxanide furoate, iodoquinol, and paromomycin, are not widely available and may only be purchased from certain pharmaceutical companies or requested from government agencies. Although tinidazole was shown to be probably more effective and better tolerated than metronidazole in this review, the limitations of the currently available evidence, and the limited availability of tinidazole in many regions, would make a widespread recommendation for its use impractical. Similarly, the evidence to recommend combination therapy is inadequate, and the limited availability of luminal agents in the market is a major deterrent to compliance with the general recommendation for combination therapy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations of the review</HEADING>
<P>Limitations in study quality, the imprecise or sparse data in some outcomes, important inconsistencies across the trials, and a high probability of reporting or publication bias decrease the quality of evidence. Therefore the conclusions of the review should be interpreted with caution. Inaccurate diagnosis of <I>E. histolytica</I> infection by stool microscopy, absence of standardized classification of the various categories of amoebic colitis (particularly nondysenteric amoebic colitis), and variable timing and definition of outcome measurements would all lead to inaccuracy in assessing treatment effects. In areas highly endemic for amoebiasis, true treatment failures or relapse would be difficult to differentiate from reinfection without the benefit of finger typing or genotyping. Incomplete reporting of adverse events may lead to an inaccurate assessment of adverse events.</P>

<LI>Antiamoebic drugs are indicated for treating individuals with amoebic colitis.</LI>
<LI>Tinidazole is probably more effective in reducing clinical failure and may be comparable to metronidazole in reducing parasitological failure, with fewer adverse events.</LI>
<LI>There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding efficacy of the other antiamoebic drugs.</LI>
<LI>Combination drug therapy may be more effective compared with metronidazole alone, but it is not known if this will lead to more adverse effects. There are insufficient data to recommend specific combinations to eradicate cysts in the stools and prevent relapse.</LI>
<LI>The trials were generally inadequate or unclear in the key components measuring methodological quality, so there is not enough evidence to be certain about the results.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>There is a need for more randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of drugs for treating amoebic colitis, with better methodological quality and using standardized definitions for evaluating outcomes.</LI>
<LI>Diagnosis of amoebic colitis should not rely solely on stool microscopy but should be confirmed by a reliable test that differentiates <I>E. histolytica </I>from nonpathogenic amoeba. There is a need to determine the most cost effective and accurate diagnostic test that can be used in developing countries.</LI>
<LI>Further information on the possible interaction of other intestinal pathogens affecting treatment response of <I>E. histolytica</I> would be important in areas where mixed infection with other intestinal pathogens and helminths are common.</LI>
<LI>Randomized controlled trials are also needed to determine which luminal agent would be the most effective in conjunction with metronidazole, or another nitroimidazole, for eradicating <I>E. histolytica</I> from the intestine and for decreasing relapse.</LI>
<LI>Finally, there is need for additional trials to compare single-dose or shorter regimens with multiple doses or longer durations of therapy.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Objectives</HEADING>
<P>Four specific objectives were added to give a more focused direction to the review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Search strategy</HEADING>
<P>Aside from searching the databases mentioned in the protocol as described in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>, we conducted additional electronic searches of PubMed using the format for highly sensitive search strategies for identifying reports of randomized controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>), with the latest search conducted on 11 February 2008. We also conducted additional searches of the databases of ongoing or unpublished trials by pharmaceutical companies and other conference proceedings not originally mentioned in the protocol.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Data collection and analyses</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>For trials with more than two intervention groups (eg two or more experimental interventions or different doses or preparations of the same drug), multiple treatment arms were combined as appropriate and compared collectively with the standard or control group in the review. This would avoid a unit of analysis error by not counting the placebo or control participants more than once in the same meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Stratification of results</HEADING>
<P>In the protocol, separate analyses were planned for outcomes reported at the end of treatment until seven days after treatment and for outcomes reported eight to 21 days after the end of treatment. However, since many trials reported outcomes 28 days or one month after treatment, we decided to stratify the outcomes from the end of treatment to 14 days and from 15 to 60 days after the end of treatment instead.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>Clinical categories (amoebic dysentery or nondysenteric amoebic colitis) and participant age (adults and children) were determined to be important subgroups even before data collection, although we failed to specify this in the protocol. Severity of disease and response to treatment differ for those with amoebic dysentery compared to those with nondysenteric amoebic colitis. Participant age is also an important confounder that may influence treatment effect and would be valid to explore as a potential source of heterogeneity. In those comparisons with enough trials, age was included as a subgroup, with the participants categorized as adults (age 15 years or older) or children (age less than 15 years). Other sources of heterogeneity that were not mentioned in the protocol but included in the post hoc subgroup analysis were type of intestinal infection (<I>E. histolytica</I> infection alone or mixed intestinal infection), criteria for determining outcome (based on <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1969</LINK> criteria or another criteria), and regimens used.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>We intended to explore validity by using the tests for diagnosing <I>E. histolytica</I> as a surrogate for trial quality. However, we could not carry out sensitivity analysis based on the diagnostic tests because only one trial used stool antigen-based ELISA test for confirming <I>E. histolytica.</I> In the review, additional sensitivity analyses were done to determine the possible effect of pharmaceutical-sponsored trials since this could have an effect on the quality of the trials.</P>
