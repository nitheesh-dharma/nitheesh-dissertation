<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Colonoscopy is a diagnostic fibreoptic investigation that enables growths in the bowel (polyps) to be detected. Some of these polyps can develop into cancer. Although colonoscopy is the most accurate available test for the detection of these growths, some polyps, especially smaller ones, can be missed for a variety of reasons, including how well the polyp can be seen against the background of the normal lining of the large intestine (mucosa). It is important to identify even small polyps, which are often the precursors to cancer. Dye spraying (chromoscopy) is one of the simpler ways to make polyps stand out against the normal bowel mucosa, and hence be more easily seen.</P>
<P>
<B>Objectives</B>
</P>
<P>We aimed to evaluate whether or not chromoscopy improves polyp detection in people undergoing screening for colorectal cancer.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Following a rigorous review of the literature, we included seven studies in our analysis with a total of 2727 participants. We included all studies that compared chromoscopy and conventional colonoscopy of the entire colon in people at risk of having polyps. The participants in the studies varied, however all were considered to be at low or average risk of developing polyps.</P>
<P>All the included studies randomised people to either conventional colonoscopy or chromoscopy. Two trials used a study design that differed from the others, by performing a conventional colonoscopy in all people first and removing any polyps observed, then randomising people to either conventional colonoscopy or chromoscopy. The goal of these studies was to determine the number of extra polyps identified with the two techniques, rather than the total number of polyps.</P>
<P>
<B>Key findings</B>
</P>
<P>The analysis showed that the rate of detection of small polyps was improved by chromoscopy by about 90%. Of even greater clinical importance, the analysis showed that the detection of small polyps that could potentially develop into cancer was increased by about 30% when chromoscopy was used. The detection rate was not different in people with large polyps or cancer, as these are easily enough seen at conventional colonoscopy. No adverse events were reported related to the use of the contrast dye.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>There were drawbacks to the quality of the evidence based on methodology. On a basic level, study designs of this type do not allow blinding of the examiner. More subtle variations in study design also introduced variation in the data that could impact the reliability of the results. For example, in some studies the time spent examining the colon was standardised in both people undergoing chromoscopy and those undergoing conventional colonoscopy, whereas in other studies it was not; as the time spent examining the bowel will influence the number of polyps detected, and this standardisation does not reflect clinical practice, this makes generalising results from these studies to clinical practice more difficult. Other potential causes of variation included the different points of randomisation of participants (that is before the single colonoscopy or before a second procedure, that latter which as highlighted earlier looks only at additional polyps identified) and the reasons for the people undergoing colonoscopy (for example people taking part in a general screening programme may have smaller and less easily detected polyps than those presenting with symptoms).</P>

<P>We included seven trials (2727 participants) in this update. Five trials were of sufficiently similar design to allow for pooled results. Two trials differed substantially in design and were included in a subgroup analysis. All the trials had some methodological drawbacks. However, combining the results showed a significant difference in favour of chromoscopy for all detection outcomes. In particular, chromoscopy was likely to yield significantly more people with at least one neoplastic lesion (odds ratio (OR) 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31 to 1.79; 7 trials; 2727 participants), and at least one diminutive neoplastic lesion (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.92; 4 trials; 1757 participants). Significantly more people with three or more neoplastic lesions were also detected, but only when studies that used high-definition colonoscopy in the control group were excluded (OR 4.63, 95% CI 1.99 to 10.80; 2 trials; 519 participants). None of the included studies reported any adverse events related to the use of the contrast dye.<BR/>

<P>There is strong evidence that chromoscopy enhances the detection of neoplasia in the colon and rectum.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-04-01 11:47:07 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A polyp is defined as a protuberant lesion in the mucosa of the bowel. It may be precancerous (neoplastic adenoma) or non-precancerous (non-neoplastic, including hyperplastic polyps). The malignant potential for adenomas has been recognised for over a century (<LINK REF="REF-Horfstad-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horfstad 2003</LINK>), and strong evidence exists that suggests detection and removal of these adenomas will reduce colorectal cancer risk and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Winawer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winawer 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zauber-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zauber 2012</LINK>). Although conventional colonoscopy is the most accurate test available for the detection of all types of polyp, data exist that raise concerns about its sensitivity (ability to detect lesions when present). The National Polyp Study investigated a large cohort of 1418 people who had undergone colonoscopy and polypectomy for an adenoma (<LINK REF="REF-Winawer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winawer 1993</LINK>). Long-term follow-up (8401 person-years) showed a clear reduction in colorectal cancer when compared to three reference populations, emphasising the point that polyp detection and removal reduces bowel cancer risk. However, five people developed cancers in the period between the initial and a follow-up colonoscopy. Although it is possible that these cancers arose in the short period between the colonoscopies, it is perhaps more likely that precursor lesions were missed. Further concerns about colonoscopic sensitivity come from studies of cohorts undergoing 'back-to-back' colonoscopy (one colonoscopy followed immediately by another) (<LINK REF="REF-Hixson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hixson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rex-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rex 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heresbach-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heresbach 2008</LINK>). These studies suggest that as many as a quarter of polyps may be missed. Although most of these missed polyps were small (less than 5 mm), some were greater than 1 cm and therefore of significant malignant potential (<LINK REF="REF-Muto-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muto 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shinya-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinya 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eide-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eide 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hermanek-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermanek 1987</LINK>). Screening studies have also highlighted the importance of adenoma detection, reporting that people undergoing colonoscopy by endoscopists with a low adenoma detection rate (ADR) had a significantly higher risk of interval colorectal cancer (CRC) (<LINK REF="REF-Kaminski-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaminski 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of factors may contribute to missed lesions and variability in ADR. Perhaps the most important relate to endoscopic technique. Good colonoscopy withdrawal technique necessitates looking behind folds, with particular attention to flexures and other relative blind spots, aspirating or flushing away residue, and optimising distension (sometimes helped by position change and the use of antispasmodics). This clearly takes time, and many studies have shown that withdrawal time is an important determinant of ADR. <LINK REF="REF-Barclay-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barclay 2008</LINK> found that endoscopists who spent more than eight minutes examining the bowel during colonoscopy withdrawal had a higher ADR compared to those who spent less than eight minutes.</P>
<P>Patient-related factors may also influence mucosal visualisation. Poor bowel preparation may obscure polyps and diverticular disease and adhesions may limit the endoscopist's view. A technically difficult intubation may result in incomplete examinations and less adequate views on withdrawal due to time constraints and reduced concentration by the endoscopist.</P>
<P>Finally, the polyp features themselves may influence the miss rate. So-called flat adenomas are small minimally raised (or even centrally depressed) lesions that are difficult to see using conventional endoscopy, often appearing as slight distortions of the mucosal colour or contour or disruptions of the vascular architecture.</P>
<P>There is controversy as to whether diminutive polyps are of clinical significance. Polyp size and the presence of high-grade dysplasia or villous histology are associated with focal cancer within an individual adenoma (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1990</LINK>), whereas polyp number and size are the most consistent risk factors for metachronous adenomas and cancer. Diminutive polyps are rarely malignant, and the rapid development of invasive cancer from a small (less than 10 mm) neoplastic lesion is unlikely (<LINK REF="REF-Eide-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eide 1986</LINK>). However, it seems that morphologically flat lesions may be an exception to this rule, with high-grade dysplasia being related more to whether there is a depressed component to the polyp (<LINK REF="REF-Rembacken-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rembacken 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsuda-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsuda 2002</LINK>). In addition, there are a small number of descriptions of advanced cancer in lesions less than 10 mm in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Ueta-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ueta 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hurlstone-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurlstone 2003</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-04-01 11:47:13 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Contrast dyes are the main dyes used in colonic chromoscopy (also known as chromocolonoscopy or chromo-endoscopy). They are neither absorbed nor do they react with the mucosal cells; they merely outline the mucosal morphology. The main contrast dye used is indigo-carmine. Concentrations vary widely, ranging from 0.2% to 2%. The reason for the variation is unclear and probably relates to endoscopist preference. Delivery is either 'targeted' at areas of mucosal irregularity that have been detected by white-light endoscopy or 'pan-colonic', aiming to dye-spray the whole of the colonic mucosa. Targeted dye spraying involves drawing up a small volume of dye (3 to 5 ml) in a large syringe along with air. The syringe is then emptied through the biopsy channel of the colonoscope along with the air to create a spray effect on the colonic wall. Pan-colonic dye spraying usually employs a catheter, often a diffusion catheter (a simple tube with a sprinkler device at the proximal end), which allows diffuse mucosal coverage of the whole colon, irrespective of its endoscopic appearance, using a larger volume of dilute dye. Contrast dyes are simple to use, safe, and cheap, but also can be labour-intensive, time-consuming, and messy.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-04-01 11:48:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dye spraying, or chromoscopy techniques, were first described in the 1970s as a way of making fine mucosal surface detail more visible at endoscopy (<LINK REF="REF-Tada-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tada 1977</LINK>). While frequently used in the upper gastrointestinal tract to detect early gastric neoplasia, in <LINK REF="REF-Lambert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lambert 2002</LINK>, and premalignant tissue (dysplasia) in the oesophagus, in <LINK REF="REF-Fennerty-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fennerty 1999</LINK>, chromoscopy in the colon is now advocated as a way of increasing the detection of colonic polyps (particularly flat lesions) by better definition of mucosal topography and highlighting of subtle mucosal abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-ASGE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASGE 2007</LINK>). High-definition colonoscopy (essentially enhanced image resolution using advanced digital imaging systems) could be expected to improve polyp detection even further, especially if coupled with chromoscopy (<LINK REF="REF-Bruno-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruno 2003</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-04-01 11:51:04 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With the advent of screening programmes for polyps that involve colonoscopy in many countries, it is imperative to ensure optimal sensitivity. Several studies have examined the effect of pan-colonic chromoscopy on enhancing polyp detection, but the data are inconsistent. The aim of this review was to examine the hypothesis that pan-colonic chromoscopy can enhance polyp detection compared with conventional colonoscopy. As chromoscopy has implications in terms of extra time taken to perform the procedure properly, and potential increased morbidity, we have examined these aspects as secondary endpoints.</P>
<P>Before listing the objectives, it is important to define the outcome measures of each colonoscopy. The procedure can be classified as normal or abnormal, with various abnormalities described. Such abnormalities could be polyps, adenomas, lesions, or neoplasia in the literature. In order to standardise definitions and to allow for comparison, a polyp is defined as a protuberant lesion that could be neoplastic (adenoma or carcinoma) or non-neoplastic (hyperplastic or inflammatory). A neoplastic polyp includes adenoma or carcinoma only.</P>

<P>The participants varied between different studies. Some studies included both average-risk and high-risk patients (prior history of polyps and/or colorectal cancer and/or high-risk symptoms) (<LINK REF="STD-Brooker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurlstone-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hurlstone 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pohl-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pohl 2011</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study design</HEADING>
<P>Three studies had a study design that differed from the other four: each participant underwent the equivalent of two consecutive colonoscopies at the same session. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lapalus-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lapalus 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoffel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffel 2008</LINK>), conventional colonoscopy was carried out initially in both study groups, with the second pass being either repeat conventional colonoscopy or chromoscopy. The outcomes of these studies were likely to be different than those in the other trials; these trials were essentially measuring the number of extra polyps detected with each intervention rather than the total number of polyps. As such, where data were available, these trials formed part of a subgroup analysis (studies with double intubation). In <LINK REF="STD-Le-Rhun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Le Rhun 2006</LINK>, the control group underwent conventional colonoscopy with the first pass of each colon segment with maximal insufflation and the second with minimal insufflation. The intervention group underwent high-resolution examination followed by chromoscopic examination of each colon segment. This could reflect standard practice where the trial was performed. We felt that this trial was more comparable to the other trials and was therefore included in the main group analyses (studies with single intubation).</P>

<P>Blinding of the examiner to the technique was impossible, and blinding of the participant was irrelevant with regard to the outcome data. The lack of examiner blinding is an inherent drawback to trials with these study designs. On a basic level, the increased time taken to dye spray could result in higher polyp detection. There were some efforts to make the two procedures more comparable in three studies; one study, <LINK REF="STD-Hurlstone-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hurlstone 2004</LINK>, sprayed the colon of the control group with saline, so increasing the withdrawal time; two others tried to control for the increased time needed for dye spraying by allowing for a slower, more detailed examination in the control group by specifying a minimum withdrawal time for all examinations (<LINK REF="STD-Kahi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kahi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pohl-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pohl 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Le-Rhun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Le Rhun 2006</LINK> increased examination time in both groups by examining sections of the colorectum twice with maximal and minimal inflation in the control group and high-definition colonoscopy and chromoscopy in the intervention arm. Despite these efforts to reduce performance bias, this inability to blind the investigator is a significant factor in interpreting the results of all the trials, and overall risk of bias should be considered as unclear (see <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK> for justification).</P>
<P>A potential increase in detection bias may be seen with the trials that did a preliminary procedure to remove polyps before randomisation (see <LINK TAG="INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Included studies</LINK> above).</P>

Two trials did their own calculation based upon assumptions from historical data (<LINK REF="STD-Kahi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kahi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pohl-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pohl 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Le-Rhun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Le Rhun 2006</LINK> obtained their own data based on a preliminary analysis. The number of participants needed in each group to achieve the necessary power varied from 117 to 396. The variation in numbers deserves comment. <LINK REF="STD-Brooker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 2002</LINK> calculated the smallest number based on an estimate of mean incidence of adenomas in the control group of 0.36 (standard deviation 0.3) and assumed a 30% increase in adenoma detection rate (&#945; level 0.05, power 80%). At the other end of the estimate, <LINK REF="STD-Kahi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kahi 2010</LINK> assumed a prevalence of adenomas in the control group of 35% and a minimum clinically significant increase in adenoma detection of 10% (two-sided &#945; 0.05, 80% power). Only one trial failed to recruit the target numbers (<LINK REF="STD-Kahi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kahi 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>When considering the entire colon, there was a significant difference in favour of chromoscopy for almost all detection outcomes.</P>
<P>The mean number of polyps (neoplastic and non-neoplastic) detected was greater for all studies. It was also greater, to a high level of statistical significance, when the studies were combined (mean difference (MD) 0.89 lesions, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.04; 7 studies; 2727 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). We considered the evidence to be of low quality. The increased yield of polyps was seen in both the proximal and distal segments of the large bowel. When a subgroup analysis of different study designs is carried out, the increased yield is still significant for both study designs.</P>
<P>From a clinical viewpoint, the most important lesions are the neoplastic lesions, as these could be precancerous. This enhanced yield was maintained even if only neoplastic lesions were considered (MD 0.33 lesions, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.41; 7 studies; 2727 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). We considered the evidence to be of low quality. However, tests for heterogeneity were significant in this analysis (I = 72%). There are several potential sources of this heterogeneity:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Firstly, the study design. Two studies randomised at the point of a second investigation (<LINK REF="STD-Lapalus-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lapalus 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stoffel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffel 2008</LINK>). Essentially these trials were looking at a different outcome, as described earlier. A subgroup analysis considering these trials alone reduces the heterogeneity whilst still showing a similar increased polyp detection with chromoscopy. However, the heterogeneity remains in the 'single intubation' trials</LI>
<LI>Secondly, the experience of the endoscopist. The <LINK REF="STD-Le-Rhun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Le Rhun 2006</LINK> group found substantially fewer polyps than the other studies in their chromoscopy group than the other studies. The authors of this study admit that some of the endoscopists had "limited experience".</LI>
<LI>Thirdly, the type of colonoscope varied. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kahi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kahi 2010</LINK>), high-definition colonoscopes were used, and the adenoma detection rate in the control group was higher than in any other study and higher than the chromoscopy cohort in all of the included trials. Others have shown that high-definition imaging improves adenoma detection rate (<LINK REF="REF-Rex-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rex 2007</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>However, removing these trials from the analysis reduces the power of I such that it cannot be relied upon.</P>
<P>If the <LINK REF="STD-Brooker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 2002</LINK> trial is removed, the heterogeneity in the 'single intubation' group reduces dramatically. The <LINK REF="STD-Brooker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 2002</LINK> trial was the only trial not to control for extubation time in the control arm. Some of their withdrawal times in this arm were very fast indeed, which may explain why the polyp yield in this arm was so different than that seen in their intervention arm.</P>
<P>Data on standard deviation were only available for two of the studies (despite all authors being contacted). For the remainder, the we estimated the standard deviation according to the assumption detailed in the <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK> section. This conservative method may have contributed to heterogeneity.</P>
<P>As it is possible for some people to have multiple polyps (neoplastic and non-neoplastic) and to thereby influence the polyp yield with each intervention, it is perhaps relevant to consider the number of participants with at least one polyp. Again, the analysis revealed a significant difference in favour of the chromoscopy group (odds ratio (OR) 1.87, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.30; 4 studies; 1515 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>), which was maintained when restricted to different study designs. We considered the evidence to be of low quality. If neoplastic lesions only are considered, the significant difference in favour of chromoscopy is again maintained (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.79; 7 studies; 2727 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>), although not if the studies using a tandem intubation design are considered separately. Only two studies gave data on the position of the polyps (<LINK REF="STD-Brooker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lapalus-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lapalus 2006</LINK>), but with different study design the data may not be reliable (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>With regard to secondary outcomes, the total number of diminutive neoplastic lesions and the number of participants with at least one diminutive neoplastic lesion were all increased in favour of chromoscopy (mean difference 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.32; 4 studies; 1409 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>) and (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.92; 4 studies; 1757 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>), respectively. We considered the evidence to be of low quality. Again, only <LINK REF="STD-Brooker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Brooker 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lapalus-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lapalus 2006</LINK> gave data on the position of the polyps (of different study designs), and therefore the data may not be reliable (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-005.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.3</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-006.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the group as a whole, the number of participants with three or more neoplastic lesions was not statistically significantly different (OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.87; 5 studies; 1669 participants) (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>). However, we again considered the evidence to be of low quality, and there was heterogeneity that is not explained by different study design. An alternative explanation for the heterogeneity may relate to the <LINK REF="STD-Kahi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kahi 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Le-Rhun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Le Rhun 2006</LINK> studies, which both used high-definition colonoscopy in the control arm. A very high detection rate in the control group was seen, particularly in the <LINK REF="STD-Kahi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kahi 2010</LINK> study. Indeed, more participants with more than three polyps were seen in the control group in this trial, suggesting that high-definition colonoscopes may be as good as chromoscopy. If only those studies using conventional chromoscopy and having a similar single-intubation study design are considered, participants with multiple polyps are more than four times as likely to be detected.</P>
<P>Only one study gave details of the number of biopsies of normal tissue taken with each intervention. Unfortunately these data were not in an analysable form. However, the authors state that the proportion of biopsies that were normal tissue were similar in all comparison groups (<LINK REF="STD-Stoffel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffel 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>With regard to withdrawal time, there was marked heterogeneity of study design and incomplete data, meaning that it was difficult to combine results. For instance, the study by <LINK REF="STD-Lapalus-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lapalus 2006</LINK> only gave data for the whole test (insertion and completion), whereas the other studies included only the extubation time. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Le-Rhun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Le Rhun 2006</LINK> examined each colonic segment with maximal and then minimal insufflation. Another study tried to standardise the extubation time by spraying saline in the control arm, making extubation time in the controls comparable to those of the chromoscopy group (<LINK REF="STD-Hurlstone-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hurlstone 2004</LINK>). Two studies stipulated minimum times for extubation (<LINK REF="STD-Kahi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kahi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pohl-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pohl 2011</LINK>). Another study stipulated that the endoscopist spent at least 20 minutes visualising the colonic mucosa (<LINK REF="STD-Stoffel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffel 2008</LINK>). Nevertheless, in all the studies (including the trials that tried to control for extubation time) the chromoscopy procedure took longer. The difference in the mean time for extubation varied from 0.3 minutes to 9.6 minutes.</P>
<P>None of the included studies reported any adverse events related to the use of the contrast dye.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-04-01 14:51:03 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-01 14:51:03 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There appears to be consistent evidence that chromoscopy enhances the detection of premalignant polyps in the colon and rectum. The number of participants with at least one neoplastic lesion increased by approximately 50%. In addition, the number of participants with three or more lesions increased more than four fold in the studies that used a single conventional colonoscopy or chromoscopy. However, there was no apparent increase in the detection of larger lesions or advanced pathology. Given the methodological limitations of the studies, we classified all evidence as low quality.</P>
<P>It could be argued that chromoscopy results in more biopsies that subsequently turn out to be normal tissue. Data for the number of normal biopsies that were taken with each comparison are minimal. Nevertheless, as still more neoplastic lesions were detected, the overall accuracy of colonoscopy is improved with chromoscopy. This would agree with the study where some data exist for the number of normal biopsies (<LINK REF="STD-Stoffel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffel 2008</LINK>); these authors suggest that although more normal biopsies were taken in the chromoscopy group, more adenomas were also found, and the proportion of normal biopsies to adenomas remained the same.</P>
<P>It appears that chromoscopy takes longer. How much longer is impossible to calculate with the data available, but mean extra time may be as high as nine minutes. Although not assessed in any study (but mentioned as a confounding factor in one, <LINK REF="STD-Le-Rhun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Le Rhun 2006</LINK>), the chromoscopy technique also requires some training. Both factors would have a significant bearing on the logistics, procedural time and costs of colonoscopy.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the potential for increased patient discomfort, complications with increased operating time, and adverse events were not examined in any of the available trials. Likewise, we were unable to examine the outcome 'site of the lesions found' (proximal colon (caecum to splenic flexure) and distal colon/rectum (distal to splenic flexure)).</P>
<P>Considering withdrawal times, there is evidence to suggest that the detection of polyps is enhanced the more time is taken to examine the mucosa carefully during extubation (<LINK REF="REF-Barclay-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barclay 2006</LINK>). It is possible that the increased time taken on extubation with the dye-spray technique resulted in the enhanced polyp detection, although this was controlled for robustly in one study, <LINK REF="STD-Hurlstone-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hurlstone 2004</LINK>, and arguably in others where there was a set minimum extubation time (<LINK REF="STD-Stoffel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Stoffel 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kahi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pohl-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Pohl 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>It should be recognised that other developments in colonoscopy to enhance polyp detection may negate the enhanced sensitivity with chromoscopy and may certainly reduce the time taken to complete the procedure. For example, the use of a standard patient position protocol during extubation has been shown to improve mucosal visualisation and polyp detection (<LINK REF="REF-East-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-East-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Chiu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiu 2006</LINK> has also demonstrated in a prospective endoscopist-blinded randomised trial that colonic preparation on the day of colonoscopy had a beneficial effect regarding neoplasia detection. Furthermore, <LINK REF="REF-Sanaka-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanaka 2006</LINK> has shown that afternoon scheduling of colonoscopy is an independent predictor of an incomplete procedure and hence predictive of 'miss rates'. With regard to extubation technique, <LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2004</LINK> suggested sustained "retroflexion" extubation of the right colon for identification of significant lesions behind folds and in positions where conventional forward-viewing localisation was not possible. <LINK REF="REF-Deenadayalu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deenadayalu 2004</LINK> suggested the use of a 170-degree wide-angle colonoscope for enhanced visualisation but failed to show a convincing benefit when comparing it to conventional-viewing colonoscopy. Water-infusion techniques (combining or replacing air insufflation with water infusion) were initially designed to facilitate caecal intubation and to improve patient comfort. Some studies have examined the adenoma detection rate using the combination of water perfusion with chromo-endoscopy (<LINK REF="REF-Leung-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leung 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hafner-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hafner 2015</LINK>), with a suggestion of improved adenoma detection. Cap-assisted colonoscopy is another technique that appears to improve caecal intubation time, but may have limited or no benefit on polyp detection (<LINK REF="REF-Ng-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effect of high-definition technology on adenoma detection is somewhat controversial. While some believe it does not improve polyp detection (<LINK REF="REF-East-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">East 2008</LINK>), others have suggested benefit, and pooled data from a meta-analysis of five studies suggest a marginal increase in polyp detection (<LINK REF="REF-Subramanian-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subramanian 2011</LINK>). Two trials within this Cochrane review incorporated high-definition colonoscopes (<LINK REF="STD-Le-Rhun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Le Rhun 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kahi 2010</LINK>), and the adenoma detection rate in the control group was high in both studies. Indeed, in <LINK REF="STD-Kahi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kahi 2010</LINK> the detection rate in the control group was higher than the chromoscopy arm of many of the other studies. High-definition scopes also appear to have the additional advantage of a shorter learning curve and ease of use.</P>
<P>Other technological interventions include combining the wide-angled lens with high-definition monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Rex-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rex 2007</LINK>). The use of the Third Eye Retroscope allows detection of polyps hidden around folds (<LINK REF="REF-Triadafilopoulos-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Triadafilopoulos 2008</LINK>), and results from a multicentre trial suggest an improved adenoma detection rate (<LINK REF="REF-Siersema-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siersema 2012</LINK>). However, procedural times are increased due to the need for removal of the 'third eye' in order to carry out suctioning or to allow an accessory device such as biopsy forceps or snare. A future development is full-spectrum endoscopy (FUSE), which allows for a high-resolution, 330-degree view of the lumen whilst maintaining the standard features and capabilities of a conventional colonoscope (<LINK REF="REF-Gralnek-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gralnek 2013</LINK>). This technique appears particularly promising and has recently been shown to reduce adenoma miss rate (<LINK REF="REF-Gralnek-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gralnek 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>One technological advance that has created significant scientific interest for almost 10 years is virtual chromo-endoscopy (<LINK REF="REF-Kuznetsov-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuznetsov 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Su-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chiu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiu 2007</LINK>). This technique uses a narrow spectrum of wavelengths with a decreased penetration depth to enhance mucosal visualisation. Techniques include narrow band imaging (NBI), Fuji intelligent color enhancement (FICE), and autofluorescence imaging (AFI). System activation is instantaneous on depression of the endoscopic 'head' actuation switch. Trimodal imaging combines high-definition endoscopy with autofluorescence and narrow band imaging to enhance detection and polyp differentiation (<LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Broek-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Broek 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several studies have compared virtual chromo-endoscopy with both conventional chromo-endoscopy and other technologies (<LINK REF="REF-Pohl-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pohl 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Matsuda-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsuda 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adler-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adler 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paggi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paggi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pohl-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pohl 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chung-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramsoekh-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsoekh 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boparai-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boparai 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gross-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuiper-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuiper 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adler-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adler 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moriichi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moriichi 2012</LINK>), and are the focus of various reviews, including one Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Nagorni-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nagorni 2012</LINK>). These reviews have concluded that the effect of pan-colonic virtual chromo-endoscopy on polyp detection rates appears to be limited.</P>
<P>Despite the ongoing equipment advances and increase in available data, there is still a need to carefully address the clinical utility of these technologies for the detection and characterisation of colorectal neoplastic lesions. For the time being, the current analysis would suggest that chromoscopy remains one of the most sensitive methods of enhancing polyp detection.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-04-01 14:40:09 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were differences in study design and difficulties with extracting data. For instance, most studies compared chromoscopy with conventional colonoscopy, but two studies used a more complex double-intubation design. We had to estimate standard deviation in five studies. Our conservative assumptions may have led to potential bias. Participants were all adults, but some studies recruited only older participants (older than 45 or 50 years). Participants also differed in their risk of developing polyps, but studies did not present data to allow subgroup analyses to investigate this. Two studies increased the intervention variables by incorporating high-definition colonoscopy in various trial arms.</P>
<P>Although participants being at variable risk of polyp formation as a potential source of bias was highlighted in the <LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK> section, these differences did not appear to significantly influence the total number of polyps detected. The study that only included average-risk patients detected the highest number of polyps per person (<LINK REF="STD-Kahi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kahi 2010</LINK>). Endoscopist experience, the use of high-definition colonoscopes (in <LINK REF="STD-Le-Rhun-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Le Rhun 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kahi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kahi 2010</LINK>), and the higher number of diminutive adenomas detected in these participants may account for this.</P>

<P>Essentially, our conclusions have changed little since the publication of the original review. The quality of any colonoscopic examination remains dependent on complete intubation of the colon, but perhaps more importantly on a careful and complete visualisation of the mucosa during withdrawal. Training of endoscopists should still focus on this key aspect of technique, and the importance of allowing sufficient time to carry out a thorough examination is increasingly being recognised.</P>
<P>There have been significant technological innovations aimed at enhancing mucosal visualisation and polyp detection, but so far all have proved less convincing than chromoscopy. Pan-colonic chromoscopy is the one technique that to date has undergone rigorous assessment and that based on the results should theoretically be recommended for routine practice. However, the lack of data with respect to advanced adenoma detection and interval cancer rates and the time constraints involved in incorporating routine pan-chromoscopy suggest that at present selective use may be the only feasible practical application.</P>
<P>Chromoscopy may therefore be one way of enhancing polyp detection, the treatment of which may theoretically reduce the interval cancer rate on any screening programme.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-04-01 14:46:27 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The ever-evolving technological advancements seen in colonoscopy equipment and practice require careful assessment in the form of well-designed trials. The results from narrow-band imaging and water infusion have been analysed in separate Cochrane reviews, but other advances also need to be investigated to learn if any are more effective than chromoscopy. Attention should also be given to the implications of routine use of chromoscopy. One might ask: Does the extra yield of polyps make any difference? Diminutive polyps may be of limited significance, and there are risks, albeit minimal, associated with their removal. Furthermore, it should be noted that previous surveillance intervals were determined on the basis of standard colonoscopy examinations. Enhanced detection will clearly increase surveillance frequency for some, but are such individuals at greater risk for developing adenomas? Studies focused on the detection of advanced adenomas and interval cancer rates would help answer some of these questions.</P>
<P>Withdrawal times are important not only for practical purposes (a procedure that improves sensitivity but takes a long time is impractical), but also because longer withdrawal results in increased sensitivity in detecting polyps (<LINK REF="REF-Barclay-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barclay 2006</LINK>). Dye spraying takes longer to perform, and it may be this that enhances the sensitivity, allowing for a longer time to visualise the colon. It is reassuring to see this aspect of study design being incorporated in the more recent trials. Future studies should also attempt to control for this factor.</P>
<P>It is difficult to completely reduce bias in trials of chromoscopy, as it is impossible to blind the assessors. However, in order to improve the quality of future research, it is essential that all trials should control for withdrawal time and assess for intention to treat.</P>

<P>The nature of diminutive polyp detection means that it is likely that some of the included studies are underpowered. Furthermore, significant heterogeneity is introduced by the variability of the colonoscopes used in the studies as well as the differences in dye-spraying technique. There are also subtle but clear differences in the study inclusion criteria that affect the quality of the pooled evidence.</P>

<P>The design of chromoscopy studies has one inherent and unavoidable risk of bias, which is that the participant and investigator cannot be blinded because it is not possible to be unaware that you are using chromoscopy. In some trials one aspect of blinding, that of an increased time taken to carry out the procedure, is controlled for, so that although the risk of bias due to blinding is universal, it has been reduced. Blinding aside, three generic markers of internal validity (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and selective reporting) are generally good in almost all trials. One generic marker essentially related to intention to treat is unclear from the trial reports of six studies and remains unclear after attempts to contact the authors. Although the lack of blinding is known to influence the overall results, we would suggest that given the general low risk or unclear risk of bias in the other domains, the overall risk of bias is neither high nor low, which justifies our overall grading as unclear.</P>
