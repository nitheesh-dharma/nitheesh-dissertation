Please change outcome label accordingly. (DONE 17/10/07)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SD for the Badria data seems rather small - why should this be I wonder (usually the SD is around a third of the mean). ***Could I see the paper please? (PAPER TO CJC)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;also in 1#5 Gupta and Badria are on different scales so cannot be combined unless the data is transformed or SMD is used. (SMD has been used - Liz)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1#6-9 need units please (mean attack rate per day or week, Litres or % predicted etc.) (DONE 17/10/07)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2#5 looks as if one or both of the SDs are wrong (1 and 20 are very diverse). (CORRECTED 17/10/07)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SD of FEV1 is also small in Hsu 2005 (CHECKED 17/10/07. Paper to CJC)&lt;br&gt;Units also needed for comparison 6 please. (DONE 17/10/07)&lt;br&gt;Direction of effect for 7#7 needs reversal (change graph labels please). (CHECKED - THINK LABELS ARE CORRECT? 17/10/07)&lt;br&gt;7#16,18 need units please (DONE 17/10/07)&lt;br&gt;It is odd that 10#3 and 10#4 are contradictory. ***May I see the GIV calculations from the data in this paper?&lt;br&gt;13#10 has labels on graph in the wrong direction I think. (CORRECTED 17/10/07&lt;br&gt;Also 15#4? XCheck direction for 15#5 as well please. (CORRECTED 17/10/07)&lt;br&gt;Thomas crossover data is difficult to analyse. ***Please can we discuss?&lt;br&gt;18#6 needs units. (DONE 18/10/07) Again why is SD so low in treatment arm? Could this be SE? (CORRECTED 18/10/07)&lt;br&gt;Please switch off totals for single study outcomes. (DONE 18/10/07)&lt;br&gt;Synopsis&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Good&lt;br&gt;Abstract&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Good. Minor wording change in red. Also great background section&lt;br&gt;Methods&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Future tense changed in red. GIV is the method of choice for crossovers. ***Can we discuss please?&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Badria and Hsu are single trials so should be moved down to the single trial reports even though they have subgroups for FEV1. Keep the totals for these however!&lt;br&gt;Discussion&lt;br&gt;ACTION: I think the small SDs may need to be mentioned in the second paragraph as contributing to the concern about the FEV1 results.&lt;br&gt;Para 3 raises the question of how the authors defined attack rate. There could be problems with matching placebos for herbal treatment.&lt;br&gt;Contentious issues&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Comparison 17 shows and interesting discrepancy between subjective and objective outcomes!!! (CORRECTED - WRONG MEAN VALUE ENTERED 18/10/07)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it may be too strong to conclude that there is no evidence of subjective difference, but what is found is not supported strongly by objective measures and may be subject to blinding difficulties in these trials. Do you want to consider slight rephrasing of conclusions? (DONE 18/10/07)&lt;br&gt;Spellchecked&lt;br&gt;ACTION: Done&lt;br&gt;Next action - Back to authors please. This is a good review and only needs some fine tuning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;___________________________&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.3 Beta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;13102006.

DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: We conventionally use Surname and Year to identify trials. Can you prune out the initials please. DONE &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Fine, but I am worried about the placebo effect in these trials and suggest that you only include trials that compare with placebo? If you want to keep no Treatment and usual treatment you will need to justify this. I am happy to have additional to usual treatment or no treatment but do you plan to make these separate comparisons in the review structure? CHANGED TO PLACEBO CONTROL TRIALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods : You will need to take care with studies aiming to reduce conventional treatment as their main outcome. They will probably need separate analysis with this as the primary outcome of such trials? PUT REDUCTION IN STEROIDS AS PRIMARY OUTCOME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would not advise using a JADAD total for assessing the papers. By all means use the domains of randomisation, blinding, proportion of withdrawals, but ideally decide yourselves what are the main threats to the studies and report these. A total JADAD score for these studies may not help you much?

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Chronic asthma is a inflammatory disease of the airways characterised by wheeze and breathlessness. Drug therapy is usually used to control symptoms but complementary medicine is often used, including herbal treatments, and the efficacy and safety of such treatments is not clear. We reviewed evidence from 27 trials covering 21 different herbal treatments in both adults and children from both in-patient and out-patient settings. In general, the reporting of trials was poor. The outcomes measured by the trials varied considerably which made it difficult to compare the results of studies that did look at the same treatment. On the basis of the available evidence it is not possible to show whether any of these herbal treatments can improve asthma symptoms. Further trials of high quality are needed to assess the use of herbal treatments in asthma.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Herb and plant based preparations are a popular treatment for asthma, although there remain concerns as to their efficacy and safety. In Western societies, motivations for using such treatments may be both positive and negative, with their perceived safety and dissatisfaction with conventional medicine among them. In China such treatments are more commonly used and many compounds considered 'conventional' are derived from herbs or plants.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy and safety of herb and plant extracts in the management of chronic asthma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and AMED were searched with pre-defined terms. Searches are current as of February 2007.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised placebo controlled trials of any herb or plant extract were eligible. Study participants had to have a primary diagnosis of asthma. Studies in both adults and children were eligible for the review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers assessed studies for suitability. Data were extracted and double-checked.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-seven studies (29 experimental groups) met the review entry criteria, randomising a total of 1925 participants. The studies identified assessed the effects of 21 different herbal preparations. Study quality varied considerably, and the sample sizes were often small. For primary outcomes (exacerbations, steroids use and lung function measurements): Two out of six studies reporting change in FEV1 were positive, with very few data available on the frequency of exacerbations. One study which did report these data was negative. Health-related quality of life was only measured in one trial. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The evidence base for the effects of herbal treatments is hampered by the variety of treatments assessed, poor reporting quality of the studies and lack of available data. The data that are available from the studies provide only a small insight into the long-term efficacy and harm profiles of these treatments. The absence of common endpoint measurements limits the validity of our findings further. Positive findings in this review warrant additional well-designed trials in this area.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-13 13:40:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterised by wheeze, breathlessness and airflow limitation (<LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2005</LINK>). Drug therapy is normally used to control symptoms. However the use of complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) is widespread. In a UK survey of National Asthma Campaign members, only 41% said that they had <I>not</I> used CAM and of those 41%, 67% said that they would consider using CAM for their asthma in the future. The most popular forms of CAM in the study population were breathing techniques, homeopathy and herbalism (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1998</LINK>). A survey of CAM use in asthma or rhino sinusitis sufferers in the USA found that 42% of the study population had used some form of CAM for their condition in the 12 months prior to the study. Herbal treatments emerged as being the most commonly reported form of CAM being used (<LINK REF="REF-Blanc-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanc 2001</LINK>). Another US survey of CAM use found that allergies and lung problems ranked as some of the most frequently reported medical conditions that CAM is used for, and the most popular forms of CAM for these conditions were herbs, relaxation and spiritual healing (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Why then, when there are effective treatments available for asthma do people turn to complementary or alternative medicine, especially given that evidence in support of treatments such as acupuncture and homeopathy are weak (<LINK REF="REF-McCarney-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarney 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCarney-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarney 2004</LINK>)? The reasons for people turning to CAM can be divided into positive and negative motivations (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2005</LINK>). Positive motivations include perceived effectiveness and safety; 'spiritual' or holistic nature of the therapy; personal control over treatment; good relationship with the therapist; and accessibility. Negative reasons include dissatisfaction with conventional methods; rejection of the 'establishment'; and desperation. A study into the beliefs and motivations of CAM users in Canada supports this theory. It found the two main reasons people used CAM were that it allows them to take a more active role in their health, and a feeling that conventional medicine was not effective for their health condition (<LINK REF="REF-Sirois-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sirois 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>As shown by <LINK REF="REF-Blanc-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanc 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1998</LINK>; and <LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1998</LINK>, herbal therapy is a popular form of CAM in asthma. There is a long history of using herbs to treat asthma and a number of asthma drugs have their origins in herbal remedies. For example, ephedrine was developed from the traditional Chinese herbal remedy 'ma huang', and tea leaves are the herbal origin of theophylline (<LINK REF="REF-Ziment-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziment 2000</LINK>). Caffeine, found in tea and coffee, is a member of the same family as theophylline, and has been used for centuries as a treatment for asthma. A recent Cochrane review found that it improved lung function for up to four hours after ingestion (<LINK REF="REF-Bara-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bara 2001</LINK>). There are many different herbs and herbal preparations that are used to treat asthma and each culture has its own approach. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> shows examples of herbs used for the treatment of asthma by culture. Western cultures use products from local plants but also borrow from Eastern cultures (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2000</LINK>). Herbal interventions for asthma are often used in addition to conventional medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Bielory-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bielory 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clement-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clement 2005</LINK>) rather than as a sole agent.</P>
<P>One of the positive motivations for using CAM is perceived safety. However there are risks with the use of herbal remedies including drug interactions, inconsistent dosing, contamination and natural toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2000</LINK>). Drug interactions could be a particular concern as a survey of herbal therapy users found that 81% also used conventional medicines (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1998</LINK> also found that herbal remedy users would be less likely to consult their GPs for suspected adverse events to a herbal remedy than they would for a conventional over-the-counter medicine. In fact, herbal therapy users tend to self-medicate or take the advice of a friend or relative (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clement-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clement 2005</LINK>) so are unlikely to consult any practitioner at all on the use of herbal products. </P>
<P>Whether herbal products are actually effective in the treatment of asthma is uncertain. A systematic review of herbs for asthma conducted in 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Huntley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huntley 2000</LINK>) found 17 randomised controlled trials: six assessing traditional Chinese herbs; eight assessing traditional Indian remedies; one assessing a Japanese herbal preparation; one assessing dried ivy-leaf extract, and one assessing use of marijuana. They found the methodological quality of the trials was poor and concluded that herbal products are of "uncertain value in the treatment of asthma". However, they also concluded that were some "promising data". Given the high usage of herbal products among people with asthma, a new assessment of the current evidence is needed.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effectiveness of herbal therapies as a sole agent or in addition to pharmacological therapy in the management of chronic asthma.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are included.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adults and children over five years old with a diagnosis of chronic asthma of all severities. Diagnosis should be confirmed on the basis of symptoms and lung function assessment.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>For the purposes of this review, herbal medicine is defined as the use of plants or plant extracts to treat disease. The products may be derived from the leaves, stems, buds, roots, fruit or bark (<LINK REF="REF-Bielory-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bielory 1999</LINK>) and administered in a number of different ways. Given the nature of asthma, any substances that are taken by inhaling smoke will be excluded, but other than that there will be no limitation on the method of administration. Single chemicals extracted from a plant, or synthetic chemicals based on plant constituents will be excluded (e.g. ephedrine from <I>Ephedra sinica </I>(ma huang) or atropine from <I>Atropa belladonna </I>(deadly nightshade)). </P>
<P>The intervention may be a single herb or a mixture of herbs given either as a sole agent or in addition to usual treatment, with a placebo control. This review does not consider trials that compare one herbal intervention with another, or herbs with any other 'complementary' treatment, such as homeopathy or acupuncture.</P>

<BR/>The reference lists of review articles and primary studies were checked for additional trials. Authors of studies were contacted for further information if necessary. Manufacturers and experts in the CAM field were contacted for any unpublished data. Contact was made with the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field and the Chinese Cochrane Centre, and special interest groups such as the National Asthma Campaign and British Lung Foundation.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>Selection of studies<BR/>
</B>The results of the literature search were screened by two review authors. At the first stage potentially relevant trials were identified on the basis of their title, abstract and keywords. The full-text was then obtained and assessed for inclusion or exclusion in the review. Trials were not excluded on the basis of language and translations were obtained where possible.</P>
<P>Any disagreement between the authors was resolved by discussion or where necessary by referral to a third party. </P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction and management<BR/>
</B>Data was extracted independently by two authors using a standard data extraction form developed by the Airways Group. Trialists were contacted for further information and unpublished data if necessary. The data was entered into RevMan by one author and checked for accuracy by another. Again, any disagreement between the authors was resolved by discussion or consultation with a third party. In some cases data had to be estimated from graphs presented in the paper (<LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lau-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2004</LINK>). In these cases the values were estimated by two reviewers and where there were differences the mid-point between the two was used.</P>

<B>Results of the search</B>
<BR/>The electronic searches retrieved a total of 2645 references. Additional hand searching by TW identified 111 studies conducted in the People's Republic of China. Correspondence with Asthma UK revealed one further study. After initial screening of the titles and abstracts, and collation of information from TW we assessed 252 studies for possible inclusion in the review. A total of 27 studies (represented by 29 experimental comparisons) met review entry criteria, randomising 1925 participants.</P>

<P>The reporting quality of the studies was poor. Based on study publications, we could only assess methodological quality for a small number of the included trials. Although all of the studies were reported as being randomised and blinded, the detail of these characteristics was frequently not elaborated.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Randomisation</B>
<BR/>This was adequately described (in seven trials (26%), and was inadequate in one of them (<LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 1996</LINK>). In the remaining four studies where randomisation was described, the process was undertaken by a third party and was generated automatically.</P>
<P>
<B>Blinding </B>
<BR/>Identical presentation of treatment and control treatments was described in 10 studies (37%). In one study an emetic agent was added to the placebo preparation in order to mask this particular side-effect (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Withdrawal </B>
<BR/>Eight studies reported withdrawals (30%: <LINK REF="STD-Chan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hederos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hederos 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khayyal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Khayyal 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mansfeld-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mansfeld 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tamaoki-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tamaoki 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one study gave adequate descriptions of all three of these domains (<LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Juergens-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Juergens 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathew-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Mathew 1974</LINK> gave descriptions of randomisation and blinding. <LINK REF="STD-Tamaoki-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Tamaoki 1995</LINK> reported blinding and withdrawals adequately. </P>

<P>Twenty seven studies (29 experimental groups) contributed data to the analysis. One study of Evening Primrose Oil did not contribute any numerical data as separate data were not available for the asthma sub-group (<LINK REF="STD-Hederos-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hederos 1996</LINK>). However this paper reported no significant difference for the asthma sub-group and this was confirmed by correspondence with the author.</P>
<P>Studies tended to report individually defined measures of changes in lung function, thus combination of data for meta-analysis was only possible within subgroups of two studies; Boswelia (<LINK REF="STD-Badria-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Badria 2004</LINK>) and Mai-Men-Don Tang (<LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2005</LINK>), and between studies of tylopohora indica (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathew-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Mathew 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shivpuri-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Shivpuri 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shivpuri-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Shivpuri 1972</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Herbal preparations are used frequently in the management of asthma globally. We found 27 studies assessing 21 herbal preparations which met the entry criteria of the review. There were very little combined outcome data to assess, which reflects both the array of different interventions assessed, study designs and outcomes measured, for example FEV1 was reported in five different ways across 17 studies, of which five studies reported positive differences in favour of treatment and twelve were not significant. Consequently none of our planned a priori subgroup analyses were possible. The positive outcome data for many of the outcomes reported should be seen in the context of the poor reporting quality of the studies, which prevents a thorough evaluation of the evidence in this area. On the strength of current evidence there are only a limited number of preparations which have been assessed in such a way as to permit a substantial summary of their efficacy and safety. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Badria-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Badria 2004</LINK> reported significant improvements in FEV1 as percentage of predicted for Boswellia in adults. The small sample subgroups drawn from the study may bias the pooled effect. The benefits measured as improvement in percentage of predicted FEV1 translate into only modest changes in actual FEV1 whose clinical relevance is therefore uncertain. Such benefits need to be carefully balanced against the unknown side-effect profile of this treatments; although the study did not report any adverse outcomes. Significant improvements in PEFR as percentage of predicted were reported for two other compounds: Propolis in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Khayyal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Khayyal 2003</LINK>) and pycnogenol (French maritime pine bark extract) in children (<LINK REF="STD-Lau-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2004</LINK>). Again the changes in PEFR are expressed as change of percent predicted and translate into modest absolute changes of lung volumes. The only significant improvement in absolute PEFR, reported with Boswelia (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1998</LINK>) is also small in clinical terms.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis of two studies of tylophora indica showed improvement in symptoms scores (&gt;50%) after one week (<LINK REF="STD-Mathew-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Mathew 1974</LINK>
<I>; </I>
<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1979</LINK>), and three studies showed impressive results in measuring clinical improvement at week one (defined as at least 50% reduction in frequency of attacks and only moderate symptoms), although this effect had disappeared by week 12 (<LINK REF="STD-Shivpuri-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Shivpuri 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shivpuri-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Shivpuri 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mathew-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Mathew 1974</LINK>). Meta-analysis of physiological data from two studies showed a greater than 20% improvement in PEFR after one week (<LINK REF="STD-Mathew-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Mathew 1974</LINK>
<I>; </I>
<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1979</LINK>) and in one study this improvement remained at 12 weeks follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Mathew-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Mathew 1974</LINK>) This preparation was postulated to have an effect persisting for weeks after the six days of treatment administered in these studies, but no other objective measure of improvement was seen after 12 weeks. Whilst demonstrating improvement in attack frequency, this intervention may not be suitable for chronic application since it is also associated with severe gastrointestinal side-effects, sufficient to lead one of the trialists to include an emetic agent in the placebo comparator in order to mask treatment group assignment (<LINK REF="STD-Mathew-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Mathew 1974</LINK>). </P>
<P>Requirement for oral steroids is an indication that the nature of chronic asthma is severe and persistent (<LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2005</LINK>). Where inhaled steroids are available, these are normally preferred to oral steroids if asthma can be satisfactorily controlled in this way (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005</LINK>). One study assessed the effect of eucalyptol as an oral steroid sparing agent (<LINK REF="STD-Juergens-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Juergens 2003</LINK>). The mean daily dose reduction of nearly 3 mg would translate to a meaningful reduction in the daily steroid load, especially since a significant decrease in symptoms favouring treatment accompanied this reduction. Nevertheless longer-term follow-up would be necessary to establish whether this effect is sustainable beyond 12 week duration of this study. Oral steroid dosages at entry ranged from 5 to 24 mg prednisolone daily, therefore this was a selected group of asthmatics at step 5 of current asthma guidelines. Further information on the effect of eucalyptol on inhaled steroid dosage and in a more representative sample of asthmatics is therefore needed. </P>
<P>There were some reported improvements in subjective asthma symptoms. Boswellia, eucalyptol, ginger, pulmoflex, propolis, tylophora indica, Tj-96, Liu-Wei-Di-Huang-Wan, Shen-Ling-Bia-Shu-San, and Jai-Wei-Si-Jun-Zi-Tang all produced some improvement in patient's symptoms. However, the way in which these symptoms were reported is vastly different, for example, Pulmoflex (<LINK REF="STD-Gabrielian-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gabrielian 2004</LINK>) showed improvement in 'patients experiencing deterioration' while Ginger (<LINK REF="STD-Rouhi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rouhi 2006</LINK>) showed improvement in 'patients experiencing chest tightness'. Values for Chinese herbs Liu-Wei-Di-Huang-Wan, Shen-Ling-Bia-Shu-San, and Jai-Wei-Si-Jun-Zi-Tang (<LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 1996</LINK>) had to be estimated from graphs, and there were issues with the adequacy of blinding in these trials. The study of Propolis (<LINK REF="STD-Khayyal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Khayyal 2003</LINK>) used different coloured sachets to administer the treatment and control and <LINK REF="STD-Rouhi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rouhi 2006</LINK> did not mention any attempt to mask the strong taste of ginger. The inconsistencies and the poor quality of the reporting in these trials does undermine the validity of these results. <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> demonstrates the lack of information for many of the studies which prevented their contribution to the analysis of data in the this review. </P>
<P>It is commonly perceived that herbal treatments for asthma are safer than proprietary medications. However, their use has been associated with an increase in hospital admission (<LINK REF="REF-Blanc-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanc 1997</LINK>). In this review 9 of the sixteen studies which considered adverse effects reported their presence. Symptoms were predominantly gastrointestinal and for some studies dropout rates were significant (<LINK REF="STD-Shivpuri-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Shivpuri 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are a number of limitations to the studies of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) trials identified from the literature searches which did not meet the entry criteria of the review. Firstly, none of the trials used a placebo as control. Without this, participants were aware as to their treatment group allocation. Secondly, none of the trials undertook allocation concealment. Although Chinese medicinal herbs as a treatment for chronic asthma are widely accepted in China, most of the constituents of the pharmacologically prepared drugs used in trials were not clearly specified. This is in marked contrast to pharmacological agents used in Western medicine, in which the chemical constituents, their quantities and the percentage of any impurities or contaminants are more widely known, and variation between different production batches is kept within specified limits. Variation between formulations and batches of formulations are inevitable consequences of TCM, though the Chinese Government specifies acceptable limits of variation. This variation may be a contributory factor in differing study results. Therefore, when a trial uses a self-prepared herbal formulation, the quality of herbs and methods of preparation should be stated in detail, in order to assess properly whether inconsistent effects could be explained by differences in treatments. Lastly, a large number of the trials claimed to be RCTs, but when we contacted the trial authors about the method of randomisation they used, we found that more than 95% of the authors misunderstood the concept of randomisation. In addition to this, some of the studies were conducted several years ago, and the trial authors may have forgotten the details of the methodology they employed, which could lead to bias and affect the veracity of information. </P>
<P>Extrapolating the findings of the studies in this review to a more general population is hampered by the poor reporting quality of the original studies. Sixteen trials were reported after the publication of the CONSORT statement in 1996 (<LINK REF="REF-Consort" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consort</LINK>), but only four of these (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hsu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Juergens-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Juergens 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murali-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Murali 2006</LINK>) report both the method of randomisation and blinding. The quality of reporting in the studies leaves open to question whether the positive findings in the review could be used to inform a decision on whether to use any of the treatments studied. <LINK REF="REF-Gagnier-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gagnier 2006</LINK> presents an elaborated CONSORT statement for the reporting of RCTs in herbal interventions. Journals should take into account the recommendations for reporting the intervention, its delivery and adequate control. </P>
<P>The mean sample size was 69, and data from different studies were available for statistical combination in seven outcomes from a total of 119 outcomes contributing to the review. Priorities for research in this area include better reporting of methodology, more open disclosure of outcome data, and clear reporting of baseline characteristics. Only one study reported group mean FEV1 of predicted (<LINK REF="STD-Urata-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Urata 2002</LINK>) and more frequent reporting of standard absolute measures of lung function and severity indicators would facilitate more informed decision-making when people are considering the use of herbal preparations in the management of asthma. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>On the basis of the evidence presented in this review, the authors conclude that although some herbal preparations have shown improvement in subjective measures of asthma symptoms, this is not strongly supported by objective measures, and may be related to biases within the studies such as inadequate blinding.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Tylophora indica has been studied in five papers included in this review. There is some evidence for benefit but studies of longer than six days duration are needed. The significant evidence of adverse effects suggests that further work to differentiate the active ingredient(s) from the causes of the side effects will be required before longer studies can be performed. Some other preparations (boswellia, Mai-Men-Dong-Tang, Propolis, pycnogenol and Jia-Wei-Si-Jun-Zi-Tang) show some potential to improve lung function, or to reduce daily steroid dosage (eucalyptol), but the trials reporting these are of small sample size and short duration. There is a need for carefully constructed trials of adequate power to further assess these compounds. Future studies should conform to CONSORT guidance and report readily comparable measures such as absolute levels of spirometric data and use existing validated measures of symptom and disease severity.</P>
