<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-03-14 22:59:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The hip joint is a ball and socket joint. Newborns may have hips that are not in their socket (dislocated) or hips that are improperly formed (dysplasia). Risk factors for hip dysplasia include a family history of a similar problem and female infants delivered in the breech position. The hips of most newborns will be examined clinically after birth and during infancy to determine whether they are stable, unstable or dislocated. Screening for hip dysplasia may prevent the need for late treatment, which is associated with long term hip deformity, gait disturbance and arthritis. However, early screening leads to increased treatment. Treatment may be complicated by damage to the hip due to impairment of the blood supply (avascular necrosis).</P>
<P>This review found no studies that compared the benefits and costs of early screening versus not screening for hip problems. Studies that compared the addition of ultrasound to clinical examination reported that when ultrasound was performed on all infants, the rate of treatment increased with no significant difference in rate of late detected dysplasia or surgery. Targeted ultrasound to infants at high risk of hip dysplasia did not significantly increase the rate of treatment but also did not significantly reduce the rate of late detected dysplasia or surgery. It is not possible to give clear recommendations for hip screening of newborn infants from the available evidence.</P>
<P>Where infants are clinically detected as having unstable but not dislocated hips, or are detected on ultrasound to have mild hip dysplasia, there is evidence that delaying treatment by two to eight weeks reduces the need for treatment without a significant increase in late diagnosed dysplasia or surgery.</P>

<P>There is insufficient evidence to give clear recommendations for practice. There is inconsistent evidence that universal ultrasound results in a significant increase in treatment compared to the use of targeted ultrasound or clinical examination alone.

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-06-28 11:48:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-06-28 11:29:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The term developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) describes a range of hip abnormalities affecting the newborn in which the femoral head and acetabulum are in improper alignment or grow abnormally, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Shipman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shipman 2006</LINK>). Clinical instability of the hip is the traditional hallmark of the disorder, but the definition of DDH also includes hips with radiological abnormalities of the femoral head or acetabulum that may or may not be associated with joint instability (<LINK REF="REF-Dezateux-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dezateux 2007</LINK>). The precise cause of DDH is unknown, with a combination of genetic and environmental influences associated with DDH and hip dislocation including family history, fetal crowding, vaginal delivery, breech presentation and female gender (<LINK REF="REF-Sewell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sewell 2009</LINK>). Early screening for DDH has the potential to prevent long term hip dysplasia and arthritis requiring hip replacement.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-05-15 22:52:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The prevalence of DDH varies from 1.6 to 28.5 cases per 1000 live births depending on the definition and the population being studied (<LINK REF="REF-Bialik-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bialik 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dezateux-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dezateux 2007</LINK>). Most cases of DDH resolve without treatment in the first few months of life (<LINK REF="REF-Bialik-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bialik 1999</LINK>). However, uncorrected DDH, especially when associated with hip dislocation, is associated with significant long term morbidity including gait abnormalities, chronic pain and premature degenerative arthritis of the hip requiring joint replacement in later life. Up to 94% of adults with untreated congenital dislocation of the hip will have moderate or severe osteoarthritis by the second decade (<LINK REF="REF-Cooperman-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooperman 1983</LINK>). In the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register, DDH was implicated in 9% of all primary hip replacements and almost one third of hip replacements in people under 65 years (<LINK REF="REF-Furnes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furnes 2000</LINK>). </P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-06-28 11:28:09 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Screening programmes for DDH involve clinical examination, ultrasound examination (universal or targeted to high risk groups) or a combination of the two. X-ray screening has been used historically but is rarely used today and will not be covered by this review. Risk factors for DDH that may prompt targeted screening include breech presentation, female gender, a first degree relative with DDH, metatarsus adductus, congenital torticollis, talipes, high birthweight and oligohydramnios (<LINK REF="REF-Wynne_x002d_Davies-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wynne-Davies 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bache-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bache 2002</LINK>). There are also racial differences in the incidence (<LINK REF="REF-Yiv-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yiv 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinical examination involves observation of the infant for limb length discrepancy, thigh fold symmetry and any limitation of abduction. The manoeuvres of Barlow and Ortalani are then carried out. Barlow's test is used to dislocate an unstable but normally located femoral head. Ortalani's test is used to return an already dislocated femoral head to the acetabulum. Each test is considered positive if a 'clunk' or instability is felt as the femoral head dislocates (Barlow) or relocates (Ortalani). Clicks felt during the clinical examination are not considered significant (<LINK REF="REF-Bond-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bond 1997</LINK>). One important factor in the success of a clinical screening programme is the experience of the examiner (<LINK REF="REF-Bialik-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bialik 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finne-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finne 2008</LINK>). One large cohort study involving over 20,000 infants missed only two cases of hip dislocation that presented at a late stage (15 and 18 months) (<LINK REF="REF-Hadlow-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadlow 1988</LINK>). Similar results have been seen in other series (<LINK REF="REF-Darmonov-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darmonov 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goss-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goss 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>A range of ultrasound techniques for detecting newborn DDH have been described (<LINK REF="REF-Graf-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graf 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harcke-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harcke 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Terjesen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terjesen 1989</LINK>). Some methods use a static technique to estimate the degree of femoral head coverage by the acetabulum or the appearance of the hip joint. Other methods ultrasound the hip during a dynamic manoeuvre to visualize any subluxation or dislocation of the femoral head while the joint is under stress. Ultrasound allows the detection of dysplastic hips that are clinically stable (<LINK REF="REF-Sucato-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sucato 1999</LINK>) and detects more DDH than clinical screening alone (<LINK REF="REF-Bialik-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bialik 1999</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-05-15 22:14:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dislocated or dislocatable hips that are identified and treated in the neonatal period show more normal growth radiologically and require less surgical intervention than those diagnosed and treated late (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 1985</LINK>). These observations have prompted screening programmes for DDH, including the routine ultrasound scanning of every newborn hip in several European countries. The biological rationale for hip adduction therapy is to place the growing hip joint into a correctly located position in order to encourage normal subsequent development (<LINK REF="REF-Dezateux-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dezateux 2007</LINK>; Eastwood 2003).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-06-28 11:29:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no clear consensus as to what degree of ultrasound abnormality in a newborn hip should be treated (<LINK REF="REF-Woolacott-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolacott 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dezateux-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dezateux 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roposch-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roposch 2007</LINK>). Longitudinal studies of universal hip screening show that 90.4% of hips that are ultrasound positive for DDH in the newborn period become normal without treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Bialik-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bialik 1999</LINK>), implying that many infants are treated for DDH unnecessarily. An alternative to universal screening is targeted screening in which only infants with risk factors for DDH or abnormal clinical examination are evaluated by ultrasound. Universal hip ultrasound screening has been associated with higher rates of treatment than targeted ultrasound screening, but that treatment is generally shorter and less intrusive (<LINK REF="REF-Woolacott-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolacott 2005</LINK>). Hip abduction splinting, the most common treatment for early DDH, can lead to complications including avascular necrosis of the femoral head (<LINK REF="REF-Gore-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gore 1999</LINK>), femoral nerve palsies, pressure sores and parental anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Dezateux-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dezateux 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gardner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite its widespread use internationally, clear evidence linking DDH screening to a reduction in hip complications is weak (<LINK REF="REF-Woolacott-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolacott 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shipman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shipman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dezateux-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dezateux 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kamath-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamath 2007</LINK>). Studies have failed to demonstrate improvements in either the rate of DDH corrective surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Godward-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Godward 1998</LINK>) or the rate of late presenting DDH (<LINK REF="REF-Kamath-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamath 2007</LINK>) since screening was introduced. Furthermore, a committee established by the US Congress in 2006 to evaluate the effectiveness of DDH screening concluded that there was "insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants as a means to prevent adverse outcomes" (<LINK REF="REF-USPSTF-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">USPSTF 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Controversy also exists about the best time to screen for DDH. Barlow reported that infants examined late in the first week of life have a lower incidence of DDH than those examined in the early part of the week (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 1962</LINK>). This suggests a spontaneous resolution of DDH, which has been seen in other observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Bialik-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bialik 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to examine the evidence of benefits and harms of different screening methods for DDH.</P>

<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were employed. The methodological quality of each trial was reviewed independently by the review authors. Each identified trial was assessed for methodological quality with respect to: a) masking of allocation, b) masking of intervention, c) completeness of follow up, and d) masking of outcome assessment. This information is included in the table 'Characteristics of included studies'.</P>
<P>In addition, the 'Risk of bias' table was completed. The review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, detailed below.</P>
<P>1. Random sequence generation: was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: low risk (any truly random process for example random number table, computer random number generator); high risk (any non-random process for example odd or even date of birth, hospital or clinic record number); or unclear risk.</P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment: was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: low risk (for example telephone or central randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); high risk (open random allocation, unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation, date of birth); or unclear risk.</P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors: was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed the methods as: low risk, high risk or unclear risk for participants; low risk, high risk or unclear risk for study personnel; and low risk, high risk or unclear risk for outcome assessors; and the specific outcomes assessed.</P>
<P>We used the term 'blinding of treatment' to refer to the screening and management pathway. We used the term 'blinding of measurement' to refer to outcome assessment (for example DDH or surgery).</P>
<P>4. Incomplete outcome data: were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. We assessed methods as: adequate (&lt; 20% missing data); inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data); or unclear.</P>
<P>5. Selective outcome reporting: are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>For each included study, we assessed the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias as: low risk (where it was clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); high risk (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes were reported, one or more reported primary outcome was not pre-specified, outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so cannot be used, study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or unclear risk. </P>
<P>6. Other sources of bias: was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns regarding other possible sources of bias (for example whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as: yes; no; or unclear.</P>

If we used ICCs from other sources, we planned to report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identified both cluster randomised trials and individually randomised trials, we planned to synthesise the relevant information.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">For all infants (unselected infants)</HEADING>
<P>No study compared clinical examination versus no screening, or ultrasound screening versus no screening. No conclusion can be made about the balance of benefits and harms from newborn screening for DDH compared to not screening for DDH. Of concern is that screening leads to increased intervention, which has been associated with the development of avascular necrosis (AVN); with the frequency of AVN ranging from 5% to 60% after surgical treatment and 0% to 14% after non-surgical treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Shipman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shipman 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence to date relates to the addition of universal or targeted ultrasound to clinical examination for the early detection of DDH. The two studies were single centre studies in which the clinical examinations were performed by examiners with substantial paediatric experience and the ultrasound was performed by either experienced orthopedic surgeons (<LINK REF="STD-Holen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Holen 2002</LINK>) or a single physician (<LINK REF="STD-Rosendahl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rosendahl 1994</LINK>). The evidence may not be applicable to centres who use doctors or nurses in training to perform the hip examination, or centres in which the hip ultrasound component is performed by multiple sonographers. The studies used both static and dynamic methods of ultrasound examination. <LINK REF="STD-Holen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Holen 2002</LINK> used the static method described by Terjesen and Holen (percentage acetabular cover of femoral head: normal &gt; 47% boys; &gt; 44% girls) and a subjective dynamic test for instability. <LINK REF="STD-Rosendahl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rosendahl 1994</LINK> used the method of Graf (major dysplastic morphology = Graf types IIIa or worse; mild dysplastic morphology = IIc and D) and a dynamic test performed during a Barlow equivalent manoeuvre. A review of studies of diagnostic accuracy for ultrasound screening (<LINK REF="REF-Rosendahl-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosendahl 2007</LINK>) found that studies reported adequate repeatability for the static [Graf, Morin, modified Morin (Terjesen)] and for the combined static and dynamic methods [modified Graf (Rosendahl)], while no such reports were found for the dynamic (Harcke) ultrasound techniques, suggesting that the methods used in the studies included in this review are likely to have adequate repeatability. Given that both studies used experienced clinical examiners, it is possible that the benefits of ultrasound screening found were less than would have occurred in a setting where doctors or nurses in training are used to perform the clinical examination. It may also be difficult for many care settings to reproduce the outcomes of the ultrasound screened groups given the experience of the ultrasonographers used.</P>
<P>Compared to clinical examination alone, <LINK REF="STD-Rosendahl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rosendahl 1994</LINK> reported that the use of universal ultrasound significantly increased the rate of treatment for DDH without a significant reduction in rate of late diagnosed DDH or surgery. Use of targeted ultrasound did not significantly affect the rate of treatment, late diagnosed DDH or surgery. Two studies reported heterogeneous effects of universal ultrasound compared to targeted ultrasound on treatment rate, but found no significant differences in rates of late diagnosed DDH, delayed abduction splinting, avascular necrosis or surgery. Although these comparisons include several thousand infants, they are likely to be substantially underpowered to detect important differences in rates of late diagnosed DDH, avascular necrosis and surgery. To detect a fall in rate of late diagnosed DDH from 2.6 to 1.4 per 1000 would require a trial substantially in excess of 100,000 infants.</P>
<P>The two studies comparing the addition of hip ultrasound versus clinical examination alone reported ultrasound or radiological outcomes after one month of age (<LINK REF="STD-Holen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Holen 2002</LINK>) or a mean age of 4.5 months (range 2.5 to 18 months) (<LINK REF="STD-Rosendahl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rosendahl 1994</LINK>). Neither study reported longer term functional outcomes of infants. No quality of life scale was reported. Infants with DDH are at risk of long term hip dysplasia, arthritis and functional impairment as well as associated psychological effects. However, the incidence of DDH diagnosed by ultrasound ranges between 34·0 and 60·3 per 1000 and is substantially greater than that detected by Ortolani and Barlow manoeuvres (between 1·6 to 28·5 per 1000). The incidence of DDH detected by imaging is also substantially higher than the prevalence of persistent and clinically diagnosed hip dysplasia in unscreened populations, which is estimated to be 1·3 per 1000 (range 0·84 to 1·5) (<LINK REF="REF-Leck-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leck 2000</LINK>). Also, a proportion of infants with unrecognised hip dysplasia (11% to 44%) who present late remain pain free into adulthood (<LINK REF="REF-Dezateux-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dezateux 2007</LINK>). As a result, the studies included in this review are likely to have reported higher rates of late diagnosed DDH than will be reflected in clinical functional outcomes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">For infants with clinically unstable hips</HEADING>
<P>The two included studies enrolled infants with clinically unstable hips. Both excluded infants with dislocated hips (which were splinted immediately) so the findings of the review do not apply to these infants. In the clinical treatment group, infants with clinically unstable hips were splinted and those with minor instability were observed for eight weeks. In the delayed treatment group, infants were reviewed after 10 to 14 days by both clinical and ultrasound investigation. Infants with persisting instability were then splinted, but in one study those with minor instability were monitored for eight weeks. Clinical examination was performed by an experienced paediatrician. Ultrasounds were performed by an experienced sonographer (one of the researchers). The outcomes of 708 infants were reported. Both studies reported rates of late diagnosed DDH (that is persistent clinical or ultrasound abnormality) and rate of treatment, but only one study enrolling 629 infants reported rates of delayed abduction splinting, avascular necrosis and surgery. Late diagnosed DDH was reported at one year by both studies. In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Elbourne 2002</LINK> reported independent mobility at two years. Longer term hip dysplasia, arthritis and functional impairment, as well as associated psychological effects, were not reported. The findings largely relate to the addition of ultrasound in order to delay and reduce intervention for clinically unstable but not dislocated hips and report functional findings to two years.</P>

<P>One study that enrolled 128 infants with mild hip dysplasia on ultrasound reported the effect of immediate splinting compared to delayed ultrasound and targeted splinting at eight weeks. Initial ultrasound was undertaken after either the detection of clinical hip instability or the identification of other risk factors for DDH (breech presentation at delivery, or first or second degree family history of DDH) at the newborn screening examination. Infants with dislocated, dislocatable, or severely dysplastic hips were excluded and received immediate treatment. Infants &lt; 2.5 kg at birth or with major congenital anomalies were also excluded. Late hip dysplasia was reported at one year but longer term hip dysplasia, arthritis and functional impairment as well as associated psychological effects were not reported.

<P>Both studies assessing the effects of clinical examination or ultrasound screening, or both, for hip abnormality had substantial methodological concerns, although the allocation methods of one of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rosendahl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rosendahl 1994</LINK>) place it at particularly high risk of bias. There is also substantial concern in that for most analyses only a single study is included. Given the low rate of major adverse outcomes, including avascular necrosis, surgery and late diagnosed DDH, there is substantial concern that the analyses are underpowered to detect even a moderate difference between groups. Although <LINK REF="STD-Holen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Holen 2002</LINK> used an adequate method of screening allocation, the allocation concealment was unclear and blinding of outcome assessments was not reported. According to the nursery of admission, <LINK REF="STD-Rosendahl-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Rosendahl 1994</LINK> had an inadequate method of infant allocation, and outcome assessment was blinded. There was significant heterogeneity between the studies in rates of treatment comparing infants screened by universal versus targeted ultrasound. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analysis identified several potential explanations for heterogeneity, including differences in treatment thresholds and differences in the experience of the clinical hip examiners. There are also substantial methodological concerns for both studies.</P>

However, radiographs were not available for 15% of infants at two years. The other small study alternately assigned infants to groups although outcome assessment was reported to be blinded to the group of assignment. There was significant heterogeneity between studies reporting rates of treatment. Subgroup analysis suggests heterogeneity is potentially due to differences either in the time of enrolment or treatment criteria for the clinical examination and immediate splinting group.

<P>This review included pre-specified study eligibility criteria, quality appraisal criteria and outcomes for assessment of studies and the effects of the interventions.

The appraisal of study eligibility and quality, and extraction of data, were performed independently by three review authors.</P>
<P>The inclusion of studies using quasi-random methods of patient allocation has the potential to bias the findings of the review. In addition, the primary outcome of the review (late diagnosed DDH) is reported for all studies and not restricted to studies of adequate methodology. Risk of bias assessment suggests that there are substantial methodological concerns particularly for the comparisons assessing the effect of clinical hip examination and hip ultrasound for screening of all infants.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-03-26 15:08:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) in 2000 recommended that all newborns&#8217; hips should be screened by physical examination with examination of all infants&#8217; hips according to a periodicity schedule and follow until walking (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2000</LINK>). The US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) stated "There is evidence that screening leads to earlier identification; however, 60% to 80% of the hips of newborns identified as abnormal or as suspicious for DDH by physical examination and &gt; 90% of those identified by ultrasound in the newborn period resolve spontaneously, requiring no intervention. There is poor evidence (poor quality studies) of the effectiveness of both surgical and non-surgical interventions; avascular necrosis of the hip (AVN) is reported in 0% to 60% of children who are treated for DDH. Thus, the USPSTF was unable to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for DDH but was concerned about the potential harms associated with treatment of infants identified by routine screening" (<LINK REF="REF-USPSTF-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">USPSTF 2006</LINK>). The findings of this review are largely in keeping with these statements, although the USPSTF report also included diagnostic test accuracy assessments and observational studies of infant hip screening outcomes.</P>
<P>It was noted in the USPSTF review (<LINK REF="REF-USPSTF-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">USPSTF 2006</LINK>) that trials of screening versus not screening are now unlikely to be conducted given the creep of evidence and practice, despite concerns regarding the potential harm from screening and excess treatment. It is probable that research will now focus on reducing rates of treatment in infants with a clinical or ultrasound abnormality, as well as reducing the potential for harm from splinting or other surgical treatment.</P>

<P>It is not possible to give clear recommendations for practice. There were no studies examining the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment versus not screening and later treatment. When screening is used, there is inconsistent evidence that universal ultrasound results in a significant increase in treatment compared to the use of targeted ultrasound or clinical examination alone. Neither ultrasound strategy has been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes, including late diagnosed DDH and surgery. The studies are substantially underpowered to detect significant differences in the uncommon event of late detected DDH or surgery. The studies included in this review largely used experienced clinical hip examiners and experienced ultrasonographers, with well developed protocols for screening and treatment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-03-15 03:25:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A large trial of ultrasound screening versus clinical screening, either at birth or during infant health checks, is required to determine whether the benefits and costs of early detection and treatment of DDH using ultrasound is superior to clinical examination alone. For the trial to detect a clinically important difference in functional outcomes, in excess of 100,000 infants are likely to be needed to be enrolled.
