<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-03-27 13:49:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>This review found no firm evidence that drug management of agitation and aggression in adults with acquired brain injury is effective. There was weak evidence, based on a few small randomized controlled trials, that beta-blockers can improve aggression after acquired brain injury, but very large doses were used which would have been likely to produce significant adverse effects. For other classes of medication, reasonable size randomized controlled trials have not been published. </P>
<P>Based on the lack of evidence, the review comes to no conclusion on the effectiveness of drugs. There is reasonable anecdotal evidence, for example in published cases series, that antipsychotics, mood stabilizers and antidepressants may be effective in the management of this situation.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Of the many psychiatric symptoms that may result from brain injury, agitation and/or aggression are often the most troublesome. It is therefore important to evaluate the efficacy of psychotropic medication used in its management.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effects of drugs for agitation and/or aggression following acquired brain injury (ABI).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and other electronic databases. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and recent reviews. In addition we handsearched the journals <I>Brain Injury</I> and the <I>Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation</I>. There were no language restrictions. The searches were last updated in June 2006.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the efficacy of drugs acting on the central nervous system for agitation and/or aggression, secondary to ABI, in participants over 10 years of age.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Studies of patients within six months after brain injury and/or in a confusional state, were distinguished from those of patients more than six months post-injury, or who were not confused.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Six RCTs were identified and included in this review. Four of theses evaluated the beta-blockers, propranolol and pindolol, one evaluated the central nervous system stimulant, methylphenidate and one evaluated amantadine, a drug normally used in parkinsonism and related disorders. The best evidence of effectiveness in the management of agitation and/or aggression following ABI was for beta-blockers. Two RCTs found propranolol to be effective (one study early and one late after injury). However, these studies used relatively small numbers, have not been replicated, used large doses, and did not use a global outcome measure or long-term follow-up. Comparing early agitation to late aggression, there was no evidence for a differential drug response. Firm evidence that carbamazepine or valproate is effective in the management of agitation and/or aggression following ABI is lacking. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Numerous drugs have been tried in the management of aggression in ABI but without firm evidence of their efficacy. It is therefore important to choose drugs with few side effects and to monitor their effect. Beta-blockers have the best evidence for efficacy and deserve more attention. The lack of evidence highlights the need for better evaluations of drugs for this important problem.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-05-14 14:16:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Psychological and psychiatric problems exceed physical problems as causes of morbidity and disability following acquired brain injury (ABI) (<LINK REF="REF-Jennett-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jennett 1981</LINK>). Of the many psychiatric symptoms that may result from ABI, agitation and aggression are often the most troublesome for carers and patients. Agitation and aggression on medical or surgical wards immediately following the injury occur in about 11% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Brooke-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooke 1992a</LINK>). They can cause disruption to the normal running of the ward and, when a patient returns home, the family may suffer considerable distress (<LINK REF="REF-Livingston-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Livingston 1985</LINK>), resulting from the difficulties of looking after somebody who may now be irritable (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomsen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomsen 1984</LINK>), and occasionally violent (<LINK REF="REF-Lezak-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lezak 1978</LINK>). There is good evidence that patients with a head injury have an increased risk of aggression and agitation. For example when compared with patients with multiple trauma but without head injury, three times as many head injured patients showed significant aggression during the first 6 months post injury as did the control group (33.7% versus 11.5%) (<LINK REF="REF-Tateno-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tateno 2003</LINK>). And problems with aggression continue for many years in a proportion of cases. For example a quarter of patients at follow-up six, 24 and 60 months after discharge from an in-patient rehabilitation unit displayed aggressive behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Baguley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baguley 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In light of this it is surprising that clinicians are yet to agree on definitions of agitation and aggression (<LINK REF="REF-Sandel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandel 1996</LINK>). A variety of terms are used to refer to agitation and aggression and often the two terms are treated as interchangeable. Although the concept of agitation and aggression are closely intertwined it is useful, both theoretically and practically, to draw a distinction between them.</P>
<P>Agitation, defined as disturbed behaviour as a result of overactivity, occurs frequently in the acute phase of recovery, where it is usually related to post-traumatic amnesia (PTA). Post-traumatic amnesia is a transient period characterised by disorientation, confusion and cognitive impairment. As improvements in cognition tend to precede improvements in agitated behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Corrigan-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corrigan 1988</LINK>), environmental intervention rather than drug therapy is often the preferred means of managing agitation in the acute phase. Medication that adversely affects cognitive function may exacerbate the problem. However, people suffering from agitation related to PTA are generally, certainly in the UK, still on acute surgical or medical wards that are least able to offer environmental interventions. On the other hand, aggression in the later stages of recovery, which may be more responsive to pharmacological treatment, tends to occur when the patient is in a rehabilitation unit, by which time environmental manipulation is more realistic.</P>
<P>The definition of aggression encompasses both verbal and physical aggression against self, objects and other people (<LINK REF="REF-Yudofsky-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yudofsky 1986</LINK>). It may also include severe irritability, violent, hostile, or assaultative behaviour and "episodic dyscontrol". A distinction is often made between instrumental and goal directed aggression and hostile and/or explosive aggression (<LINK REF="REF-Bushman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bushman 2001</LINK>). It is the latter type that is generally observed after brain injury, usually during the later stages of recovery, when the patient is no longer suffering from PTA and has regained cognitive awareness (<LINK REF="REF-Silver-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silver 1994</LINK>). Although a distinction can be made between types of aggression there is no empirical evidence, to the authors' knowledge, that they differ in their pharmacological response.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-05-14 14:16:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Rationale for drug treatment of agitation and aggression </HEADING>
<P>Various classes of medications have been used to treat agitation and aggression following ABI (<LINK REF="REF-Fugate-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fugate 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glenn-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glenn 1991</LINK>) these include:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>antipsychotics, including haloperidol;</LI>
<LI>benzodiazepines;</LI>
<LI>anticonvulsants particularly carbamazepine;</LI>
<LI>buspirone (a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic);</LI>
<LI>antidepressants including trycyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and trazodone;</LI>
<LI>amantadine;</LI>
<LI>beta-blockers;</LI>
<LI>lithium.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The rationale for the use of the various psychotropics in the management of agitation and/or aggression is poorly defined. Often medication is used to sedate the patient, rather than to treat a specific mental illness or organic brain syndrome, which may be causing the aggressive behaviour.</P>
<P>Antipsychotics (synonymous with major tranquillisers or neuroleptics) are commonly used to manage aggression. In the short term they may be used to quieten disturbed patients whatever the underlying psychopathology. However, the only well established long-term indication is the management of schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsch-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsch 1973</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients with ABI are likely to be at risk of sub-clinical epileptic activity (<LINK REF="STD-Schiff-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Schiff 1982</LINK>) which has been proposed as a cause of aggression (<LINK REF="REF-Pincus-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pincus 1991</LINK>). In patients without ABI carbamazepine has been found to reduce aggression (<LINK REF="REF-Cowdry-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cowdry 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foster-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 1989</LINK>), which could be related to its anticonvulsant or mood stabilising effects.</P>
<P>Depression and anxiety may cause irritability and aggravate aggressive behaviour. In this case sedative antidepressants might be expected to help. Mood stabilisers, such as lithium, could also work. A further rationale for the use of antidepressants is the observation that metabolites of noradrenaline and serotonin have been found to be reduced in cerebrospinal fluid from agitated patients with ABI (<LINK REF="REF-van-Woerkom-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Woerkom 1977</LINK>). Most antidepressants potentiate noradrenaline and/or serotonin in the brain. Lithium potentiates serotonin pathways as does buspirone, an anxiolytic.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse consequences of drug treatment</HEADING>
<P>There are many potential problems associated with prescribing psychotropic medication in people with ABI. Perhaps the most important is that sedating medications can cause confusion and may, therefore, exacerbate agitation occurring during the confusional state of PTA.</P>
<P>Patients with brain injury may be particularly vulnerable to developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Heird-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heird 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lu-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vincent-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 1986</LINK>). Another side effect of neuroleptics is akathisia, which may increase agitation. Benzodiazepines may occasionally cause an increase in aggressive behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-French-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gardos-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardos 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gardner-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner 1985</LINK>). Recent concerns about the possible increased risk of stroke in older patients taking atypical antipsychotics also need to be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Herrmann-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herrmann 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is some evidence from human studies that anticonvulsants can have adverse effects on cognitive function when prescribed to prevent post-traumatic seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Dikmen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dikmen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1994</LINK>). Furthermore, studies in animals have demonstrated the potential for neuroleptics (<LINK REF="REF-Feeney-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feeney 1982</LINK>), benzodiazepines (<LINK REF="REF-Schallert-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schallert 1986</LINK>), and anticonvulsants (<LINK REF="REF-Brailowsky-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brailowsky 1986</LINK>) to impair recovery from brain injury. Yet these potentially harmful drugs are being prescribed to the majority of patients admitted to hospital after head injury (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1995</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-05-14 14:15:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Given the possible harmful effects of treating agitation and aggression with drugs it is important to evaluate the evidence that psychotropic drugs are effective in managing agitation and aggression following ABI.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the evidence that psychotropic medication is effective for the management of agitation and/or aggression in patients with ABI. We have also looked at evidence for unwanted side effects of medication to enable us to determine whether unwanted effects out weigh beneficial effects. All psychotropic medication was included in the review. </P>
<P>As there is no good evidence for a differential drug response for agitation, as opposed to aggression, this review considered any form of agitation or aggression secondary to brain injury. To enable a study of differential treatment effects, papers were classified according to the type of agitation and/or aggression and the stage of recovery.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>The review identified studies of patients suffering from acquired brain injuries that were single incidents, that is, not progressive, and were acquired in adult life. Therefore, it included anoxic brain injury, encephalitis and other forms of brain injury. Non-progressive brain injury due to alcohol or other drug abuse were also included. Cerebrovascular events (stroke) were excluded. </P>
<P>Agitated and/or aggressive behaviour must have been described as a presenting symptom although a formal diagnosis of organic personality syndrome with recurrent outbursts of aggression or rage (<LINK REF="REF-DSM_x002d_IV-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">DSM-IV 1995</LINK>, personality change due to a general medical condition, F07.0; aggressive type) was not required.</P>
<P>Agitation and/or aggression must have been measured using an explicit measurement tool that allowed a quantitative score of agitation and/or aggression.</P>
<P>Aggression against property or others, whether physical or verbal, was included. Aggression, which was only sexual or only against the self, was not included. Shouting behaviour that was not threatening was not included.</P>
<P>Age at injury greater than 10 years (to exclude patients usually classified as suffering from learning disabilities or mental impairment). </P>
<P>Studies in which the major problem was post-traumatic epilepsy were excluded. </P>
<P>There was no restriction on time between injury and treatment, severity of injury or setting of study. </P>
<P>Patients were classified according to the stage of recovery following the brain injury. We have attempted to distinguish agitation and/or aggression occurring earlier, during the confusional state, from aggressive behaviour occurring later. To do this we classified papers according to whether the patient was in a confused state, and/or Rancho level IV, and/or described as being in PTA, as opposed to patients who were no longer confused. In the absence of adequate information in the paper for this assignment to be made we classified papers according to cohorts less than six months and greater than six months post-injury.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Schneider-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 1999</LINK>: amantadine: 1<BR/>This study tested the hypothesis that amantadine would decrease agitation and improve cognitive functioning in patients with TBI using a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. The six-week trial was divided into two-week blocks of amantadine/placebo, withdrawal, placebo/amantadine. Patients were randomly allocated to one of the two treatment orders. Amantadine was gradually increased to a maximum dose of 150mg twice daily.</P>
<P>The 10 patients were aged 19 to 56 years (mean age 31 years) and had suffered a closed head injury. The majority had an initial Glasgow coma scale score (GCS) of below nine and all showed impairments in attention/concentration. No data were provided on the time between injury and treatment. However, the patients were described as being in an acute brain injury unit and as a large increase in orientation over the six-week trial was observed, it is likely the injury to treatment interval was less than six months.</P>
<P>Outcome measures consisted of the neurobehavioural rating scale (NRS) and standard neuropsychological tests of attention, orientation, memory, executive/flexibility and behaviour. These tests were administered at pre-trial and at two-week intervals.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Brooke-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Brooke 1992b</LINK>: propranolol: 1<BR/>This is a study of 21 subjects with severe TBI (GCS score below eight), in a combined trauma and rehabilitation centre over an 18 month period, whose main problems were agitation. The subjects were randomly assigned to a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of propranolol, beginning with 60mg a day and increasing to a maximum of 420mg. No details were given regarding the time post-injury. The study lasted eight weeks.</P>
<P>Episodes of agitation were measured using the overt aggression scale (OAS) which rates the type and severity of the episode.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Greendyke-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Greendyke 1986a</LINK> : propranolol: 2<BR/>A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of propranolol to a dose of 520mg a day (maximum recommended dose in BNF is 320mg/day). Active and placebo periods were of 11 weeks duration with a cross-over period in between (the total study period was 25 weeks). Nine patients completed the study, of whom eight had ABI (age range 27 to 75 years; mean age 51 years). The participants were 1 to 30 years post-injury. It seems very likely that seven or eight of these patients are the same as those in the <LINK REF="STD-Greendyke-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Greendyke 1986b</LINK> study.</P>
<P>Patients were rated with the nurses observational scale for inpatient evaluation (NOSIE). During the trial all regular psychotropic medication was stopped apart from paraldehyde and phenobarbital as required (the same being true for the <LINK REF="STD-Greendyke-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Greendyke 1986b</LINK> study).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Greendyke-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Greendyke 1986b</LINK> : pindolol: 2<BR/>This study was a randomised controlled trial of pindolol (up to 60mg per day), using a cross-over design. The treatment and placebo periods were of only two weeks. The authors appear to have used many of the same participants as an earlier study (<LINK REF="STD-Greendyke-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Greendyke 1986a</LINK>) looking at propranolol (see above).</P>
<P>The study authors give no information about the assessment scale used to rate the behaviours. They also state that the treatment order was randomly determined for each patient group rather than each individual. It is not clear what they are referring to in this statement. Ten of the 11 patients had ABI and were all were described as "severely demented". The mean age range was 28 to 76 years, the mean age being 54 years.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Greendyke-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Greendyke 1989</LINK>: pindolol: 9<BR/>The first part of this study evaluated the efficacy of pindolol in managing verbal and physical aggression in 13 (10 ABI), brain-damaged male patients using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. In the first part of the study (21 weeks) patients were randomly allocated to either group A (pindolol) or group B (placebo). At week 10, there was a six week cross-over interval where pindolol was tapered down for group A and introduced for group B. At week 21 patients entered the second phase of the study. The objective of this phase was to determine whether pindolol would ameliorate problematic behaviours (not necessarily agitation/aggression) which were preventing the patients from being placed at a lower level of care. In this phase pindolol was re-introduced for those on the placebo and all of the patients were maintained on the drug for a further 12 weeks.</P>
<P>The 10 patients with ABI were aged 38 to 72 years (mean age 60.3 years). No data were given on the time between injury and treatment although the sample was described as a group of "chronically hospitalised" patients, suggesting the interval between injury and treatment was greater than six months. Entry criteria for the study required patients to be presenting with behavioural problems that prevented them being placed at a lower level of care. In phase one of the study all psychotropic medication was discontinued. Supplementary medication included phenobarbital and paraldehyde as required.</P>
<P>A variety of outcome measures were administered pre-trial, at cross-over and post-trial including: geriatric interpersonal evaluation scale (GIES), nurses observation scale for inpatient evaluation (NOSIE) and Sandoz Clinical Assessment-Geriatric (SCAG). Incidence of agitation and/or aggression were recorded in the nursing log and quantified using the overt aggression scale (OAS).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review has highlighted the lack of high quality evaluations of medication for the management of agitation and/or aggression in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI). This may reflect the difficulties of carrying out research in this area. Reasons for this may be that staff are understandably not tolerant of aggression and fear entry into a trial will delay treatment, the patients are not usually in a position to give informed consent, symptoms of agitation and aggression fluctuate spontaneously, the population of patients with ABI are very heterogeneous and there are many other factors that will influence outcome apart from medication.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the sensitivity of patients with ABI to adverse side effects, particularly confusion which is likely to make the agitation and/or aggression worse, means that it is important that medications are prescribed on the basis of good evidence.</P>
<P>Of the six studies identified, the best quality evidence, although still somewhat limited, is for beta-blockers (<LINK REF="STD-Brooke-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Brooke 1992b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greendyke-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Greendyke 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greendyke-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Greendyke 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greendyke-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Greendyke 1989</LINK>). Propranolol has been found to be effective in two randomised controlled trials (RCTs); one looking at agitation in the weeks following injury and the other at aggressive behaviour months and years after injury (<LINK REF="STD-Brooke-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Brooke 1992b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greendyke-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Greendyke 1986a</LINK>). However, these studies used relatively small and heterogeneous samples of patients. Two of the three studies from the same research group appeared to have used largely the same cohort. Further, large doses of beta-blockers were used; many clinicians would be wary of using such large doses, particularly for treating a symptom which is not a standard indication for the drug and in a situation where the patient may not be in a position to give informed consent. However, several of the excluded studies using lower levels of evidence, lend support to the value of beta-blockers.</P>
<P>Methylphenidate is no longer available in the UK for routine prescription. The evidence in favour of psychostimulants is poor and must be weighed against the real risks of adverse mental side effects, particularly in a population of patients who are often vulnerable to drug abuse.</P>
<P>In a number of studies, the improvement seen on medication was observed within two to six weeks of starting medication. This occurred in both early and late post-injury cohorts and regardless of whether the symptom was agitation or aggression. The improvement was maintained over the treatment period, but in one RCT the placebo group also improved, though more slowly, so that by seven weeks there was no difference in agitation between the two groups (<LINK REF="STD-Brooke-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Brooke 1992b</LINK>). This observation that improvements on medication occur within weeks of starting medication is consistent with clinical practice. Patients often report early gains on a new drug to treat agitation and/or aggression, but several months later, despite having remained on the medication, levels of agitation and/or aggression deteriorated to baseline levels. </P>
<P>There was little evidence of a differential drug effect on agitation as opposed to aggression. Beta-blockers were found to be useful for both agitation (<LINK REF="STD-Brooke-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Brooke 1992b</LINK>) and aggression (<LINK REF="STD-Greendyke-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Greendyke 1986a</LINK>) whether occurring early or late post-injury. </P>
<P>Overall, the research in this area is characterised by studies using low levels of evidence. These are descriptive case reports that provide data that cannot be easily evaluated and therefore are of little value. Firstly, it is usually impossible to evaluate whether the patient did in fact respond to the medication. Secondly, even if the patients did respond, one cannot be sure that they did so at the expense of other unreported cases, who did not respond, or even got worse. Systematically collected case series at least begin to get round this second difficulty, though they are still exposed to publication bias. </P>
<P>In summary, this review has highlighted the need for quality research evaluating the efficacy of drugs used in the management of agitation and/or aggression in patients who have suffered an ABI. A further limitation of the work that has been published is the little attention paid to the potential for harm, and the effects of medication on the functional outcome of patients, especially in the longer term.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Numerous drugs have been tried in the management of agitation and/or aggression in acquired brain injury (ABI) but without firm evidence of their efficacy. It is therefore important to choose drugs with few side effects and to constantly monitor, in the individual, the evidence that the medication is helping.</P>
<P>Beta-blockers have the best evidence to support their efficacy and deserve more attention. However, if they are going to be used, it should be done with caution and preferably with the informed consent of the patient.</P>
<P>Carbamazepine is often the drug of choice yet hard evidence that it is effective is completely lacking. Nevertheless, in our clinical experience carbamazepine seems to be well tolerated and is generally without adverse mental/neurological side effects. Valproate may be an alternative treatment, though at present there is little evidence to support its use.</P>
<P>The evidence suggests that drug effects on agitation and aggression are seen early, within two to six weeks of starting medication. This would suggest that if no benefit is observed by the end of six weeks, then the drug should be tailed off and another one tried after a suitable interval. </P>
<P>There is no evidence that the drug response of agitation early after brain injury is different from that of later aggression. There is evidence that both respond to propranolol.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Better research evaluations of drugs for the management of agitation and/or aggression in ABI are required. </P>
<P>Given the lack of evidence for any drug or class of drugs being effective, this review suggests that RCTs are appropriate, given the current state of clinical information. Research clinicians are justified in arguing that they have no prior reason to believe that one drug treatment is better than another or that one drug treatment is better than placebo.</P>
<P>We would encourage the clinician to use a specific protocol with all patients, using whichever drug the individual clinician considers appropriate. If this were done consistently on every consecutive patient then useful information would rapidly be acquired.</P>
<P>Case reports should not be published unless there is evidence that the authors have systematically included in their series all patients treated with the drug. More attention should be paid to N-of-1 research methods. These have the advantage of being relevant to the individual patient as well as being able to provide evidence about overall efficacy across subjects (if they are collected systematically). N-of-1 methods are particularly suitable for rehabilitation, because of the chronicity of symptoms.</P>
<P>Care must be taken in looking at other drug effects. Patients with aggressive behaviour are often placed on cocktails of medication. It may be the removal of a noxious drug when a new drug is started that is the therapeutic event. Or the drug under study may in fact be working by raising levels of another, active, drug already being prescribed.</P>
