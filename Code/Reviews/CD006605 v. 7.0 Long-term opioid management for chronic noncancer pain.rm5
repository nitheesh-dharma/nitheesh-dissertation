Twenty five of the studies were case series or uncontrolled long-term trial continuations, the other was an RCT comparing two opioids. Opioids were administered orally (number of study treatments groups [abbreviated as "k"] = 12, n = 3040), transdermally (k = 5, n = 1628), or intrathecally (k = 10, n = 231). Many participants discontinued due to adverse effects (oral: 22.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 15.3% to 32.8%]; transdermal: 12.1% [95% CI: 4.9% to 27.0%]; intrathecal: 8.9% [95% CI: 4.0% to 26.1%]); or insufficient pain relief (oral: 10.3% [95% CI: 7.6% to 13.9%]; intrathecal: 7.6% [95% CI: 3.7% to 14.8%]; transdermal: 5.8% [95% CI: 4.2% to 7.9%]). Signs of opioid addiction were reported in 0.27% of participants in the studies that reported that outcome. All three modes of administration were associated with clinically significant reductions in pain, but the amount of pain relief varied among studies. Findings regarding quality of life and functional status were inconclusive due to an insufficient quantity of evidence for oral administration studies and inconclusive statistical findings for transdermal and intrathecal administration studies.<BR/></P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-04-17 16:52:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jessica Thomas"><P>Many patients discontinue long-term opioid therapy (especially oral opioids) due to adverse events or insufficient pain relief; however, weak evidence suggests that patients who are able to continue opioids long-term experience clinically significant pain relief. Whether quality of life or functioning improves is inconclusive. Many minor adverse events (like nausea and headache) occurred, but serious adverse events, including iatrogenic opioid addiction, were rare.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2009-09-29 13:01:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-09-28 17:33:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This systematic review differs in several ways from a previous systematic review on this topic that our group performed (<LINK REF="REF-Noble-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noble 2008</LINK>). Because reviews in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> have fewer restrictions on the size of the review than a traditional peer-reviewed article, we were able to include the outcomes health-related quality of life and functional status in this review. The evidence base changed, with the inclusion of newly published studies (<LINK REF="STD-Collado-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Collado 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pascual-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pascual 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rauck-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rauck 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaladi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shaladi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thorne-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Thorne 2008</LINK>) and non-English-language studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bettoni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bettoni 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klapetek-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Klapetek 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pimenta-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pimenta 1998</LINK>), one study that we have reclassified as prospective (<LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2001</LINK>), and one study that was not identified in our earlier searches (<LINK REF="STD-Thimineur-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thimineur 2004</LINK>). In addition, two studies that were included in our previous review were excluded in this review, because we recently found that they were actually retrospective studies through personal communications with the study authors (<LINK REF="STD-Kanoff-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kanoff 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tutak-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Tutak 1996</LINK>). However, the differences in the studies that met general inclusion criteria did not impact the conclusions of the review in any important way. In addition, we updated our methodology to reflect more current methods by reducing the minimum number of studies needed to perform a meta-regression from 10 to five, implementing an updated quality-assessment approach using a revised instrument, not excluding studies with particularly low scores, and using each of the instrument items as a covariate to investigate heterogeneity where appropriate.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Chronic noncancer pain</HEADING><P>The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defines chronic pain as "pain which persists past the normal time of healing," which is considered to be pain lasting for three months or longer (<LINK REF="REF-IASP-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">IASP 1986</LINK>). Chronic pain is a common problem worldwide. A World Health Organization survey of primary care patients seeking care at 15 centers in 14 countries across Asia, Africa, Europe, South America, and North America found that 22% of primary care patients reported pain lasting longer than 6 months (<LINK REF="REF-Gureje-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gureje 1998</LINK>). A systematic review of four international studies conducted in developed countries found prevalence rates of any type and severity level of chronic pain ranging from 10.5% to 55.2% of the population (<LINK REF="REF-Harstall-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harstall 2003</LINK>). The Pain in Europe survey of 46,000 individuals showed that one in five people suffer from chronic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Breivik-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breivik 2006</LINK>). In this survey, chronic pain sufferers reported 7 years of chronic pain on average, with some reporting pain lasting more than 20 years (<LINK REF="REF-Breivik-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breivik 2006</LINK>). An estimated 9% of Americans (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2002</LINK>) and 19% of Europeans (<LINK REF="REF-Breivik-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breivik 2006</LINK>) have moderate to severe chronic noncancer pain (CNCP). Women are more likely than men to experience chronic pain, and the overall prevalence of chronic pain increases with age (<LINK REF="REF-Ballantyne-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballantyne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blyth-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blyth 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Breivik-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breivik 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elliott-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliott 1999</LINK>). Although CNCP usually does not arise from an etiology that is inherently life-threatening, suicide rates are elevated among individuals with chronic pain, especially when there is a sense of hopelessness about the pain (<LINK REF="REF-Fishbain-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishbain 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2006</LINK>). One study found that completed suicide was associated with higher pain severity (<LINK REF="REF-Kikuchi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kikuchi 2008</LINK>). Suicide rates for people with chronic pain remain higher even when mental illness has been accounted for (<LINK REF="REF-Ratcliffe-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ratcliffe 2008</LINK>).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="2">Opioids for chronic noncancer pain</HEADING><P>Opioids are a class of drugs that relieve pain by binding to and blocking certain receptors located in the brain and spinal cord. Although opioid use for acute pain, postsurgical pain, and palliative care is accepted in the United States. and many other countries, there is debate about whether opioids are appropriate for the treatment of CNCP. The efficacy of opioids for CNCP has been demonstrated in short-term trials (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2006</LINK>), including those for neuropathic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 2005</LINK>), but little is known about whether these agents continue to be effective over the longer durations of treatment typical for CNCP. Concerns have also been raised about adverse effects that may arise with long-term use, including the development of psychologic addiction or abuse, or both.</P><P>Exactly how many people take opioids long-term for CNCP, and just what they are taking, has not been definitively defined. Chronic opioid use (for at least 6 months) has been estimated at 0.65% of a U.S.-insured population (<LINK REF="REF-Cicero-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicero 2009</LINK>), and regular or continuous use has been estimated at 0.27% of Dutch epidemiologic survey respondents (<LINK REF="REF-Eriksen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksen 2006</LINK>). An analysis of insurance database claims in the U.S. found that 10% of people who were prescribed opioids had at least a 3-month supply (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2008</LINK>), and the Dutch epidemiologic survey found that 12% of people with pain due to causes other than cancer reported they take opioids "regularly or continuously." In the studies by <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Eriksen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksen 2006</LINK>, most people were prescribed weak opioids; in <LINK REF="REF-Cicero-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicero 2009</LINK> the opposite was true. In all three studies only a minority of patients were prescribed extended-release opioids.</P></SUBSECTION></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-09-01 14:10:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the evidence pertaining to the efficacy and safety of long-term opioid therapy for CNCP.

Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. We assessed the risk of bias in included studies using a 10-question internal validity assessment instrument developed by methodologists at ECRI Institute for the assessment of case series using domains identified as important factors by experts in the field (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AHRQ-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRQ 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2003</LINK>). To evaluate long-term, open-label case series that were continuation studies of short-term RCTs, we consulted the original publication of the RCT whenever necessary (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' for original citations).</P><P>We assessed internal validity separately for each outcome using the instrument shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, with the exception of adverse events, for which no internal validity assessment was conducted. Affirmative answers were scored +1, negative answers were scored -1, and answers "not reported" scored zero. Scores were normalized by adding the component question scores, adding 10, and dividing that sum by five. Scores of at least 7.5 were considered "moderate," and scores below 7.5 were considered "low." Given the inherent limitations of case series, we adjusted this scale so that no case series could be considered "high" in internal validity. We used the median internal validity score of the studies for each outcome to describe the overall evidence-base quality. The overall quality of a body of evidence (for example, the median internal validity score of all studies addressing a particular outcome) influences the strength of qualitative conclusions and stability of quantitative conclusions drawn from it (<LINK REF="REF-Treadwell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treadwell 2006</LINK>).</P><P>We modified the scale to assess the internal validity of a study on the whole rather than by outcome and time point to complete the <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK> tables of this review. We assessed the comparability of participants at baseline and follow-up for studies where continuous outcomes (e.g., quality-of-life scales) were reported only; for binary outcomes (e.g., proportion who discontinued) we always used the baseline number of participants as the denominator, factoring out attrition and making this item moot. We omitted the items regarding outcome objectivity (because the outcomes were universally subjective, so the answer is always "no") and standardization of instruments (because we required that the instrument be standard to meet inclusion criteria, so the answer is always "yes"). For studies that administered opioids using an automated implantable infusion pump, we always answered the item regarding compliance as yes.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING><P>Two review authors (MN, CA) independently extracted data from English-language articles.

Combined results with I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 50% were considered substantially heterogenous.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect and data synthesis (meta-analysis)</HEADING><P>We analyzed the available evidence using systematic <I>a priori</I> protocols, which are described as follows (and described in further detail in <LINK REF="REF-Treadwell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treadwell 2006</LINK>). We summarized data using meta-analysis when at least two studies per mode of opioid administration addressed a particular outcome of interest. These protocols were used to attempt to formulate both qualitative (the direction of a treatment effect) and quantitative (the magnitude of a treatment effect) conclusions. We used random-effects meta-analyses to pool data (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>).</P><P>For dichotomous data (for example, proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in pain), event rates (risk) were calculated. For continuous data (e.g., changes in visual analogue scale [VAS] pain scores from baseline), standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated. A correlation coefficient of 0.50 between pre and post data was assumed for all continuous outcomes (this value was altered in sensitivity analyses). For the calculation of proportions of patients who had a certain outcome, when no events or no non-events occurred, the conventional correction factor of 0.5 was added to the number of events or non-events (numerator) and the total number of participants (denominator). Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for all summary data.</P><P>Statistically significant changes may not always be large enough to be clinically meaningful. The <I>minimum</I> amount of change in pain score that we considered to be clinically meaningful was a 2-point change on a scale of 0 to 10 (or, 20 percentage points), based on findings in trials studying general chronic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Farrar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrar 2000</LINK>), chronic musculoskeletal pain (<LINK REF="REF-Salaffi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salaffi 2004</LINK>), and chronic low-back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Hagg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagg 2003</LINK>), which were commonly cited causes of pain among the participants enrolled in the studies included in the evidence base of this report. We also calculated the proportions of participants who attained at least 50% pain relief (that is, a 50% reduction from their baseline scores), which is generally accepted as being clinically significant.</P><P>The SMD enables pooling of data on the same outcome from different metrics (e.g., different pain scales or different quality-of-life measurement instruments) into a single statistic. However, interpreting the SMD can be difficult. When data were combined from studies that used different instruments and the summary effect size could not be interpreted in terms of the original metric, to facilitate interpretation we: (1) considered whether all studies comprising the evidence base showed statistically and/or clinically significant changes when considered individually; and (2) considered the general guidelines in <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1988</LINK>. Wherever possible we prefer to consider the outcome in terms of the original metric, but because different studies used different scales to measure the same outcome, this was not always possible in this review, and Cohen's guidelines enable some interpretation of the resulting summary effect size. Cohen's guidelines suggest that an SMD value of 0.2 is small, 0.5 is medium, and 0.8 is large; however, these guidelines are intended to represent between-studies effect sizes, not pre-post effect sizes. We stress that in the context of this report they are only intended to give a general sense of the size of change observed when considering the data in terms of the original metric is not possible and should not be used to draw firm conclusions regarding the overall effect size magnitude.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING><P>If means and standard deviations were not available for continuous data, we attempted to determine an estimate of treatment effect from reported statistics (e.g., t-values, F-values, P-values) (as described in <LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1994</LINK>). However, where measures of variance were not reported, exact statistics were not reported either. In these instances, we excluded the study for the outcome(s) for which reporting was incomplete.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING><P>We divided the evidence base by mode of drug administration (i.e. oral, transdermal, intrathecal) to reduce clinical heterogeneity.

We investigated duration of treatment as a covariate whenever heterogeneity was detected, given our suspicion that length of treatment would be of particular importance (although we acknowledge that having only a small number of studies limits the power to detect an effect). Additional covariates were investigated when at least five studies comprised the evidence base and depended on data available for studies in the evidence bases of the different outcomes. They included publication date, sample size, predominant cause of pain, opioid dose, opioid administered, and quality assessment items. For oral opioids, we also investigated weak compared with strong opioids. (This was not necessary for intrathecal and transdermal opioids because they were all strong). P-values of meta-regressions were investigated using a permutation test, to avoid Type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2004</LINK>). We did not explore possible sources of heterogeneity other than the duration of treatment when fewer than five studies per outcome were identified.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING><P>We performed sensitivity analyses on evidence bases comprised of at least three studies. Evidence bases consisting of only one or two studies were considered to inherently lack robustness.

For cumulative meta-analyses, we considered the evidence base for continuous outcomes robust if the point estimate did not change by more than one level of clinical significance (e.g., 20 percentage points for pain). When analyzing the proportion of participants with a particular outcome, we considered the evidence base to be robust if the point estimate did not change by more than 10 percentage points with the addition of the most recent two studies.</P><P>Because our data came from case series, we performed two additional sensitivity analyses for continuous outcomes for which conclusions were drawn. Assumptions about the assumed correlation coefficient (0.5) of pre and post data were tested by varying the correlation coefficient from -0.99 to 0.99, in the method of Thiessen Philbrook and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Thiessen-Philbrook-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thiessen Philbrook 2007</LINK>).</P><P>If more than 15% attrition occurred at follow-up for continuous outcomes (pain, quality of life, and function), we inflated the standard deviations of baseline scores by 100% and deflated them by 50% to test whether changing the baseline participant characteristics would overturn the conclusion, as the participants remaining long-term may differ in important ways from the participants who dropped out. We used these methods to evaluate the evidence base for quantitative robustness (i.e., stability of the summary effect estimate), continuous/categorical outcomes, and qualitative robustness (i.e., consistency as to whether opioids show a benefit of any magnitude).</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING><P>For analyses without substantial heterogeneity (I² &lt; 50%) and at least 10 studies, we planned to use the "trim and fill" method to test for funnel plot asymmetry, which suggests missing studies, possibly due to publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Duval-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duval 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duval-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duval 2000b</LINK>).

Reasons for low internal validity ratings varied by study, but included failure to describe participant recruitment methods; failure to compare the characteristics of participants who completed the study to participants who did not in studies with attrition; high prevalence of use of ancillary/adjuvant treatments; and use of funding from a source with a potential conflict of interest in the outcome. In oral and transdermal administration studies compliance was generally not reported. The risk of bias is probably highest for the continuous outcomes (e.g., pain relief, quality of life) and lowest for the outcomes on discontinuation from clinical study and adverse events. This is primarily because the high attrition rates affect both the risk of bias and the generalizability of the results from the continuous data outcomes. The reasoning for this is that only data from completer analyses were available at long-term follow-up, though this should not affect the dichotomous data because all enrolled participants are reflected in those data sets. Although participants had long-term pain before enrolling in studies, regression to the mean remains possible. We attempted to minimize selection bias by requiring prospective studies, but this may still be a threat, particularly to open-label continuations of RCTs.<BR/></P></STUDY_QUALITY><INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-09-29 13:01:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The first outcome we present is adverse events, because many clinicians and patients are particularly concerned about the harms associated with opioids. We then present an assessment of discontinuation rates for the two most common reasons cited for leaving a study (adverse events and insufficient pain relief) before analyzing effectiveness outcomes. The rate of discontinuation from a clinical study represents the number of participants who discontinued participation in the study. The rate does not necessarily capture the rate of discontinuation of opioids. Participants may continue opioids under different protocols, change opioids, or change mode of administration. Likewise, participants who discontinued participating in trials that administered opioids using an implantable infusion pump did not necessarily have their pumps removed. Follow-up data on participants who discontinued participating in the studies were not reported. In the one study that tracked satisfied departures, 87% of enrollees who discontinued participation left as satisfied departures, and at 48 months, 92% of enrollees were either still in the study or had a satisfied departure (<LINK REF="STD-Mystakidou-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mystakidou 2003</LINK>). The findings of this study suggest that high attrition is not necessarily synonymous with high rates of treatment failure.</P><P>For the four studies that were open-label extensions of RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Caldwell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Caldwell 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harati-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Harati 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McIlwain-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwain 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roth-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 2000</LINK>), we considered baseline data from the original RCTs. For discontinuation outcomes, we used the total number of participants who enrolled in the denominator, and the participants who discontinued from the drug groups (but not placebo during the RCT, although these participants could later discontinue opioids during the open-label continuation) in the numerator. We also used the baseline pain scores from the beginning of the RCT rather than the beginning of the open-label continuation to more accurately capture pre-post data instead of maintenance data.<BR/></P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events (side effects)</HEADING><P>The variability in thresholds for reporting adverse events, failure to report whether certain adverse events occurred in some studies, and inconsistent reporting or use of definitions of events/effects precluded our ability to pool data in meta-analyses to determine rates. Absence of long-term nonopioid control groups precluded determination of relative rates of adverse events.</P><P>The most commonly reported adverse events included gastrointestinal effects (i.e., constipation, nausea, dyspepsia), headache, fatigue/lethargy/somnolence, and urinary complications (i.e., retention, hesitancy, ''disturbance''). In at least one study, participants were proactively treated for common opioid side effects, such as nausea (<LINK REF="STD-Collado-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Collado 2008</LINK>). Studies for each of the modes of administration reported that adverse events/effects diminished over time (<LINK REF="STD-Bettoni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bettoni 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mystakidou-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mystakidou 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pascual-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pascual 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roth-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zenz-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Zenz 1992</LINK>). Most of the adverse events were minor. However, a few serious events were reported, including sedation (<LINK REF="STD-Fredheim-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fredheim 2006</LINK>), hypoventilation/bradypnea (<LINK REF="STD-Milligan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milligan 2001</LINK>), hallucinations (<LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2001</LINK>), and abdominal pain (<LINK REF="STD-Rauck-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rauck 2008</LINK>).</P><P>There is much concern among patients and their families as well as clinicians that addiction may develop during long-term opioid therapy. Of the 27 treatment groups, 18 specifically stated that participants were screened for a history of substance addiction or abuse before study enrollment (the remaining nine studies did not report whether participants with addiction/abuse histories were excluded). Six studies specifically stated that no cases of addiction were observed, and 18 studies did not report whether addiction was observed. Two studies did report possible cases of opioid addiction. In one prospective registry study in which participants were pre-screened for addiction and abuse, six (3%) appeared to meet criteria for opioid abuse and/or addiction as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) (<LINK REF="STD-Portenoy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Portenoy 2007</LINK>). In the other study, one (3%) case of drug-seeking behavior was reported in a pre-screened population (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>). Among the studies where addiction or addiction and abuse rates are specifically reported, the total event rate is 0.27% (7/2613). If we assume that there were in fact no cases of addiction among the studies that did not report whether addiction occurred (as it seems likely that such an important adverse event would be reported if it were observed), then the rate is 0.14% (7/4884). Only one study reported on abuse separately from addiction (<LINK REF="STD-Milligan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milligan 2001</LINK>), and reported signs of abuse in three participants. Most of the studies pre-screened participants for abuse histories and all administered opioids under ongoing medical supervision, therefore, these rates should not be generalized to an unselected population or to individuals taking opioids without appropriate medical supervision.</P><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Oral administration</HEADING><P>Adverse event data were collected from 12 case series that examined the impact of oral opioids with a total of 2445 participants who began long-term oral opioids. Two of the studies reported a total of 10 deaths. Eight participants in one study died within one year of beginning oral opioids for reasons that were not reported, suggesting that these deaths were not opoid-related. The study authors reported that no serious opioid-related adverse events occurred (<LINK REF="STD-Zenz-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Zenz 1992</LINK>).

Another study reported that two participants discontinued treatment due to dermatitis, but it is unclear whether the events were related to the site of application (<LINK REF="STD-Collado-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Collado 2008</LINK>). One study reported nine deaths, of which one, due to severe bronchopneumonia, was considered possibly attributable to transdermal opioids (<LINK REF="STD-Milligan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milligan 2001</LINK>). The authors did not believe that the other eight deaths were opioid-related.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Intrathecal administration</HEADING><P>Adverse events were extracted from 10 studies on intrathecal opioid administration that enrolled a total of 228 participants. Adverse events unique to the intrathecal mode of administration included pump and catheter malfunctions and malpositioning, surgical complications, and postsurgical complications. The percentage of participants whose device complications required reoperation was high in some studies, such as 27% in <LINK REF="STD-Hassenbusch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hassenbusch 1995</LINK>, 25% in <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2001</LINK>, and 20% in <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>. The studies with the highest reoperation rates were older. It is unclear whether this might be due to use of older models of infusion pumps and accessories or less extensive surgeon experience with the pumps available at the time. Two studies reported a total of six deaths. In one study, the deaths were due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 1), pericolonic abscess (n = 1), and myocardial infarction (n = 1) (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>).

However, heterogeneity remained substantial when the source of funding that was known was controlled for (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 96.4%), indicating unresolved differences among the studies. In addition, only two studies did not clearly have a funding source with a potential conflict of interest in the findings (e.g., drug company).

When this factor is controlled for, heterogeneity remains significant (90.5%), so additional causes of heterogeneity remain important. We subdivided the evidence base and considered the rate for each opioid type. The rate for weak opioids was 11.4% (95% CI: 7.0% to 18.1%), and the rate for strong opioids was 34.1% (95% CI: 29.2% to 39.3%).

In the RCTs, a total of 755 participants were enrolled, and 376 (50%) continued treatment in the open-label extension. In the nonrandomized study, 126 participants were enrolled in the titration phase, and 94 (75%) entered the maintenance phase after one week. The studies assessed the use of tramadol for neuropathic pain due to diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Harati-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Harati 2000</LINK>), extended-release oxymorphone for osteoarthritis pain (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwain-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwain 2005</LINK>), extended-release oxycodone for osteoarthritis pain (<LINK REF="STD-Roth-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 2000</LINK>), and extended-release oxymorphone for osteoarthritis or back pain (<LINK REF="STD-Rauck-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rauck 2008</LINK>). Each of the studies used a different scale to assess pain severity: 0 to 3 Likert scale (<LINK REF="STD-Roth-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 2000</LINK>); a 0 to 4 Likert scale (<LINK REF="STD-Harati-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Harati 2000</LINK>); a 0 to 11 NRS (<LINK REF="STD-Rauck-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rauck 2008</LINK>), and a 0 to 100 VAS (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwain-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwain 2005</LINK>). Use of the SMD allowed these studies to be combined in a meta-analysis; however, the variation among instruments precludes translation of the pooled estimate into a single original metric.</P><P>We pooled data at 6 to 7.5 months to promote comparability of the data, because this was the only duration of follow-up for which all three studies reported data. (Data at up to 12 months is reported in <LINK REF="STD-McIlwain-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwain 2005</LINK>, and data at up to 18 months is reported in <LINK REF="STD-Roth-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 2000</LINK>). At this time point, a total of only 273 participants, or 58% of those who began the long-term extension or maintenance phase, remained. Because the attrition rate is so high, the participants are likely highly selected, and the data may be biased. It is possible that individuals with the poorest treatment response discontinued participating in the studies, in which case the pooled SMD would not represent the average treatment effect of all participants who began the study. Rather, it would represent the average treatment effect of those who were able to continue on oral opioids in the context of the studies for about six months. For those participants remaining in the studies at 6 months, the pooled SMD is 1.55 (95% CI: 0.85 to 2.25) (P &lt; 0.001). Interpretation of the average amount of pain relief this represents in the original metric to attempt to determine whether the effect size is indeed large enough to be clinically significant is not possible, because three different pain scales were used. However, this SMD would be considered to represent a medium to large treatment effect between independent groups. More importantly, considered in isolation, each study suggests a clinically important reduction in pain from baseline.</P><P>Although all four studies reported significant reductions in pain among completers, they varied with respect to just how much pain reduction was achieved. The differences in these findings is measured as substantially heterogenous (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 93.9%), and upon sensitivity analysis, this evidence base lacks quantitative robustness. Because only four studies comprise the evidence base, the source of this heterogeneity cannot be investigated, under our protocol. Because of the unexplained heterogeneity and lack of quantitative robustness, we believe the summary estimate may not accurately represent the average amount of pain relief among people able to continue opioids for about six months. Because of the high rate of attrition, it is not likely to capture the average amount of pain relief of all participants. However, because all four studies consistently show at least a moderate reduction in pain from baseline, and because this qualitative conclusion was robust to all sensitivity analyses, we conclude that pain relief that appears to be clinically important is achieved long-term for patients able to remain on oral opioids for six months. The strength of the evidence supporting this conclusion is weak.

However, because there are only two studies currently available and because there is heterogeneity that cannot be explored due to the small size of the evidence base (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 97.8%), the evidence base is currently too unstable to confidently draw conclusions regarding the average amount of pain relief patients who begin transdermal fentanyl might expect.

Most studies administered morphine alone or with an adjuvant, but three prescribed alternative opioids where deemed appropriate (<LINK REF="STD-Hassenbusch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hassenbusch 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mironer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mironer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thimineur-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Thimineur 2004</LINK>). Most of the studies reported outcome data on an intention-to-treat basis. Duration of treatment ranged widely, from 6 months to a mean of 29 months. Data for more compatible intermediate time points were not available.</P><P>We combined data at each studies' longest duration of follow-up with the intent of using meta-regression to determine whether duration of treatment is associated with reported pain scores. Only one study reported this outcome in terms of a NRS on a scale of 0 to 10 (<LINK REF="STD-Hassenbusch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hassenbusch 1995</LINK>), the rest reported the outcome in terms on VAS on a scale of 0 to 10. For both the NRS and the VAS, higher scores indicated greater pain. At longest follow-up time, 201 (91%) participants remained to contribute data to this outcome. At baseline, the studies had a pooled score of 8.70 (95% CI: 8.37 to 9.04), indicating severe pain. At longest duration of treatment, the pooled score was 4.45 (95% CI: 3.44 to 5.47), indicating moderate pain. Calculated with a correlation coefficient of 0.5, the SMD was 2.01 (95% CI: 1.37 to 2.66). These data are shown in <LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>. Importantly, when considered in isolation, each study shows clinically significant mean reductions in pain among the participants remaining in the study for long-term follow-up.</P><P>Although the studies consistently showed significant pain relief when considered individually, analysis revealed substantial heterogeneity in the amount of pain relief among the studies (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 87.1%). We performed multiple univariate meta-regressions to explore the heterogeneity. We investigated each of the items of the internal validity instrument, but none of these items were found to be significantly associated with the outcome. We also investigated year of publication, sample size, drug administered (morphine, morphine with adjuvant, or other), predominant cause of pain, and duration of treatment (follow-up). Predominant cause of pain was the only factor significantly associated with the SMD (P = 0.01). As a robustness test, we repeated the regression using three other meta-regression models (i.e., fixed-effect, method of moments, unrestricted maximum likelihood), which consistently showed significant findings. Failed back surgery syndrome (k = 5) was associated with the least amount of pain relief, unspecified (k = 2) and neuropathic pain (k = 1) were associated with more pain relief, and osteoporotic vertebral fractures (k = 1) were associated with the most pain relief. However, the fact that few studies were available for three of the four causes of pain undermines the stability of this finding. In addition, previous work in this area that used different inclusion criteria did not detect a relationship (<LINK REF="REF-ECRI-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ECRI 2008</LINK>). For these reasons the finding should be regarded with skepticism. When the model was replicated, heterogeneity remained substantial (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 82.4%). Because a substantial portion of the heterogeneity remains unexplained, we have not drawn a quantitative conclusion regarding the amount of pain relief that patients beginning intrathecal opioids should expect. However, these data consistently show that participants experienced clinically significant pain relief with long-term administration of opioids by an implantable infusion pump, and although supported by weak evidence, this finding is robust.</P></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="5">Proportion of patients with at least 50% pain relief</HEADING><P>Seven studies that enrolled a total of 151 participants were included for this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Angel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Angel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hassenbusch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hassenbusch 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mironer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mironer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaladi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shaladi 2007</LINK>). Duration of follow-up ranged from 6 months (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mironer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mironer 2001</LINK>) to a mean of 29 months (<LINK REF="STD-Hassenbusch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hassenbusch 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar 2001</LINK>). The summarized proportion of participants who had at least a 50% reduction in pain was 44.5% (95% CI: 27.2% to 63.2%), which is shown in <LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK>. This estimate was substantially heterogenous (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 71.7%). We investigated the heterogeneity using study protocol factors and individual internal validity assessment responses. Size of enrollment sample, predominant cause of pain, drug(s) administered, and duration of treatment were not associated with the proportion of participants with at least 50% pain relief. However, year of study publication was, with more recently published studies showing larger proportions of participants with at least 50% pain relief (P = 0.02). This finding was consistent when other meta-regression models were used (fixed-effect, method of moments, and unrestricted maximum likelihood). Whether more recent therapy is truly related to improved outcomes is unclear; a relationship between year of study publication and average pain relief was not detected in the previous outcome. When the model was corrected for publication year, heterogeneity was reduced but remained substantial (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 52.2%). One of the internal validity assessment items, whether the study was prospective or not, also had significant findings. Although prospective study design was an inclusion criterion for this assessment, for two of the studies it was unclear whether they were prospectively designed (<LINK REF="STD-Angel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Angel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaladi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shaladi 2007</LINK>). These two studies had higher proportions of participants with at least 50% pain relief on average. Substantial heterogeneity remained despite correction of the model for this factor (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 64.9%). When we dropped them and repeated the meta-analysis, the point estimate was lower but the results were not significantly different (event rate 35.5%; 95% CI: 22.4% to 51.2%) and heterogeneity remained substantial (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 58.8%). Due to the remaining unexplained heterogeneity, the exact proportion of participants who have at least 50% pain relief from intrathecal opioids cannot be accurately determined; however, it can be concluded that some patients do have this amount of pain relief.</P></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of life</HEADING><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Oral administration</HEADING><P>One study that administered oral morphine to participants with low-back pain reported a change in quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Allan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Allan 2005</LINK>).

(Longer-term data are available for <LINK REF="STD-Mystakidou-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mystakidou 2003</LINK>, but we used their data at 12 months to promote comparability with the other two studies). Because a large portion of the participants dropped out, the findings from this assessment should be considered relevant only to participants who remain in treatment for a year, as participants who discontinued treatment before then may differ in important ways. One study showed minimal change on both the mental and physical subscales (<LINK REF="STD-Milligan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Milligan 2001</LINK>), one showed a large amount of improvement on both subscales (<LINK REF="STD-Mystakidou-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mystakidou 2003</LINK>), and one showed minimal improvement on the mental subscale but very large improvement on the physical subscale (<LINK REF="STD-Allan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Allan 2005</LINK>).</P><P>When combined in meta-analysis, heterogeneity was therefore substantial for both the mental subscale (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 99.0%) and physical subscale (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 99.1%), and could not be explored due to the small size of the evidence base. The pooled mental subscale SMD had inconclusive findings due to the lower limit of the 95% CI (SMD 0.78: 95% CI: -0.06 to 1.63), as shown in <LINK REF="FIG-14" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 14</LINK>. Because of this inconclusive statistical finding and the unexplained heterogeneity, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the association between long-term administration of transdermal fentanyl and mental quality of life. The pooled physical subscale did show a large improvement from baseline, with a SMD of 4.46 (95% CI: 1.23 to 7.68); however, the effect size varied considerably between studies, as shown in <LINK REF="FIG-15" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 15</LINK>. Although this statistical finding precludes the accurate estimation of how much of an improvement in physical quality of life patients who remain on transdermal fentanyl may experience, these findings suggest that they do experience an improvement.

As no data are provided on these participants after they dropped out of the studies, it is impossible to say whether they continued opioid therapy under different protocols. For participants able to continue opioids in the studies, evidence (albeit weak) suggests that, for all analyzed modes of administration, their pain scores were lower on average than before therapy began, and that this relief could be maintained long-term (&gt; 6 months). However, data describing long-term safety and efficacy of opioids for CNCP are limited in terms of quantity and quality. An evidence base consisting of low-quality studies provides only weak evidence from which to draw qualitative conclusions and only low-stability evidence from which to draw quantitative conclusions. Some of the quantitative estimates were not robust, meaning that an estimate of the treatment effect size cannot be accurately estimated with the currently available evidence, and the estimates may therefore be unstable and should be interpreted cautiously. The low internal validity ratings indicate that the evidence supporting our conclusions is highly subject to change, and that the likelihood is high that findings of future studies may overturn these conclusions. Furthermore, there may be a particular risk of publication bias in uncontrolled case-series studies, as journals may be less likely to accept studies of this design, investigators may be less likely to submit them for publication (given the lesser financial investment in conducting them), and no clinical trial registry for uncontrolled studies is currently in widespread use. The small size of the evidence base for each mode of administration prevented us from using the trim-and-fill method of identifying potentially missing studies.</P><P>Among outcomes for which qualitative conclusions were possible, unexplained heterogeneity limited the number of quantitative conclusions we could make. We postulated that at least some of the heterogeneity might be explained by differences in duration of treatment; however, meta-regression did not support this possibility for any outcome. For discontinuation from the study due to adverse events or insufficient pain relief, this may be because most people who discontinue participation in opioids studies do so within the first six months. For pain, this may be because optimum pain relief is achieved within six months and longer durations of treatments serve to maintain the effect, or it may be because participants with the most treatment-resistant pain discontinue participating in the study early on. Alternatively, the evidence bases may simply have been underpowered to detect a relationship between duration of treatment and the outcomes. Investigation of heterogeneity for efficacy outcomes for oral and transdermal opioids was not possible due to the small size of the evidence bases. Investigation was possible for intrathecally-administered opioids, and potential relationships between proportion of participants with clinically significant pain relief (&gt; 50%) and year of publication and prospective study design, and between average pain relief and predominant cause of pain in the study, were identified. However, these relationships do not seem stable. The only convincing covariate we identified was a lower rate of discontinuation due to adverse events from clinical study in studies that administered oral weak opioids compared with studies that administered strong oral opioids.</P><P>The high attrition rates in some of the studies call into question whether the participants reporting continuous outcomes are representative of the patient population originally enrolled in those studies, and whether as a result, this attrition is a threat to internal or external validity. For oral opioids in particular, findings on amount of pain relief or change in quality of life strictly pertain to the participants remaining at longer durations of treatment, and do not necessarily indicate the average treatment effect for all patients who begin oral opioids. We found no studies that thoroughly attempted to identify prognostic factors for drop out. Measuring the proportion of participants who had clinically significant pain relief circumvented the problem of attrition, because individuals who dropped out of the study were assumed to be treatment failures.</P><P>Considering data from case series may be warranted in certain situations, including when a long duration of follow-up is needed that an RCT cannot provide, when the technology appears promising and waiting for RCTs is unacceptable, and when a policy decision must be made in the absence of RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Dalziel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalziel 2005</LINK>). Case series are generally considered a lower level of evidence for measuring the impact of an intervention than controlled trials, because without a control group, there is no empirical estimate of what the patients&#8217; outcomes might have been if they had <I>not</I> been treated. Control groups are essential when patients' future outcomes are highly uncertain. However, if the natural history of a disease is stable, substantive improvement would not be expected without the intervention in question. Also, we postulate that individuals who have failed multiple previous treatments may be less susceptible to placebo effects than the general population. As patients prescribed long-term opioids have had pain long-term, and have typically experienced failure of more conservative treatment options (e.g., simple analgesics, physical therapy), many have had a lack of success with surgery (e.g., patients with failed back surgery syndrome). Also, some research suggests that placebo effects in pain research are not large (<LINK REF="REF-Hrobjartsson-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hrobjartsson 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hrobjartsson-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hrobjartsson 2004b</LINK>). We therefore believe it is justifiable to consider evidence from case series for this patient population. However, the fact that we considered data from uncontrolled case series should be kept in mind when considering the studies' results; influences from regression to the mean and selection bias cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, case series data cannot be extrapolated to draw conclusions regarding comparative effectiveness.</P></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-09-29 12:48:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-09-01 15:30:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Most of the participants in these studies had back pain, often following failed back surgery, osteoarthritis, or neuropathic pain. These findings should not be generalized to patients with chronic pain of other types, such as headache. Concern that an individual with CNCP may develop dependence on the drug during long-term administration represents a potential barrier to treatment. However, the rate of observed signs of opioid addiction was extremely low in the body of evidence considered in this review (0.27%, conservatively). This rate would be 0.14% if no addictive behaviors occurred among the studies that did not mention addiction rates at all. Only three participants were reported as having potential abuse problems. These numbers do not support the contention that potential iatrogenic opioid addiction should limit therapy for well-selected and well-supervised patients. Because most studies screened out potential participants with histories of substance abuse or addiction, the rates of addiction reported in these studies are only generalizable to patients without a history of addictive/abusive behaviors. This finding is consistent with that of another review article on opioid abuse and addiction that calculated an abuse/addiction rate of 0.19% in studies that prescreened chronic pain patients for long-term opioid use or addiction/abuse history, and 3.27% in all studies (<LINK REF="REF-Fishbain-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishbain 2008</LINK>). Given the complexity of definitively diagnosing opioid addiction (see <LINK REF="REF-Ballantyne-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballantyne 2006</LINK>) and in the interest of capturing the overall effect of opioid therapy on quality of life, we sought to analyze health-related quality-of-life outcomes in this review. However, findings on quality of life were inconclusive for all modes of administration.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-09-29 12:48:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The Mayday Fund (<A HREF="http://www.maydayfund.org">www.maydayfund.org</A>), a foundation sponsoring pain treatment research, asked ECRI Institute to review issues including the efficacy and safety of opioids for noncancer pain in 2004. The Milbank Memorial Fund (<A HREF="http://www.milbank.org">www.milbank.org</A>) invited an international group of pain researchers to help formulate key questions. Representatives from these organizations and additional pain researchers critiqued the review and made recommendations for future research. Allowing rescue opioids (with the amount and frequency of dosage as an outcome) in placebo or nonopioid groups may circumvent ethical problems of withholding treatment from individuals with CNCP in long-term RCTs. Protocols should specify uniform diagnostic and data collection criteria (e.g., pain etiology, drugs prescribed, dosing regimens) and mimic clinical practice (e.g., drug combinations could be used, drug changes could be made, drug dosage could be titrated slowly and adjusted, adverse effects could be aggressively managed). Reasons for discontinuation, including satisfied departures, must be documented. Long-term poorly-understood effects, including androgen deficiency and changes in immune function, must be documented. However, practical/pragmatic RCTs might be cost prohibitive (<LINK REF="REF-Tunis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tunis 2003</LINK>). Adequately powered, well-designed prospective cohort studies could provide useful information (<LINK REF="REF-Geborek-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geborek 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mamdani-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mamdani 2002</LINK>). Long-term dose-dependent efficacy and adverse effects could be researched in existing databases (e.g., European Medicines Evaluation Agency, FDA, Australia Therapeutic Goods Administration). Studies on U.S. Veterans Healthcare Administration data are examples of retrospective analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Hermos-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermos 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahowald-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahowald 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reid-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ytterberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ytterberg 1998</LINK>).</P><P>Despite the identification of 26 treatment groups with 4768 participants, the evidence regarding the effectiveness of long-term opioid therapy in CNCP is too sparse to draw firm conclusions, including quantity of mean of pain relief. Poor reporting reduced the amount of acceptable data. Studies should always report data needed for meta-analysis (mean, standard deviation, number of participants, or data to calculate them), and authors of studies for which these data were not originally published should consider making them publicly available. Studies should also use validated scales, report intention-to-treat data in addition to completer analyses, and conduct post-hoc analyses to identify prognostic factors for treatment success.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2009-11-03 19:41:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We thank Jeffrey Lerner, PhD, of ECRI Institute for overseeing the original project from inception to completion.

spinal surgery It left me with scar tissue I also suffer from various bulging discs that touch the nerves in the lumber thoracic and cervical regions This causes severe pain unbearable pain at times I was prescribed Mat 60 mg twice a day Rising to 120mg twice a day plus Oramorph I was then able to get out Do my own shopping Do the type of things people take for granted In trying to reduce the Mst I quickly found out that the pain this caused prevented me from leading any kind of normal life I have never experienced any kind of craving for any drug and if it didn't have pain I could happily give up any kind of Morphine or pain relief There is no high in taking Morphine for pain Your present policy is going to kill people like me We can't live with the level of pain so will commit suicide You

for submitting your comments and we are sorry to hear of your chronic pain condition. It is experiences such as yours that make us determined to help. You will have read that we state in the abstract: &#8220;weak evidence suggests that patients who are able to continue opioids long-term experience clinically significant pain relief&#8221;. Cochrane reviews are not policy but seek to summarise the available evidence which we did at the time. &#8220;Weak evidence&#8221; just describes the quality of the evidence that we found at that time, and speaks to our confidence about the claims made about the value (efficacy and safety) of any medicine. We are aware that the review is now quite old and so are actively considering updating it or removing it from the library.</P><P>Best wishes,</P><P>Phil
