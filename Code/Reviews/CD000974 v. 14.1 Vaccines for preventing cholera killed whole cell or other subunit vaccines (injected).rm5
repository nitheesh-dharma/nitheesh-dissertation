<P>Cholera is an acute gastroenteritis caused by <I>Vibrio cholerae</I>. Infection causes profuse watery diarrhoea, and up to 40% of patients die if untreated. Cholera was a major cause of death in many countries in the past; epidemics are now less common, but cholera remains an important cause of death in developing countries, especially in Africa.</P>
<P>Vaccination against cholera was first tested in the nineteenth century and may play a role in controlling epidemics. Injected (parenteral) whole cell vaccines were used in the 1960s and 1970s, but they went out of favour as their efficacy was thought to be low and short-lived, and associated with a high rate of adverse effects. This review summarizes the evidence for effectiveness of injected cholera vaccines. A separate Cochrane Review describes trials with oral cholera vaccines, which were introduced more recently and are used currently.</P>
<P>Sixteen trials, involving over one million adults, children, and infants, were included. Injected cholera vaccines reduced the risk of death from cholera and the risk of contracting cholera at 12 months. Significant protection lasted for two years. Injected cholera vaccines had more systemic and local adverse effects than placebo, but these adverse effects were relatively well tolerated and were not severe or life-threatening.</P>
<P>The authors conclude that injected cholera vaccines appear to be relatively safe and more effective than usually realized. However, they are not currently available and therefore cannot be recommended for use. This review provides a solid background of evidence for the effects of cholera injected vaccines, against which to compare the effects of oral vaccines.</P>

<P>Sixteen trials, involving over one million adults, children and infants, fulfilled the inclusion criteria.

Compared to placebo, vaccinees had a reduced risk of death from cholera (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.93; 837,442 participants) and a reduced risk of contracting cholera at 12 months (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.65, random-effects model; 1,512,573 participants). This translates to an efficacy of 48%, 95% confidence interval 35% to 58%. Significant protection lasted for two years, even after only a single dose, and for three years with an annual booster. Children over five years and adults were protected for up to three years, while children under five years were protected for up to a year.

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-13 18:36:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-13 16:40:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cholera is an acute infection that causes sudden onset of profuse watery diarrhoea, and up to 40% of patients die if untreated. Cholera was a major cause of death in many countries in the past, although epidemics are now less common. Nevertheless, cholera remains an important cause of death in developing countries. In 2005, there were a total of 131,943 reported cases of cholera throughout the world, including 2272 deaths (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006a</LINK>), and it is known that there were many more cases that were not reported. Ninety-five per cent of reported cases were in Africa. Cholera can lead to serious outbreaks: in 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed 49 different outbreaks in 36 countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cholera is caused by the Gram-negative bacillus <I>Vibrio cholerae.</I> There are over a hundred serological groups of <I>V. cholerae</I>, each with varying potential to cause disease. Until recently only one of these (<I>V. cholerae </I>01) caused epidemic cholera. In 1992 to 1993, an epidemic of cholera originating in the Indian subcontinent was found to be caused by <I>V. cholerae</I> 0139, also called 0139 Bengal. Cholera strains are also classified by their biotype (Classical or El Tor), and within the biotype, the serotype (Ogawa or Inaba). Serotype differences are based on differences in structure of the lipopolysaccharide membrane. The various serological groups are important as each vaccine component tends to be specific to particular groups of <I>V. cholerae</I>.</P>
<P>Transmission of <I>V. cholerae</I> occurs predominantly when people ingest faecal contaminated water or food. The disease spreads rapidly where there is poverty, poor hygiene, and lack of sanitation. Waterborne spread can be responsible for devastating epidemics such as that which occurred due to El Tor cholera in the refugee camps of Goma, Zaire in July 1994. This resulted in 70,000 cases and 12,000 deaths (<LINK REF="REF-S_x00e1_nchez-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sánchez 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>V. cholerae</I> colonize the gut using small hair like structures ("pili") that attach to the small bowel. High stomach pH and blood group O appear to make colonization more likely. The attached bacteria then release a soluble toxin, which results in the symptoms of the disease. This toxin is composed of two subunits, A and B. The A subunit stimulates cellular mechanisms in the bowel cells that disrupt sodium transport. The net result is a high sodium chloride (salt) concentration in the gut lumen, which holds on to water by osmotic forces, leading to profuse watery diarrhoea, severe dehydration, and eventually death. The B subunit of cholera toxin does not cause toxic effects but does stimulate an immune response from the host. Colonization can be inhibited by specific antibodies which are generated after infection with <I>V. cholerae</I>.</P>
<P>Intravenous rehydration therapy can be very effective in treatment of cholera. However, health services in cholera endemic or epidemic areas often do not have sufficient capabilities for such treatment. Improving hygienic practices in areas of poverty and limited water supply can also be problematic. This has led to attempts to prevent cholera by vaccination. The first vaccine effectively used against cholera was probably that of Ferran, who in 1884 apparently successfully controlled an epidemic in Spain. A vaccine was also produced by the Pasteur Institute in the 1920s.</P>
<P>Widespread use of cholera vaccines began in the 1960s when there was a series of large trials in what was then known as East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), India, and the Philippines. Most of the vaccines used in these trials were composed of whole <I>V. cholerae </I>serogroup 01 cells, usually a mixture of biotypes and serotypes, which were killed by either formalin, phenol, or heat. There were also trials of cholera toxoid vaccines in the 1970s. The killed whole cell vaccines, which were subsequently licensed, are injected and usually given in one or two doses.</P>
<P>Injected (parenteral) whole cell vaccines grew in popularity until the 1970s when they went out of favour (<LINK REF="REF-Bhadra-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhadra 1994</LINK>) on the grounds that efficacy was thought to be low and short-lived, high titres of serum vibriocidal antibodies were thought not to provide sufficient intestinal immunity to prevent infection, and they were said to have a high rate of adverse effects. The advent of oral rehydration therapy, considered a highly effective treatment, was a major advance in reducing cholera morbidity, and led to a shift in interest away from injected vaccines. Even when injected cholera vaccines were in relatively widespread use in the early 1970s, it was never determined whether an individual's protection was likely to interrupt transmission to others in the community, or how important enteral or parenteral immunity is in bacterial shedding.</P>
<P>Recent cholera epidemics have shown that there still a requirement for an effective vaccine against this major disease (<LINK REF="REF-S_x00e1_nchez-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sánchez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Calain-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006b</LINK>). Oral vaccines have been under development since the 1980s, stimulated by the increasing recognition of the importance of stimulating local intestinal immunity in the prevention of the disease. Both killed and live oral vaccines are now licensed, but the injected vaccine is no longer used.</P>
<P>The original version of this review included both injected and oral cholera vaccines (<LINK REF="REF-Graves-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graves 2001</LINK>),<B> </B>but this is now superseded and withdrawn. The current review assesses the results of trials with killed parenteral (injected) vaccines only. A separate Cochrane Review describes trials with oral cholera vaccines (<LINK REF="REF-Abba-_x0028_in-progress_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abba (in progress)</LINK>).</P>

<P>We attempted to identify all relevant trials regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press, and in progress).</P>
<P>We searched the following databases using the search terms and strategy described in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (1 September 2008); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2008, Issue 3); MEDLINE (1966 to 1 September 2008); EMBASE (1974 to 1 September 2008); and LILACS (1982 to 1 September 2008).</P>
<P>We searched the bibliographies of included studies.

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2009-03-09 15:19:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>PG and JD independently extracted and double-checked the following data: characteristics of participants (number, age, gender, ethnic group, risk category, and previous immunization status, if known); characteristics of interventions (vaccine type, placebo type, dose, immunization schedule, and length of follow up (in months); outcome measures; and trial date, location, sponsor, and publication status. All disagreements in the data extraction were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>Adverse effect data were extracted individually for each adverse effect where possible. For trials where adverse effects were reported for more than one dose, the average of the number of people reporting each adverse effect for each dose was recorded. Where trials reported the occurrence of adverse effects over time following a single dose, the effects occurring in the first time period (typically 24 hours) were recorded if the total number of people reporting each effect in the complete follow-up period was not given.</P>
<P>We extracted incidence of cholera cases and death over particular time periods of follow up (eg first year following vaccination, second year etc) to determine the duration of protection.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-03-09 15:19:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>PG and JD independently<B> </B>assessed each trial's method of treatment allocation (random, quasi-random, sequential, not stated), blinding (double, single, or not blind), completeness (percentage of randomized participants completing the immunization schedule and the follow-up period), and the surveillance procedure used to detect cases.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2009-05-02 13:28:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall risk ratio (RR) was used to report the relative rates of cholera cases in vaccinated and placebo groups. This figure was converted to vaccine efficacy using the formula: % vaccine efficacy = (1-RR) x 100%.</P>
<P>Overall risk ratio was also used for adverse effect rates and other outcomes.</P>
<P>We anticipated between-trial variation in estimates of vaccine efficacy as there are several sources of heterogeneity which cannot be standardized. For example, the studies included in this review have been undertaken in a range of countries, each of which has a different pattern of exposure to the cholera pathogens. There are also major differences in the formulation of the vaccines.</P>
<P>To account for these differences in the analysis where significant heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.1) was encountered between the study results, we have incorporated it into the analysis by reporting the results of the analysis using the random-effects model, presented in the results section as a letter R following a result. Elsewhere we have reported the results of analyses using the fixed-effect model.</P>
<P>It was defined a priori that subgroup analyses would be done for different age groups (under and over five years), and over time.</P>
<P>We split trials that included several active arms receiving separate vaccines into individual references (denoted as i, ii, iii, etc). As each active arm is compared to the same placebo group it is important that the analysis does not count the participants and cases in the placebo group more than once. This was prevented by dividing the placebo cases and participants as evenly as possible between the arms. The validity of this approach was confirmed in a second analysis in which the active arms within each trial were added together before the trials were pooled. This gave identical results in analyses using a fixed-effect model, and very similar, but slightly less conservative, results when using a random-effects model.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trial sites</HEADING>
<P>The trials were conducted starting in 1963 and continuing until the late 1970s. Most were large and required massive programs to undertake the logistics of vaccination and surveillance. Several series of large trials (a total of several hundred thousand people in each site) were conducted in four sites in endemic areas: the Matlab study area of East Pakistan (later Bangladesh); Calcutta, India; Negros Occidental province, Philippines; and Surabaya, Indonesia. One smaller trial (998 participants) was conducted in the former USSR (<LINK REF="STD-Burgasov-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Burgasov 1976</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Some of these trials (usually the first one in each series) investigated safety and immunogenicity. Most trials included clinical outcomes detected during massive population surveillance operations. All trials observed incidence of natural infection by cholera. The trial conducted in the former USSR investigated only safety and immunogenicity (<LINK REF="STD-Burgasov-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Burgasov 1976</LINK>). In terms of this review's outcome measures, 24 comparisons reported on vaccine efficacy (cholera cases and/or deaths) and 11 comparisons considered adverse effects. Nine reported on both types of outcome. <LINK REF="STD-Benenson-1968a" TYPE="STUDY">Benenson 1968a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Burgasov-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Burgasov 1976</LINK> provided data on adverse effects only.</P>

<P>The methodological quality of the efficacy trials was relatively high, considering their age.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Method of treatment allocation</HEADING>
<P>Nine trials with 16 comparisons stated that the allocation method was randomization although only one trial mentioned a particular method (Latin Square (<LINK REF="STD-Azurin-1965i" TYPE="STUDY">Azurin 1965i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Azurin-1965ii" TYPE="STUDY">Azurin 1965ii</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Azurin-1965iii" TYPE="STUDY">Azurin 1965iii</LINK>)). The other five trials (eight comparisons) used a sequential method such as alternate census number (<LINK REF="STD-Curlin-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Curlin 1975</LINK>, all East Pakistan trials). These trials have therefore been classified as quasi-randomized controlled trials rather than randomized controlled trials, and allocation concealment is regarded as inadequate. All of the other trials mentioned some kind of coding system or identical preparation of placebo and are thus classified as adequate for allocation concealment.</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Completeness</HEADING>
<P>The major flaw in the reporting of the efficacy trials is the lack of information on the completeness (ie the percentage of randomized participants completing the immunization schedule and the follow-up period). In many trials there was a large difference between the number randomized and the number who actually participated. Some trials reported on the number completing the vaccination schedule (71% for <LINK REF="STD-Curlin-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Curlin 1975</LINK>). Most trial reports provided little information on the percentage of participants who completed even the initial period of follow up. The India, Indonesia, and Philippines trials gave no information on this aspect of the trials. The little information on follow up that can be gleaned from some of the other trials suggests that dropout was not a serious problem &#8211; for example, dropout appears to have been less than 5% by two years in <LINK REF="STD-McCormack-1969" TYPE="STUDY">McCormack 1969</LINK>, about 5% by one year in <LINK REF="STD-Mosley-1970_x002d_i" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 1970-i</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mosley-1970_x002d_ii" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 1970-ii</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Mosley-1970_x002d_iii" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 1970-iii</LINK>, and about 10% in <LINK REF="STD-Oseasohn-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Oseasohn 1965</LINK>. It is easy to appreciate that keeping track of participants in trials with many thousands of people per arm would be a problem. However, since differential dropout is a serious potential source of bias in vaccine trials, and more information on this topic (perhaps by sampling a proportion of participants) would have been reassuring.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Surveillance procedure used to detect cases</HEADING>
<P>Of the 14 efficacy trials, five used only active surveillance for cases, six used only passive, and three used both (details in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). In all but one of the five East Pakistan/Bangladesh efficacy trials, it was claimed that daily or twice-weekly surveillance was carried out at home. In India, all four trials used passive surveillance, whereby cases were not detected unless they presented for treatment or sent a postal or telephone message. The Indonesia trial also used passive surveillance. In the Philippines, one trial used active surveillance only and the other three used a combination of passive surveillance and house to house visits, although the frequency and duration of this activity is not stated.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Surveillance procedure used to detect cases</HEADING>
<P>The seven trials reporting on adverse effects were very poor in reporting the methods of surveillance (details in Appendix 2). However, since most reported on adverse events within 24 hours of vaccination, it is likely that individuals were actively assessed during that time period. In <LINK REF="STD-Burgasov-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Burgasov 1976</LINK>, home follow up continued for 30 days, although the frequency was not stated. In one trial in the Philippines where adverse effects were assessed (<LINK REF="STD-Azurin-1965iii" TYPE="STUDY">Azurin 1965iii</LINK>), passive surveillance occurred in addition to active follow up because numerous participants reported to health facilities with adverse events.</P>

<P>This comparison specifically examined the question of whether booster doses of injected vaccines improve the duration of protection. Two trials (one with two sub-trials) included booster schedules: <LINK REF="STD-McCormack-1969" TYPE="STUDY">McCormack 1969</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mosley-1970_x002d_i" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 1970-i</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mosley-1970_x002d_ii" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 1970-ii</LINK>. The <LINK REF="STD-McCormack-1969" TYPE="STUDY">McCormack 1969</LINK> trial included both non-booster and booster arms: the non-booster arm had two doses on a short schedule, while the booster arm had either one or two initial doses followed by additional doses after one and two years. <LINK REF="STD-Mosley-1970_x002d_i" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 1970-i</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mosley-1970_x002d_ii" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 1970-ii</LINK> tested Classical monovalent Ogawa (<LINK REF="STD-Mosley-1970_x002d_i" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 1970-i</LINK>) or Inaba (<LINK REF="STD-Mosley-1970_x002d_ii" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 1970-ii</LINK>) vaccines with a single initial dose followed by one booster shot at one year. In both trials the non-booster and/or placebo groups received placebo shots instead of booster doses to maintain blinding. For up to one year of follow up before the booster was given, no difference would be expected between short schedule and booster subgroups: RR 0.55 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.68, random-effects model; 1,442,164 participants) for the single-dose schedule; and RR 0.35 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.98, random-effects model; 64,208 participants<B> </B>for the booster subgroups respectively; see <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>.

There were between-trial differences in the risk ratios for other adverse effects, with one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pal-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pal 1980</LINK>) showing large (RR &gt; 1.5) increases in headache, fever, erythema, and swelling, although the averages across all trials were not statistically significant. In <LINK REF="STD-Benenson-1968a" TYPE="STUDY">Benenson 1968a</LINK>, the adverse effects were not classified beyond systemic or local;13% of participants had systemic effects (RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.10 to 4.80) and 40% had local effects (RR 3.48, 95% CI 2.14 to 5.63). One trial in the Philippines with three arms reported on trials with Classical vaccine (<LINK REF="STD-Azurin-1965i" TYPE="STUDY">Azurin 1965i</LINK>), El Tor vaccine (<LINK REF="STD-Azurin-1965ii" TYPE="STUDY">Azurin 1965ii</LINK>), and Classical vaccine with oil adjuvant (<LINK REF="STD-Azurin-1965iii" TYPE="STUDY">Azurin 1965iii</LINK>). There were serious adverse events observed in this trial when participants presented to health facilities (abscesses, ulcers, or hard masses at the site of vaccination), and it is reported that 96% of these occurred in the group who received the oil adjuvant vaccine (<LINK REF="STD-Azurin-1965iii" TYPE="STUDY">Azurin 1965iii</LINK>). It was also reported that erythema, swelling, pain, induration, fever, and a feeling of weakness were experienced by participants. Overall the percentage of persons experiencing adverse events of any type was 0.8% in those receiving Classical vaccine (<LINK REF="STD-Azurin-1965i" TYPE="STUDY">Azurin 1965i</LINK>), 1.7% in those with El Tor vaccine (<LINK REF="STD-Azurin-1965ii" TYPE="STUDY">Azurin 1965ii</LINK>), 96.1% in the Classical/oil adjuvant vaccine <LINK REF="STD-Azurin-1965iii" TYPE="STUDY">Azurin 1965iii</LINK>, and 1.4% in the placebo group.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-13 18:36:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included trials of injected cholera vaccines that had clinical outcomes (cholera cases, deaths, and adverse effects). We excluded trials with only immunological outcomes because our main questions were the efficacy and safety of injected cholera killed or subunit vaccines. The number of cases of cholera at different time periods after vaccination was our major outcome measure. We also assessed deaths (both all-cause and cholera specific) by year one of follow up, although this was investigated in few trials. Adverse effects were assessed by relatively few trials with a high variability in definition and measurement which made synthesis across different studies difficult.</P>
<P>The results of our review show that injected cholera vaccines are relatively efficacious in the first seven months. There was no evidence for a marked decline in efficacy in the second half of the first year or in year two, even without a booster dose.</P>
<P>Efficacy estimates stratified by age group (under or over five years) showed little difference in the first year. In year two, the vaccines were significantly less efficacious in children under five years than in older individuals. This difference persisted at year three when the vaccines had little effect in children aged less than five years (efficacy 20%, 95% CI -14% to 43%) but were still strongly protective in persons over five years (efficacy 57%, 95% CI 38 to 71%). By years four and five, neither age group was protected.</P>
<P>Both short vaccination schedules (single dose or two doses up to one month apart) and schedules with annual booster doses induced equivalent protection for two years in recipients. After year two, the booster schedule appeared to provide superior protection: efficacy was 9% for short schedules and 66% for booster schedules in year three and in year four the respective estimates were 7% and 39%. Our assessment of short versus booster schedules is based on a limited number of trials which included boosters (<LINK REF="STD-McCormack-1969" TYPE="STUDY">McCormack 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mosley-1970_x002d_i" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 1970-i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mosley-1970_x002d_ii" TYPE="STUDY">Mosley 1970-ii</LINK>), only one of which continued beyond three years.</P>
<P>Injected cholera vaccines reduced cholera deaths by half, but they were of marginal efficacy in preventing all-cause death.</P>
<P>Injected cholera vaccines appear to be reasonably safe and were relatively well tolerated. Injected cholera vaccines did not cause significant increase in most individual systemic adverse effects (fever, malaise, headache) compared to active placebo, although they did cause increased malaise compared to inert placebo, and increased vomiting and unspecified systemic reactions compared to active placebo.</P>
<P>Injected cholera vaccines caused an increased number of local adverse effects including erythema, tenderness, and infiltration compared to inert placebo, and unspecified local reactions when compared to active placebo.</P>
<P>Our decision not to include serological outcomes in this review is based partly on the uncertainty of the relationship between protection afforded by the vaccine and a rise in antibody titre following immunization. Previously, the mouse protection index was considered the best correlate measure (<LINK REF="REF-Joo-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joo 1974</LINK>), but since then most studies have quantified immunogenicity in terms of serum anti-toxin antibodies and/or vibriocidal antibodies, often in assays which are serotype specific (Inaba and Ogawa). Anti-toxin antibodies may protect by neutralizing cholera toxin, while vibriocidal antibodies may protect against colonization. Currently the critical protective immunity is thought to be antibacterial (vibriocidal) rather than antitoxic (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1995</LINK>). However, elevated serum vibriocidal antibodies, which may exist in persons in endemic areas, are often not further boosted by either vaccination or exposure to cholera, so rates of seroconversion may not correlate well with vaccine efficacy in these areas. Moreover, studies with serological outcomes reported results in a variety of assays using different definitions of seroconversion, making it very difficult to sum-up in a homogeneous way. Trials with clinical outcomes are the definitive method of assessing protection.</P>
<P>Historically six criticisms have been levelled at injected cholera vaccines. Firstly the protection from these vaccines is frequently stated to be below 30% at four to six months after vaccination (<LINK REF="REF-S_x00e1_nchez-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sánchez 1997</LINK>), or "modest and short lived" (<LINK REF="REF-Clemens-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clemens 1994</LINK>), or 50% to 70% with a short duration of three to six months (<LINK REF="REF-Feeley-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feeley 1978</LINK>), or not exceeding 50% to 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Joo-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joo 1974</LINK>). We concur with the estimates of the latter two authors of overall protective efficacy, since our estimate is 57% (50% to 64%) after seven months. But we do not confirm the short duration of efficacy, since our estimate is 51% (4%1 to 59%) efficacy in the first year and 47% (36% to 56%) in the second year.</P>
<P>Secondly, injected cholera vaccines were stated to give "incidence of significant local reactions in up to 30% of vaccinees" (<LINK REF="REF-S_x00e1_nchez-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sánchez 1997</LINK>) and "immunization is generally accompanied by mild fever, malaise and headache" (<LINK REF="REF-Joo-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joo 1974</LINK>). We found some basis for the former statement, but not for the latter since only up to 13% of vaccinees had systemic adverse effects. In general, injected cholera vaccines were well tolerated and the nature of the relatively minor adverse effects must be weighed against the possible severity and catastrophic impact of cholera.</P>
<P>Thirdly, protective efficacy in children aged less than five years was stated to be "below 30%" (<LINK REF="REF-S_x00e1_nchez-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sánchez 1997</LINK>) or "poor" in the same age group (<LINK REF="REF-Joo-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joo 1974</LINK>). Again the letter of these statements is not borne out by the results of our meta-analysis, as in the first year the level of protection is equivalent in under- and over-five year olds (51% and 55% in the two groups). However, protection certainly persists longer in persons aged over five years, in whom efficacy was 57% in the third year after immunization.</P>
<P>Fourthly, it was suggested that injected cholera vaccines do not reduce carriage of <I>V. cholerae</I> 01 (<LINK REF="REF-Clemens-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clemens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-S_x00e1_nchez-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sánchez 1997</LINK>). We are not able to comment on this statement as the trials reviewed to date have not addressed this issue specifically. Moreover <LINK REF="REF-Clemens-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clemens 1994</LINK> noted that the role of asymptomatic excretion of <I>V. cholerae</I> in epidemics is unclear, and consequently the public health importance of interrupting 'carrier' status is not known. Cvjetanovi&#263; 1978a and Cvjetanovi&#263; 1978b suggested that lifelong healthy carriers epidemiologically play a negligible role.</P>
<P>Fifthly, <LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1973b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1973b</LINK> thought that injected KWC vaccines have no role in controlling an epidemic, assuming an efficacy of around 50%. Although the included trials have not addressed this issue, it certainly appears likely that seeking out and vaccinating household contacts of cases (as considered by <LINK REF="REF-Sommer-1973b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommer 1973b</LINK>) would be too late to prevent infection of such secondary cases, and this is supported by one excluded trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sommer-1973a" TYPE="STUDY">Sommer 1973a</LINK>). However we believe that this does not discount the potential indirect effect that vaccinating a community would have on controlling or preventing an epidemic (<LINK REF="REF-Clemens-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clemens 1996</LINK>). Vaccine trials to date have involved individual, rather than community, randomization. The efficacy (or rather effectiveness) of a vaccine is likely to be much greater if given to a whole community rather than to dispersed individuals, if the vaccines reduced excretion of bacteria or if herd immunity was attained. This would have to be tested in trials of different design than the ones reviewed here.</P>
<P>Finally, it is asserted that injected cholera vaccines necessitate more than one inoculation to be effective. We did not find this to be the case for parenterally administered vaccines. Most of trials in our analysis used only one dose. For example, eight of the 10 trials (16 of 18 subtrials) of injected cholera vaccine analysed at seven months' follow up used a single dose, with a summary estimate of 54% efficacy. At two years, our summary estimate for these injected cholera vaccines was 39% (21% to 52%) protective efficacy in the second year of follow up; this was derived from six trials, in five of which only one dose was given. Booster doses do not provide enhanced protection until years three and four.</P>
<P>We conclude that injected cholera vaccines are generally safe and relatively effective, with a combined estimate of 57% efficacy at one year and 47% at two years. Injected cholera vaccines achieve this level of efficacy after one injection or a short schedule of two doses; extending this level of protective efficacy for up to four years requires an annual booster. Vaccines were of equivalent efficacy in children under five years as in older age groups in the first year, but protection persisted longer (up to three years) in older children and adults.</P>
<P>These data provide the background information against which to compare the efficacy of oral cholera vaccines, which are the subject of a separate Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Abba-_x0028_in-progress_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abba (in progress)</LINK>).</P>
<P>Disaggregation of study results for this review caused a considerable conceptual and logistic burden. Study reports frequently discussed more than one separate trial in the same published report, and there were multiple publications from single trials. Repetition of study results is to a certain extent inevitable in such large studies of long duration, which lend themselves to multiple publications of progress reports or partial reports of different outcomes. However, we feel that unnecessarily complicated trials, combined with multiple reporting, may have contributed to the underestimation of the extent and longevity of protection induced by injected cholera vaccines. Nevertheless it is not clear how the myth of requirement for six-monthly boosters for this type of vaccine originated, since no trial tested such a schedule, and the few trials comparing annual booster and non-booster schedules showed no advantage of booster until the third year of follow up.</P>
<P>Over one million people, including infants and children, have taken part in large, good quality efficacy trials of injected cholera vaccines over the last 35 years. The overwhelming majority of these participants have been poor residents of cholera-endemic areas. Also hundreds of researchers have devoted years of their careers to these trials. Their contributions deserve to be better recognized by thorough examination of the results of these trials. It appears that the adverse effects have been overestimated and relatively effective injected cholera vaccines have been underestimated.</P>

<P>Injected cholera vaccines are not currently available and therefore not recommended for either residents of endemic areas or travellers. The accepted wisdom is that they provide weak, partial protection of very short duration and require multiple doses. However, this meta-analysis demonstrated significant protection for populations living in endemic areas for up to two years following a single dose, and for three to four years with annual booster. Risk of death from cholera was also reduced by 50% in the first year after vaccination.</P>

<P>All cholera vaccine trials to date have been individually rather than group randomized. Research is needed on whether cholera vaccines can control epidemics if given on a population basis.</P>
<P>Results of two trials showing that alum adjuvant KWC injected vaccines were more effective in young children than older persons suggest that modern adjuvants could possibly increase the efficacy of injected KWC vaccines in this age group.</P>
<P>This review provides a solid background of evidence for effects of cholera injected vaccines against which to compare the effects of oral vaccines.</P>
