<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-08-09 11:02:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Worldwide, cancer of the womb 'endometrial cancer' is the fifth commonest cancer among women up to 65 years of age and has a higher incidence in developed countries than developing countries. For women with cancer of the womb, removal of the womb (hysterectomy) and removal of both fallopian tubes and ovaries is considered current standard treatment. Other treatments include radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Traditionally, surgery for cancer of the womb is performed through a laparotomy (open cut in abdomen).</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to compare the overall survival and disease-free survival for laparoscopic (keyhole surgery) surgery with laparotomy in women with presumed early endometrial cancer. </P>
<P>We found that laparoscopy is associated with less blood loss and earlier discharge from hospital. With regards to long term survival outcomes, treatment by keyhole surgery is comparable to open surgery (laparotomy).</P>

<P>Traditionally, surgery for endometrial cancer (hysterectomy with removal of both fallopian tubes and ovaries) is performed through laparotomy. It has been suggested that the laparoscopic approach is associated with a reduction in operative morbidity. Over the last 10 to 15 years there has been a steady increase of laparoscopy for endometrial cancer. This review investigates the evidence of benefits and harms of laparoscopic surgery compared with laparotomy for presumed early stage endometrial cancer.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-08-06 12:27:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 3, 2012, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL up to April 2012.

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-08-01 10:41:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias. Hazard ratios (HRs) were used for OS and recurrence-free survival (RFS), risk ratios (RR) for severe adverse events and the mean difference (MD) method was used for continuous outcomes in women who received laparoscopy or laparotomy and these were then pooled in random-effects meta-analyses.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-09 10:57:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight RCTs comparing laparoscopy with laparotomy for the surgical management of early stage endometrial cancer were identified.</P>
<P>All eight trials met the inclusion criteria, 3644 women were assessed at the end of the trials. Three trials assessing 359 participants with early stage endometrial cancer, found no statistically significant difference in the risk of death and disease or recurrence between women who underwent laparoscopy and those who underwent laparotomy (HR = 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.62 to 2.10) and HR = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.42 for OS and RFS respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of peri-operative death, women requiring a blood transfusion, and bladder, ureteric, bowel and vascular injury. However, a meta-analysis of two trials found that women in the laparoscopy group lost significantly less blood than those in the laparotomy group (MD = -106.82 mL, 95% CI: -141.59 to -72.06). A further meta-analysis of two trials, which assessed 2923 women and included one very large trial of over 2500 participants, found that the rate of severe post-operative adverse events was significantly lower in the laparoscopy group compared with the laparotomy group (RR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.91). The large trial did not give a breakdown of these severe post-operative adverse events into different adverse event categories. Most trials were at moderate risk of bias. Hospital stay was reported in all of the trials and results show that on average, laparoscopy was associated with a significantly shorter hospital stay.</P>

<P>This review has found evidence to support the role of laparoscopy for the management of early endometrial cancer.</P>
<P>For presumed early stage primary endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, laparoscopy is associated with similar overall and disease-free survival. Laparoscopy is associated with reduced operative morbidity and hospital stay. There is no significant difference in severe post-operative morbidity between the two modalities.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-08-01 10:44:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Endometrial cancer is a cancer of the lining of the womb and worldwide is the fifth most common cancer in women up to 65 years of age and is a common cause of death from gynaecological cancers worldwide. A woman's risk of developing endometrial cancer by age 65 years ranges from 0.46% in developing countries to 0.92% in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-GLOBOCAN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GLOBOCAN 2008</LINK>). Endometrial cancer is predominantly a disease of postmenopausal women and most cases occur in women aged 50 and older<I>.</I>The majority of patients (71%) present with stage 1 disease (<LINK REF="REF-Creasman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creasman 2006</LINK>). The overall survival in stage 1 disease is high with more than 90% of women being disease-free five years after surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Creasman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creasman 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of endometrial cancer is steadily rising and risk factors include an aging population, obesity, diabetes mellitus, nulliparity, late menopause, unopposed oestrogen intake or oestrogen-producing tumours, a history of breast cancer and the use of tamoxifen (<LINK REF="REF-Berek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berek 2010</LINK>). The prognosis depends on various factors, which include histological grading, depth of invasion into the myometrium, lymph node involvement, tumour size, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), stage of disease and treatment received, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Berek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berek 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>For patients with endometrial cancer, removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) and removal of both fallopian tubes and ovaries is considered current standard treatment; other treatments include adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Pelvic/para-aortic lymph node dissection +/- omental biopsy has been suggested for high-grade tumours, tumours with unfavourable histological types and tumours invading the myometrium (<LINK REF="REF-Eltabbakh-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eltabbakh 2002</LINK>).Traditionally, surgery for endometrial cancer is performed through a laparotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Marana-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marana 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The laparoscopic approach results in a reduction in operative morbidity, including wound infection, blood loss and ileus (obstruction of the bowel ) in overweight and elderly women (<LINK REF="REF-Eltabbakh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eltabbakh 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holub-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holub 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Obermair-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Obermair 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scribner--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scribner 2001</LINK>). In addition, it has been suggested that the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) is comparable to laparotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Eltabbakh-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eltabbakh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Obermair-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Obermair 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tozzi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tozzi 2005</LINK>)</P>
<P>The International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging in endometrial cancer is surgical and hysterectomy is required to determine the depth of myometrial invasion and cervical involvement (<LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 1989</LINK>). The FIGO staging for endometrial cancer was updated in 2009, but all studies included started recruitment prior to the introduction of FIGO (2009) staging, therefore,we used 1989 FIGO staging. In this staging sytem, the presence of cancer cells in the peritoneal washing will equate to stage IIIA disease, whilst in contrast, the presence of positive washings does not alter the updated FIGO staging (<LINK REF="REF-FIGO-Staging-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">FIGO Staging 2009</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-08-01 10:44:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The laparoscopic approach described is either laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) or total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH). LAVH is where part of the hysterectomy is performed by laparoscopic surgery and part vaginally, but the laparoscopic component of the operation does not necessarily involve division of the uterine vessels. The final removal of the uterus is completed through the vagina. TLH is where the entire operation (including suturing of the vaginal vault) is performed laparoscopically and there is no vaginal component.</P>

<P>It is not yet established whether laparoscopy is as good as, or better than, the conventional laparotomy for the treatment of endometrial cancer.

The risk of port-site metastases may be reduced by closure of the port site in layers (<LINK REF="REF-Tjalma-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tjalma 2003</LINK>) and the risk of vaginal recurrence reduced by avoiding uterine manipulation during laparoscopy.

<P>All titles and abstracts retrieved by electronic searching were downloaded to the reference management database Endnote, duplicates were removed and the remaining references were independently examined by three review authors (KG, ADF, AL). These review authors screened titles and abstracts of references identified from the search and eliminated articles that were obviously not relevant to the search question. When all review authors determined that the trial was not eligible for inclusion no further action was taken. When one or more of the review authors determined that the article may have been eligible for inclusion, the full text article was obtained. Each review author then independently determined if these trials were eligible for inclusion. Disagreements about inclusions were resolved by discussion. We sought further information from the authors when papers contained insufficient information to make a decision about eligibility. No attempt was made to blind review authors to article authors or journals.</P>

The trial of <LINK REF="STD-Zullo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zullo 2009</LINK> explicitly reported an HR with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for both survival outcomes. The <LINK REF="STD-Malzoni-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Malzoni 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tozzi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tozzi 2005</LINK> trials reported the number of women in each group who died and experienced disease recurrence and gave the exact log rank P value from the Kaplan Meier survival plots so it was possible to estimate the HR using this information (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Malzoni-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Malzoni 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mourits-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mourits 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tozzi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tozzi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walker-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zullo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zullo 2009</LINK>), peri-operative death within 30 days or six weeks was either explicitly reported or it could be deduced using the Kaplan Meier plots or other information in the text.</P>

<P>The trial of (<LINK REF="STD-Walker-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2012</LINK>) did not find any statistically significant difference in peri-operative death rate within 30 days between women in the laparoscopy and laparotomy groups (RR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.27 to 1.71).

<P>Meta-analysis of three RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Malzoni-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Malzoni 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tozzi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tozzi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zullo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zullo 2009</LINK>), assessing 313 participants, found that laparoscopy was associated with a large and statistically significant reduction in blood loss compared with laparotomy (MD = -106.82, 95% CI: -141.59 to -72.06). In addition, laparoscopy was associated with a significantly shorter hospital stay and reduced post-operative complications.</P>
<P>Three trials reported on quality of life data (QoL) using validated scales (<LINK REF="STD-Janda-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Janda 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mourits-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mourits 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zullo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zullo 2009</LINK>). During the first three years from surgery in the (<LINK REF="STD-Zullo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zullo 2009</LINK>) trial, the total Short-Form Healthy Survey (SF-36) scores were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in the laparoscopic surgery group than in the laparotomy group. At the four-year follow-up visit and at the next visits, no significant difference between groups was observed. The trial of (<LINK REF="STD-Janda-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Janda 2010</LINK>) reported early (up to four weeks) and late (up to six months) post-operative recovery, these time periods were adequate in allowing a satisfactory assessment of QoL over a longer period of time. Similarly, the (<LINK REF="STD-Mourits-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mourits 2010</LINK>) trial assessed QoL after six weeks and three months post-surgery. Patients who had laparoscopy scored significantly higher on the physical functioning sub-scale of the SF-36 at six weeks, and on the role-physical sub-scale at three months after the procedure. Patients who had laparotomy scored significantly higher on the vitality sub-scale of the mental dimension three months after surgery. No differences between groups were recorded for the other sub-scales.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-08-01 11:07:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified eight randomised controlled trials that compared laparoscopy with laparotomy in women with early stage endometrial cancer. All trials included at least 70% of women with early stage disease.</P>
<P>Overall, the quality of the evidence was moderate (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-Working-Group" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE Working Group</LINK>). Although there were eight included trials, only two reported on survival data that could be pooled in a meta-analysis using a hazard ratio. The very large trial of <LINK REF="STD-Walker-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2012</LINK> plans to report survival outcomes when women have been followed up for a longer period so the inclusion of this trial would add sufficient power to detect differences in survival that may or may not be present and would enable us to upgrade the review as providing high quality evidence.</P>
<P>While the review found no evidence of a difference between the two types of surgery in terms of overall and recurrence-free survival and QoL was incompletely reported, it does suggest that laparoscopy may be associated with significantly less post-operative complications with less estimated blood loss and a lower rate of severe post-operative complications.</P>
<P>The trial of (<LINK REF="STD-Walker-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2012</LINK>) assessed severe post-operative adverse events in 2591 women of which there was a total of 431 events (The meta-analysis, which included the (<LINK REF="STD-Janda-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Janda 2010</LINK>) and (<LINK REF="STD-Walker-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2012</LINK>) trials, assessed 2923 women and noted 473 events). There was no statistically significant difference in any of the adverse event categories, but there was a concern that the <LINK REF="STD-Walker-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2012</LINK> trial did not give a breakdown of the severe adverse events in terms of bladder, ureteric, bowel and vascular injury. If the authors of this trial had provided a breakdown then the results of the meta-analyses may well have been very different because there were a sparse number of events in each meta-analysis of the various different injuries in the smaller trials that were pooled.</P>
<P>The absence of survival data from the (<LINK REF="STD-Walker-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2012</LINK>) trial does not allow any firm conclusions to be drawn, but these data should be available sometime in the future.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-08-01 11:07:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Including the available evidence of the large <LINK REF="STD-Walker-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2012</LINK> trial does allow robust conclusions for the comparison in terms of efficacy, despite inconsistency in the survival point estimates in the smaller three trials that addressed these outcomes. There is evidence to suggest that laparoscopy is a safer method of surgery than laparotomy for women with early stage endometrial cancer, but the <LINK REF="STD-Walker-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2012</LINK> trial did not give a breakdown by adverse event category and this resulted in many of the meta-analyses of adverse events, which were included in some of the smaller trials, being insufficiently powered to detect any difference that may have been present.</P>
<P>The reporting of the methodological quality of the trials showed that most trials were at moderate risk of bias while three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fram-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fram 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tozzi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tozzi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zorlu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zorlu 2005</LINK>) were at high risk of bias as they did not satisfy any of the criteria used to assess risk of bias.</P>
<P>In the two trials that reported survival, an HR was either reported explicitly or it was possible to deduce one using the methods of <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>. An HR is the best statistic to summarise the difference in risk in two treatment groups over the duration of a trial, when there is "censoring" i.e. the time to death (or disease recurrence) is unknown for some women as they were still alive (or disease free) at the end of the trial.</P>
<P>Three trials reported on QoL data using a validated scale (<LINK REF="STD-Janda-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Janda 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mourits-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mourits 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zullo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zullo 2009</LINK>), but only the <LINK REF="STD-Zullo-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zullo 2009</LINK> trial used an adequate follow-up period of four years. QoL should be assessed at different time intervals and, to allow a satisfactory assessment, should continue for a reasonably long period of time.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-08-01 11:07:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have attempted to reduce bias in the review process by performing a comprehensive search, including a thorough search of the grey literature and ensuring that all studies were sifted and data extracted independently by two review authors. We also restricted the included studies to RCTs as they provide the strongest level of evidence available.</P>
<P>The greatest threat to the validity of the review is likely to be the possibility of publication bias i.e. studies that did not find the treatment to have been effective may not have been published. We were unable to assess this possibility as all the treatment comparisons were restricted to meta-analyses of up to seven trials.</P>

The mean hospital stay of those who underwent LPS was three to four days shorter, and they returned to normal activity sooner. The number of lymph glands resected was the same with both techniques. Laparoscopy was associated with a better quality of life after surgery. With respect to long-term results, no significant differences were found in relation to overall, disease-free or cause-specific survival, according to one study.</LI>

<P>TLH is associated with equivalent or improved QoL at 6 months when compared to the standard treatment of TAH. In early recovery (up to 4 weeks after surgery), patients who had a TLH had significantly greater improvements in most QoL measurements than those who received TAH. The greatest differences were noted in FWB (13% greater improvement for patients with TLH), PWB (11%), EnWB (6%), and the overall FACT-G summary score (7%; P = 0·001 for all comparisons). Patients in the TLH group also reported a 5% (P = 0·001) greater improvement in body image and 7·5% (P = 0·001) greater improvement in overall QoL (EuroQoL-VAS) than patients in the TAH group. During early recovery, neither EWB (P = 0·39) nor SWB (P = 0·59) differed significantly between patients assigned to TAH or TLH.</P>
<P>During the late post-operative recovery phase (3&#8211;6 months after surgery), patients with TLH recovered significantly more in their physical (P = 0·008), functional (P = 0·009), endometrial cancer-specific (P = 0·003), and overall well being (FACT-G; P = 0·03), and also had better QoL recovery with regard to body image (P = 0·001)</P>

<P>Laparoscopy had fewer moderate to severe postoperative adverse events than laparotomy (14% vs 21%, respectively; P &lt; .0001) but similar rates of intraoperative complications, despite having a significantly longer operative time (median, 204 v 130 minutes, respectively; P &lt; .001). Hospitalization of more than 2 days was significantly lower in laparoscopy versus laparotomy patients (52% <I>v </I>94%, respectively; <I>P &lt;</I> .0001). Pelvic and para-aortic nodes were not removed in 8% of laparoscopy patients and 4% of laparotomy patients (P <I>&lt;</I> .0001).
