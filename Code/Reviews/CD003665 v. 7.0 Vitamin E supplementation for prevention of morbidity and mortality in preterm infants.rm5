<P>Giving extra vitamin E to preterm babies can provide some benefits, but it increases the risk of life-threatening infections. Preterm babies (born before 37 weeks) can develop a range of problems because their organs are not mature. Vitamin E may be able to help prevent or limit some of these problems, but it can potentially also have harmful effects. Breast milk of a woman who has given birth prematurely has higher than usual levels of vitamin E. Preterm babies can be given extra vitamin E as vitamin drops, in vitamin E-enriched formula, in intravenous fluids, or by injection into their muscles. This review of studies of vitamin E supplements found that while extra vitamin E reduces the chances of some complications (including disease of the retina), the risk of life-threatening infection is increased. The risk of bleeding in the brain is increased when extra vitamin E is given by vein but decreased when the extra vitamin E is given by other routes.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Treating very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with pharmacologic doses of vitamin E as an antioxidant agent has been proposed for preventing or limiting retinopathy of prematurity, intracranial hemorrhage, hemolytic anemia, and chronic lung disease. However, excessive doses of vitamin E may result in concerning side effects.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of vitamin E supplementation on morbidity and mortality in preterm infants.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>MEDLINE (October 2002), EMBASE (March 2002), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003), and personal files for clinical trials assessing vitamin E in preterm infants were searched. The MEDLINE and CCTR searches were updated in March 2007.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Trials analyzing primary outcomes (mortality or combined long-term morbidity) or secondary outcomes (other morbidity) in infants with gestational age less than 37 weeks or birth weight less than 2500 grams were selected. The intervention was allocation to routine supplementation with vitamin E in the treatment group versus placebo, no treatment or another type, dose or route of administration of vitamin E. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-six randomized clinical trials fulfilled entry criteria. No study assessed combined long-term morbidity. Routine vitamin E supplementation significantly increased hemoglobin concentration by a small amount. Vitamin E significantly reduced the risk of germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage and increased the risk of sepsis; however, heterogeneity limits the strength of these latter two inferences. Vitamin E did not significantly affect other morbidity or mortality. In VLBW infants, vitamin E supplementation significantly increased the risk of sepsis, and reduced the risk of severe retinopathy and blindness among those examined. <BR/>Subgroup analyses demonstrated (1) an association between intravenous, high-dose vitamin E supplementation and increased risk of sepsis and of parenchymal cerebral hemorrhage; (2) an association between vitamin E supplementation by other than the intravenous route and reduced risk of germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage and of severe intraventricular hemorrhage; and (3) an association between serum tocopherol levels greater than 3.5 mg/dl and increased risk of sepsis and reduced risk for severe retinopathy among those examined.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Vitamin E supplementation in preterm infants reduced the risk of intracranial hemorrhage but increased the risk of sepsis. In very low birth weight infants, vitamin E increased the risk of sepsis, and reduced the risk of severe retinopathy and blindness among those examined. Evidence does not support the routine use of vitamin E supplementation by intravenous route at high doses or aiming at serum tocopherol levels greater than 3.5 mg/dl. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-20 09:39:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>1. What is vitamin E?<BR/>Vitamin E comprises a group of eight biologically active tocopherols, among which d-alpha-tocopherol has the highest antioxidant activity per mg of tocopherol (1.49 international unit [IU]/mg). The IU is defined as the biological activity of 1 mg of dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate. One mg of d-alpha-tocopherol equivalent equals the activity of 1 mg of d-alpha-tocopherol. Vitamin E is one of several antioxidants that preterm infants can use as scavengers of free radicals, thereby potentially limiting processes which can lead to chronic lung disease and retinopathy of prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-Thibeault-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thibeault 2000</LINK>) and other long-term complications (Brigelius-Flohé2002). In addition, alpha-tocopherol inhibits inflammation by modulating cellular signaling and by regulating transcription, and stimulates immunity; a metabolite of gamma-tocopherol has been proposed as a natriuretic factor (Brigelius-Flohé2002) .</P>
<P>2. Do preterm infants need vitamin E, and what is their requirement of this vitamin?<BR/>The content of alpha-tocopherol in the body of the fetus remains at 3-7 mg/kg throughout gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1981</LINK>). In preterm infants, lack of vitamin E intake or fat malabsorption results in edema, thrombocytosis and hemolytic anemia and could eventually result in spinocerebellar degeneration. Signs of this deficiency are enhanced by iron supplementation (due to its oxidant activity) and by high concentration in milk formula of linoleic acid and other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which are subject to oxidation (<LINK REF="STD-Hassan-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Hassan 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oski-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Oski 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ritchie-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritchie 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1975</LINK>). The clinical assessment of vitamin E deficiency remains a challenge in preterm infants, because serum tocopherol levels may not reflect tissue levels and depend on serum lipid levels (<LINK REF="REF-Greer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greer 2000</LINK>). A tocopherol/total lipid ratio of greater than 0.8 mg/g has been recommended as an indication of vitamin E sufficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>The amount of vitamin E in colostrum and preterm milk is approximately two to three times that in mature milk (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1993</LINK>). Formulas for preterm infants should contain at least one IU of vitamin E per gram of linoleic acid, 0.6 mg of d-alpha-tocopherol equivalent per g of PUFA (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1981</LINK>) and 0.7 IU per 100 kcal in order to prevent vitamin E deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Committee-N-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Committee N 1985</LINK>). With these doses, hemolytic anemia of vitamin E deficiency has been virtually eliminated except in rare cases of prolonged total parenteral nutrition with lipid emulsion and inadequate supplemental vitamin E or in cases of fat malabsorption due to cholestatic liver disease or to cystic fibrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1987</LINK>). The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition has recommended daily supplementation of 5-25 IU of vitamin E in preterm infants to ensure enough accretion (<LINK REF="REF-Committee-N-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Committee N 1985</LINK>); however, such supplementation might not be necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>The optimal amount of parenteral vitamin E in preterm infants is uncertain, although the maximum recommended dose for any neonate is 7 IU per day (5 ml of M.V.I. Pediatric®, Astra Pharmaceuticals, L.P., Wayne, PA). The manufacturer's recommendation is 1.5 ml/day for infants weighing less than 1 kg, 3.25 ml/day for those weighing 1 to 3 kg, and 5 ml/day for infants and children weighing 3 kg or more and up to 11 years of age. The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended a standard dose for all preterm infants: 40% of a vial of M.V.I. Pediatric® (<LINK REF="REF-Committee-N-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Committee N 1998</LINK>). Using a fixed dose per day (regardless of exact weight), serum alpha-tocopherol levels at one week of life are inversely related with birth weight (<LINK REF="REF-Amorde_x002d_Spalding-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amorde-Spalding 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1987</LINK>), and some infants develop serum levels greater than 3.5 mg/dl (<LINK REF="REF-Amorde_x002d_Spalding-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amorde-Spalding 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DeVito-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeVito 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacDonald-1987" TYPE="STUDY">MacDonald 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Phillips-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillips 1987</LINK>). The American Society for Clinical Nutrition recommends a parenteral dose of vitamin E of 2.8 IU/kg/day for preterm infants and 7 IU/day in full-term infants (<LINK REF="REF-Greene-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greene 1988</LINK>). This dose is met by standard intravenous vitamin solutions (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greer 2000</LINK>): a dose of 2.8 IU/kg/day is provided by 1 ml of a vial of M.V.I. Pediatric® Solution for infants with a weight of 500 g and by 2 ml for a weight of 1000 g. Schwalbe has recommended a dose of d,l-alpha-tocopheryl acetate of 4.5 mg/kg/day (4.5 IU/kg/day) for very low birth weight infants based on serum levels during the first 2 weeks of life after a five-day infusion (<LINK REF="STD-Schwalbe-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Schwalbe 1992</LINK>). In preterm infants with birth weight 820-2000 g, vitamin E at an average dose of 3 IU/kg/day administered intravenously by continuous infusion in multivitamins for 3-4 weeks generally yields plasma levels within the normal range (1-3 mg/dl) (<LINK REF="STD-Gutcher-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Gutcher 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baeckert-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baeckert 1988</LINK>). </P>
<P>3. What is the rationale for vitamin E supplementation in preterm infants; what is the bioavailability; what is the potential indirect and direct toxicity of vitamin E supplements; and is there a safe dose?<BR/>Supplementing very low birth weight infants with vitamin E as an antioxidant agent has been proposed for preventing or limiting retinopathy of prematurity, intracranial hemorrhage, and chronic lung disease. Nevertheless, tissue levels reached by pharmacologic doses of vitamin E are several fold higher than those required to produce maximum antioxidant effect (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1987</LINK>). </P>
<P>At steady state, umbilical cord blood serum, plasma or erythrocyte levels of tocopherol are related to, but less than half maternal levels and increase progressively during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Navarro-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cachia-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cachia 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jain-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jain 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baydas-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baydas 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bolisetty-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolisetty 2002</LINK>). One study has shown that the administration of 300-600 mg of vitamin E to the mother during preterm labor may reduce the risk of neonatal intracranial hemorrhage diagnosed at non traumatic spinal tap or autopsy (1/45 in the treated group versus 6/45 in controls, RR 0.17, CI 0.02,1.33; RD -0.11, CI -0.22) (<LINK REF="REF-Minkowski-1949" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minkowski 1949</LINK>). Nevertheless, two other studies have shown that fetal cord plasma levels of tocopherol fail to increase after three days of maternal supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-L_x00e9_ger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Léger 1998</LINK>) and within nine days of maternal supplementation only increase up to values lower than half those required to reduce hemolysis (<LINK REF="STD-Cruz-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Cruz 1983</LINK>). Approximately 30% of the mothers have levels consistent with vitamin E deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Cachia-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cachia 1995</LINK>), and a daily maternal intake of 400 IU of vitamin E has been estimated to prevent or correct such deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Woods-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2001</LINK>). In a cohort of 1231 gravid women, maternal plasma concentrations of alpha-tocopherol in early pregnancy and at 28 weeks were positively associated with fetal growth (<LINK REF="REF-Scholl-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholl 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most but not all studies support the observation that enteral absorption of vitamin E in preterm infants is sufficient to rapidly achieve adequate blood levels of tocopherol (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1987</LINK>). Neonatal serum tocopherol levels increase progressively when fed human colostrum, which is rich in vitamin E (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moran-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moran 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ostrea-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostrea 1986</LINK>), or formula, which now routinely contains vitamin E. In preterm infants, enteral absorption of vitamin E from water-soluble preparations is better than from lipid-soluble preparations (<LINK REF="STD-Gross-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Gross 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jansson-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Jansson 1984</LINK>). Intramuscular absorption of alpha-tocopheryl acetate prepared in solution in olive oil, available in several European countries, is six times lower than that of vitamin E in colloidal solution, available in England and North America (<LINK REF="STD-Bonati-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bonati 1991</LINK>). When vitamin E is provided as alpha-tocopheryl acetate, bioavailability of free vitamin E (tocopherol) requires hydrolysis, which is mediated by an enzyme (esterase). This hydrolysis is a limiting step in case of parenteral administration (<LINK REF="REF-Newmark-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newmark 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pedraz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pedraz 1989</LINK>) but not in case of enteral administration (Bell 1979 [see <LINK REF="STD-Zipursky-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Zipursky 1987</LINK>]), because of abundance of pancreatic and jejunal mucosal esterase activity (<LINK REF="REF-Mathias-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathias 1981</LINK>). These observations explain why even a small dose of 5 mg of dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate provided enterally has proven to be more efficient than larger intramuscular doses (30 mg) in treating scleredema (<LINK REF="STD-Gerl_x00f3_czy-1949" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlóczy 1949</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vitamin E toxicity may be related to the dose, chemical form, route of administration, or (in the case of parenteral forms) speed of administration, or to some combination of these factors (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hale-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 1995</LINK>). Risks associated with vitamin E excess in adult humans (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1989</LINK>) include (1) impaired resistance to infection resulting from decreased leukocyte function, and (2) increased bleeding resulting from a decrease in vitamin-K-dependent factors in vitamin-K deficient individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Corrigan-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corrigan 1979</LINK>) and inhibition of platelet prostaglandin synthesis and of platelet aggregation (<LINK REF="REF-Stuart-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuart 1979</LINK>). Reports of toxicity of enteral vitamin E are rare in infants. Enteral intake of vitamin E up to 25 mg/kg/day rarely yields serum levels greater than 3.5 mg/dl (81 micromol/L), i.e., the levels associated with an increased incidence of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1989</LINK>). The safe upper limit of vitamin E in infant formulas was estimated to be 10 mg d-alpha-tocopherol equivalent per 100 kcal or 15 IU/100 kcal, which would provide half the amount of enteral vitamin E (25 mg/kg/day) that appears to be safe and well tolerated (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1989</LINK>). This dose also corresponds to the highest concentration of vitamin E in colostrum (~60 mg/dl). Johnson has recently proposed to classify serum tocopherol levels as physiologic (1-3.5 mg/dl), proposed for prophylaxis and treatment of early retinopathy of prematurity, and pharmacologic (4-5 mg/dl), proposed for treating severe retinopathy of prematurity (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1995</LINK>). Increased necrotizing enterocolitis has been observed in patients with serum concentration of vitamin E greater than 3.5 mg/dl while receiving a total (intravenous vitamins, intravenous lipid solution, formula and oral vitamin supplementation 0-25 mg/kg/day) vitamin E dose less than 25 mg/kg/day (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1988</LINK>). </P>
<P>Fifty-eight infants at a single institution received pharmacologic doses (25-50 IU/kg/day intravenously) of a new preparation of vitamin E (E-Ferol®, O'Neal, Jones and Feldman, Maryland Heights, MO), which contained dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate solubilized at 25 IU/ml with 9% polysorbate 80 and 1% polysorbate 20. Among these 58 infants, eight developed pulmonary deterioration, liver failure (hepatomegaly, ascites, and in some cases cholestatic jaundice and hypoproteinemia), thrombocytopenia, and renal failure, and five died (<LINK REF="REF-Lorch-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorch 1985</LINK>). Review of autopsy-derived tissue from 20 infants showed vascular hepatotoxicity characterized by progressive intralobular cholestasis, inflammation of hepatic venules, and extensive sinusoidal veno-occlusion by fibrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Bove-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bove 1985</LINK>). Two subsequent retrospective reports described E-Ferol®-related events (<LINK REF="REF-Martone-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martone 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arrowsmith-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrowsmith 1989</LINK>). A total of 38 deaths were attributed to E-Ferol®, which was removed from the market. It remains unclear whether the toxicity of E-Ferol® resulted from the vitamin E itself, its preparation as tocopheryl acetate (which could not be hydrolyzed when given intravenously), the polysorbates present in the product, or an undetermined contaminant (<LINK REF="REF-Balistreri-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balistreri 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1987</LINK>). Parenteral vitamin E administration (either dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, or free dl-alpha tocopherol in ethanol) caused dose-related toxicity in kittens, including hepatosplenomegaly and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Phelps-1987b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phelps 1987b</LINK>). Toxicologic studies (see <LINK REF="REF-Arrowsmith-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrowsmith 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Balistreri-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balistreri 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alade-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alade 1986</LINK>) suggested that the effects of E-Ferol® could be at least in part reproduced by high doses of polysorbates 20 and 80. However tissue accumulation of vitamin E and tissue changes after E-Ferol® administration depended on the dose, route and duration of administration, with toxicity associated with rapid intravenous administration (<LINK REF="REF-Hale-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>A retrospective analysis has shown a significant association between pharmacologic oral doses of vitamin E (diluted 1:2, provided at a dose of 200 mg/day in eight aliquots) in very low birth weight infants and necrotizing enterocolitis (<LINK REF="REF-Finer-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finer 1984</LINK>). Necrotizing enterocolitis was attributed to the high osmolality of the undiluted solution, 4050 mOsm/kg, in turn related to its high content of propylene glycol (daily dose of 200 mg tocopherol, 800 mg propylene glycol, 800 mg sorbitol, 1 g polysorbate 80 in 4 ml water). Alternatively, toxicity may have been related to direct toxicity of vitamin E or of propylene glycol. The dose of propylene glycol was almost three times as much as a well-tolerated daily dose (300 mg propylene glycol and 1 mg vitamin E in 1 ml M.V.I.-Concentrate®, Armour Pharmaceutical Co, Kankakee, IL) resulting in serum propylene glycol levels greater than 40 mg/dl in 14/30 very low birth weight infants (<LINK REF="STD-MacDonald-1987" TYPE="STUDY">MacDonald 1987</LINK>). The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis decreased when this formulation was later replaced with an isotonic solution without propylene glycol. </P>
<P>Soft tissue calcification has been reported in two patients after intramuscular administration of vitamin E (<LINK REF="REF-Barak-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barak 1986</LINK>). </P>
<P>4. Why are systematic reviews of vitamin supplementation in preterm infants and subgroup analyses needed?<BR/>Existing reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Ehrenkranz-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrenkranz 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bell-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phelps-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phelps 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phelps-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phelps 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phelps-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phelps 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Law-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muller-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muller 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gross-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baley 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ehrenkranz-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehrenkranz 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watts-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watts 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raju-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raju 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greer 2000</LINK>) have assessed only some of the effects of vitamin E on mortality and morbidity in preterm infants or very low birth weight infants. The present systematic review analyzes a broader spectrum of risks and benefits of vitamin E supplementation, in preterm infants and in very low birth weight infants. Subgroup analyses are required to determine which factors affected the responses to vitamin E supplementation. </P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were designed to determine if the effects of vitamin E supplementation on morbidity and mortality in preterm infants depend on:<BR/>(1) Gestational age: The most immature infants body content of vitamin E at birth is lower and the risks for many of the outcome variables are higher. Birth weight could be used if gestational age is not available<BR/>(2) Vitamin E preparation and route of administration: This may affect vitamin E absorption, distribution and toxicity. The latter may result (1) from direct tissue toxicity of vitamin E and/or (2) from specific reagents, e.g., polysorbates 80 and 20 (<LINK REF="REF-Arrowsmith-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrowsmith 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lorch-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorch 1985</LINK>), or propylene glycol, which can unduly increase osmolality, thereby increasing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (<LINK REF="REF-Finer-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finer 1984</LINK>).<BR/>(3) The total daily dose of vitamin E, i.e., the sum of supplemented vitamin E and the dose contained in the formula and in parenteral nutrition in both groups, and serum tocopherol levels. <BR/>(4) Time of initiation of vitamin E supplementation: This is especially important for outcome variables which appear early (e.g., intraventricular hemorrhage) and those in which early onset of free radical-related damage and inflammation is expected (e.g., chronic lung disease)<BR/>(5) Intake of other nutritional components, which may modify the risk of production of free radicals and serum tocopherol levels (<LINK REF="REF-Gross-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gross 1985</LINK>). These may include oxidants (e.g., iron), antioxidants (e.g., selenium, vitamin A) and oxidizable nutrients (e.g., PUFA).<BR/>(6) Selection bias: randomized trials (which prevent selection bias) only versus all controlled studies. To limit the size of this review, this subgroup analysis was eliminated (see below).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of vitamin E supplementation on morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Secondary aims included subgroup analyses designed to determine if the effect of vitamin E supplementation depends on the factors delineated above (see Background, last paragraph).<BR/> </P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled clinical trials in which at least one of the primary or secondary outcome variables(see below) has been analyzed. After obtaining all possibly eligible trials, it became evident that many large, well-designed randomized trials were available. We therefore decided to eliminate all nine quasi-randomized trials from the analyses.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Preterm infants (gestational age less than 37 weeks). Trials were included regardless of the vitamin E intakes of the infants' mothers during pregnancy.<BR/>After obtaining all possibly eligible trials, it became evident that many trials assessing the effect of vitamin E on important outcome variables in neonates had used birth weight rather than gestational age. Therefore, eligibility criterion were modified to either gestational age less than 37 weeks or birth weight less than 2500 grams.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Randomized or quasi-randomized allocation of the infant to routine supplementation with vitamin E in the treatment group versus either placebo, no treatment or another type, dose or route of administration of vitamin E. Studies were accepted regardless of the vitamin E content of the infant's feedings (human milk or formula). The treatment group may have received vitamin E supplement either enterally or parenterally, and at any dose. However, studies assessing the effect of another intervention, to which vitamin E was only a co-intervention (e.g., studies assessing the effect of erythropoietin on hemoglobin concentration, in which vitamin E and iron were provided only in the treatment group) were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary outcome measures included mortality, combined outcome at 18 months including mortality [mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, blindness, mental retardation or cerebral palsy], and combined outcome at 18 months excluding mortality [bronchopulmonary dysplasia, blindness, mental retardation or cerebral palsy]. </P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures include the following: <BR/>E-Ferol-related "clinical syndrome" as defined earlier (<LINK REF="REF-Arrowsmith-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arrowsmith 1989</LINK>), combined outcome (either mortality before discharge, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe retinopathy of prematurity, severe cerebral abnormality, blindness, mental retardation, or cerebral palsy), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (current definition: continuous positive airway pressure or oxygen requirement at 36 weeks corrected age), patent ductus arteriosus, sepsis, severe intraventricular hemorrhage (Papile grade III or IV), mild-to-moderate intracranial hemorrhage (Papile stage I or II), severe cerebral abnormality [either intraventricular hemorrhage grade III or IV, cystic periventricular leukomalacia or severe ventricular dilatation], severe retinopathy of prematurity (grade 3 or worse), retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis with gastrointestinal perforation, necrotizing enterocolitis not requiring surgery, renal failure (serum creatinine concentration above 1.5 mg/dl), signs of hemolysis (anemia, reticulocyte count, hemoglobin concentration, need for transfusion, number of transfusions, bilirubin concentration), platelet count, coagulation tests, and local reaction at the injection site. Studies which reported only serum or plasma tocopherol levels but none of the above mentioned clinical outcomes were not included.</P>

<P>See Collaborative Review Group Strategy.<BR/>MEDLINE accessed using PubMed in October 2002 (1966 - 2002), EMBASE in March 2002 (1974 - 2002), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003 and Issue 1, 2007. We examined reports in any language as long as the report included an abstract in English. The MEDLINE search was repeated in April 2003 and March 2007. <BR/>The MEDLINE search was done using the following search terms: (&lt;vitamin E&gt; OR &lt;tocopherol&gt;). The search was limited to &lt;birth -23 months&gt; AND (&lt;randomized clinical trial&gt; OR &lt;controlled clinical trial&gt;). Because this search yielded many studies conducted in children, it was re-done using (&lt;vitamin E&gt; OR &lt;tocopherol&gt;) AND (prematurity OR preterm). <BR/>The EMBASE search was done using the following search terms: (Exp alpha tocopherol OR vitamin E.mp. OR *tocopherol/) AND (exp prematurity/ OR preterm.mp.). The search was limited to (human and infant &lt; to one year&gt;).<BR/>Selection was done independently by three investigators; any disagreement was resolved by discussion.<BR/>The CCTR does not accept searches using single-letter words. Therefore the search was done using the following search terms: Tocopherol AND (prematurity OR preterm) AND infant.<BR/>Personal files were searched and reviewed relevant references cited in the other manuscripts.</P>

<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (CNRG) were used.<BR/>http://neonatal.cochrane.org/<BR/>"<I>Organization and Methodology of a Systematic Review for CNRG (Guidelines for Reviewers &amp; Editors</I>)"<BR/>These included independent review of all candidate studies by all reviewers. The methodological quality of the trials was assessed by analyzing the risk of four types of bias: selection, performance, attrition and detection.<BR/>Standard methods of the CNRG were used for estimating treatment effects with 95% confidence interval (CI) and a fixed effect model. Dichotomous variables were assessed using relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD), and number needed to treat/harm. Data were extracted on as many randomized patients as possible, and analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis, using as denominator for dichotomous variables the total number of randomized patients. Since several studies have reported specific outcome variables only in selected subgroups subject to attrition bias (e.g., survivors) the names of the variables were modified accordingly. Exceptionally, the total number of patients in each arm of the study was not available because the authors have excluded patients from the study after randomization; in this case, the maximum number of available patients was used instead of the total number of randomized patients. Data reported in very low birth weight infants were treated as separate variable, to allow subgroup analyses in this important population. Continuous variables are presented as mean ± 1 standard deviation (SD). Where justified clinically, we merged two or more subgroups of a published study, using standard formulae to calculate the weighted mean and to estimate the weighted standard deviation (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brion-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brion 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zahr-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zahr 1984</LINK>). Continuous variables were assessed by the weighted mean difference (WMD) between the treatment group and the control group.<BR/>Additional data including those obtained after or pending publication were requested from the authors, if necessary.</P>
<P>I. Original plan:</P>
<P>To analyze studies separately according to the amount of vitamin E provided to the mother during pregnancy, and according to the amount, type or route of vitamin E supplementation of the infants in the control group:<BR/>1.

<P>6. According to study design:<BR/>6.1. Randomized studies only<BR/>6.2. All studies</P>
<P>II. Modifications to the original plan:</P>
<P>Studies of vitamin E administration to preterm infants have been conducted for more than fifty years, during which standard of care including baseline vitamin E intake in pregnancy and in very low birth weight infants has changed considerably. Furthermore, the definitions of chronic lung disease of prematurity or bronchopulmonary dysplasia and of retinopathy or prematurity or retrolental fibroplasia have changed several times during the last decades. Several methods have been used to administer vitamin E, and some of the differences in design among studies became clear only during completion of the protocol.</P>
<P>Outcome variables in the available trials were often reported only is specific subgroups, e.g., very low birth weight infants. Because very low birth weight infants are the only ones at risk for some of the complications potentially treated or prevented by vitamin E (e.g., severe retinopathy of prematurity), separate outcome variables were created in that weight group to allow subgroup analyses. This was the only way to determine which (or whether any) specific method of vitamin E administration (dose, duration, level, etc) is both efficient and nontoxic in very low birth weight infants. Subgroups among very low birth weight infants are referred to as "all studies" when they included all studies irrespective of the weight cut-off (either 1500 grams or 1000 grams), "equal to or less than 1500 grams" or "equal to or less than 1000 grams", as appropriate for each specific weight cut-off. For many outcome variables the first subgroup includes "all infants in all studies."</P>
<P>An additional outcome variable that had not been anticipated was added as a post-hoc analysis: retinal hemorrhage.</P>
<P>In order to limit the number of comparisons, the main planned comparisons (listed in above sections 1 and 2) were replaced by the following:<BR/>1. Vitamin E versus placebo<BR/>2. Vitamin E versus another form or route of vitamin E (intramuscular versus enteral, intravenous versus intramuscular, intramuscular in olive oil versus intramuscular in colloidal form)</P>
<P>Many trials used combination of enteral and parenteral vitamin E supplementation, so these entries were modified as follows:<BR/>2. Route of administration and formulation:<BR/>2.1. Enteral<BR/>2.1.1. Enteral hypertonic formulation at pharmacologic dose<BR/>2.2. Parenteral with or without enteral<BR/>2.2.1. Parenteral with hypertonic enteral formulation at pharmacologic dose<BR/>2.2.2. Parenteral colloidal with polysorbate<BR/>2.2.3. Intravenous (with or without other routes of administration)<BR/>2.2.4. Excluding intravenous administration</P>
<P>The cut-off value for vitamin E intake were clarified as follows:<BR/>3. Total daily dose of vitamin E provided (iv + diet + supplement) to the treatment group, target serum level<BR/>3.1. &lt;=20 mg d-alpha-tocopherol equivalents/kg/d OR 30 IU/kg/d, i.e., 30 mg/kg/d dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate*<BR/>3.2. &gt; 20 mg d-a-tocopherol equivalents/kg/d OR 30 IU/kg/d, i.e., 30 mg/kg/d dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate*<BR/>* If the dose is expressed in IU/day or mg/day, we used mean birth weight (estimated, if necessary, to be 1000 g for studies on infants with birth weight &lt; 1500 grams) in the group for the calculations.</P>
<P>Based on <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1995</LINK> an entry based on serum tocopherol levels at the end of the period of vitamin supplementation was added:<BR/>3.3. Serum tocopherol level &lt;=3.5 mg/dl (81 micromoles/L)<BR/>3.4. Serum tocopherol level &gt;3.5 mg/dl</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were added based on duration of the treatment:<BR/>4. Time of onset and duration of vitamin E supplementation in the treatment group<BR/>4.1. Within the first 48 hours of life<BR/>4.2. After the first 48 hours of life<BR/>4.3. Duration of treatment &lt;= 1 week (7 daily doses)<BR/>4.4. Duration of treatment &gt; 1 week (7 daily doses)</P>
<P>Since only randomized trials were included for this review, the subgroup analysis of randomized trials was eliminated.</P>
<P>Vitamin E administration during pregnancy and dose of vitamin E in the control group is addressed as subgroup analyses instead of main comparisons:<BR/>6. Vitamin E provided during pregnancy<BR/>6.1. Documented prolonged high-dose (at least 400 IU/day for a week) vitamin E during pregnancy</P>
<P>7. Total dose of vitamin E provided to the control group<BR/>7.1. &lt;= 10 mg vitamin E/100 kcal<BR/>7.2. &gt; 10 mg vitamin E/100 kcal</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses based on other nutritional components that may modify the effects of or the need for vitamin E were assessed as planned, except comparisons in which vitamin E was a co-intervention with one of those supplements were eliminated.</P>
<P>Because these studies have spanned more than 50 years of research, definitions of outcome variables such as retrolental fibroplasia (retinopathy of prematurity) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia have changed. Only entries for which we found relevant studies are presented in the Table of Comparisons.<BR/>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The MEDLINE search retrieved 128 studies, the EMBASE search 35 studies and the CCTR search 14 studies. Review of personal files and reading of documents obtained by the initial searches and by screening all references listed in manuscripts yielded more than 50 additional studies. An updated search of the MEDLINE and the CCTR conducted in March 2007 yielded one additional retrospective study (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2005</LINK>). After excluding ineligible studies and after merging multiple publications of the same studies, a total of 62 trials remained. Twenty-six randomized clinical trials (range of patients per trial: 10-914) were included in this systematic review. Among these 26 trials, five were conducted in the 1970's, 17 in the 80's, three in the 90's and one in 2003.</P>
<P>Only those trials that prospectively compared a group of vitamin E-supplemented neonates with a control group are reported in the Tables of Included and Excluded Studies. Thirty-five studies are listed in the Table of Excluded Studies. Studies were placed in this group for the following reasons (some studies for more than one reason): (1) trials (n=18) that did not assess any of the predefined outcomes or did not provide analyzable outcomes because either mean and variability (standard error of the mean or standard deviation), frequencies or individual data were not available, (2) studies (n=7) in which the experimental group and the control group were not enrolled simultaneously, (3) quasi-randomized trials (n=12, of which three had at least one additional criterion of exclusion), defined as trials in which patients were not randomly allocated to the treatment and the control arms of the study, (4) trials (n=3, two of which also fitted the first criterion) in which either no preterm infants had been enrolled or a mixture of full-term and preterm infants had been enrolled and (5) trials (n=1) in which vitamin E was only a co-intervention. A complete list of 51 additional publications (case series, reviews, retrospective chart reviews) that were considered but are not reported in this systematic review is available upon request. </P>
<P>Although the classical definition of very low birth infants is a birth weight less than 1500 grams, studies assessing the effect of vitamin E on outcomes in preterm infants used a birth weight equal to or less than 1500 grams. In order to shorten the text, the term "very low birth weight infants" is used to refer to this latter group. </P>
<P>1. Vitamin E versus placebo<BR/>This group included 25 randomized trials that assessed the effects of vitamin E supplementation by enteral route only (n=8), intramuscular with or without enteral (n=15), or intravenous with or without other routes (n=2). Vitamin E supplementation was initiated within the first 48 hours of life in all treated patients in 20 studies, and after 48 hours in all treated patients in four studies. The duration of vitamin E supplementation was up to one week in eleven studies and greater than one week in all patients in thirteen studies. The total dose of vitamin E intake in the treated group was equal to or less than 30 IU/kg/day in fifteen studies and greater than 30 IU/kg/day in nine studies. Serum tocopherol levels were up to 3.5 mg/dl in fifteen studies and greater than 3.5 mg/dl in eight studies. The total dose of vitamin E intake in the control group was up to 10 mg/100 kcal in 22 studies and greater than 10 mg/100 kcal in three studies.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chiswick-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Chiswick 1982</LINK> is a randomized trial assessing the effect of four daily intramuscular injections of 20 mg/kg/dose of dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate as an aqueous colloidal solution (Ephynal®, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) starting at 24 hours of age on mortality and intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants. Entry criteria were: preterm infants without major congenital malformations. The concentration of the solution was 1000 mg/2 ml, and individual doses greater than 0.5 ml were divided and given in two different injection sites. Controls received no injection of vitamin E. Only five infants, i.e., those without respiratory distress, received formula (SMA Gold Cap Milk®, Wyeth Laboratories, Slough, England) during the first four days of life. The total number of patients entered into the study was 35, including 14 in the treatment group and 21 in the control group. Gestational ages ranged from 25 to 36 weeks (average 29.1±3.3 weeks in the treated group and 29.3±3.3 weeks in the control group) and birth weights from 550 to 1750 g (average 1.21±0.29 kg in the treated group and 1.25±0.33 kg in the control group). Intraventricular hemorrhage was diagnosed by computerized tomography, clinical findings (uniformly blood-stained cerebrospinal fluid, seizures, tense anterior fontanel) or autopsy. Because not all infants had a computerized tomography (number not provided) or an autopsy (n =1), it is possible that some cases of intraventricular hemorrhage may not have been diagnosed; for the calculations we only used demonstrated cases of intraventricular hemorrhage (in contrast with the authors who assumed that one patient had a hemorrhage). Outcome variables included mortality and intraventricular hemorrhage.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Chiswick-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Chiswick 1983</LINK> is a randomized trial assessing the effect of three intramuscular injections of 20 mg/kg/dose of dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate as an aqueous colloidal solution (Ephynal®, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) given at 12, 36 and 60 hours of age on intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants. Entry criteria were gestational age less than 37 weeks and birth weight less than 1751 g. Controls received no injection of vitamin E. No information is provided about enteral intake of vitamin E. Intraventricular hemorrhage was diagnosed by ultrasonogram performed within the first 48 hours of life and at least once after 72 hours; repeat examinations were done where possible daily during the first week and less often afterwards. The total number of patients was 44, including 21 in the treatment group and 23 in the control group. Mean gestational ages and birth weights in the whole study population are not provided. Outcome variables included mortality, germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Cruz-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Cruz 1983</LINK> is a randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of four intramuscular injections of 25 mg/kg of vitamin E (on days one, two, four and eight, respectively) on hematologic parameters in preterm infants. Entry criteria were: (1) mothers admitted with threatened premature delivery at 26-34 weeks of gestation, (2) infants born to mothers admitted for threatened preterm delivery at 26-34 weeks of gestation and delivered with a weight less than 2300 g. All mothers of infants in the randomized trial received 900 mg of vitamin E (Ephynal®, Roche) daily for three days, followed by 100 mg daily until delivery. A non-randomized third group of infants, born to non-supplemented mothers, received no intramuscular vitamin E supplementation. All infants were fed banked breast milk, followed by an infant formula (Allomin). All infants received oral multivitamin drops starting on day five of life; this provided two mg of vitamin E daily. Among 55 infants enrolled in this trial, 27 were randomized to the experimental group and 28 to the control group. Mean gestational ages were 32.8±1.9 weeks and 32.4±1.9 weeks, respectively, in the experimental and in the control group, and mean birth weights were, respectively, 1808±361 and 1817±357 g. Outcome variables included retrolental fibroplasia, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Ehrenkranz-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrenkranz 1982</LINK> is a double-blind randomized trial assessing the effect of repeated intramuscular injections of 20 mg/kg of Vitamin E Injectable® (Hoffmann-LaRoche) on neonatal outcomes. Entry criteria included respiratory distress syndrome and informed consent. Injections were given upon admission to the study and 24, 48, and 168 hours later. Additional doses were given twice weekly as long as infants received oxygen therapy and could not tolerate feedings and vitamin supplements. Patients in the control group received same volumes of placebo, i.e., the vehicle. All infants initially received an intravenous protein solution containing vitamin E 2.5 U/L. Enteral feedings provided 16 U/L (formula) or 3 U/L (human milk). Patients tolerating feeds regularly were given oral vitamin E supplementation (Aquasol E®, USV Pharmaceutical Corp.) at a dose of 50 IU/day if weight was less than 1000 g and 25 IU/day if weight was greater than 1000 g.

In the manuscript, several data are presented only in the 210 patients with negative initial scan (102 patients in the treatment group and 108 in the control group), including birth weights in the treatment group and in the control group (respectively, 1273±315 grams and 1214±346 grams), gestational ages (respectively, 29.3±2.0 weeks and 28.8±2.2 weeks), and complete information about the classification of the intracranial hemorrhage. The authors used a classification in 3 grades; therefore, grade 3 was re-coded into Papile's grade IV (intraparenchymal hemorrhage). Outcome variables available in all patients included mortality, periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (adding numbers in Table II and those in the second paragraph of the discussion), necrotizing enterocolitis, and reaction at site of injection.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1985</LINK> is a double-blind randomized trial assessing the effect of oral administration of dl-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-succinate (Mead Johnson) 50 mg/day once a day for three consecutive days; the first dose was given before 24 hours of life. Entry criteria included: gestational age 30-36 weeks, birth weight 970-2610 g, healthy, lack of pulmonary disease or oxygen requirement, no ABO or Rh isoimmunization, and no other sources of bilirubin production, such as hematoma or bruising. The only exclusion criterion was infection. Control patients received placebo. All infants were fed either breast milk or a proprietary formula without iron (vitamin E contents ranging from 12 to 25 IU/L). Decisions regarding phototherapy were made by staff physicians who were unaware of the study results. Among 30 patients entered into the study, seventeen were allocated to the treatment group and thirteen to the control group. Average birth weights were 1.79±0.38 kg in the treatment group and 1.83±0.33 kg in the control group; average gestational ages were 32.6±1.6 weeks and 33.4±1.5 weeks, respectively.

<LINK REF="STD-Zipursky-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Zipursky 1987</LINK> is a double-blind randomized trial assessing the effect of enteral (gavage) supplementation of 25 IU vitamin E daily provided as 16 mg dl-alpha-tocopherol (Hoffman-La Roche) for six weeks in preterm infants smaller than 1500 g on anemia, coagulation tests and serum tocopherol levels. Entry criteria included birth weight &lt; 1500 g, expected survival greater than 48 hours, and informed consent. Exclusion criteria included major congenital anomalies and Rhesus hemolytic disease. Infants in the control group received placebo (Tween 80). Age at entry into the trial was 2.7±3 days in treatment group and 2.9±2 days in control group. Infants in both groups also received recommended amounts of vitamin E, either in breast milk (5.4 IU/L and 0.8 mg/g of PUFA), SMA 20 (10 IU/L or 1.3 mg/g of PUFA) or SMA 24 (12 IU/L or 1.3 mg/g of PUFA). The range of PUFA content in milk used was 4-6 g/L. No added iron was provided, although SMA 20 and SMA 24 contained, respectively, 12.7 and 15.2 mg/L of iron sulfate. Individual or group amounts of feeding are not provided, so that total amount of iron cannot be calculated. The total number of patients is not the same in the two follow-up manuscripts (266 in Milner 1981 and 268 in Watts 1991). Assuming that these differences represent loss to follow-up (two patients lost to follow-up acknowledged in Milner 1981), the total number of patients is presumed to be 269 infants entered into the study, with 135 allocated to the treatment group and 134 to the control group. Average birth weights were 1149± 244 g and 1158±251 g in the treatment group and in the control group, respectively, and average gestational ages were 29.2±2.7 and 29.1±2.7 weeks, respectively. Mean age at entry into the trial was 2.7±3 days in the treatment group and 2.9±2 days in the control group. Baseline characteristics (number of infants &lt; 1000 g, percentage of infants with severe illness) were similar in the two groups. Outcome variables included mortality and stages III or IV bronchopulmonary dysplasia (defined, respectively, by bilateral cystic lesions without or with fibrosis) and retrolental fibroplasia, and among specific subsets, hemoglobin concentration, reticulocyte count, platelet count, and coagulation tests.</P>

Entry criteria included: live born infant, gestational age equal or less than 32 weeks, no malformations, born in participating centers over 3 months, and admitted to a neonatal intensive care within two hours of birth. Patients received three daily doses of 20 mg/kg of vitamin E starting at 8 hours of life. Infants were randomly allocated to the treatment group, receiving dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate as an aqueous colloidal solution (Ephynal®, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland), or to the control group, receiving alpha-tocopherol in olive oil solution (Evio Forte®, Bracco, Milan). The exact amounts of vitamin E administered enterally and by transfusion are not provided. Infants received 2-98 ml/kg/day of enteral feeding, including breast milk (vitamin E content 1.11±0.53 mg/100 ml) or formula (vitamin E content 0.23±0.08 mg/100 ml). Among 50 enrolled patients, 44 (22 in each group) completed the study. Birth weights ranged from 670 g to 1800 g with an average of 1217±311 g. Average gestational age was 29.0±2.5 weeks. </P>

<P>
<B>VITAMIN E VERSUS PLACEBO OR NO VITAMIN E</B>
<B> (COMPARISON 01):</B>
<B> </B>
<BR/>
<B>Primary outcomes:</B>
<BR/>Vitamin E supplementation did not significantly affect mortality in all patients and in very low birth weight infants; the strength of this inference is strong, based on more than 1500 randomized patients and no evidence of heterogeneity . No study assessed combined outcomes at 18 months of age.</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary outcomes:</B>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia</I>
</B>
<B>
<I>:</I>
</B>
<BR/>Vitamin E supplementation did not significantly affect these outcomes (except for some subgroup analyses of patent ductus arteriosus requiring treatment). The strength of theses inferences is strong, based on 500-900 randomized patients and no evidence of heterogeneity. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Patent ductus arteriosus:</I>
</B>
<BR/>Vitamin E supplementation did not significantly affect patent ductus arteriosus. The strength of this inference is strong, based on 500-900 randomized patients and no evidence of heterogeneity. However, there was significant heterogeneity for patent ductus arteriosus requiring treatment, and some subgroup analyses reached statistical significance. <BR/>
<B>
<I>
<BR/>Sepsis:</I>
</B>
<BR/>Vitamin E supplementation significantly increased the risk of sepsis after study entry among all infants (typical estimate RR 1.52, CI 1.13, 2.04). The strength of this inference appears strong, based on a large number of randomized patients (&gt;1000) and no evidence of heterogeneity. However, there is heterogeneity in RD. Vitamin E supplementation significantly increased the risk of sepsis after study entry among very low birth weight infants (typical estimate RR 1.53, CI 1.13, 2.08), and among very low birth weight infants treated for more than one week (typical estimate RR 1.63, CI 1.17, 2.26). The strength of this inference is strong, based on 500-900 randomized patients and no evidence of heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis showed that this effect was associated with parenteral vitamin E supplementation, intravenous supplementation, at dose greater than 30 IU/kg/day, starting within 48 hours after life, with serum tocopherol levels greater than 3.5 mg/dl, and with vitamin E intake in the control group that was equal to or lower than 10 mg/100 kcal. In contrast, vitamin E did not significantly affect the risk of sepsis among surviving very low birth weight infants (n=274).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Intracranial hemorrhage:</I>
</B>
<BR/>Vitamin E supplementation significantly reduced the risk for germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage among all infants (n=1755) (typical estimate RR 0.85, CI 0.73, 0.99). The strength of this inference appears strong, based on a large number of randomized patients and no evidence of heterogeneity. However, there is heterogeneity in RD. Subgroup analyses suggest that this heterogeneity may be related in large part to differences in route of administration; specifically, subgroup analyses of intravenous versus other routes of administration completely eliminated this heterogeneity. Intravenous vitamin E supplementation did not significantly affect the risk of hemorrhage (01.19.05), whereas administration by other than the intravenous route (01.19.06) significantly reduced that risk (typical estimate RR 0.71, CI 0.58, 0.87; RD -0.14, CI -0.22, -0.06). <BR/>Among very low birth weight infants, vitamin E supplementation did not significantly affect the risk for germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage; although the strength of this inference appears strong, based on a large number (n=777) of randomized patients and no statistical evidence of heterogeneity, a word of caution is required. Subgroup analysis excluding high-dose intravenous vitamin E only counted a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Fish-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fish 1990</LINK>) involving only 147 patients and yielding an estimate RR of 0.70, CI 0.46,1.04, which is in the same range as that cited above in this paragraph for all premature infants. </P>
<P>The effect of vitamin E supplementation on severe intraventricular hemorrhage or on parenchymal hemorrhage was heterogeneous. Vitamin E supplementation did not significantly affect the risk of severe intraventricular hemorrhage or parenchymal hemorrhage among all infants or among very low birth weight infants. In extremely low birth weight infants vitamin E supplementation did not significantly affect the risk for severe hemorrhage (n=232) in studies analyzing the data on intention to treat basis, but significantly reduced the risk of severe intraventricular hemorrhage in survivors (n=133). This discrepancy resulted from the fact that vitamin E reduced the risk of severe hemorrhage only in survivors in <LINK REF="STD-Fish-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fish 1990</LINK>. The effects of vitamin E on parenchymal hemorrhage could have resulted from several differences in design between two studies: intravenous high-dose, prolonged administration of vitamin E including in extremely low birth weight infants was associated with an increased risk in one study, whereas intramuscular, low-dose, short administration was associated with a reduced risk in another study.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Retinopathy of prematurity:</I>
</B>
<BR/>Vitamin E supplementation did not significantly affect the risk of retinopathy of prematurity (all grades) among all infants (typical estimate RR close to 1 in all analyses). The strength of this inference is strong, based on more than 1300 randomized patients and no evidence of heterogeneity. </P>
<P>Vitamin E supplementation did not significantly affect the risk of severe retinopathy of prematurity among all infants (typical estimate RR 0.72, CI 0.41,1.25) and among very low birth weight infants (typical estimate RR 0.59, CI 0.32,1.08) in an intention to treat analysis. The strength of this inference appears strong, based on more than 1300 randomized patients and no statistical evidence of heterogeneity. Nevertheless, the RR is not close to 1 in either of these analyses. Among examined very low birth weight infants, vitamin E significantly reduced the risk for severe retinopathy of prematurity (n=1062) (typical estimate RR 0.58, CI 0.34, 1.00) and the risk for blindness (typical estimate RR 0.19, CI 0.10, 0.88, n=467) but not retinal detachment (too rare to reach any solid conclusion) nor the risk for reaching a final cicatricial stage. The reduction in risk for severe retinopathy was observed with serum levels greater than 3.5 mg/dl (typical estimate RR 0.34, CI 0.13, 0.88 for all infants and 0.34, CI 0.13,0.87 for very low birth weight infants), but not with lower levels (typical estimates RR 0.83, CI 0.42, 1.61 and 1.01, CI 0.44,2.32, respectively). Reduced risk of blindness was observed in very low-birth weight infants receiving vitamin E starting within 48 hours of life and for more than a week. </P>
<P>Our results on retinopathy of prematurity are similar although not identical to those of a recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Raju-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raju 1997</LINK>), which analyzed retinopathy of prematurity after reclassifying individual outcomes according to the International Classification for Retinopathy of Prematurity. The odds ratio for retinopathy of prematurity among very low birth weight infants using an intention-to-treat analysis was 0.85 (CI 0.65, 1.11) in <LINK REF="REF-Raju-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raju 1997</LINK>, compared with 0.83 (CI 0.62, 1.11) in our study. The odds ratio using an intention-to-treat analysis was 0.44 (CI 0.21, 0.87) for severe retinopathy (ROP 3+) in <LINK REF="REF-Raju-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raju 1997</LINK>, compared with 0.57 (CI 0.30, 1.09) for ROP &gt;=3 in our study; analysis among patients examined reached significance in <LINK REF="REF-Raju-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raju 1997</LINK> as well as in our analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Necrotizing enterocolitis:</I>
</B>
<BR/>Vitamin E supplementation did not significantly affect the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis among all infants and among very low birth weight infants (typical estimate RR 1.37, CI 0.93, 1.95). The strength of this inference appears strong, based on more than 1340 randomized patients and no statistical evidence of heterogeneity. Nevertheless, the typical estimate RR is not close to 1 and RR in individual studies varies between 0.51 and 6.88. </P>
<P>Among 734 very low birth weight infants treated for more than one week, the typical estimate RR was 1.51 (CI 0.99, 2.30), reaching significance in infants with birth weight less than 1500 grams and in those with serum tocopherol levels greater than 3.5 mg/dl. The strength of this inference is limited by lack of intention-to-treat analysis and by heavy weighing of the results towards a single study using high-dose intravenous vitamin E administration (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Hematologic outcomes:</I>
</B>
<BR/>Vitamin E supplementation significantly increased hemoglobin by a small amount (0.4 g/dl) in more than 400 patients and without evidence of heterogeneity, and significantly reduced reticulocyte count. Nevertheless, it did not affect the need for transfusion. In very low birth weight infants, vitamin E significantly reduced serum bilirubin by 1.5 mg/dl. <BR/>Low-dose, enteral administration of vitamin E did not significantly affect platelet counts or coagulation tests. <BR/>High-dose intravenous administration of vitamin E significantly increased the risk of retinal hemorrhage among 85 extremely low birth weight infants in a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Phelps-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Phelps 1987a</LINK>) but not among the whole set of 232 very low birth weight infants. This is the same study in which vitamin E significantly increased the risk of parenchymal intracranial hemorrhage (01.28). Rosenbaum had found a statistical association between severe intraventricular hemorrhage and later retinal hemorrhage (p&lt;0.007, Fisher's exact test (<LINK REF="STD-Phelps-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Phelps 1987a</LINK>). Mean peak tocopherol levels were 5.07+/-3.41 mg/dl in patients with retinal hemorrhage versus 3.49+/-3.22 mg/dl in those without retinal hemorrhage (p = 0.025). </P>
<P>
<B>Summary:</B>
<BR/>Summary statistics using intention-to-treat analyses showed that routine vitamin E supplementation significantly reduced the risk of germinal/intraventricular hemorrhage (RR 0.85, CI 0.73, 0.99) and increased the risk of sepsis after study entry (RR 1.52, CI 1.13, 2.04) but did not significantly affect mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, parenchymal hemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, platelet count, or coagulation studies. Hemoglobin concentration was significantly increased by a small amount (WMD 0.46, CI 0.24, 0.69). In very low birth weight infants, vitamin E supplementation significantly increased the risk for sepsis after study entry (RR 1.53, CI 1.13, 2.08) and, although with significant heterogeneity, the risk for parenchymal hemorrhage (RR 9.21, CI 1.22, 69.58); among those with known outcomes vitamin E significantly reduced the risk for severe retinopathy (RR 0.58, CI 0.34, 1.00) and blindness (RR 0.29, CI 0.10, 0.88).</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses showed that (1) serum tocopherol levels greater than 3.5 mg/dl in very low birth weight infants were associated with a significantly increased risk of sepsis after study entry (RR 1.72, CI 1.24, 2.40) , with increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis among those treated for more than one week (RR 1.60, CI 1.02, 2.52) and with reduced risk for severe retinopathy among those examined (RR 0.34, CI 0.13, 0.88); and (2) intravenous, high-dose administration of vitamin E in very low birth weight infants was associated with a significantly increased risk of sepsis after study entry (RR 1.56, CI 1.07, 2.27), with increased risk of parenchymal hemorrhage in one study only and with increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis among those treated for more than one week in another study.</P>
<P>
<B>Colloidal vitamin E versus vitamin E in olive oil:</B>
<BR/>Colloidal vitamin E resulted in higher serum levels, but did not significantly affect any of the analyzed outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Discussion:</B>
<BR/>In this systematic review, a large number of subgroup analyses was undertaken. This must lead to caution in inferring the likely effects of treatment when estimated in multiple subgroups. </P>
<P>Although this systematic review shows that high-dose intravenous vitamin E has toxic effects, these data should not be taken as evidence that intravenous vitamin E at any dose is toxic. Based on all the available evidence from this systematic review and from data presented in the background, the dose recommended by the American Society for Clinical Nutrition (2.8-3.5 IU/kg/day) (<LINK REF="REF-Greene-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greene 1988</LINK>) for extremely low birth weight infants should remain the current standard of care for those fed parenterally. </P>
<P>The majority of the clinical trials available in this systematic review were conducted in the 1980s or earlier, so that too few surviving extremely preterm infants were available to permit subgroup analysis of this most vulnerable population. Thus, recommendations based on the available subjects must be viewed with caution when applied to the group of preterm infants inhabiting the modern neonatal unit. The current population includes many infants who are more premature and smaller than the infants on whom the recommendations were based. Furthermore, the only major long-term benefit of vitamin E supplementation demonstrated in this review was the prevention of blindness in very low birth weight infants, the incidence of which has been substantially reduced with laser photo coagulation. </P>
<P>Because the majority of clinical trials available for this review analyzed infants who currently are not the ones at high risk for threshold retinopathy of prematurity, and because severe retinopathy is relatively frequent in extremely low birth weight infants, it would appear justified to initiate a multicenter randomized trial assessing the effects in this population of supplementation with vitamin E (excluding high-dose intravenous administration) begun within 48 hours of birth and given for more than one week. Only three studies provided extremely low birth weight infants meeting these criteria and available for analysis in this systematic review: <LINK REF="STD-Ehrenkranz-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrenkranz 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fish-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fish 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hittner-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Hittner 1981</LINK>, in which mean serum tocopherol levels in the treatment group were, respectively, 3.89, 4.24 and 1.21 mg/dl. In the latter study, serum levels in control patients were compatible with vitamin E deficiency. Thus, only the first two studies should be used as baseline. The numbers of patients available to our analysis were 147 for mortality (01.02.03), sepsis (01.16.03), germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage (01.20.03), severe intraventricular hemorrhage (grade III/IV) (01.25.02) and necrotizing enterocolitis (01.45.03), nine for retinopathy of prematurity among patients examined (01.34.03) and for severe retinopathy (grade 3 or more) (01.36.03) and blindness (01.43.03), and none for retinopathy of prematurity (any grade) (01.32.03), parenchymal hemorrhage (grade IV) (01.28), retinal detachment among survivors (01.40.03) and retinal bleeding (01.66.02). Among patients examined, the typical estimate RR was 1.67 for sepsis (01.16.03), 0.70 for germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage (01.20.03), 0.59 for severe intraventricular hemorrhage (01.25.02), 0.27 for retinopathy of prematurity among patients examined (01.34), 0.12 for severe retinopathy of prematurity (01.38.03), not estimable for blindness (01.43.03), and 0.51 for necrotizing enterocolitis (01.45.03). Thus, preliminary analysis suggests that potential benefits might include a reduction of severe intraventricular hemorrhage and retinopathy and potential toxicity might include sepsis. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Available data show that vitamin E supplementation in very low birth weight infants reduces severe retinopathy at high serum tocopherol levels, i.e., those associated with sepsis. Doses of vitamin E greater than 30 IU/kg/day are also associated with sepsis. Thus, the "best" pharmacologic dose of vitamin E is unclear at this point. Evidence argues against the use of intravenous vitamin E supplementation, high doses or routes yielding serum tocopherol levels greater than 3.5 mg/dl in preterm infants including very low birth weight infants. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>It would appear justified to initiate in extremely low birth weight infants a multicenter randomized trial assessing the effects of supplementation with vitamin E (excluding high-dose intravenous administration) begun within 48 hours of birth and given for more than one week. Such a study should examine the incidence of severe retinopathy of prematurity, blindness, severe intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. The study should focus on the most immature infants (less than 28 weeks gestational age and less than 1000 grams birth weight ) because these infants are at the highest risk of complications of prematurity. If a new multicenter trial is to be undertaken, it should be designed to allow careful monitoring for toxicity, and, if doses greater than 30 IU/kg/day are to be tested, serum tocopherol levels should be monitored. It is unclear whether target levels should be below or above 3.5 mg/dl because high levels were those associated both with increased risk of sepsis and with reduced risk for severe retinopathy. Furthermore, such trial may be more controversial than other interventions which may reduce the risk of severe retinopathy of prematurity without apparent severe side effects, e.g., reducing oxygen administration and allowing a decrease in oxygen saturation (<LINK REF="REF-Tin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chow-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chow 2003</LINK>). </P>
