<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-30 17:34:32 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Sore throat is a widespread acute respiratory tract illness which affects all age groups. In China, many Chinese herbal medicines are used to treat this illness. Because the majority of clinical research into traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as a treatment for sore throat failed to meet world standards of clinical research reporting, the authors could not recommend any preparation or formulation for clinical use in the previous published version.</P>
<P>In this updated review, we included a total of 12 studies (including five new studies), involving 1954 participants. Six Chinese herbal medicines may facilitate the improvement of symptoms and increase the rate of recovery. Two studies separately reported one case of diarrhoea and one case of mild nausea; two trials reported no adverse events in the treatment group; and other studies did not report any adverse events. We identified ten studies as being of poor methodological quality and only two studies as being of medium methodological quality. Chinese medicinal herbs may be the treatment choice for sore throat, but we cannot recommend any particular preparation or formulation over another as we did not find any well-designed studies to provide strong evidence to conclusively support or reject the use of Chinese traditional herbal medicines in the treatment of sore throat. Enhancing the quality of research into Chinese medicinal herbs for sore throat is imperative, and stronger evidence from high quality, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed.<BR/>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-10 12:59:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We included 12 studies involving 1954 participants. We identified ten studies as being of methodologically poor quality and two studies as being of medium quality. We did not perform a meta-analysis but reported the results separately. Six formulations were shown to be superior to the control in improving recovery: Ertong Qingyan Jiere Koufuye was more effective than Fufang Shuanghua Koufuye for acute pharyngitis (odds ratio (OR) 2.52; 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.11 to 5.74); Yanhouling mixture  was more effective than gentamicin atomised inhalation for acute pharyngitis (OR 5.39; 95% CI 2.69 to 10.81); Qinganlan Liyan Hanpian was more effective than Fufang Caoshanhu Hanpian for acute pharyngitis (OR 2.25; 95% CI 1.08 to 4.67); sore throat capsules were more effective than antibiotics (intravenous cefalexin) for acute pharyngitis or acute tonsillitis (OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.01 to 5.51); compound dandelion soup was more effective than sodium penicillin for acute purulent tonsillitis (OR 5.06; 95% CI 1.70 to 15.05); and eliminating heat by nourishing yin and relieving sore-throat methods combined with Dikuiluqan Hanpian was more effective than Dikuiluqan Hanpian alone for children with chronic pharyngitis (OR 2.63; 95% CI 1.02 to 6.79). Another six formulations were shown to be equally efficacious as the control.</P>

<P>Based on the existing evidence in this review, some Chinese herbal medicines for treating sore throat appeared efficacious. However, due to the lack of high quality clinical trials, the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine for treating sore throat is controversial and questionable. Therefore we cannot recommend any kind of Chinese medical herbal formulation as an effective remedy for sore throat.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-02-09 23:45:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-01-30 17:18:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sore throat can either be a disease in itself, for example pharyngitis, laryngitis, or tonsillitis, or result from other diseases, such as influenza and glandular fever (<LINK REF="REF-Tian-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tian 2002</LINK>). It is primarily caused by a virus or bacteria, or both. Other known causes include allergic reactions, trauma, toxins, and neoplasia (<LINK REF="REF-Kazzi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazzi 2004</LINK>). People suffering from a sore throat can recover spontaneously; that is, 'cure' is not dependent on treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Spinks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spinks 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 1996 in the United States, the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey estimated that 18 million patients sought treatment for a sore throat, making it the sixth leading cause of visits to physicians (<LINK REF="REF-Joan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joan 2003</LINK>). As many as four to six times that number may not seek treatment for a sore throat (<LINK REF="REF-Goslings-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goslings 1963</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spinks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spinks 2011</LINK>). It is the second most common illness for which Australians seek medical attention. Recent data from the 'Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health' (BEACH) project showed that 4% of all symptomatic presentations to general practitioners were for throat complaints, second to cough at 7% (<LINK REF="REF-Danchin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Danchin 2002</LINK>). The incidence is higher internationally (<LINK REF="REF-Kazzi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazzi 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients complain of a sudden onset of painful throat or pain on swallowing, which can be accompanied by fever, headache, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and skin rash. Signs may include tonsillo-pharyngeal erythema, tonsillo-pharyngeal exudate, soft palate petechiae, beefy-red swollen uvula, and swollen and tender anterior cervical lymph nodes (<LINK REF="REF-Cauwenberge-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cauwenberge 1999</LINK>). Not all patients have all signs and symptoms as many cases are milder and do not have an exudate.</P>
<P>The disease is usually temporary and mild, however it can lead to serious ear and sinus infections, and occasionally acute rheumatic fever if effective treatment is not instigated early (<LINK REF="REF-Kirse-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirse 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McIsaac-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIsaac 2000</LINK>). Other possible complications include nephritis, myocarditis, and other connective tissue diseases.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-01-30 17:21:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sore throats, while very common, can be painful and uncomfortable. Management of sore throat includes symptomatic treatment, antibiotic therapy for Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS) pharyngitis and, if clinically indicated, surgical treatment, including tonsillectomy.</P>
<P>The efficacy of antibiotics for reducing the duration of symptoms is modest. The reduction of illness time is greatest in the middle of the illness period; that is, the mean absolute reduction is approximately one day at around day three (<LINK REF="REF-Spinks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spinks 2011</LINK>). Also, penicillin B treatment showed a more rapid resolution of the symptoms than a placebo in adult patients with an acute sore throat and (group A) streptococcal pharyngitis (<LINK REF="REF-Zwart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zwart 2001</LINK>). Dexamethasone appears effective as an adjuvant to antibiotic therapy in the treatment of acute, severe exudative pharyngitis because it reduces the duration and severity of pain in these patients (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>In conclusion, the indiscriminate use of antibiotic therapy for adults with sore throat is not endorsed. A diagnostic and therapeutic rationale, that limits antibiotic therapy to patients most likely to benefit, must consider the low prevalence of GABHS pharyngitis in adults, the magnitude of the benefits and the risks for allergic reaction to therapy, and antibiotic resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2001</LINK>). Other risks of prescribing antibiotics include diarrhoea, rashes, candidiasis, unplanned pregnancy secondary to oral contraceptive failure, and the rare occurrence of anaphylaxis. Another consequence is to 'medicalise' the condition of sore throat, resulting in increasing re-attendance for future episodes of this condition (<LINK REF="REF-Little-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Little 1997</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-02-09 13:59:41 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In Western medicine, the administration of antibiotics is likely to shorten the time to the remittance of symptoms and reduce the likelihood of complications in patients whose sore throat has a bacteriological aetiology. However, their benefits may be limited in the treatment of sore throat more generally (<LINK REF="REF-Spinks-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spinks 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for sore throat for thousands of years. According to TCM theory, sore throat may have either external or internal causes. Common external causes are pathogenic wind, cold, heat, fire, and dryness. Internal causes are usually related to excess heat or fire, Yin deficiency, or phlegm. According to different symptoms or causes, the treatment principle of TCM for sore throat is to expel the external pathogens and to clear the excess of toxic heat, fire, or phlegm. Antiviral, antiasthmatic, antitussive, and fever-relieving herbs are the basic elements of a prescription. Their effects have been demonstrated by pharmacological studies, for example, Radix Scutellariae has an antiphlogistic effect (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 1990</LINK>); Radix Glycyrrhizae has an expectorant effect (<LINK REF="REF-Zhu-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 1976</LINK>); Folium Perillae has an antitussive effect (<LINK REF="REF-Yu-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yu 1986</LINK>); Radix Astragali has an antiperspirant effect; and Fructus Xanthii helps relieve nasal obstruction, and so on.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-02-09 23:45:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In recent years, there has been an increase in public interest in the range of therapies which lie outside the 'mainstream' medical practice because of the overuse of antibiotics and the emergence of drug resistant bacteria. Natural medicinal herbal remedies may help to alleviate the pain of sore throat. However, there are concerns regarding adverse events, for example, allergic reactions and Chinese herbal nephropathy (CHN) (<LINK REF="REF-Lampert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lampert 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lord-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lord 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nortier-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nortier 2000</LINK>). Because the majority of clinical research into TCM as a treatment for sore throat failed to meet world standards of clinical research reporting, the review authors could not recommend any preparation or formulation for clinical use in the first publication of our review (<LINK REF="REF-Shi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shi 2007</LINK>). The scientific evidence that Chinese herbal medicines are more effective than other conventional treatments in treating sore throat is inadequate. Four years on and there are many new clinical research trials of Chinese medicinal herbs in the treatment of sore throat. Based on the new evidence, this review aims to summarise the existing literature of the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicines for treating uncomplicated sore throat.</P>

<P>We assessed risk of bias of RCTs using the following quality criteria specified in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We described the possible sources of bias (below) which are reflected in the 'Risk of bias' table for each included study. We classified each of these sources as of low, high, or unclear risk of bias to each of the questions in the table. Whenever possible we included additional information with a clarifying comment or a quoted sentence taken directly from the original article.<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described the methods used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups (selection bias) for each included study. Methods are categorised as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk: adequate (any truly random process, e.g. random number table, computer random number generator, coin tossing, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice, drawing of lots);</LI>
<LI>high risk: inadequate (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth, some rules based on date (or day) of admission, any rules based on hospital or clinic record number); or</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence in sufficient detail and determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment. Methods are categorised as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk: adequate concealment (e.g. central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy controlled randomisation); sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk: inadequate concealment (using an open random allocation schedule; assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards; alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure); or</LI>

<P>We described for each included study and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported; the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants); reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported; and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. We planned to re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertook where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors. Methods are categorised as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk: studies where few drop-out/losses to follow-up were noted and an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was possible;</LI>

<P>We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. Methods are categorised as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk: where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported;</LI>
<LI>high risk: where not all of the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcome was not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">6. Free from other sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias such as conflict of interest. We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias. Methods are categorised as:</P>

We excluded two studies because random allocation was mentioned but the procedure was not described and we could not obtain sufficient information from the study author. We excluded sixteen studies due to inadequate random allocation or allocation was according to the patients' order of admittance. Among the previous studies awaiting classification, we excluded nine studies because random allocation had not been mentioned. We excluded two trials because the author forgot the randomisation procedure, and we excluded a further nine studies due to inadequate random allocation (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table).</P>

This is in marked contrast to pharmacological agents used in Western medicine, in which the chemical constituents, their quantities and the percentage of any impurities or contaminants are precisely known; and the variation between different production batches is kept within specified limits. Variation between formulations and batches of formulations are inevitable consequences of TCM, though the Chinese Government specifies acceptable limits of variation. This variation is a factor that may contribute to any heterogeneity between different study results. So, when a study uses a self-prepared herbal formulation, the quality of herbs and methods of preparation should be stated in detail, in order to achieve consistent effects.</P>
<P>Another problem is that the formulation components were not adequately described. The variability in individual components of herbal preparations and the variability between different preparations of combination products, means that any meaningful scientific evaluation is very difficult without precise descriptions of the components of TCM formulations for decision makers' consideration. Also, Chinese names for herbal preparations are not sufficient; in addition to the folk or TCM special names, each preparation should be described, giving internationally recognised taxonomic names (genus species) of all plants included, plant organ, and proportions.</P>
<P>Furthermore, one must accept that the overall treatment concept for TCM is different to that used in Western medicine. We know that when using a TCM preparation for treating a disease, the type of 'zheng' of a disease has to be matched to the treatment. Unfortunately some studies did not state whether the TCM control drug matched the type of 'zheng&#8242; or not. For example, Ertong Qingyan Jiere Koufuye (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2004</LINK>) should be used to treat acute pharyngitis with 'feiwei shire zheng'. However, if the control drug Fufang Shuanghua Koufuye was not well matched to this 'zheng', Ertong Qingyan Jiere Koufuye would logically prove to be more effective than Fufang Shuanghua Koufuye, due to the poor choice of the control drug. We suggest TCM study authors explain each 'zheng' by using conventional drug terms, as this will be more informative for both physicians and consumers when selecting an appropriate preparation.<BR/>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-02-09 23:48:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>The overall quality of evidence is rated as 'very low' (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the studies included used a placebo as a control; instead 'positive effect drugs' were selected. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Qin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Qin 2003</LINK>) compared different types of the same preparation 'Shuanghuanglian'; this is an 'equivalence effect test' (the study aims to demonstrate that the intervention's effect is the same as the control) or 'non-inferiority effect test' (the trial aims to demonstrate that the intervention's effect is not less effective than the control) study. The remaining six trials used a 'superiority effect test' (the study aims to demonstrate that the intervention is better than the control). However, of these, only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gao-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 2004</LINK>) were double-blinded and two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Qin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Qin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 1998</LINK>) were single-blinded for patients; the other three studies did not use blinding. None of the studies performed allocation concealment.</P>
<P>A large number of the studies claimed to be RCTs but when we contacted the authors about the method of randomisation they used, we found that most of the study authors misunderstood the concept of randomisation. In addition to this, some of the studies were conducted several years ago and the study authors may have forgotten the details of the methodology they employed, which could lead to bias and influence the veracity of information. For example, when the author of an excluded study (<LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2003</LINK>) was contacted, the author explained the randomisation method involved using a random numbers table. However, the description in the introduction conflicted: "In recent years, I tried to use a variated TCM formulation 'Xiaoyao Shan' to treat 63 chronic pharyngitis patients"; that is, the article was a retrospective study or a personal clinical experience recollection.</P>
<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Qin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Qin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 1998</LINK>) used unequal arms in their design. Of these studies, <LINK REF="STD-Qin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Qin 2003</LINK> used a proportion of 3:1 and only 20 patients were included in the control group (20 out of 60). Consideration of the sample sizes was not reported and thus the studies cannot detect differences between the two groups, which may lead to a low test power.</P>
<P>None of the studies described how the outcomes were assessed. In particular, the methods for testing TCM sign outcomes should be stated in detail.<BR/>
<BR/>We would like to suggest not using 'marked improvement' and 'improvement' as outcomes for testing the effects of treating sore throat, as the results of these two outcomes were based on the participants' feelings and assessor's subjective judgement. Instead, we suggest using endpoint outcomes, such as 'recovery' and 'no improvement'.<BR/>
<BR/>The poor methodological quality of the studies may result in false positive findings. For example, by not concealing interventions in the 'equivalence effect test' or 'non-inferiority effect test', participants could be biased towards reporting equivalent outcomes. If blinding and allocation concealment were not used, performance bias, detection bias and selection bias are potential risks.</P>
<P>We also found that there was no evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of the 'positive control drugs', which were often used as controls in studies, for sore throat. Therefore, for those interventions that were shown to be equal in efficacy to the control, no conclusion about the efficacy of the intervention can be made. This is the case for the following interventions: Shuanghuangliang Hanpian versus Shuanghuanglian granula for acute pharyngitis (<LINK REF="STD-Qin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Qin 2003</LINK>), Qingyan Lihou aerosol versus Shuangliao Houfeng San aerosol for acute pharyngitis (<LINK REF="STD-Sun-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 1998</LINK>), Wuwei Shaji Hanpian versus Jiangzhong Caoshanhu Hanpian (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2002</LINK>), Jinhou aerosol inhalation versus gentamicin for chronic laryngitis (<LINK REF="STD-Li-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1999</LINK>), and Qingkailing tablet versus Jinsang Kaiyin Wan for acute  pharyngitis (<LINK REF="STD-Gao-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>In five studies, the intervention formulations were prepared by the study author or their colleagues and the prepared drugs were made in the study author's hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Gao-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 1998</LINK>). In these studies, the study authors conducted the study and designed the formulation and the. Therefore the results could be biased in favour of the intervention. For example, although <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 2004</LINK> showed their self-prepared Yanhouling Heji was more effective than gentamicin, their evidence is considered weak since we are unable to rule out the influence of conflict, selection bias, and performance bias.</P>
<P>Finally, we considered that it is important to include TCM signs as a secondary or an additional outcome in the review. However, it is difficult to compare or quantify TCM signs as they are subjective outcomes. For example, 'mai xiang' means pulse presentations. Diagnosing 'mai xiang' in TCM is a complex and difficult technique, dependent on the TCM physician's feeling and experience. TCM researchers and physicians should find a gold standard method which is repeatable and easy to practice to measure TCM signs.</P>

<P>Because the majority of clinical research for TCM in the treatment of sore throat failed to meet world standards of clinical research reporting, the review authors could not recommend any preparation or formulation for clinical use in the first publication of our review (<LINK REF="REF-Shi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shi 2007</LINK>). From August 2006 to June 2011, we identified 25 new studies but excluded 20 new studies due to the poor quality of the research design and implementation. We did not find any well-designed studies to provide strong evidence for Chinese traditional herbal medicines for the treatment of sore throat. Chinese herbal medicines are widely used to treat sore throat and most are non-prescription drugs. Their medicinal effects and side effects are unclear and we strongly recommend quality research in this area.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-30 22:03:41 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinical studies assessing herbal medicines for treating sore throat should use adequate randomisation methods and the allocation sequence should be sealed. Future studies should use a placebo or no treatment as a control. If a herbal medicine is used as a control, only those medicines which have a demonstrated effect on sore throat should be used. Blinding for participants, researches and outcome detectors is necessary. Except for the designer, researchers should not know whether the study uses an 'equivalence effect test' or 'non-inferior test'. The design for calculating the sample size should be reported. The trial should be conducted by researchers other than the formulation designer and the preparation maker. Endpoint outcomes should be used to assess the effect of treatment rather than subjective outcomes. A gold standard method which is repeatable and easy to perform should be used to measure the TCM signs. The information on conducting the study should be reported in detail according to CONSORT (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).</P>
