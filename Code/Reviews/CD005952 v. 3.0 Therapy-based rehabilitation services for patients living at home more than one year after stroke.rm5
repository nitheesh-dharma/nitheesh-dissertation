<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Therapy-based rehabilitation services for patients living at home more than one year after stroke</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>It is unclear if rehabilitation provided more than one year after a stroke can improve recovery. People who are recovering from a stroke for one year or more often have persistent disabilities. Although therapy-based rehabilitation for such patients is an accepted part of stroke management, the evidence base for such practice is unclear. We identified only five clinical trials, including 487 participants, which showed a tendency towards improved recovery but the results were inconclusive. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Current practice of rehabilitation intervention mainly concentrates on the first six months of stroke. At present, there is no agreed consensus about the benefits of such a service more than one year after stroke. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To ascertain whether therapy-based rehabilitation services can influence outcome one year or more after stroke.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the trials registers of the following Cochrane Review Groups: Stroke Group (last searched September 2007), Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (last searched October 2006) and Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (last searched October 2006). We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>Issue 4, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2006), EMBASE (1980 to October 2006), CINAHL (1982 to October 2006), AMED (1985 to October 2006), PEDro (1952 to October 2006), British Nursing Index (1993 to October 2006), DARE (1994 to October 2006), HMIC (1979 to October 2006) and NHS EED (1991 to October 2006). We also searched dissertation databases and ongoing trials and research registers, scanned reference lists and contacted researchers and experts in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled trials of community-based stroke patients, in which at least 75% were recruited one year after stroke and received a therapy-based rehabilitation intervention that was compared with conventional care. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials and extracted data on a number of pre-specified outcomes. The primary outcomes were the proportion of participants who had deteriorated or were dependent in personal activities of daily living at the end of scheduled follow up.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We identified five trials of 487 participants that were eligible for the review. Overall, there was inconclusive evidence as to whether therapy-based rehabilitation intervention one year after stroke was able to influence any relevant patient or carer outcome. Trials varied in design, type of interventions provided, quality, and outcomes assessed.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review highlights the dearth of evidence investigating long-term therapy-based rehabilitation interventions for patients with stroke. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-07 11:52:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Stroke remains the leading cause of death and disability both in developed and developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-MacKay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacKay 2004</LINK>). In 2004 the World Health Organization (WHO) predicted that the number of stroke cases will increase, despite stable incidence rates, due to the increasing trend in ageing populations worldwide. In the United Kingdom alone, stroke remains the third leading cause of death with an estimated 110,000 first stroke cases reported yearly (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2004</LINK>). It has also been reported that approximately 450,000 disabled stroke survivors are now residing in the United Kingdom, with 33% functionally dependent at one year post stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Stroke-Assoc-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stroke Assoc 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Systematic literature searches have demonstrated that there have been numerous developments in the field of stroke management, especially in managing acute stroke patients in a hospital setting. Multi-disciplinary team organisation has been recognised as an important and significant factor in post-acute stroke care (<LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 2001</LINK>). More recently, a systematic review examining the effectiveness of early supported discharge services for acute stroke patients found that these services can reduce the length of hospital stay but remains unclear about further costs and benefits to patient outcome (<LINK REF="REF-ESDT-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESDT 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Current practice of rehabilitation interventions mainly concentrate on the first six months of stroke (<LINK REF="REF-RCP-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCP 2004</LINK>). This period of intervention has possibly been based on published data on the pattern of stroke recovery, suggesting that most recovery occurs within the first six months after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Tilling-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tilling 2001</LINK>). However, several studies have documented that many stroke patients have persistent disability at one year after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Lincoln-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lincoln 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wade-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wade 1992</LINK>). The Outpatient Service Trialists systematic review found that people living at home within a year of having a stroke and receiving therapy-based rehabilitation services at home were more independent in their activities of daily living (ADL) and less likely to deteriorate in their ability to perform such activities (<LINK REF="REF-OST-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">OST 2004</LINK>). The European Stroke Initiative in 2003 suggested that active rehabilitation should be administered as long as an objective improvement in neurological dysfunction is observed in patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hacke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hacke 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite continuing disability, the provision of therapy-based rehabilitation services a year or more post stroke is low. At present, there is no agreed consensus about the benefits of such a service more than one year after stroke. We planned to systematically review the available literature including all randomised trials in view of the null hypothesis that therapy-based rehabilitation services did not affect the recovery of patients living at home more than one year after stroke. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>In this systematic review, we addressed the following questions.<BR/>(1) Can therapy-based rehabilitation services influence the outcome of stroke patients (and carers) one year or more after the index stroke?<BR/>(2) Which outcomes are influenced by therapy-based rehabilitation services, for example, dependency, social activities, mood or functional deterioration?</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-10-07 11:52:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-10-06 16:06:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included all unconfounded, truly randomised controlled trials of stroke patients or trials which included a defined subgroup of stroke patients, resident in the community more than one year after stroke onset, receiving a therapy-based rehabilitation service intervention which is compared with conventional care (that is, normal or usual care or no intervention). Conventional care is defined as the routine or usual care patients have received after one year post stroke. This included any therapy provided in outpatient department or day hospital.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included studies which recruited participants with a clinical diagnosis of stroke regardless of their age or sex or ethnic group, as long as they were resident in a community setting and were randomised to treatment more than one year after stroke onset. We included studies where at least 75% of participants were more than one year after stroke at randomisation. We followed the WHO criteria for stroke, that is 'a clinical syndrome of presumed vascular origin characterised by rapidly developing sign of focal or global disturbance of cerebral functions lasting more than 24 hours or leading to death' (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1978</LINK>). We excluded trials with subarachnoid haemorrhage, unless a subgroup of stroke patients could be identified for which there were separate results.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We reviewed trials that investigated therapy-based rehabilitation services with the following features.<BR/>(1) Outpatient: the intervention must be targeted towards stroke patients living at home (nursing home, residential, or any other type of residential address). The exact type (e.g. domiciliary, day hospital, home-based care, outpatient clinic) was recorded but not used as an exclusion criterion. <BR/>(2) Therapy-based rehabilitation: interventions provided by a qualified physiotherapist, occupational therapist or multidisciplinary staff, or under the supervision of qualified therapy staff working with patients to improve task-orientated behaviour (e.g. walking, dressing) and to reduce disability (<LINK REF="REF-OST-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">OST 2004</LINK>).<BR/>(3) Services: any intervention that required an organisational and staffing structure (that is one that requires rehabilitation therapy staff). Inclusion criteria for services were: (a) where an intervention was tested at the service level, not at the level of a specific therapeutic technique; (b) where the service intervention was routinely directed to a wide group of stroke patients. We included trials which received no routine intervention or normal practice. The exact type of control was recorded but not used as an exclusion criterion. </P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-10-06 16:06:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We used the following outcomes to assess the objectives of this systematic review. The outcomes reflected the full burden of disabling illness and probable target of therapy-based rehabilitation services (<LINK REF="REF-OST-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">OST 2004</LINK>). We recorded the following outcomes to represent the full burden of disabling illness.</P>

<P>(1) Case fatality (death) at the end of follow up.<BR/>(2) Patient's performance in extended activities of daily living (EADL) by the end of scheduled follow up.<BR/>(3) Patient's subjective health status or quality of life at the end of scheduled follow up.<BR/>(4) Patient's mood at the end of scheduled follow up.<BR/>(5) Carer's mood at the end of scheduled follow up.<BR/>(6) Re-admission to hospital and days spent in hospital at the end of scheduled follow up.<BR/>(7) Patient and carer satisfaction with services at the end of scheduled follow up.</P>
<P>Secondary outcome measures (2), (3), (4), and (5) were measured using available measures as reported within the studies.

<P>We searched the trials register of the following Cochrane Review Groups: Stroke Group (last searched September 2007), Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (last searched October 2006), and Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (last searched October 2006). We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2006, lssue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2006) (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>), EMBASE (1980 to October 2006), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to October 2006), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (1985 to October 2006), Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) (1952 to October 2006), British Nursing Index (1993 to October 2006), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (1994 to October 2006), Health Management Information Consortium database (HMIC) (1979 to October 2006), NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) (1991 to October 2006), Dissertation Abstracts (1961 to October 2006), Aslib Index to UK theses (1970 to October 2006), National Research Register (http://www.nrr.nhs.uk/, Issue 4, 2006), Medical Research Council Register (http://www.ctu.mrc.ac.uk/, October 2006), Current Research in Britain (CRIB) (http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/, October 2006), HSRPRoj (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hsproj/, October 2006). In order to avoid duplication, the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Search Co-ordinator was regularly consulted.

<P>Two review authors (NA, MW) checked the titles and abstracts identified from the searches. If it was clear that the study did not refer to a randomised controlled trial of therapy-based rehabilitation, it was excluded. Two review authors (NA, MW) independently assessed each study to determine whether it met the pre-defined selection criteria; any disagreements were resolved through discussion and overall consensus with the review team.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (NA, MW) independently assessed the quality of the included studies. This quality assessment included an evaluation of the following components:<BR/>(1) the method of generation of the randomisation sequence;<BR/>(2) the method of allocation concealment (considered adequate if the assignment cannot be foreseen);<BR/>(3) who was blinded or not blinded (participants, clinicians, outcome assessors);<BR/>(4) how many participants were lost to follow up in each arm (split into post-randomisation exclusions and later losses if possible);<BR/>(5) whether the participants were analysed in the groups to which they were originally randomised (intention to treat).</P>
<P>We assessed additional components for each trial since these may produce biased estimates of treatment effect. The additional components were:<BR/>(6) sample size calculation declared;<BR/>(7) inclusion and exclusion criteria defined;<BR/>(8) time to follow up;<BR/>(9) baseline comparability of severity, age, and gender;<BR/>(10) conflict of interest;<BR/>(11) appropriateness of statistical analyses (this criterion was considered if the original data could not be extracted from the publication).</P>
<P>We recorded this information in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table and a description of the quality of each study was given based on these components.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Three review authors (NA, MW and JL-B) performed data extraction independently and any disagreements were resolved through discussion with the review team. If possible, we obtained any missing data from the authors of the relevant studies. We used a standardised data collection form in order to summarise the information from the trials. One author (JL-B) entered and checked the data. If available, we sought individual patient data from the original trialists, which were standardised and re-analysed and the resulting group data used in preference to the published data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>For studies with a similar type of therapy-based rehabilitation we performed a meta-analysis to calculate a weighted treatment effect across trials using a random-effects model (DerSimonian and Laird model). We expressed the results as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. The results were also expressed as the number needed to treat, if appropriate, for a range of plausible control event rates. Where it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis, either due to too much heterogeneity or where there is a lack of evidence, we summarised the data for each study. Results from cluster randomised controlled trials were extracted directly from the published article, and were not pooled with the results from the parallel group trials.</P>
<P>We assessed heterogeneity between the studies using I squared (I<SUP>2</SUP>)<SUP> </SUP>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>). If substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> greater than 50%) existed between studies for the primary outcome measures, we explored reasons for the heterogeneity, such as types of service. Owing to a lack of eligible studies we did not conduct a sensitivity analysis to explore methodological quality.</P>
<P>Data relating to dependency were dichotomised irrespective of the scale used, (e.g. Barthel Index 0 to 55; modified Rankin score 3 to 5). Where non-consistent cut offs were used across trials, we used the raw individual patient data to create consistent categories. Where more than one disability or dependency measurement scale has been used within a trial, the most frequently used measurement scale across trials was used for the primary analysis. We conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the effects of the individual measurement scales. We defined deterioration as any worsening in activities of daily living as measured by a recognised and validated assessment, for example Barthel Index scale and Nottingham Extended Daily Living Scale.</P>

One study (<LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2006</LINK>) recruited participants from 12 nursing or residential homes in Oxfordshire. One study employed additional measures for recruiting participants which included advertisements, radio broadcast, and help from general practitioners (GPs) and community workers (<LINK REF="STD-Wade-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wade 1992</LINK>). Four trials recruited participants one year or more after stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wade-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wade 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Werner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Werner 1996</LINK>), whereas the remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Mulder-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mulder 1989</LINK>) recruited participants within a set time frame of six months to five years after stroke.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Stroke status </HEADING>
<P>Information on the type of stroke was available for three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulder-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mulder 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wade-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wade 1992</LINK>). With respect to the type of stroke, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK>) reported 31% (26/85) of participants in the intervention group had a left hemiparesis compared to 47% (40/85) in the control group; 66% (56/85) with a right hemiparesis in the intervention group compared to 52% (44/85) in the control group; and 4% in the intervention group have had other types of stroke compared to 1% in the control group. Mulder and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Mulder-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mulder 1989</LINK>) documented that 47% (18/38) of participants in the intervention group had a left hemiplegia compared to 27% (5/18) in the control group; 24% (9/38) with a right hemiplegia in the intervention group compared to 39% (7/18) in the control group. Only one study reported the percentage of participants with a previous stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK>), where 24% of participants were known to have had at least one episode of previous stroke prior to randomisation. In the <LINK REF="STD-Werner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Werner 1996</LINK> study, the mean number of years post-acute stroke was three years (standard deviation 1.8 years), whereas <LINK REF="STD-Mulder-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mulder 1989</LINK> reported the mean number of years post stroke as 2.5 years (range eight months to seven years). There was no information on years post stroke reported from the three remaining trials (<LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wade-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wade 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>With regards to the sequale of stroke, impairment in communication was reported in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulder-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mulder 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wade-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wade 1992</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK> study, aphasia was reported as 39% (33/85) in the intervention group compared with 26% (22/85) in the control group. Mulder and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Mulder-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mulder 1989</LINK>) documented that 7.9% (3/38) in the intervention group had limited communication compared to 11% (2/18) in the control group. In the <LINK REF="STD-Wade-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wade 1992</LINK> study, clinically-judged abnormal communication was reported in 12% (6/49) of participants in the early intervention group compared to 11% (5/45) of participants in the late intervention group. Two other complications were also reported in this study: clinically-judged abnormal cognition, which was reported in 10% (5/49) of participants in the early intervention group compared with 11% (5/45) of participants in the late intervention group; and sensory loss was reported in 45% (22/49) of participants in the early intervention group compared with 58% (26/45) of participants in the late intervention group. Impairment of short orientation and memory concentration was reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2006</LINK> trial, with 62% (39/63) of participants reported with this sequale in the intervention group compared with 58% (32/55) of participants in the standard care (control) group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Stroke care </HEADING>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK>) reported that 75% of participants in the intervention group were admitted to hospital at the time of stroke compared with 76% (65/85) of participants in the control group. Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wade-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wade 1992</LINK>) documented the mean delay in treatment for participants in the early intervention group was 53 months (standard deviation 29.5 months) compared with 59.6 months (standard deviation 35.3 months) in the late intervention group. No similar data were available for the other three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mulder-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mulder 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Werner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Werner 1996</LINK>). Only two trials provided information regarding type of care received by participants prior to recruitment. In the <LINK REF="STD-Wade-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wade 1992</LINK> trial, 27% (13/49) of participants in the early intervention group lived alone compared with 20% (9/45) in the late intervention group; 67% (33/49) of participants in the early intervention group were with carers compared with 71% (32/45) of participants in the late intervention group; and 6% (3/49) of participants in the early intervention group compared with 9% (4/45) of participants in the late intervention group were institutionalised prior to recruitment. In the <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK> trial, 24% (20/85) of participants in the intervention group compared with 31% (26/85) of participants in the control group lived alone prior to recruitment, and no other type of care was further described. In the <LINK REF="STD-Wade-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wade 1992</LINK> trial, 10% (5/49) of participants in the early intervention group compared with 9.0% (4/45) of participants in the late intervention group had received physiotherapy before randomisation.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study intervention and comparison</HEADING>
<P>For details of the comparisons made within the five trials, please refer to 'Characteristics of included studies' table. Two of the trials focused on a problem-solving approach with a single discipline rehabilitation intervention (physiotherapy), although the exact interventional approach applied in each study was different (<LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wade-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wade 1992</LINK>). One further study focused on a single discipline intervention (occupational therapy) (<LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2006</LINK>). Two trials used a multi-disciplinary rehabilitation intervention where a combination of physiotherapy and occupational therapy in a outpatient setting was used (<LINK REF="STD-Mulder-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mulder 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Werner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Werner 1996</LINK>). For the <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK> trial, a problem solving approach by a registered physiotherapist using an assessment was used. Participants were seen in their own home or at the outpatient rehabilitation centres. In the <LINK REF="STD-Wade-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wade 1992</LINK> trial, although a similar problem solving approach was used as the method of intervention, the trial compared early intervention and late intervention groups, using same-treatment modalities but in different time periods. The intervention was based on goal-orientated therapy, offering advice to solve problems identified during the initial assessments. The <LINK REF="STD-Mulder-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mulder 1989</LINK> study<B> </B>compared one intervention group and three control groups in a structured rehabilitation programme that encompassed meetings and activities, supervised by a physiotherapist and an occupational therapist. The trial did not explain the nature of the activities received by the control groups. In the <LINK REF="STD-Werner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Werner 1996</LINK> trial, the intervention was based on functional task modalities administered by a registered physiotherapist and an occupational therapist in an outpatient rehabilitation setting. In the <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2006</LINK> trial, the trial compared treatment intervention against routine care using a client-centred approach, where the intervention was provided by a qualified occupational therapist targeted towards improving independence in personal activities of daily living.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intensity of intervention</HEADING>
<P>All five trials provided information regarding the intensity of intervention given to participants. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Mulder-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mulder 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Werner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Werner 1996</LINK>) provided fixed structured sessions to participants in the intervention groups, whereas in the other three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wade-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wade 1992</LINK>) the intervention sessions were tailored according to the participant's baseline assessments. In the <LINK REF="STD-Werner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Werner 1996</LINK> trial, an intensive 12-week programme was provided that encompassed an hour of physiotherapy and occupational therapy for four days each week. In the <LINK REF="STD-Mulder-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mulder 1989</LINK> trial a longer intervention period consisting of 22 fortnightly meetings for a total duration of a year was provided, where each meeting lasted 2.5 hours with activities encompassing exercises or games, discussions and recreational activities. The <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK> trial described their intervention programme as a standard maximum contact of 13 weeks with a minimum of three contacts per person during the intervention period. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Wade-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wade 1992</LINK> used a mean of four visits (standard deviation 2.5 visits) per participant, with most participants being seen one to six times during the intervention period. Participants in this study spent on average two hours and four minutes (standard deviation 28 minutes) during each session. The <LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2006</LINK> trial provided a flexible three-month intervention period dependent on the agreed goals between the participant and therapist. The intervention sessions were designed to address the multi-faceted needs of the care-home participants that encompassed task specific practices, provision of aids and adaptations and specific therapeutic interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2006</LINK>).</P>

The remaining trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mulder-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mulder 1989</LINK>) reported no differences in baseline characteristics for age and stroke characteristics (hand function, communication and hemineglect), but reported more women and more participants with right-sided hemiplegia. In addition, this trial reported a high drop-out rate from the study, however final analysis showed no differences in the percentage of drop outs between the intervention and the control group . Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Werner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Werner 1996</LINK>) also reported high rates of drop out from the study, and thus recruited five additional controls towards the end of the study; however no difference in baseline comparability of the groups were reported.</P>

Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2006</LINK>) reported global poor outcome at the end of six-month follow up. A significant difference in global poor outcome was seen between the intervention and control groups relating to a 26% difference in favour of the intervention group (51% versus 76%) (95% CI, 3% to 48%; P = 0.03, using x<SUP>2</SUP> test and adjusted for cluster design). There were no data available for the remaining four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulder-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mulder 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wade-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wade 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Werner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Werner 1996</LINK>) regarding death or poor outcome.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-06 16:12:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In recent years the importance of therapy-based rehabilitation services a year or more after stroke has received little attention. The provision of further rehabilitation at this time point may be particularly relevant as this aspect of care aims to promote patients' independence and reintegration into the community. To date, the benefits of such services have not been fully evaluated. Hence, this systematic review assessed the effectiveness of therapy-based rehabilitation for stroke patients living at home a year or more after stroke. It also sought to address which outcome may have been influenced by the rehabilitation intervention provided.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Findings</HEADING>
<P>The review has been constrained by the studies available to us. Overall, there was inconclusive evidence whether therapy-based rehabilitation interventions one year or more after stroke was able to influence any relevant patient or carer outcome. This review found a paucity of trials evaluating rehabilitation interventions at a year or more after stroke and those that were available varied in methodological design, type of interventions provided and the quality and outcomes assessed.</P>
<P>The primary outcome of this review, death or deterioration in ability to perform activities of daily living, was not reported in all included trials. These findings are consistent with those of the Outpatient Service Trialist review (<LINK REF="REF-OST-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">OST 2004</LINK>) which found that none of the trials reported a similar outcome. In this review, the trial intervention was either a single discipline intervention (physiotherapist, occupational therapist) or a combined intervention. However, all trials showed a similar approach that was based on a problem-solving method as a focus of intervention. This may suggest that, although each trial was different in design and methodology, the nature of the rehabilitation intervention itself shared a common aim, that is to reduce the level of disability by altering task-orientated behaviour and goal-orientated activities.</P>
<P>Finally, although this review failed to demonstrate potential benefits of rehabilitation intervention a year or more after stroke, it must be emphasized that the lack of evidence of benefit is not the same as evidence of a lack of benefit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations of review</HEADING>
<P>A considerable amount of literature has been identified during the review process, but of the 35 trials, only five were randomised controlled trials looking at one year or more after stroke. We believe our search strategy was comprehensive as we were able to identify a number of unpublished studies and were able to contact some of the original trialists for additional information, hence minimizing the risk of publication bias.</P>
<P>In our review there are a number of methodological concerns which must be acknowledged. Firstly, of the five trials meeting the inclusion criteria, only four were eligible for meta-analysis. The trial by Sackley et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sackley-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sackley 2006</LINK>) was a cluster RCT, hence it was different in design and therefore did not qualify to be pooled with the other RCTs. Trials were of variable quality with concealed randomisation in two trials, blinding of outcome assessors in four trials and intention-to-treat analysis in two trials. Therefore, the results of the individual trials need to be interpreted with caution. Secondly, the findings from this review are restricted by the limited number of comparable outcome measures used. Included trials demonstrated clinical heterogeneity in the intervention tested, duration of follow up and the selection criteria for participants included. However, in order to maintain the robustness of the findings from the review, we have stated in advance the criteria for trial inclusion and acceptable outcomes to reflect the range of limited activity and participation that we feel are related with longer-term stroke. Finally, two of the included trials were subjected to considerable rates of attrition which may raise the possibility of bias.</P>
<P>In view of the heterogeneous nature of the trials reviewed, interpretation was a major difficulty in this review. Therefore the overall results of the analysis should not be viewed as conclusive evidence of the benefit of rehabilitation intervention one year or more after stroke. To provide a more detailed understanding of the variation between the trials we have described the individual characteristics of the trials included in the review.</P>
<P>This review highlights the dearth of evidence investigating long-term therapy-based rehabilitation interventions for patients with stroke. Evaluations of stroke rehabilitation interventions have previously focussed on the acute phase of care, most likely due to a perception that rehabilitation potential has plateaued by six months after stroke. The fact that there are currently only a few services that offer routine follow up after six months of stroke may have further contributed to the lack of evidence for this area.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The National Stroke Strategy emphasises the need for long-term rehabilitation for stroke patients, but yet this review shows that there is insufficient evidence to support the development of such services. Whilst we are in support of such long-term services, it is mandatory that these services are evaluated as they are being implemented.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The analysis was based on a review of trials with different methodological qualities that restricts the overall findings of this review. Future trials in rehabilitation interventions should incorporate standardised methodological qualities such as clearly defined randomisation and allocation concealment methods, intention-to-treat analysis, clearly defined rehabilitation interventions and standardised outcomes to be used in each trial. This proposal is needed to provide more robust analysis in future meta-analysis in this topic.</P>
