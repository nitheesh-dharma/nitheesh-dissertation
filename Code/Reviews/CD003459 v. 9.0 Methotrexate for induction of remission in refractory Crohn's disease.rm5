<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-09 10:44:37 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Although corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant side effects. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to treat active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. This review includes seven randomized trials with a total of 495 participants. There is evidence from one large study which suggests that methotrexate (25 mg/week) injected intramuscularly for 16 weeks among patients with active treatment resistant Crohn's disease may provide a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids. This reduction in steroid use could reduce steroid-induced side effects for people with chronic Crohn's disease. Although side effects are more common with high dose methotrexate therapy, no serious side effects have been observed. Common side effects associated with methotrexate therapy include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache. Studies comparing lower dose oral methotrexate (12.5 to 15 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. sugar pill) or other active drugs (e.g. azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine) indicate that lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit for treatment of active treatment resistant Crohn's disease. However, these trials were small in size and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Two studies looked at the combination of methotrexate and infliximab (a biological drug) compared to infliximab therapy alone. These studies indicated that the addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies.</P>

<P>Although corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant adverse effects. The success of methotrexate as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis led to its evaluation in patients with refractory Crohn's disease. Methotrexate has been studied for induction of remission of refractory Crohn's disease and has become the principal alternative to azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy. This systematic review is an update of previously published Cochrane reviews.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-07-24 11:41:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The primary outcome was failure to enter remission and withdraw from steroids. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, serious adverse events and quality of life. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each outcome. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the methodological quality of included studies. The GRADE approach was used to assess the overall quality of evidence supporting the primary outcome.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-27 12:21:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Seven studies (495 patients) were included. Four studies were rated as low risk of bias. Three studies were rated as high risk of bias due to open label or single-blind designs. The seven studies differed with respect to participants, intervention, and outcomes to the extent that meta-analysis was considered to be inappropriate. GRADE analyses indicated that the quality of evidence was very low to low for most outcomes due to sparse data and inadequate blinding. Three small studies which employed low dose oral methotrexate showed no statistically significant difference in failure to induce remission between methotrexate and placebo or between methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine. For the study using 15 mg/week of oral methotrexate 33% (5/15) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 11% (2/18) of placebo patients (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 13.31). For the study using 12.5 mg/week of oral methotrexate 62% (16/26) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 54% (14/26) of placebo patients (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.82). This study also had an active comparator arm, 62% (16/26) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 59% (19/32) of 6-mercaptopurine patients (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.57). For the active comparator study using 15 mg/week oral methotrexate, 20% (3/15) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 6% of 6-mercaptopurine patients (RR 3.20, 95% CI 0.37 to 27.49). This study also had a 5-ASA arm and found that methotrexate patients were significantly more likely to enter remission than 5-ASA patients. Twenty per cent (3/15) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 86% (6/7) of 5-ASA patients (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.67). One small study which used a higher dose of intravenous or oral methotrexate (25 mg/week) showed no statistically significant difference between methotrexate and azathioprine. Forty-four per cent (12/27) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 37% of azathioprine patients (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.29). Two studies found no statistically significant difference in failure to enter remission between the combination of infliximab and methotrexate and infliximab monotherapy. One small study utilized intravenous methotrexate (20 mg/week) for 5 weeks and then switched to oral (20 mg/week). Forty-five per cent (5/11) of patients in the combination group failed to enter remission compared to 62% of infliximab patients (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.69). The other study assessing combination therapy utilized subcutaneous methotrexate (maximum dose 25 mg/week). Twenty-four per cent (15/63) of patients in the combination group failed to enter remission compared to 22% (14/63) of infliximab patients (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.03). A large placebo-controlled study which employed a high dose of methotrexate intramuscularly showed a statistically significant benefit relative to placebo. Sixty-one per cent of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 81% of placebo patients (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93; number needed to treat, NNT=5). Withdrawals due to adverse events were significantly more common in methotrexate patients than placebo in this study. Seventeen per cent of methotrexate patients withdrew due to adverse events compared to 2% of placebo patients (RR 8.00, 95% CI 1.09 to 58.51). The incidence of adverse events was significantly more common in methotrexate patients (63%, 17/27) than azathioprine patients (26%, 7/27) in one small study (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.21 to 4.89). No other statistically significant differences in adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events or serious adverse events were reported in any of the other placebo-controlled or active comparator studies. Common adverse events included nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-07-24 11:40:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>There is evidence from a single large randomized trial which suggests that intramuscular methotrexate (25 mg/week) provides a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids in patients with refractory Crohn's disease. Lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any significant benefit relative to placebo or active comparator. However, these trials were small and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Comparative studies of methotrexate to drugs such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine would require the randomization of large numbers of patients. The addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infliximab monotherapy. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-07-24 11:39:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Although corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, approximately 20% of patients who respond relapse when steroids are withdrawn and become steroid dependent (<LINK REF="REF-Binder-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binder 1985</LINK>). Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant adverse effects. Other immunosuppressive agents have been used to try to induce remission of Crohn's disease or reduce the dose of corticosteroid required in corticosteroid dependent patients. A recently updated Cochrane review indicates that purine antimetabolites (i.e. azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine) are not effective for induction of remission in Crohn's disease but may have steroid sparing effects in patients with refractory Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Chande-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chande 2013</LINK>). The use of these agents varies widely among practitioners, perhaps because of concern about adverse effects and efficacy. Cyclosporine has been found to be ineffective for treatment of Crohn's disease and is a nephrotoxic drug (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2005</LINK>). The success of methotrexate as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis led to its evaluation in patients with refractory Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Baron-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baron 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Houben-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Houben 1994</LINK>). Methotrexate has been studied for induction of remission of refractory Crohn's disease and has become the principal alternative to azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of methotrexate for the treatment of active refractory Crohn's disease. This systematic review is an update of previously published Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Alfadhli-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfadhli 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>A computer assisted search of the Cochrane IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register and the on-line databases MEDLINE,EMBASE, and CENTRAL was performed to identify relevant publications from inception to 9 June 2014. Manual searches of reference lists from potentially relevant papers were performed in order to identify additional studies that may have been missed using the computer assisted search strategy. Review articles and conference proceedings were also searched to identify additional studies. The search strategies are reported in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-07-31 13:39:37 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>
<B>Study selection:</B> The publications were assessed independently by two authors (YW and JKM), and relevant studies were selected according to the inclusion criteria. Any disagreement among authors was resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction:</B> Two authors (YW and JKM) independently extracted data. The outcome data of interest were the number of patients randomized into each treatment group and the number of patients in each group who failed to enter remission. The numbers lost to follow-up and the duration of follow-up were also recorded. Treatment and control modalities were summarized, as were the demographics of the study population. In cases where the necessary data were not available from the published report, the authors were contacted and asked to supply missing data. However, no further information has been supplied to date.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool involves rating trials as high, low or unclear risk for each of the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Randomization sequence generation;</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment;</LI>
<LI>Blinding;</LI>
<LI>Missing data and attrition;</LI>
<LI>Outcome reporting; and</LI>
<LI>Other sources of bias.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>). Outcome data were rated as high, moderate, low or very low quality evidence. Data from randomized controlled trials begin as high quality but can be downgraded based on the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Risk of bias in the included trials;</LI>
<LI>Indirect evidence;</LI>
<LI>Inconsistent findings (including unexplained heterogeneity);</LI>
<LI>Imprecision (i.e. sparse data or wide confidence intervals); and</LI>
<LI>Reporting bias.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The different quality ratings are interpreted as the likelihood that future research would affect the estimate of effect. An estimate of effect based on high quality evidence is unlikely to change with further research. If the overall evidence is of moderate quality further research may have an impact on our confidence in the estimate and may change the estimate. Low quality evidence is likely to have an impact on the effect estimate. Very low quality research means that we are very uncertain about the finding (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical Analysis:</B> Data were analysed using Review Manager (RevMan 5.3). We calculated the risk ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes. Trials were first reviewed to assess the clinical comparability of the trial protocols and study populations. If the trials were apparently comparable it was planned to next examine the homogeneity of the outcomes from the various trials to assess the statistical validity of combining the results of the various trials. This would be carried out using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Ardizzone-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ardizzone 2003</LINK> conducted a randomized, single center, investigator blinded comparison of intravenous and oral methotrexate versus oral azathioprine for the treatment of chronic active Crohn's disease (N = 54). The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methotrexate in comparison to azathioprine and to establish whether methotrexate has a shorter onset of action. Chronicity was defined as the need for steroid therapy of <U>&gt;</U> 10 mg/day for at least four months during the preceding 12 months with at least one attempt to discontinue treatment and a CDAI <U>&gt;</U> 200. Patients in the methotrexate group (n = 27) received 25 mg/week intravenously for three months and then were switched to oral administration at the same dosage for the next three months. Patients in the azathioprine group (n = 27) received 2 mg/kg/day for six months. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients entering first remission after three and six months of treatment. Clinical remission was defined as complete withdrawal from corticosteroid therapy and CDAI <U>&lt;</U> 150. Secondary outcomes included decrease in steroid requirements, decrease in mean CDAI scores, decrease in mean CRP and ESR and fistula closure. At the end of three months 44% (12/27) of methotrexate treated patients were in remission compared to 33% (9/27) who received azathioprine (P = 0.28). The respective figures at six months were 56% and 63% (P = 0.39). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients who withdrew due to adverse events. However, drug related adverse events occurred more frequently in the methotrexate group (P &lt; 0.001). Although <LINK REF="STD-Ardizzone-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ardizzone 2003</LINK> concluded that the results did not support a more rapid treatment effect of methotrexate it should be noted that the number of patients studied in the trial was inadequate to address this question. In fact, the 11% absolute difference in favour of methotrexate is consistent with a clinically meaningful difference in the three month remission rates (95% CI for the 11% difference; - 36.9 to 15%).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Arora-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Arora 1999</LINK> randomized 33 patients who had Crohn's disease that was prednisone-dependent for at least six months with CDAI &gt; 150 on 10 mg/day of prednisone or &lt; 150 on prednisone dose of <U>&gt;</U> 15 mg/day. Patients received either placebo or methotrexate 15 mg/week orally with dose escalation to a maximum of 22.5 mg/week according to clinical response. Outcome was assessed by reduction in prednisone dosage, CDAI, hospital admission and laboratory parameters. Treatment failure was defined as no improvement in the CDAI at 3 months with any reduction in steroid dose or the development of severe clinical illness. Four patients were dropped from the study for non-compliance and one because of intercurrent illness, and 28 patients could be evaluated. There was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.142) in exacerbations of Crohn's disease between methotrexate-treated patients (6/13) and placebo-treated patients (12/15). There was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.175) in the number of adverse effects in methotrexate-treated patients (3/13) as compared to the placebo-treated patients (0/15).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1995</LINK> conducted a randomized, multicenter, double blind placebo-controlled trial of intramuscular methotrexate in patients with chronic steroid-dependent Crohn's disease (N = 141). Eligible patients had chronically active Crohn's disease with at least three months of symptoms despite a daily dose of at least 12.5 mg of prednisone with at least one attempt to discontinue treatment. A total of 141 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 25 mg/wk methotrexate (n = 94 patients) or placebo (n = 47 patients). Remission was defined as discontinuation of prednisone therapy and CDAI score of &lt; 150 point at the end of 16 weeks. After 16 weeks, 37 patients (39.4 percent) were in clinical remission in the methotrexate group compared to 9 patients (19.1 percent) in the placebo group (P = 0.025). Patients in the methotrexate group received less prednisone overall than those in the placebo group (P = 0.026). The mean score on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index after 16 weeks of treatment was significantly lower in the methotrexate group (162 +/- 12) than in the placebo group (204 +/- 17, P = 0.002). In the methotrexate group, 16 patients (17 percent) withdrew from treatment because of adverse events as compared with 1 patient (2 percent) in the placebo group (P = 0.012).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2014</LINK> conducted a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial comparing the combination of methotrexate and infliximab to infliximab monotherapy in patients with active Crohn's disease. One-hundred and twenty-six patients were randomized to infliximab or placebo (monotherapy, n = 63) or infliximab and methotrexate (combination therapy, n = 63) for 50 weeks of treatment. All patients received prednisone during the study with tapering of doses beginning after week 1. Infliximab was given intravenously at 5 mg/kg at weeks 1, 3, 7, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46. Methotrexate doses were given subcutaneously and gradually increased to 25 mg/week by week 25. Remission was defined as CDAI &lt; 150. The primary outcomes were failure to achieve remission by week 14 and failure to maintain remission by week 50. Those not in remission by week 14 were withdrawn from the maintenance phase. Other outcomes included number of patients who achieved and maintained remission, change in CDAI, SF-36 and c-reactive protein, serum infliximab levels, and antibodies to infliximab. At week 14, 15/63 and 14/63 patients receiving combination therapy and monotherapy respectively failed to enter remission.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK> conducted a randomized single center comparison of oral methotrexate, oral 6-mercaptopurine and oral 5-ASA for the treatment of chronic steroid-dependent inflammatory bowel disease (N = 72). Steroid dependence was defined as those patients whose prednisone could not be lowered to 20 mg/day without presenting inflammatory activity determined by a CDAI score of <U>&gt;</U> 200 or having presented more than two episodes in the last six months or more than three in the last 12 months. None of the patients received methotrexate or 6-mercaptopurine prior to entry. Thirty-eight patients with Crohn's disease were randomized to 15 mg/week methotrexate (n = 15), 1.5 mg/kg/day 6-mercaptopurine (n = 16) or 3 g/day 5-ASA for 30 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome was clinical remission defined as stopping prednisone and a CDAI of &lt; 150 and a normal serum orosomucoid concentration. No statistically significant differences in remission rates were found between the methotrexate (12/15, 80%) and 6-mercaptopurine groups (15/16, 94%). A statistically significant difference in remission rate was found between the methotrexate and 5-ASA (1/7, 14%, P &lt; 0.01) groups and between the 6-mercaptopurine and 5-ASA groups (P &lt; 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients who withdrew due to adverse events (methotrexate 2/15, 6-MP 1/15, 5-ASA 0/7).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK> conducted a multicenter, randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trial assessing the efficacy of oral methotrexate in chronic steroid-dependent Crohn's disease. The study included patients with active Crohn's disease, who had received steroids or immunosuppressives or both for at least 4 months during the preceding 12 months and with current HBS of &gt;7 (no immunosuppressive therapy 3 months prior to entry). Patients were randomized to one of three treatment arms: placebo, oral methotrexate 12.5 mg/week, or oral 6-mercaptopurine 50 mg daily for nine months in addition to steroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid as clinically indicated. The authors defined four outcomes without defining a primary outcome:<BR/>1) The proportion of patients entering first remission which was defined as HBS &lt; 3 and the patients not receiving steroids;<BR/>2) Maintenance of remission in those patients entering remission;<BR/>3) Decrease in steroid requirement during the study; and<BR/>4) General well being at the beginning and throughout the study.</P>
<P>Eighty-four patients were included (methotrexate, 26 patients; 6-mercaptopurine, 32 patients; placebo, 26 patients). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the proportion of patients entering first remission or the proportion of patients relapsing after first remission. The Harvey-Bradshaw score and the mean monthly steroid doses were not different between the two groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Schr_x00f6_der-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schröder 2006</LINK> recruited 19 patients with Crohn's disease to an open label study comparing infliximab monotherapy (n = 8) to infliximab and methotrexate (combination therapy, n = 11). Patients were eligible if they had chronically active Crohn's disease (steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory and resistant or intolerant to azathioprine therapy). Patients could not be taking more than 4 g/day of an 5-aminosalicylate or less than 40 mg/day of prednisolone. The trial lasted 48 weeks. All patients received two infusions of infliximab at 5 mg/kg at week zero and two. Patients randomized to methotrexate received six infusions of methotrexate (20 mg/week) on weeks zero to five, they then were administered oral methotrexate (20 mg/week) for the remainder of the study. Remission was defined as CDAI &lt; 150. Secondary outcomes included time to clinical remission and steroid doses. Ten of 11 patients in the combination group and four of eight patients receiving monotherapy achieved remission at some point in the trial (P = 0.04). This outcome was also assessed at various weeks throughout the study. At 24 weeks, 6/11 and 3/8 patients in the combination and monotherapy groups respectively achieved remission (P = 0.65). Six of the 19 patients withdrew from the trial, primarily due to lack of efficacy.</P>

<P>The seven included studies differed with respect to participants, intervention, and outcomes to the extent that it was considered to be inappropriate to pool the data for meta-analysis. Although in three studies methotrexate was administered orally in low doses these studies were sufficiently heterogeneic in terms of methotrexate dose, treatment duration, disease duration and steroid use that it was not valid to combine the data. GRADE analyses were performed on individual studies instead of pooled data.</P>
<P>Two studies which employed low doses of oral methotrexate showed no statistically significant difference for induction of remission between methotrexate and placebo treated patients. The <LINK REF="STD-Arora-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Arora 1999</LINK> study reported that 33% (5/15) of methotrexate patients and 11% (2/18) of placebo patients failed to enter remission (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 13.31). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome was low due to very sparse data (7 events, See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK> reported that 62% (16/26) and 54% (14/26) of patients receiving methotrexate and placebo, respectively, failed to enter remission (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.82). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome was low due sparse data (30 events) and unknown risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment (See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1995</LINK> study which employed a higher dose of intramuscularly administered methotrexate showed a statistically significant benefit relative to placebo. Sixty-one per cent (57/94) of methotrexate patients failed to achieve remission compared to 81% (38/47) of placebo patients (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93; number needed to treat, NNT=5). This study also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in quality of life with methotrexate treatment (IBDQ: methotrexate 169 +/- 4, placebo 151+/- 6 , P &lt; 0.002). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome was moderate due to sparse data (95 events, see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of studies compared methotrexate to other active comparators. <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK> found no statistically significant difference for induction of remission between oral methotrexate and oral 6-mercaptopurine.

A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome was low due to sparse data (35 events) and unknown risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment (See <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK> also found no statistically significant difference for induction of remission, with 20% (3/15) and 6% (1/16) of patients receiving oral methotrexate and oral 6-mercaptopurine, respectively, failing to enter remission (RR 3.20, 95% CI 0.37 to 27.49). A GRADE analysis indicated that the quality of evidence supporting this outcome is very low due to sparse data and lack of blinding (4 events, See <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK> did find a statistically significant difference in efficacy between oral methotrexate and oral 5-ASA. Twenty per cent (3/15) of patients administered methotrexate and 86% (6/7) of patients administered 5-ASA failed to enter remission (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.67).

A GRADE analysis indicated that the quality of evidence supporting this outcome was low due to sparse data (29 events, See <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>The three trials that employed low dose oral methotrexate (<LINK REF="STD-Arora-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Arora 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK>), and two trials which employed a higher dose of intravenous and oral methotrexate (<LINK REF="STD-Ardizzone-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ardizzone 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schr_x00f6_der-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schröder 2006</LINK>), included relatively small numbers of patients and may have lacked power to show a benefit of this form of therapy if such a benefit exists. In two of these trials it was difficult to be certain from the published results of the precise numbers of patients who were in clinical remission and the status of these patients with respect to continued steroid treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Arora-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Arora 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK>).

A GRADE analysis indicated that the quality of evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to very sparse data (2 events) and an unknown risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment (See <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK> reported that 13% (2/15) of methotrexate patients withdrew due to adverse events compared to 0% (0/7) of 5-ASA patients (RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.14 to 46.14). A GRADE analysis indicated that the quality of evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to very sparse data (2 events) and lack of blinding (see <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). With respect to the combination of methotrexate and infliximab, <LINK REF="STD-Schr_x00f6_der-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schröder 2006</LINK> reported no withdrawals due to adverse events in either group (0/11 combination therapy; 0/8 infliximab alone). <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2014</LINK> reported no statistically significant difference in withdrawals due to adverse events between patients receiving combination therapy with methotrexate and infliximab and infliximab alone.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-07-24 11:35:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Crohn's disease is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent exacerbations and remissions. Corticosteroids have been the mainstay of therapy for the induction of remission in patients with Crohn's disease. However, 20% of patients become steroid dependent (<LINK REF="REF-Binder-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Binder 1985</LINK>). Physicians attempt to avoid prolonged steroid therapy because of the frequency and severity of adverse effects. As a result, many physicians attempt to introduce steroid sparing agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine.</P>
<P>The interest in methotrexate for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease originated from an uncontrolled study in which 12 weeks of intramuscular methotrexate at a dose of 25 mg/wk resulted in a significant response in 5 of 7 patients with refractory ulcerative colitis and 11 of 14 patients with Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Kozarek-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kozarek 1989</LINK>). Randomized trials were subsequently performed.</P>
<P>Seven randomized controlled trials were identified. Methotrexate was superior to placebo in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1995</LINK>), which included the largest number of patients and utilized intramuscular administration of the drug at a high dose. Two other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arora-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Arora 1999</LINK>) showed no statistically significant difference between low dose oral methotrexate and placebo treated patients (<LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arora-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Arora 1999</LINK>). These trials may have failed to show a benefit of methotrexate in refractory Crohn's disease because they used lower doses of the drug (12.5 to 15 mg/week compared to 25 mg/week) and oral administration. Both studies included relatively small numbers of patients and the failure to show a difference between the treatment and control groups may have been due to insufficient statistical power. One trial assessed quality of life and demonstrated a clinically significant improvement in quality of life in methotrexate patients compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies looked at the efficacy of methotrexate compared to azathioprine (<LINK REF="STD-Ardizzone-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ardizzone 2003</LINK>), 6-mercaptopurine (<LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK>), and 5-ASA (<LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK>). These trials included small numbers of patients and the failure to show a difference between treatment groups may be due to a lack of statistical power. The statistically significant result favouring methotrexate over 5-ASA for induction of remission reported by <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK> needs to be interpreted with caution due to the small numbers of patients enrolled. <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK> attempted to compare response rates of azathioprine, oral methotrexate and placebo. This study used low doses of both drugs, enrolled small numbers of patients and did not show any statistically significant difference with placebo for either drug. None of these trials provide sufficient evidence to assess the efficacy of oral or intravenous methotrexate compared to other active medications used for the treatment of Crohn's disease. To compare the relative efficacy of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine to methotrexate the randomization of large numbers of patients would be required.</P>
<P>In clinical practice, intramuscular administration is associated with higher costs and compromised patient quality of life because of the need for increased clinic visits. Subcutaneous injection can be used as an alternative method of parenteral administration. It has been shown to have similar pharmacokinetics to intramuscular injection, is easier to administer and leads to greater patient comfort and reduced local complication rate at the injection site than intramuscular injection (<LINK REF="REF-Balis-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balis 1988;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Brooks-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egan-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egan 1999b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies compared the combination of methotrexate and infliximab to infliximab monotherapy. <LINK REF="STD-Schr_x00f6_der-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schröder 2006</LINK> was a small, open label trial and found no difference in efficacy between infliximab monotherapy and the combination of methotrexate (intravenous infusions and oral) and infliximab. <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 2014</LINK> was a larger, double-blind trial which also found no difference in efficacy between the combination of methotrexate (subcutaneous) and infliximab and infliximab monotherapy. Further research is needed to determine whether the addition of methotrexate to infliximab or other biological therapies has any benefit for patients with refractory Crohn's disease. Future research should also determine which route of administration is most effective.</P>
<P>Adverse events were observed in approximately equal frequency in the methotrexate treated (45%) and control (42%) groups in the study reported by <LINK REF="STD-Feagan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Feagan 1995</LINK>. However, 17% of the methotrexate treated patients were withdrawn from treatment because of adverse events, compared to 2% in the placebo group (P = 0.012). The most common reasons for withdrawal were nausea and vomiting (6 patients) and asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes (7 patients). No serious adverse effects were observed. Although the design of this study resulted in withdrawal of these patients, in clinical practice in patients with rheumatoid disease, adverse effects such as nausea are often dealt with or prevented by the concomitant administration of folic acid (<LINK REF="REF-Griffith-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffith 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lorenzi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorenzi 2000</LINK>), and asymptomatic elevations of transaminases are not considered to reflect or predict existing or future hepatic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Kremer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kremer 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the three trials that employed lower doses of oral methotrexate no serious adverse effects were observed (<LINK REF="STD-Arora-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Arora 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mat_x00e9__x002d_Jim_x00e9_nez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maté-Jiménez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oren-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oren 1997</LINK>). However, in one trial ALT levels were increased in 53% of patients receiving methotrexate, compared to 22% of patients receiving placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Arora-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Arora 1999</LINK>). No clinically significant hepatotoxicity was observed in any patient.</P>
<P>On the basis of a single large randomized trial methotrexate appears to be safe and effective medication for induction of remission in patients with refractory Crohn's disease when administered parenterally at a dose of 25 mg weekly. There is no evidence that lower doses administered orally are effective.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-11-09 11:16:00 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="David J. Tsoulis">
<P>There is evidence from a single large randomized trial which suggests that intramuscular methotrexate (25 mg/week) provides a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids in patients with refractory Crohn's disease. Lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any benefit relative to relative to placebo or active comparator (e.g. azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine). The addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infiximab monotherapy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-11-09 11:14:35 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Trials of lower doses of methotrexate administered orally may be justified. Comparative studies of methotrexate to other immunomodulatory drugs such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine would require the randomization of large numbers of patients. Further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies.</P>
