<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Interventions for minimal change disease in adults with nephrotic syndrome</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Nephrotic syndrome is a condition where the kidneys leak protein from the blood into the urine. Minimal change disease is the third most common primary kidney disease in adults with unexplained nephrotic syndrome (10% to 15%). Steroids have been used widely since the early 1970s for the treatment of adult-onset minimal change disease, however the optimal agent, dose and duration has not been determined. This review identified three small studies (68 participants) comparing: 1) intravenous plus oral steroid treatment versus oral sterids; 2) oral versus short-course intravenous steroid treatment; and 3) oral steroid treatment versus placebo. Only oral steroid treatment (compared to short-course intravenous steroid treatment) showed an increase in the number of patients who achieved complete remission. However, the lack of available studies leaves important treatment questions unanswered; what is the optimal dose and duration of steroid treatment in new-onset adult minimal change disease; how are relapses following steroid-induced remission prevented and treated; and what are the appropriate treatments for steroid-dependent or treatment-resistant minimal change disease? </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Steroids have been used widely since the early 1970s for the treatment of adult-onset minimal change disease. The response rates to immunosuppressive agents in adult minimal change disease, especially steroids, are more variable than in children. The optimal agent, dose, and duration of treatment for the first episode of nephrotic syndrome, or for disease relapse(s) has not been determined.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the benefits and harms of interventions for the nephrotic syndrome in adults caused by minimal change disease.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference articles and abstracts from conference proceedings, without language restriction. <BR/>
<I>Search date: January 2007.</I>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any intervention for minimal change disease in adults over 18 years with the nephrotic syndrome were included. Studies comparing different routes, frequencies, and duration of immunosuppressive agents were selected. Studies comparing non-immunosuppressive agents were also assessed.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-05-14 11:41:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results were expressed as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, or mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three RCTs (68 participants) were identified. All treatment comparisons contained only one study. No significant difference was found between prednisone compared with placebo for complete (RR 1.44, CI 0.95 to 2.19) and partial remission (RR 1.00, CI 0.07 to 14.45) of the nephrotic syndrome due to minimal change disease. There was no difference between intravenous methylprednisolone plus oral prednisone compared with oral prednisone alone for complete remission (RR 0.74, CI 0.50 to 1.08). Prednisone, compared with short-course intravenous methylprednisolone, increased the number of subjects who achieved complete remission (RR 4.95, CI 1.15 to 21.26). The lack of statistical evidence of efficacy associated with prednisone therapy was based on data derived from a single study that compared 'alternate-day prednisone' to no immunosuppression' with only a small number of participants in each group. No RCTs were identified comparing regimens in adults with a steroid-dependent or relapsing disease course or comparing treatments comprising alkylating agents, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levamisole, or mycophenolate mofetil. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Further comparative studies are required to examine the efficacy of immunosuppressive agents for achievement of sustained remission of nephrotic syndrome caused by minimal change disease. Studies are also needed to evaluate treatments for adults with steroid-dependent or relapsing disease. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-14 11:42:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Nephrotic syndrome is a clinical condition where the glomeruli of the kidney leak protein from the blood into the urine. It is characterised by often severe generalised oedema and hypoproteinaemia and, if untreated, is associated with considerable morbidity. The causes of nephrotic syndrome are either a primary renal process, or a result of injury to the kidney through systemic diseases, most commonly diabetes mellitus. Minimal change disease is the third most common primary kidney disease in adults with unexplained nephrotic syndrome (10% to 15%) (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Korbet-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korbet 1996</LINK>), after membranous nephropathy (30% to 40%) and segmental sclerosing glomerular disorders (20% to 30%) (<LINK REF="REF-Haas-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 1997</LINK>). In fact, minimal change disease may be diagnosed in cases of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis due to sampling errors in the kidney biopsy process. The incidence of minimal change disease varies depending on the population studied and is reported as 1/1,000,000 in the UK compared with 27/1,000,000 in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>). Adult-onset minimal change disease is associated with kidney failure in 33% of patients, hypertension in 35%, microscopic haematuria in 47%, and hypercholesterolaemia in 96% (<LINK REF="REF-Nakayama-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakayama 2002</LINK>). Kidney biopsy is mandatory for a diagnosis of minimal change disease in adults with the nephrotic syndrome.</P>
<P>The kidney biopsy in minimal change disease reveals no, or only minor, changes on light microscopy. The abnormality is the fusion of the foot processes of the podocyte cell which normally forms an impermeable barrier to protein as part of the glomerular membrane that controls the urinary filtrate. While the precise pathogenesis of minimal change disease is yet to be clarified there is increasing evidence that T lymphocytes, and probably other immune cells, are involved in the disease and may produce cytokines that alter the normal glomerular filtration membrane that prevents proteinuria (<LINK REF="REF-Grimbert-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimbert 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The response rates to immunosuppressive agents in adult minimal change disease, especially steroids, are more variable than in children. Uncontrolled studies have suggested that the response rates to steroids in adults is "delayed" by 8 to 16 weeks compared to that demonstrated in children and the reasons for this delay are poorly understood. The development of minimal change disease in those older than 40 years may be characterised by increased rates of kidney impairment and hypertension, although these features may simply reflect age-related changes (<LINK REF="REF-Tse-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tse 2003</LINK>). The most efficacious treatment to achieve sustained remission of proteinuria in adults is less well defined than for children. Relapse of the nephrotic syndrome after remission may occur and refers to the recurrence of an abnormal urine protein excretion rate, with or without oedema. Spontaneous remission is infrequent, although prior to the widespread use of corticosteroids a spontaneous rate of remission was reported in over half of patients in the first two years after diagnosis (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1970</LINK>). Steroids have been used widely since the early 1970s for the treatment of adult-onset minimal change disease (<LINK REF="REF-Nolasco-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolasco 1986</LINK>). The response rate to corticosteroids is slower in adults than in children where remission can be achieved in 37% to 50% within four weeks, 51% to 76% within eight weeks, and 76% to 97% within 16 weeks. However, up to 10% of patients may fail to achieve complete remission with corticosteroid therapy alone and require additional immunosuppression. After an initial complete response, up to two-thirds of adults treated with steroids alone will relapse on one or more occasions, and approximately 25% become frequent relapsers (<LINK REF="REF-Nakayama-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakayama 2002</LINK>). Many patients develop steroid dependency. Older patients may have different remission rates to corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Korbet-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korbet 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nakayama-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakayama 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other agents active against the immune system have been employed to prolong periods of remission or reduce corticosteroid exposure. In adults, alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil) (<LINK REF="REF-Al-Khader-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al Khader 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mak-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mak 1996</LINK>) have been tested for the treatment of glomerular diseases. More recently, agents used in transplantation including cyclosporine, (<LINK REF="STD-Matsumoto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Matsumoto 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyrier-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Meyrier 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woo 2001</LINK>), tacrolimus (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schweda-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schweda 1997</LINK>), sirolimus (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2005</LINK>), and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (<LINK REF="REF-Briggs-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briggs 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Day-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mogyorosi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mogyorosi 2002</LINK>) have all been reported in patients with either steroid-resistant or frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome. Adverse effects from immunosuppression may be considerable, depending on the agent used, and include infection, malignancy, peptic ulceration, diabetes mellitus, infertility, kidney failure, bone marrow suppression, hypertrichosis, and alopecia. Other nonspecific supportive treatments to reduce proteinuria and ameliorate the morbidity of the nephrotic syndrome are reported, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (<LINK REF="STD-Arora-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Arora 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dilek-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dilek 1999</LINK>), non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), heparinoids, and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG Co-A) reductase inhibitors (<LINK REF="STD-Deighan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Deighan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olbricht-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Olbricht 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The treatment of adult-onset minimal change disease appears to have developed without consensus and the most effective second-line immunosuppressive agent to treat steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome or frequently relapsing disease appears uncertain. Initial therapy is most commonly in the form of corticosteroids alone but strong evidence is lacking for the treatment of steroid-resistant, relapsing or steroid-dependent subjects. This systematic review examined the existing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the benefits and harms of interventions for the nephrotic syndrome caused by minimal change disease in adults to identify areas that require further research. The incidence and nature of treatment related toxicity were emphasised.</P>

<P>For dichotomous outcomes (complete remission, partial remission, doubling of serum creatinine or end-stage kidney disease, adverse events) results were expressed as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Data were pooled using the Der Simonian Laird random-effects model but the fixed-effect model was also analysed to ensure robustness of the model chosen and susceptibility to outliers. Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment (proteinuria, kidney outcomes, duration of remission), the mean difference (MD) was used. Heterogeneity was analysed, where applicable, using a chi squared test on N-1 degrees of freedom, with an alpha of 0.05 used for statistical significance and with the I² test (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis was planned to explore any possible sources of heterogeneity (e.g. participants, treatments and study quality). Heterogeneity among participants could have been related to; age (dichotomised to between 18-40 years and greater than 40 years), kidney function, evidence of glomerulosclerosis on biopsy, haematuria, hypertension, response to corticosteroids, characteristics of clinical course (partial remission, frequently relapsing disease, steroid dependence, duration of NS), severity of NS, severity of hyperlipidaemia. Heterogeneity in treatments could have been related to prior agent(s) used and the agent, dose and duration of therapy. Adverse effects were tabulated and assessed with descriptive techniques, as they were likely to be different for the various agents used (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Where possible, the risk difference with 95% CI was calculated for each adverse effect, either compared to no treatment or to another agent.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-14 11:46:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>All available RCTs in adults with minimal change disease evaluate treatment of recent onset nephrotic syndrome and compare prednisone with another steroid regime or with no treatment. The review identified three vastly different RCTs performed over two decades, on small numbers of participants without adequate power to detect differences in therapeutic efficacy. This suggests these original studies have little relevance to contemporary treatment of minimal change disease in adults. RCT data for treatment of relapsing disease or steroid-resistant disease are absent. The likelihood of achieving remission within two months of presentation did not differ between alternate-day prednisone and no immunosuppression in one study, or between intravenous steroid followed by oral prednisone and oral prednisone alone in another study. The lack of superior efficacy for prednisone over placebo for achievement of remission is surprising and probably explained by the spontaneous remission rate in the small group (N = 14) prescribed no treatment, such that there was no difference in complete remission between groups at the end of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Coggins-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Coggins 1985</LINK>). In children, studies of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome using either higher doses of steroid or an increased duration of steroid therapy lead to prolonged remission from the nephrotic syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2007</LINK>). This is echoed by the finding in this review of a single RCT in adults where continuous oral prednisone induced complete remission better than short-course (three day) intravenous steroids, although the small patient numbers could not exclude the possibility that this treatment advantage was due to chance alone.</P>
<P>Adult minimal change disease is steroid-responsive in approximately 80% of cases (<LINK REF="STD-Meyrier-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Meyrier 1988</LINK>) although up to two-thirds of adults undergo a relapsing course, and steroid-sensitive forms may become steroid-dependent. In such cases, repeated or continuous courses of corticosteroid treatment increases the likelihood of glucocorticoid toxicity. In relapsing paediatric nephrotic syndrome, daily prednisone treatment, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, levamisole, and cyclosporine all significantly reduce the risk of subsequent relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Durkan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durkan 2005</LINK>). No RCT data are available to guide similar treatment for adults, particularly for those who experience relapse during or after initial treatment, for those who frequently relapse, or for those who develop steroid dependency. Agents such as cyclosporine (<LINK REF="STD-Matsumoto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Matsumoto 2004</LINK>), tacrolimus (<LINK REF="REF-Westhoff-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westhoff 2006</LINK>) cyclophosphamide, and mycophenolate mofetil (<LINK REF="REF-Mogyorosi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mogyorosi 2002</LINK>) are evaluated in uncontrolled studies of adult nephrotic syndrome, and may be associated with significant toxicity, including kidney impairment (<LINK REF="STD-Ponticelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ponticelli 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharpstone-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Sharpstone 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tejani-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Tejani 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uldall-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Uldall 1972</LINK>). The lack of available studies leaves important treatment questions unanswered; what is the optimal dose and duration of steroid treatment in new-onset adult minimal change disease; how are relapses following steroid-induced remission prevented and treated; and what are the appropriate treatments for steroid-dependent or treatment-resistant minimal change disease?</P>
<P>The absence of evidence to guide management of adults with the nephrotic syndrome due to minimal change disease is in direct contrast to the available data for children with the nephrotic syndrome, summarised in three separate Cochrane systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Durkan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durkan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2007</LINK>). Adult minimal change disease is a rarer condition and this rarity has presented a vital barrier to the conduct of adequately powered studies for this population. The incidence of (all-cause) nephrotic syndrome in children approaches 2/100,000, probably an order of magnitude more frequent than the condition in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Arneil-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arneil 1961</LINK>). Moreover, studies in adults with minimal change disease, published in the 1970's, showed an "early and dramatic" decrease in proteinuria following prednisone therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gulati-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Gulati 1973</LINK>). This profound "before and after" evidence to support the use of steroids in adult minimal change disease lead to the widespread adoption of this empirical approach. No subsequent adequately powered studies to examine the efficacy and toxicity of steroids were conducted. The low incidence of the disease in adults has also prevented adequate RCTs to evaluate treatment for steroid-dependent or relapsing disease</P>
<P>The combination of causes for nephrotic syndrome together into RCTs has commonly occurred for adults. Frequently adults with minimal change disease have been combined in interventional studies with adults with focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyrier-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Meyrier 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ponticelli-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ponticelli 1993</LINK>), membranous nephropathy (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mansy-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mansy 1989</LINK>), and membrano-proliferative disease (<LINK REF="STD-Gulati-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Gulati 1973</LINK>). In order to maximise recruitment previous studies have also enrolled both adults and children with minimal change disease into the same study. This approach is problematic as the study populations are necessarily heterogenous and the applicability of such research findings to individuals with adult minimal change disease is limited. This is particularly true where adults are enrolled in studies with children, and where patients with sclerosing glomerular lesions are combined with patients with minimal change disease. The heterogenous response of these different populations to treatment demands that any future studies enrol adults with biopsy-proven minimal change disease alone.</P>
<P>An international collaborative group to organise multicentre studies of therapy in adult glomerular disease would facilitate the conduct of such studies. The funding of the European Vasculitis Study Group in 1993 is such an example of a collaborative international network coordinated with a central secretariat to ensure appropriate studies of rare diseases are conducted in vasculitis (<LINK REF="REF-EUVAS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUVAS 2006</LINK>). This group has published a large body of well-conducted research to guide therapy for vasculitis. For primary glomerulopathies a similar collaborative network could facilitate international studies of treatments that have previously been shown to be efficacious in children and in observational studies in adults. In adults with new-onset nephrotic syndrome comparisons of different durations and doses of corticosteroids should be considered. Non-corticosteroid based immunosuppression should be assessed in steroid-dependent, steroid-resistant, and relapsing disease, focusing on the duration of remission, kidney outcomes, and treatment-related toxicity.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review has generated no evidence to support the efficacy of any agent for induction or prolongation of remission for adults with the nephrotic syndrome caused by minimal change disease. The lack of statistical evidence of efficacy associated with prednisone therapy was based on data derived from a single study that compared 'alternate-day prednisone' to no immunosuppression' with only a small number of participants in each group. The results should be treated with caution due to the small numbers of studies available. No information is available to guide the use of non-steroid immunosuppression either following the first presentation of nephrotic syndrome or relapsing or steroid-resistant adult minimal change disease. There are insufficient data to determine whether 'time-to-remission' was significantly influenced by any treatments in this review.</P>
