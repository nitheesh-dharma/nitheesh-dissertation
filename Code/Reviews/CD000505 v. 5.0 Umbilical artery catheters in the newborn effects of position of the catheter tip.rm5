<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-22 15:38:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High positioning of umbilical artery catheters in babies in neonatal intensive care leads to fewer complications than low positioning. The umbilical artery catheters (tubes) (UACs) commonly used in neonatal intensive care to monitor babies, can sometimes cause them problems. They can be used with different accompanying doses of the drug heparin, and different catheter materials and design. The catheter can also be placed in a low or high position. This review found that high catheter positions led to fewer complications, and reduced the need for replacement and re-insertion of catheters.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-07-31 13:19:12 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Umbilical arterial catheters (UACs) are among the most commonly used monitoring methodologies in neonatal intensive care. There seems to be significant variance between neonatal intensive care units in exactly how these catheters are used. This variance involves heparin dosing, catheter materials and catheter design and positioning of the catheter. Immediately after insertion of a UAC, local vascular compromise is frequently evident, usually in the form of blue or white toes, but occasionally with more severe and extensive ischemic manifestations. Aortic thrombi and renal ischemia have also been described. Some epidemiologic and case control studies have also shown that use of umbilical artery catheterisation is statistically associated with the later development of necrotizing enterocolitis. In order to minimize these morbidities, some aspects of the use of UACs have been assessed in randomized control trials.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-07-31 17:09:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic overview analyses data regarding comparisons of 'high' and 'low' catheter positions. High positioned catheters are usually placed so that the tip is in the descending aorta above the level of the diaphragm and below the left subclavian artery. Low positioned catheters are usually placed so that the tip is above the aortic bifurcation and below the renal arteries.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-07-31 13:19:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although it may seem self-evident that a shorter length of catheter in the aorta would cause fewer problems, other considerations such as the turbulence of blood flow around the catheter tip and the effects on flow dynamics of flushing the catheter after blood drawing complicate the picture. Evidence from randomized controlled trials is therefore required to clarify the benefits and risks of catheter position.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>The original search strategy retrieved 12 trials investigating catheter position, catheter materials or heparin use. The updated searches, the latest being in March 2007 revealed no new randomized controlled trials comparing high to low catheter position.</P>
<P>Seven trials of varying methodological quality have examined the effects of catheter positioning on clinical outcomes. One of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Henry-abstract" TYPE="STUDY">Henry abstract</LINK>) was reported only as an abstract and insufficient data were presented to enter into the meta-analysis. This trial has therefore been excluded.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Harris-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1978</LINK> studied 36 infants, both term and preterm, who required umbilical artery catheterisation. Infants were allocated alternately to high or low catheter groups. The primary outcome variable is not stated, but data were recorded for a number of complications, clinical ischemic compromise of the limbs, necrotising enterocolitis and death. The timing of ascertainment of these outcomes is uncertain. Death appears to have been ascertained until the time of discharge; the one occurrence of necrotizing enterocolitis noted in the paper occurred after the catheter was removed.</P>
<P>Kempley 1993 performed a randomised single center trial in 308 term and preterm infants. Randomisation was stratified by birth weight and either end hole or side-hole (oxygen electrode tipped) catheters were used. Outcome variables were primarily necrotising enterocolitis, and secondarily clinical vascular compromise, hypertension, hematuria, and duration of catheter usability. All were ascertained until discharge from hospital. Necrotising enterocolitis was defined using a standard definition. Hematuria was defined as 'macroscopic hematuria'. In a separate publication they reported Doppler ultrasound findings in a subgroup of the infants, n = 69 (Kempley 1993, citation #2). </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mokrohisky-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Mokrohisky 1978</LINK> randomly assigned 73 term and preterm infants to high compared to low catheter positioning. Outcome variables were clinical vascular compromise, hypertension, necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, aortic thrombosis on aortography at catheter removal, and hematuria. The duration of surveillance for these outcome variables is not detailed. Hypertension and necrotising enterocolitis were not defined. Although surveillance for hematuria was carried out, the results are not presented.<BR/> <BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Stork-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stork 1984</LINK> reported in abstract form a trial of high versus low catheter position. The major outcome variable was the occurrence of hypertension, others being the occurrence of clinical vascular compromise of the legs and necrotising enterocolitis. The abstract reported the outcome for the 'first 182 infants analyzed'. No further reports from this study were found. Study infants were both term and preterm, and umbilical catheterisation was clinically required. Blood pressure was recorded for a maximum of 30 days. Both oxygen electrode tipped catheters and plain end-hole catheters were used. Hypertension was defined as a mean arterial pressure greater than 70 mmHg for three days. Definition of necrotising enterocolitis was not given.</P>
<P>The Umbilical Artery Catheter Trial Study Group (<LINK REF="STD-UACTSG-1992" TYPE="STUDY">UACTSG 1992</LINK>) studied 970 preterm infants in a multi-center randomized trial. Infants of between 500 and 1500 grams birth weight were entered using a masked, blocked, birth weight stratified, randomization scheme. Only 3.5 Fr catheters were used but there is no note of whether these were end-hole, side-hole or either; heparinisation was also not standardised. The major outcome criterion was the combined incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (grade 2 to 4) and death during the first five days of life. The sample size was initially determined by standard methods to be 724, with the hypothesis being a reduction in the combined rate of death or intraventricular hemorrhage from 24.6% to 16%. The sample size was actually increased after an interim analysis showed a suspicion that one of the randomization strata may have an increase in the major outcome variable. Other outcome variables recorded were clinical ischemic phenomena, sepsis, seizures, and necrotizing enterocolitis during the first five days of life. Data were also recorded to 120 days or hospital discharge but are not presented in the text; they are currently being sought from the authors.</P>
<P>Wesstrom's trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wesstrom-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Wesstrom 1979</LINK>) was designed to randomly assign infants requiring umbilical catheter placement to one of four groups, high end hole, high side hole, low end hole or low side hole catheter. Sixty-two infants were studied. After the first 15 months the side hole groups were dropped, presumably because of the high incidence of aortic thrombosis and for the final four months randomization was to high or low end hole catheters only. The end hole catheter used was an 'Argyle' umbilical catheter, the side hole catheter was an Argyle feeding tube. Most catheters were 5 Fr size. The major outcome variable was aortic thrombosis; this was determined either by angiography at the time of removal of the catheter or at autopsy. Clinically apparent sequelae were said to be recorded, but are not clearly described.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-10-28 12:01:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>HIGH CATHETER POSITION COMPARED WITH LOW CATHETER POSITION (Comparison 1):<BR/>Clinical vascular compromise (Outcome 1.01):</B>
<BR/>The studies of catheter position have all demonstrated that clinical ischemic phenomena are significantly less common with high catheter position (typical RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.63). This result was consistent between studies with individual relative risks for the studies ranging from 0.25 to 0.60. For all of the individual trials, except for <LINK REF="STD-Stork-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stork 1984</LINK>, this was a statistically significant result.</P>
<P>
<B>Death or occurrence of intraventricular hemorrhage (Outcome 1.02):</B>
<BR/>The combined outcome of death or intraventricular hemorrhage was reported in only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-UACTSG-1992" TYPE="STUDY">UACTSG 1992</LINK>) and was not significantly affected, RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.89, 1.39. Similarly, intraventricular hemorrhage alone was reported only in this trial and was not significantly affected, RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.74, 1.32 <B>(Outcome 1.04)</B>.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Death (Outcome 1.03):</B>
<BR/>Death rates were reported by five of the trials. All gave a relative risk close to 1.0 and none were significantly different between high and low catheter positions. Relative risk varied between 1.00 and 1.21, with an overall RR of 1.11; 95% CI 0.88, 1.40.</P>
<P>
<B>Necrotising enterocolitis (Outcome 1.05):</B>
<BR/>The frequency of necrotising enterocolitis was determined in five trials. The diagnostic criteria for necrotising enterocolitis are not stated in several of the studies. However, there does appear to be homogeneity between studies with all of the studies having widely overlapping confidence intervals. This was a fairly rare outcome with an overall incidence of 3.9% with high catheters and 2.9% with low catheters. Relative risks range from 1.1 to 3.0 with none of the individual studies showing a significant effect of catheter position. The overall relative risk is 1.34; 95% CI 0.79, 2.25.<BR/>
<BR/>The <LINK REF="STD-UACTSG-1992" TYPE="STUDY">UACTSG 1992</LINK> study reported necrotising enterocolitis incidence until five days of age. However, this is a complication which often presents after five days of age, and it is certainly feasible that the position of catheter placement could affect microvascular perfusion of the bowel and lead to an ischemic injury which may present somewhat later. The other studies appear to have documented necrotising enterocolitis rates until discharge, although this is not absolutely clear for two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Stork-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stork 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mokrohisky-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Mokrohisky 1978</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-UACTSG-1992" TYPE="STUDY">UACTSG 1992</LINK> did collect data on necrotising enterocolitis rates until discharge, and reported that the incidence "did not differ by level of catheter placement", but no data are given. Analyzing the data on necrotising enterocolitis either with or without the <LINK REF="STD-UACTSG-1992" TYPE="STUDY">UACTSG 1992</LINK> five day data does not change the conclusion that catheter position does not have a statistically significant effect. The relative risk for necrotising enterocolitis prior to five days of age is 1.22; (95% CI 0.53, 2.80) and for necrotising enterocolitis before discharge is 1.42 (95% 0.73, 2.78).</P>
<P>Duration of catheter usage is probably significantly improved with high catheter position, although this result was only clearly described in one study (Kempley 1993) and no standard deviation is given to allow analysis. The authors reported a median duration of catheter use of 105 hours (ranging from 1-978) with high catheters and 79 hours (range 2 - 709) with the low catheter position.</P>
<P>
<B>Aortic thrombosis (Outcome 1.06):<BR/>
</B>
<LINK REF="STD-Mokrohisky-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Mokrohisky 1978</LINK> reported a 91% incidence of aortic thrombosis on aortography performed at catheter removal in 23 infants from their study of 73 neonates. However, the relative frequency in the two groups (high versus low catheter placement) was not noted in the main article. I obtained supplemental data on file with the National Auxiliary Publications Service. This documented the results of aortography at catheter removal and showed that nine of nine infants with high catheters had documented clots compared to 12 out of 14 infants with low catheters (RR 1.17; 95% CI 0.94, 1.44). The subgroup of infants who had angiography in <LINK REF="STD-Mokrohisky-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Mokrohisky 1978</LINK> was selected, it appears, on the basis of whether parental consent could be obtained. It is, therefore, unclear whether these infants are representative of the groups as a whole. For example, it is possible that parents whose infants had clinical signs of thrombosis would be more likely to consent. The data from Mokrohisky therefore should probably be considered to be less reliable, and have not been entered into the analysis.</P>
<P>Aortic thrombosis was also noted by <LINK REF="STD-Wesstrom-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Wesstrom 1979</LINK>. The result of this study showed, in contrast, a lower incidence of aortic thrombosis with high catheters (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11, 0.86). All of the infants in Wesstrom's study had angiography.</P>
<P>
<B>Hypertension (Outcome 1.07) and Hematuria (Outcome 1.08):</B>
<BR/>Hypertension and hematuria also do not seem to differ between catheter positions, but have been reported in only three (Kempley 1993, <LINK REF="STD-Mokrohisky-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Mokrohisky 1978</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stork-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stork 1984</LINK>) and one (Kempley 1993) studies respectively. Hypertension was not defined in the same way in each of the studies. In Kempley 1993 it was defined by the need for treatment; in <LINK REF="STD-Mokrohisky-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Mokrohisky 1978</LINK> it was not defined in the publication, and in <LINK REF="STD-Stork-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stork 1984</LINK> it was defined as a mean blood pressure greater than or equal to 70 for three or more days. Both Kempley and Mokrohisky reported a very low incidence, whereas Stork reported that 10% of their infants were hypertensive. None of the studies suggested a significant effect of catheter position and overall the relative risk, 0.75, was non-significant, 95% CI 0.34, 1.67. Hematuria was reported only by Kempley 1993 and was referred to as 'macroscopic hematuria'. It was not different between groups, RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.08, 2.42.<BR/>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Although there is not a statistically significant effect of catheter position on the frequency of necrotising enterocolitis, there remains a possibility that there is clinically important effect. This effect, we can say with 95% confidence, would lie between a 21% relative risk reduction in the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis and a 125% relative risk increase. Given the reported incidence of this complication in these studies, of 3.9% with high catheters and 2.9% with low catheters, it is unlikely that another trial to prove that there is truly a difference in the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis will ever be performed.</P>
<P>Many of the analyzed complications may be of little long term significance. It could, for example, be questioned whether having blue toes for a few hours is of much real import. More important are questions of whether catheter position influences the frequency of renal injury, bowel injury or spinal cord injury. Death and intraventricular hemorrhage rates and, as mentioned above, necrotizing enterocolitis rates are not affected by catheter position. Hypertension appears to be of equal frequency with high catheters compared to low catheters. Hematuria appears to be more common with low catheters but, as stated, has not been well reported. Spinal cord injury has been reported in the randomized trials only once (<LINK REF="STD-Kempley-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kempley 1992</LINK>) in an infant with a low catheter. Other major complications which clearly are of long term importance include an infant with intestinal necrosis due to thrombosis of the superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries who had a high, side hole catheter in place (<LINK REF="STD-Kempley-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kempley 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Long term follow up has not been reported from any of the RCTs. Wesstrom reported follow up of 79 infants which appears to have included some of the babies from his controlled trial. One infant with an aortic thrombosis had a calf diameter discrepancy; one infant with a femoral artery thrombosis had a tibial length discrepancy.</P>
<P>Seibert's observational study, mentioned above, followed up 10 of the infants with aortic thrombi (<LINK REF="REF-Seibert-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seibert 1991</LINK>) and found leg size discrepancies and significantly increased blood pressure.</P>
<P>The available information indicates, in summary, that clinical vascular compromise is decreased in frequency with high catheter position, that there may be a reduction in the frequency of aortic thrombosis with high catheter position and that other complications are not affected. </P>
<P>Further data from the two studies published as abstracts (<LINK REF="STD-Stork-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stork 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Henry-abstract" TYPE="STUDY">Henry abstract</LINK>) and the outcome data at discharge of the <LINK REF="STD-UACTSG-1992" TYPE="STUDY">UACTSG 1992</LINK> trial may modify these conclusions. In particular, the effect of catheter position on aortic thrombosis could be affected by the Henry study which is of sufficient size to substantially affect this outcome. Similarly, the data on incidence of necrotising enterocolitis ascertained until discharge in the very large <LINK REF="STD-UACTSG-1992" TYPE="STUDY">UACTSG 1992</LINK> trial are needed in order to assess more precisely the effect of catheter position on this outcome. The principal investigators of these trials are being contacted and, if the requested data are retrievable, they will be incorporated in future updates of this review.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>High umbilical artery catheter positioning is supported by the literature. Using high catheter positions will lead to fewer clinically obvious ischemic complications, probably a reduced incidence of aortic thrombosis, and a longer duration of catheter usability. The incidence of serious complications is not affected.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There appear to be no controlled studies regarding whether the composition of fluids (other than heparinization) infused through the catheter affects complications. One observational study (<LINK REF="REF-Seibert-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seibert 1987</LINK>) suggested that presence of calcium in the infusate significantly increased the risk of thrombosis with low lying catheters.</P>
<P>Further studies of umbilical catheter usage in the newborn should analyze the effects of giving parenteral nutrition, calcium, antibiotics, or drugs through the catheter.</P>
