<P>Intermittent claudication is a pain in the calf due to a lack of blood needed to supply those muscles with oxygen during exercise or movement, ultimately resulting in the person to slow or stop movement. It is the most common presenting symptom for people with long-standing lower limb arterial disease resulting from narrowing of the arteries that supply the lower limbs with blood. This narrowing most commonly occurs through the process of atherosclerosis in which an artery wall thickens as a result of the accumulation of fatty materials such as cholesterol and triglycerides. People with mild lower limb arterial disease are advised to stop smoking, exercise, and take an antiplatelet agent to prevent heart attack or stroke. Medication to improve walking distance is only of limited value.</P>
<P>Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of fatty acid found in fish oils, eggs, fruits and vegetables. They are essential nutrients, as the body cannot make omega-3 fatty acids by itself. It is thought that omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial in heart disease through their effect on several different biological mechanisms. As heart disease and intermittent claudication have similar disease processes it is possible that omega-3 fatty acids will have similar effects on both diseases and could potentially increase pain-free walking distance, quality of life and other measures of benefit in those suffering from intermittent claudication.</P>
<P>The review included nine randomised controlled trials with 425 participants, comparing omega-3 fatty acid supplementation with other fatty acids. On the basis of these studies, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation did not improve walking distance, blood pressure in the leg or any other measure of clinical benefit. There was some limited evidence to suggest that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may reduce blood viscosity (the resistance of blood to flow), which when high could potentially contribute to intermittent claudication. There was no evidence to suggest that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduced plasma (the liquid component of blood) viscosity or improved the levels of different types of cholesterol or any other components of blood tested. Side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and flatulence were observed in two studies.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-13 12:50:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nine studies were included representing 425 participants. All studies compared omega-3 fatty acid supplementation with placebo lasting from four weeks to two years. Three studies with long treatment periods administered additional substances, making any observed effects impossible to attribute to omega-3 fatty acids and were excluded from the statistical analyses. One study did not express any mean values and, therefore, could not be included in statistical analyses.</P>
<P>No significant differences between intervention and control groups were observed in pain-free walking distance (mean difference (MD) 11.62 m, 95% confidence interval (CI) -67.74 to 90.98), maximal walking distance (MD 16.99 m, 95% CI -72.14 to 106.11), ankle brachial pressure index (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.05), total cholesterol levels (MD 0.27 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.48 to 1.01), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (MD 0.00 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.15), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (MD 0.44 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.31 to 1.19), triglyceride levels (MD -0.39 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.10 to 0.33), systolic blood pressure (MD 5.00 mmHg, 95% CI -11.59 to 21.59) or plasma viscosity (MD 0.03 mPa/s, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.08).</P>
<P>There was some limited evidence that blood but not plasma viscosity levels decreased with treatment and gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and flatulence were observed in two studies.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-06-13 10:26:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Omega-3 fatty acids appear to have little haematological benefit in people with intermittent claudication and there is no evidence of consistently improved clinical outcomes (quality of life, walking distance, ankle brachial pressure index or angiographic findings). Supplementation may also cause adverse effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and flatulence. Further research is needed to evaluate fully short- and long-term effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the most clinically relevant outcomes in people with intermittent claudication before they can be recommended for routine use.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-06-19 09:45:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intermittent claudication is the most common presenting symptom among people with chronic lower limb arterial disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ouriel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouriel 2001</LINK>). Ischaemia of the calf muscles causes exercise-induced lower leg discomfort that classically resolves with rest. In severe progressive disease, pain also occurs at rest and is usually localised in the foot (<LINK REF="REF-Ouriel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouriel 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The condition becomes more common with advancing age. The prevalence has been estimated at 1% to 2.5% in people aged 50 to 60 years, rising to 5% to 9% in people over 65 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Meijer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meijer 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoffers-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoffers 1991</LINK>). Asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease (often defined pragmatically as an ankle brachial pressure index (ABI) less than 0.90 in either leg) is even more common, affecting 17% of men and 20% of women in the over-55 year age group (<LINK REF="REF-Meijer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meijer 1998</LINK>). Symptomatic and asymptomatic disease are strongly associated with future cardiovascular (CV) events (<LINK REF="REF-Criqui-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Criqui 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Management of intermittent claudication includes the targeting of risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Regensteiner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regensteiner 2002</LINK>). Treatment of symptoms may include various vasoactive drugs, exercise regimens, and more complex interventions such as bypass surgery and angioplasty (<LINK REF="REF-Ouriel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouriel 2001</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-06-13 12:19:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The omega-3 fatty acid family consists of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and alpha-linolenic acid (LNA). EPA and DPA are the active forms of the omega-3 family and are found in certain fish oils, for example salmon and mackerel. Green leafy vegetables and soybean oil contain LNA, which, when consumed, is converted to EPA and then docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).</P>
<P>Previous Cochrane reviews have investigated the potential benefit of omega-3 fatty acids in cystic fibrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Oliver-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 2011</LINK>), type II diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Hartweg-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartweg 2008</LINK>), dysmenorrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Proctor-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proctor 2001</LINK>), schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Irving-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irving 2006</LINK>), pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Makrides-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makrides 2006</LINK>), and CV disease (<LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2004</LINK>), with generally inconclusive results.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-06-19 09:45:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the 1990's much interest has surrounded the use of omega-3 fatty acids (usually in the form of fish oils) to target the origin and development of coronary artery disease. Through effects on lipoprotein metabolism, haemostatic function, inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and anti-arrhythmic actions, omega-3 fatty acids have been found both to prevent the development of and to reduce the mortality from coronary artery disease (<LINK REF="REF-Abeywardena-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abeywardena 2001</LINK>). The UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on secondary prevention in people following a myocardial infarction (MI) have found omega-3 fatty acids to be a cost-effective therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2007</LINK>), although evidence would now suggest that in people with CV disease, omega-3 fatty acid supplements do not reduce adverse CV outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Halim-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halim 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>At a molecular level omega-3 fatty acids are thought to achieve their effects through several different molecular pathways, including alteration of physical and chemical properties of cellular membranes, direct interaction with and modulation of membrane channels and proteins, regulation of gene expression via nuclear receptors and transcription factors, changes in eicosanoid profiles and conversion of omega-3 fatty acids to bioactive metabolites (<LINK REF="REF-Mozaffarian-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mozaffarian 2011</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-06-19 09:46:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Atherosclerosis is a systemic disorder with shared risk factors which are independent of the specific arterial system involved. For this reason, omega-3 fatty acids may also prove beneficial in peripheral arterial disease. This review has sought to identify and evaluate all studies involving the use of omega-3 fatty acids in people with intermittent claudication to determine the effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids based on available evidence. Areas requiring further investigation have also been identified.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-06-13 10:36:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on clinical, haematological and biochemical parameters in people with intermittent claudication. This was assessed by the effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on pain-free walking distance (PFWD), maximal walking distance (MWD), quality of life scores, ankle brachial pressure index (ABI), angiographic changes, amputation rate, revascularisation procedures, mortality, vascular events, plasma lipid levels, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and blood/plasma viscosity.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-06-13 12:18:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We performed statistical analyses according to the statistical guidelines for review authors in the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group using Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>) software.</P>
<P>Since the data were continuous, we extracted mean and SD values for each outcome and analysed using the mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI), as the summary statistic. If appropriate, we pooled results for the purpose of meta-analysis. We excluded three studies from the analysis process as they administered additional active substances to their intervention groups, which made it impossible to attribute any observed effects to omega-3 fatty acids alone (<LINK REF="STD-Carrero-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Carrero 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carrero-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Carrero 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK>). One study could not be included in the analysis process as they did not express mean values (preferring median (25th; 75th percentile) values) for any outcomes; this made it impossible to combine the results of this study with the other included studies in a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Schiano-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schiano 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Unfortunately, no study presented SDs for the differences between pre- and post-intervention values. This meant that the MD analysis was carried out on the difference between treatment and control values in the post-trial period, ignoring the baseline values. Since all the studies were randomised, baseline values should have been balanced between groups. Some papers presented standard errors (SE) rather than SDs. These figures were, therefore, converted to SDs with the formula SD = &#8730;N x SE.</P>

Therefore, a decision had to be made on which values to consider. <LINK REF="STD-Mori-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 1992</LINK> took measurements at two, four, and ten weeks. As the ten week measurements were taken six weeks after cessation of therapy (by which time the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation might have subsided), the four-week values were used in the analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK> measured outcomes at six, 12, 18 and 24 months. The 24-month data were used because it was felt that the maximal effect of the intervention therapy would be observed at this time. <LINK REF="STD-Carrero-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Carrero 2005</LINK> took measurements at three, six, nine and 12 months.

<P>The studies were clinically heterogeneous in terms of dose, duration of therapy and placebo used. We used both fixed-effect and random-effects models in every analysis; where statistical heterogeneity was detected (by the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test) we used the random-effects model and MD is presented.</P>
<P>Three studies showed particular clinical heterogeneity. <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK> took place over a longer time period and involved a greater number of participants than the other studies. In addition, it evaluated the effect of both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid supplementation. This made it difficult to attribute any particular effects to omega-3 fatty acids, since omega-6 fatty acids have also been described as having lipid-lowering and anti-hypertensive effects (<LINK REF="REF-Greene-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greene 1997</LINK>). It used linoleic acid as a placebo, even though this is a precursor compound of GLA. The authors acknowledge in the paper that the linoleic acid given to the control group may have been (at least partly) metabolised into GLA. This study also had the highest number of withdrawals and dropouts. <LINK REF="STD-Carrero-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Carrero 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Carrero-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Carrero 2006</LINK> also differed from the other studies in that the intervention preparation, as well as containing omega-3 fatty acids, contained oleic acid and certain vitamins (not included in the placebo preparation). In addition, the omega-3 fatty acid dose was very small. Participants in both intervention and control groups were also given antiplatelet therapy and a haemorrheologic agent. Due to the clinical heterogeneity of these studies, we excluded them from the meta-analysis. A secondary analysis involving only these three studies was considered but not performed as it would be impossible to attribute any observed effects to omega-3 fatty acids.</P>

<P>Of the remaining four studies, <LINK REF="STD-Carrero-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Carrero 2005</LINK> described a fall in HDL cholesterol in both intervention and control groups (from 1.27 mmol/L to 1.17 mmol/L, P value &lt; 0.001 for intervention and from 1.30 mmol/L to 1.22 mmol/L, P value &lt; 0.05 for control).

No significant change in VLDL levels was observed in the <LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK> study. <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK> found that at six months, those who went on to complete the study had significantly higher VLDL cholesterol levels as compared to the control group (1.2 mmol/L (SD 0.97) compared with 1.06 mmol/L (SD 0.96), P value &lt; 0.05).</P>
<P>Since <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK> was excluded from the meta-analysis, the mean difference (MD) was only calculated for <LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK>.

<P>Despite the three studies having positive results, when the results were pooled no significant difference was found between post-intervention treatment and control groups (MD -0.39 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.10 to 0.33). Statistical heterogeneity was present in this analysis (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 72%), therefore the random-effects model MD is presented. The lack of a significant difference between intervention and control groups may have been due to the fact that the analysis did not take into account the higher baseline triglyceride levels in the intervention group compared to the control group in the <LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK> study.</P>
<P>Of the studies not included in the meta-analysis, only <LINK REF="STD-Schiano-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schiano 2008</LINK> found any significant differences in triglyceride levels. There was a decrease in triglyceride levels from 171 mmol/L to 108 mmol/L (P value = 0.03) after three months in the treatment group.

In <LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK>, DBP fell significantly by 13% in the intervention group (P value &lt; 0.05) and by 14% in the control group (P value &lt; 0.05). SBP fell significantly in the control group (by 7%, P value &lt; 0.05) but no significant change was observed in the intervention group. Mean post-trial DBP was lower in the intervention group (MD -2.00, 95% CI -3.74 to -0.26) but this was due to a higher mean baseline DBP in the control group. Mean SBP at the end of the trial showed no significant difference between treatment and control groups (MD 5.00, 95% CI -11.59 to 21.59).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK> (which was excluded from the meta-analysis) detected a statistically significant reduction in SBP of 5% (P value &lt; 0.05) in the intervention group versus an increase of 0.25% in the control group.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mortality and vascular events</HEADING>
<P>Only one study reported mortality and vascular events (<LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK>). There was no significant difference between treatment and control groups in the incidence of all-cause mortality with three deaths (5%) in each group (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.0, 95% CI 0.2 to 5.0), and CV mortality with two deaths (3%) in each group (Peto OR 1, 95% CI 0.1 to 7.3). The intervention group had a lower incidence of non-fatal coronary events with six (10%) events in the intervention group versus nine (15%) events in the control group (Peto OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.9), but this was not statistically significant (P value &gt; 0.05). The control group had a lower incidence of non-fatal stroke/transient ischaemic attack with one (1.7%) event in the intervention group versus three (5%) events in the control group (Peto OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.9), and lower limb angioplasty/bypass surgery with one (1.7%) in the intervention group versus three (5%) in the control group (Peto OR 2.8, 95% CI 0.4 to 20.3), but neither difference was statistically significant (P value &gt; 0.05). Similarly, progression to critical limb ischaemia/amputation did not differ significantly between groups with one (1.7%) in the intervention group versus zero in the control group (Peto OR 0.1, 95% CI 0 to 6.8, no P value quoted in paper).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blood viscosity</HEADING>
<P>This laboratory test can be performed at varying shear rates. Three studies reported blood viscosity (<LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodcock-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Woodcock 1984</LINK>). In the Woodcock study, a statistically significant reduction was found at shear rates of both 230/s and 23/s in the intervention group (9.13 mPa/s (1.38) to 7.88 mPa/s (0.85), P value &lt; 0.05 at shear rate of 23/s) (<LINK REF="STD-Woodcock-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Woodcock 1984</LINK>). No change was found in the control group. The <LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK> study found a statistically significant reduction in blood viscosity at low shear rates (0.945/s and 0.081/s) in the intervention group only (52.9 mPa/s (4.2) to 50.9 mPa/s (3.9), P value &lt; 0.01 at shear rate of 0.945/s). The Leng study found no significant change in blood viscosity in either group (described as high shear rates but exact rate not given) (<LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since this haematological test was carried out at different shear rates, the results were not pooled for analysis. However, the fact that two studies detected statistically significant falls in blood viscosity makes it likely that a meta-analysis would have indicated a significant effect.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-13 11:37:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review included nine studies representing 425 participants, examining the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. On the basis of these studies, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation did not improve ABI or walking distance. It would also appear to have no effect on lipid levels (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides), blood pressure, mortality or vascular events. Blood viscosity was reduced with seven weeks to two years of supplementation. There appears to be a surrogate benefit but there is little evidence for improved clinical outcomes. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may also be associated with gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and flatulence.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-07-03 09:27:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This Cochrane review involved 425 participants including both men and women. Certain patient groups (e.g. those with a diagnosis of diabetes) were excluded from the majority of studies; thus, findings from this review may not necessarily be applicable to these groups of patients.</P>
<P>Trials involving any form, dose and duration of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation were eligible. In the majority of trials, omega-3 fatty acids supplementation came in the form of capsules. No studies included in this review used dietary manipulation (e.g. increasing oily fish consumption) as a means of supplementation.</P>
<P>The small sample sizes used in three of the trials may also have resulted in a failure to detect significant clinical effects. Although two studies included a power calculation (<LINK REF="STD-Conway-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Conway 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK>), <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK> was only powered to detect a significant change in cholesterol levels and <LINK REF="STD-Conway-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Conway 2005</LINK> was only powered to detect a 20% change in PFWD.</P>
<P>It is interesting to note that none of the studies used an inactive placebo. This may have masked certain effects of omega-3 fatty acids. Both oleic acid (a monounsaturated fatty acid) and linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) have been shown to have therapeutic effects on lipids and blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Sirtori-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sirtori 1992</LINK>). A previous study involving omega-3 fatty acids (<LINK REF="REF-Belluzzi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belluzzi 1996</LINK>) found that Miglyol (capric and caprillic acid) was a suitable inactive placebo.</P>
<P>The short time-span of the included studies may also have contributed to the lack of observed effects on clinical outcomes. With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Carrero-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Carrero 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Carrero-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Carrero 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK> (which were all excluded from the meta-analysis), the trial periods ranged from four weeks to four months. <LINK REF="STD-Mori-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 1992</LINK> followed up the participants for six weeks after treatment but only four weeks of therapy was given. <LINK REF="STD-Woodcock-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Woodcock 1984</LINK> administered only seven weeks of therapy and <LINK REF="STD-Schiano-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schiano 2008</LINK> eight weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Stricker-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Stricker 2008</LINK> used three months of therapy, while <LINK REF="STD-Conway-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Conway 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK> used four months. No long-term follow-up of participants was performed.</P>
<P>Insufficient doses of omega-3 fatty acids may have been used in at least two of the studies. While <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK> administered treatment for a substantial period of time (two years), only a small daily dose of EPA was used (270 mg). Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Carrero-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Carrero 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Carrero-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Carrero 2006</LINK> used only 130 mg DHA and 200 mg EPA per day. Previously published studies have shown that a combined intake of 1.5 g to 4 g of EPA and DHA per day is required in order to observe anti-thrombotic, triglyceride-lowering, blood and plasma viscosity-lowering and endothelium-modifying effects. The three remaining studies (those included in the meta-analysis) do appear to have used therapeutic doses of omega-3 fatty acids.</P>
<P>As discussed earlier, two (<LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodcock-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Woodcock 1984</LINK>) of the three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodcock-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Woodcock 1984</LINK>) investigating blood viscosity found statistically significant reductions in blood viscosity in the intervention group. Blood viscosity can be measured at varying shear rates. Similar to blood pressure, blood viscosity can vary greatly between systole (high shear rate) and diastole (low shear rate). It is, therefore, important to test blood viscosity at both high and low shear rates; however, only <LINK REF="STD-Woodcock-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Woodcock 1984</LINK> did so. Despite only testing at a low shear rate, <LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK> detected a significant change in blood viscosity between groups. <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK>, however, only tested blood viscosity at high shear rates and did not detect a significant difference between groups. If blood viscosity had also been measured at a low rate, it is possible that different results may have been obtained. High blood viscosity is associated with intermittent claudication (<LINK REF="REF-Lowe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowe 1993</LINK>), although it remains unclear whether lowering blood viscosity is clinically beneficial.</P>
<P>As only four studies discussed adverse effects of therapy, it is difficult to determine whether the dose or formulation of omega-3 fatty acid is related to adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Conway-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Conway 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiano-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schiano 2008</LINK>). The fact that two of the studies reported that no participants reported side effects suggest that omega-3 fatty acids are generally well tolerated (<LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiano-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schiano 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK> reported increased gastrointestinal side effects despite a small daily dose of EPA suggesting that side effects are unlikely to be dose related. The intervention group in this study also included omega-6 fatty acids making it impossible to attribute the side effects specifically to omega-3 fatty acids. The severity and burden of these side effects suffered is unclear. <LINK REF="STD-Conway-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Conway 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK> used very similar daily doses of omega-3 fatty acids. Three participants from the intervention group compared to one participant in the control group withdrew from <LINK REF="STD-Conway-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Conway 2005</LINK> due to nausea or an inability to take the medication, whereas no adverse effects were reported in <LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK>. One potential explanation for the difference between the two studies is that in <LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK>, the dose was divided in to six different capsules whereas in <LINK REF="STD-Conway-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Conway 2005</LINK> the full daily dose was contained in one capsule. It is, therefore, possible that the way the omega-3 fatty acids are administered may contribute to the occurrence of adverse effects. None of the studies that used dairy drinks to administer the omega-3 fatty acids discussed side effects of therapy so it is, therefore, impossible to compare with giving omega-3 fatty acids in capsules.</P>
<P>To monitor compliance among participants, <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mori-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schiano-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schiano 2008</LINK> counted the number of returned capsules. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Stricker-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Stricker 2008</LINK> assessed compliance by the return of empty bottles. <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK> also directly asked participants about compliance. In addition, five of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Carrero-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Carrero 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carrero-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Carrero 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mori-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Woodcock-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Woodcock 1984</LINK>) measured either plasma or platelet phospholipid fatty acid composition among participants and found increases in omega-3 fatty acid concentrations in the intervention groups. As well as confirming compliance, these findings demonstrated that the omega-3 supplements had been absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK> found compliance to be high among those who completed the study, with 95% taking at least 1.12 g GLA and 180 mg EPA daily and 74% taking the full dose of 1.68 g GLA and 270 mg EPA. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Mori-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 1992</LINK> found compliance to be 99% for the fish oil group and 98% for the control group. <LINK REF="STD-Schiano-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schiano 2008</LINK> found compliance with omega-3 fatty acid treatment to be satisfactory (&gt; 94%). <LINK REF="STD-Carrero-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Carrero 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Carrero-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Carrero 2006</LINK> describes compliance as "good" (assessed by regular telephone calls to participants and collection of empty dairy containers). <LINK REF="STD-Conway-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Conway 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Woodcock-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Woodcock 1984</LINK> did not report compliance figures.</P>
<P>The primary outcome of quality of life was only investigated by one of the studies included in this review. No studies provided data on angiographic findings (another of our primary outcomes). Clinical outcomes were generally less commonly reported than biochemical or haematological outcomes, with blood pressure and side effects only evaluated by a minority of studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiano-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Schiano 2008</LINK>), and only one study publishing data on mortality, morbidity and progression to amputation (<LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK>). Economic consequences of therapy were not assessed in any of the studies and may have been useful.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-06-13 11:43:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nine studies were included in the review involving 425 participants from six countries. The quality assessment process for the systematic review of omega-3 for intermittent claudication found little evidence of major bias; however, there is some uncertainty around key elements in particular threats to the internal validity arising from possible poor blinding and allocation concealment. There was a small amount of evidence to suggest that the results were biased by random sequence generation, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. More details can be found in the 'Risk of bias' tables.</P>
<P>In addition, three trials involved the administration of additional substances to participants making it impossible to attribute any effects of treatment specifically to omega-3 fatty acids and were, therefore, excluded from the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Carrero-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Carrero 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carrero-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Carrero 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leng-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leng 1998</LINK>). This meant that the actual number of participants and studies included in the meta-analysis for each outcome was actually small with 205 participants involved in the remaining six studies.</P>
<P>There was also significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity discovered between the included studies suggesting that caution should be applied when interpreting the results of this review.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-06-13 11:44:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In order to minimise any potential bias in the review process every effort was made to conduct this review to the standards recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The studies were not homogeneous in terms of sample size, dose of therapy, duration of therapy and timing of physiological measurements. Therefore, the appropriateness of pooling individual results had to be assessed. Despite the three most clinically heterogeneous studies being excluded from the meta-analysis process, the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test statistic still showed significant statistical heterogeneity in the LDL, triglycerides and PFWD analyses. For this reason, caution should be applied when interpreting these results.</P>
<P>The analysis in this review was carried out on post-intervention values only, using the MD between treatment and control groups. This was done because none of the papers provided sufficient data to compare the MD between pre- and post-intervention values between groups. This meant that baseline values were not acknowledged by the analysis. Since the studies were all randomised, the baseline values should have been relatively equal. However, for certain outcomes this was not the case. For example, the baseline triglyceride levels were higher in the omega-3 group than in the control group in <LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK>. Even though the difference between pre- and post-trial values was greatest for the intervention group, the control group had a lower mean triglyceride level at the end of the study. This led to the MD showing no significant difference between the two, despite the fact that every study detected a fall in triglyceride levels. A further example of this problem was found in the DBP analysis. The baseline DBP levels in <LINK REF="STD-Gans-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gans 1990</LINK> were higher in the control group compared to the treatment group. This led to the MD erroneously indicating that mean post-trial DBP levels were lower in the intervention group, despite a similar reduction in DBP being observed in both intervention and control groups.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-06-13 12:16:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of this review disagree slightly to the findings of the original version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Sommerfield-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommerfield 2004</LINK>). The original review found that individuals with intermittent claudication may lead to a slight increase in total and LDL cholesterol levels. These findings were not replicated in this updated version of the review, which found no impact of omega-3 fatty acids on these measures when evidence of three new studies were included. The two versions of the review are, however, in agreement for all other outcomes.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-06-13 11:45:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>On the basis of these studies, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (in the form of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) should not be recommended for routine use in intermittent claudication unless further evidence emerges in their favour. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may reduce blood viscosity but there is no clear evidence of clinical benefit and gastrointestinal side effects may occur.</P>
<P>The fact that all the studies used omega-3 fatty acid capsules or dairy drinks means that no conclusions can be drawn about the benefits of dietary manipulation of omega-3 fatty acid intake, such as increased consumption of oily fish.<BR/>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-06-13 11:45:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review has shown that more research is required in this area. In particular, an adequately powered study is needed to compare a therapeutic dose of an omega-3 fatty acid with an inactive placebo. Further research comparing different formulations and doses of omega-3 fatty acids may be useful. Important outcomes that require adequate evaluation include walking distance, ankle brachial pressure index (ABI), quality of life, vascular events (fatal and non-fatal) and adverse effects. Long-term follow-up of participants is essential.</P>
<P>From a public health perspective, it would be useful to consider clinical effectiveness as well as the economic aspects of omega-3 supplementation such as those presented by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) following myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2007</LINK>). Mortality and morbidity outcomes, such as progression to surgery, would be particularly relevant in such an analysis. A study examining the effects of dietary manipulation would also be useful, as people may prefer to consume omega-3 fatty acids in a more natural form, rather than via capsules.</P>
