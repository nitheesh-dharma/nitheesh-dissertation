<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-04-14 02:25:42 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="Julie A Brown">
<P>The administration of antibiotics before or following transcervical intrauterine procedures may prevent infection. The lower genital tract is an area which is abundant with normal flora (resident bacteria) so that operative procedures which pass through it may increase the risk of infection. The operative procedure may cause contamination of the uterine cavity with vaginal or cervical flora, or both. In addition, the associated trauma may compromise the ability of the uterus to combat infection. The prophylactic administration of antibiotics (giving antibiotics before the development of any infection) in women undergoing transcervical intrauterine procedures may prevent infection post-procedure. There have been no randomised controlled trials evaluating the usefulness of antibiotics for the prevention of infection after these procedures. Therefore we could not draw any conclusions regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of post-procedure transcervical intrauterine infections</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-04-26 17:52:42 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antibiotic prophylaxis is the use of antibiotics for the prevention of infection. There are special considerations regarding the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in obstetric and gynaecological procedures. Because the lower genital tract is abundant with normal vaginal flora, operation through or adjacent to this area can lead to a moderate to high incidence of infection. There are established recommendations for using antibiotic prophylaxis in many major procedures, for example, vaginal hysterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2001</LINK>), abdominal hysterectomy (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mittendorf-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mittendorf 1993</LINK>) and caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chelmow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chelmow 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smaill-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smaill 2010</LINK>). There are no clear recommendations for minor operative procedures such as dilatation and curettage for evacuation of conceptive products, fractional curettage for abnormal uterine bleeding, hysterosalpingography for infertility evaluation, and hysteroscopy for intrauterine cavity diagnosis and treatment.<BR/>
</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-04-14 02:28:28 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Transcervical intrauterine procedures involve the passage of an instrument through the endocervical canal into the uterine cavity. The procedures include the collection of endometrial tissue to assess the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding, hysterosalpingography for infertility evaluation, hysteroscopy for intrauterine cavity diagnosis and treatment, and the evacuation of conceptive products. These are minor procedures. Women who undergo these procedures are at risk of infection due to exposure to the abundant genital bacteria. Infectious morbidities after these procedures include endometritis and pelvic inflammatory diseases, which need antibiotic treatment or surgical drainage, and may cause prolonged hospitalisation.</P>
<P>The incidence of infectious morbidity from transcervical intrauterine procedures varies widely according to the background prevalence for the study population and the procedure involved. A study of pelvic inflammatory diseases (PID) after dilatation and curettage in women with metrorrhagia found that 4 of 33 women who received doxycycline for one week, and 3 of 34 women who did not receive any antibiotic regimen after the procedure, had PID (<LINK REF="STD-Makris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Makris 2000</LINK>). The incidence of infectious morbidity after hysterosalpingography has been reported as 3.1% in 448 women (<LINK REF="REF-Stumpf-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stumpf 1980</LINK>) and 44% in 150 women (<LINK REF="REF-Lema-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lema 1993</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-04-14 01:31:53 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The intervention of interest in this review is the administration of antibiotics to women without documented infection, prior to a transcervical intrauterine procedure, with the aim of preventing postoperative infection.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-04-26 17:52:42 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Using prophylactic antibiotics for surgical procedures through or adjacent to the vagina, such as caesarean section, vaginal hysterectomy and abdominal hysterectomy, is recommended for reducing postoperative febrile morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chelmow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chelmow 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mittendorf-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mittendorf 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smaill-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smaill 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Transcervical intrauterine procedures also entail a risk of contamination by vaginal flora and might result in infection. However, there is no consensus on whether it is necessary to use prophylactic antibiotics to prevent postoperative infection for this type of surgery. There are no recommendations for these minor operative procedures, probably because they cause relatively small areas of raw surface and tissue trauma. It is questionable as to whether or not antibiotic prophylaxis for these minor procedures is associated with more benefit than harm. However, these procedures may cause ascending infection from the lower genital tract to the upper genital tract, especially those procedures that pass through the endocervical canal into the uterine cavity. Therefore, antibiotic prophylaxis might have a role in the prevention of infection.</P>
<P>A randomised controlled trial to assess the effect of prophylactic antibiotics on the incidence of bacteraemia following hysteroscopic surgery found the incidence to be 16% of 61 women in the non-antibiotic group and 2% of 55 women in the antibiotic group (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 1995</LINK>). A study of metronidazole in prostaglandin-induced abortion reported pyrexia in 24% of 142 women without prophylactic antibiotics and 4.1% of 145 women with prophylactic antibiotics. A study of PID after hysterosalpingography in 116 women, which was associated with <I>Chlamydia trachomatis</I> and <I>Mycoplasma hominis</I>, reported that two of the four cases who developed PID were positive for <I>C. trachomatis</I> before the procedure. The authors concluded that <I>C. trachomatis</I> should be identified in women before hysterosalpingography and, if detected, an appropriate antibiotic should be given before the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Moller-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moller 1984</LINK>). Another study of tubo-ovarian abscess after operative hysteroscopy found that the women who did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis had a higher incidence of infection following the procedure than the group who had antibiotic prophylaxis. These findings were in a high-risk group with a history of PID (<LINK REF="STD-McCausland-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McCausland 1993</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-04-14 01:31:53 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Transcervical intrauterine procedures are common in obstetric and gynaecological practices. These procedures are considered to be clean-contaminated or contaminated surgery, with a high possibility of infectious complications. It is not clear from the literature whether antibiotic prophylaxis protects against infection following transcervical intrauterine procedures and so we undertook this systematic review. There are already reviews of antibiotic prophylaxis for intrauterine contraceptive device insertion, medical or surgical first trimester induced abortion, and antibiotics for incomplete abortion (<LINK REF="REF-Grimes-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-May-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">May 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Snieders-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snieders 2005</LINK>). We have adjusted the published protocol, which initially included women undergoing intrauterine insemination or instillation and embryo transfer (<LINK REF="REF-Kroon-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroon 2012</LINK>), to exclude these women since they are now the topic of other Cochrane systematic reviews.</P>

<P>We planned to select trials in which the administration of antibiotics was done before or immediately after the procedure and without any documentation of an existing infection at that time. Study selection was to be undertaken by two review authors (JT and PL). The titles and abstracts of articles found in the search would be screened by JT, who would discard studies that were clearly ineligible but would aim to be overly inclusive rather than risk losing relevant studies. JT would obtain copies of the full-text articles and would make copies for PL; details of the authors and institutions would have been struck out and the results section removed. Both review authors would independently assess whether the studies met the inclusion criteria, with disagreements resolved by discussion. Further information would be sought from the authors where papers contained insufficient information to make a decision about eligibility.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-04-26 17:52:42 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for major operative obstetric and gynaecologic procedures, such as hysterectomy and caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chelmow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chelmow 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mittendorf-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mittendorf 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smaill-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smaill 2010</LINK>). For minor operative procedures there is conflicting evidence regarding the use of routine prophylactic antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lema-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lema 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Makris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCausland-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McCausland 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moller-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moller 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stumpf-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stumpf 1980</LINK>). In this review we planned to use randomised controlled trials to assess the effects of antibiotics on prevention of infection as well as the occurrence of adverse events after minor procedures such as fractional curettage for evacuation of the whole endometrial lining tissue, endometrial sampling for some part of the endometrial lining tissue, hysterosalpingography, hysteroscopy, hysteroscopic surgery, endometrial ablation and endometrial resection. While prophylactic antibiotics for transcervical intrauterine procedures may be of value, we have not been able to determine whether there are any benefits or harms of this intervention.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-04-14 01:01:24 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence to either support or discourage the use of antibiotics to prevent infection for transcervical intrauterine procedures. Prophylactic antibiotics may be considered in populations and areas where the incidence of infection after transcervical intrauterine procedures is high. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-04-14 01:01:24 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Transcervical intrauterine procedures may increase the risk of infection after the procedure. However, there is conflicting evidence as to the benefit of routine prophylactic antibiotics. Some observational studies have found prophylaxis useful. Double-blinded randomised trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics to placebo are needed before any conclusions can be made about the role of prophylactic antibiotics for intracervical intrauterine procedures.</P>
