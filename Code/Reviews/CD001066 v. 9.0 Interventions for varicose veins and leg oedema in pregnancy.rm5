<P>There is not enough evidence on treatments for varicose veins and leg oedema in pregnancy.</P>
<P>Varicose veins, sometimes called varicosity, occur when a valve in the blood vessel walls weakens and the blood stagnates. This in turn leads to problems with the circulation in the veins and to oedema or swelling. The vein then becomes distended, its walls stretch and sag, allowing the vein to swell into a tiny balloon near the surface of the skin. The veins in the legs are most commonly affected as they are working against gravity, but the vulva (vaginal opening) or rectum, resulting in haemorrhoids (piles), can be affected too. Pregnancy seems to increase the risk of varicose veins and they cause considerable pain, night cramps, numbness, tingling, the legs may feel heavy, achy, and they are rather ugly. Treatments for varicose veins are usually divided into three main groups: pharmacological treatments, non-pharmacological and surgery. The review identified seven trials involving 326 women. Although there was a moderate quality evidence to suggest that the drug rutoside seemed to be effective in reducing symptoms, the study was too small to be able to say this with real confidence. Similarly, with reflexology and water immersion, there were insufficient data to be able to assess benefits and harms, but they looked promising. Compression stockings do not appear to have any advantages. More research is needed.</P>

<P>Pregnancy is presumed to be a major contributory factor in the increased incidence of varicose veins in women, which can in turn lead to venous insufficiency and leg oedema. The most common symptom of varicose veins and oedema is the substantial pain experienced, as well as night cramps, numbness, tingling, the legs may feel heavy, achy, and possibly be unsightly. Treatments for varicose veins are usually divided into three main groups: surgery, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. Treatments of leg oedema comprise mostly symptom reduction rather than cure and use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-15 15:45:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included seven trials (involving 326 women). The trials were largely unclear for selection bias and high risk for performance and detection bias. </P>
<P>Two studies were placebo-controlled trials. The first one compared a phlebotonic (rutoside) with placebo for the reduction in symptoms of varicose veins; the second study evaluated the efficacy of troxerutin in comparison to placebo among 30 pregnant women in their second trimester with symptomatic vulvar varicosities and venous insufficiency in their lower extremities. Data from this study were not in useable format, so were not included in the analysis. Two trials compared either compression stockings with resting in left lateral position or reflexology with rest for 15 minutes for the reduction of leg oedema. One trial compared standing water immersion for 20 minutes with sitting upright in a chair with legs elevated for 20 minutes. Women standing in water were allowed to stand or walk in place. One trial compared 20 minutes of daily foot massage for five consecutive days and usual prenatal care versus usual prenatal care. The final trial compared three treatment groups for treating leg oedema in pregnancy. The first group was assigned to lateral supine bed rest at room temperature, women in the second group were asked to sit in a bathtub of waist-deep water at 32  0.5 C with their legs horizontal and the third group included the women who were randomised to sitting immersed in shoulder-deep water at 32  0.5 C with legs extended downward. We did not include this study in the analysis as outcomes reported in the paper were not pre-specified outcomes of this review.</P>
<P>We planned to use GRADE methods to assess outcomes for two different comparisons and assign a quality rating. However, only two out of three outcomes for one comparison were reported and could be assessed. Evidence from one trial (rutoside versus placebo) for the outcomes of reduction in symptoms and incidence of complications associated with varicose veins and oedema was assessed as of moderate quality.</P>
<P>
<B>Rutoside versus placebo</B>
</P>
<P>One trial involving 69 women, reported that rutoside significantly reduced the symptoms associated with varicose veins (risk ratio (RR) 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 3.22; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). The incidence of complications (deep vein thrombosis) did not differ significantly between the two groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.17, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.49; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). There were no significant differences in side-effects (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.23 to 7.28). Women's perception of pain was not reported in this trial.</P>
<P>
<B>External pneumatic intermittent compression versus rest</B>
</P>
<P>One trial, involving 35 women, reported no significant difference in lower leg volume when compression stockings were compared against rest (mean difference (MD) -258.80, 95% CI -566.91 to 49.31).</P>
<P>
<B>Reflexology versus resting</B>
</P>
<P>Another trial, involving 55 women, compared reflexology with rest. Reflexology significantly reduced the symptoms associated with oedema (reduction in symptoms: RR 9.09, 95% CI 1.41 to 58.54). The same study showed a trend towards satisfaction and acceptability with the intervention (RR 6.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 39.11).</P>
<P>
<B>Water immersion versus leg elevation</B>
</P>
<P>There was evidence from one trial, involving 32 women, to suggest that water immersion for 20 minutes in a swimming pool reduces leg volume (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.83).</P>
<P>
<B>Foot massage versus routine care</B>
</P>
<P>One trial, involving 80 women reported no significant difference in lower leg circumference when foot massage was compared against routine care (MD -0.11, 95% CI -1.02 to 0.80).</P>
<P>No other primary or secondary outcomes were reported in the trials.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-09-16 14:18:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is moderate quality evidence to suggest that rutosides appear to help relieve the symptoms of varicose veins in late pregnancy. However, this finding is based on one study (69 women) and there are not enough data presented in the study to assess its safety in pregnancy. Reflexology or water immersion appears to help improve symptoms for women with leg oedema, but again this is based on two small studies (43 and 32 women, respectively).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-09-14 17:35:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The body's veins are responsible for ensuring blood flows back to the heart. To assist this process veins are designed with a series of valves, which close between heartbeats to prevent the blood flowing backwards. A varicose vein, sometimes called varicosity, occurs when a valve weakens, putting more pressure on other valves and causing blood to stagnate. The vein then becomes distended, its walls stretch and, like tired elastic, sag, allowing the vein to swell in that region into a miniature balloon near the surface of the skin. The veins in the legs are most commonly affected as they are working against gravity, but the vulva (vaginal opening) or rectum, resulting in haemorrhoids (piles), can be affected.</P>
<P>Varicose veins are most commonly seen in North America and Western Europe. Vein problems are less common in the Mediterranean Basin, South America, and India and even more uncommon in the Far East and Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2006</LINK>). They are more common in women compared with men (<LINK REF="REF-Criquiui-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Criquiui 2003</LINK>). Pregnancy is presumed to be a major contributory factor in the increased incidence of varicose veins in women (<LINK REF="REF-Stansby-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stansby 2000</LINK>); varicose veins affecting about 40% of pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-Rabhi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabhi 2000</LINK>). Evidence suggests that parous women (having had a previous pregnancy) have a higher incidence of varicose veins compared with nulliparous women (no previous pregnancy), and that multiparous women (more than one previous pregnancy) have the highest risk (<LINK REF="REF-Beebe_x002d_Dimmer--2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beebe-Dimmer 2005</LINK>). In 70% to 80% of women who develop problems with varicose veins during pregnancy, the symptoms appear during the first trimester (first three months of pregnancy), often within two to three weeks of a woman becoming pregnant (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>During pregnancy increased blood volume puts veins under increased pressure. In addition, an increase in the hormone progesterone relaxes the muscular walls of the blood vessels. This makes it even more difficult for veins to move blood from the lower body back to the heart. The increasing weight of the growing uterus (womb) puts pressure on the pelvic veins and on the inferior vena cava (a large vein on the right side of the body that receives blood from the lower limbs and the greater part of the pelvic and abdominal organs and carries it back to the heart). This increases blood pressure in the leg veins, and thus influences the development of varicose veins. As the baby grows and the uterus enlarges, the veins become even more prominent. Moreover, there are oestrogen and progesterone receptors in saphenous veins (veins in the leg) and, although their function is not known, it has been claimed that they may provoke venous dilation and valve failure in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Mashiah-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mashiah 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>This same process can in turn lead to venous insufficiency and leg oedema (excess fluid collecting in tissues causing swelling). The slowing down of the circulation causes blood to pool in the legs, forcing fluid from the veins into the tissues of the feet and ankles. Leg oedema can affect up to 80% of pregnant women, and should not be considered to be a sign of pregnancy-induced hypertension or pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Enkin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enkin 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most common symptom of varicose veins and oedema is the substantial pain experienced, as well as night cramps, numbness, tingling, the legs may feel heavy, achy, and possibly be unsightly. The skin around the varicose vein may also itch, throb, or feel like it is burning. Symptoms tend to worsen after long periods of standing and with each successive pregnancy. For some women, however, varicose veins or oedema can cause little or no discomfort.</P>
<P>Although unlikely, there are potential complications associated with varicose veins and the resulting oedema. Possibilities include venous thrombus (small blood clot in vein), thrombophlebitis (inflammation of the vein), bleeding of the varicose vein, deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the deep veins, usually legs), and pulmonary embolism (blocking of a blood vessel by a blood clot that has travelled to the lungs by the blood stream) (<LINK REF="REF-Rabhi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabhi 2000</LINK>). Varicose veins often improve three or four months after giving birth, and the oedema tend to diminish soon after the birth. With chronic venous insufficiency, problems including varicose eczema (brown or purple discolouration of the skin) and venous ulcers (a minor wound that fails to heal, causing an ulcer) can occur (<LINK REF="REF-Feied-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feied 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-09-14 17:25:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Treatments for varicose veins are usually divided into three main groups: surgery, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. Treatments for leg oedema comprise mostly of symptom reduction rather than cure and use pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pharmacological treatments</HEADING>
<P>Sclerotherapy is a procedure used to treat the affected veins. The veins are injected with liquid sclerosing drugs (detergent type with tensio-active properties), which make them shrink immediately and then dissolve over a period of weeks as the body naturally absorbs the treated vein. Because the solution is injected directly into the vein, there is thought to be little or no damage to the surrounding skin. A compression bandage has to be worn for between three and six weeks after treatment. Often several injections are needed.</P>
<P>Phlebotonics are a class of medications used to treat venous insufficiency, known as venoactive drugs. Their action is not well established; however, they are associated with increasing venous tone and preventing oedema. They include rutosides, hidrosmine, diosmine, calcium dobesilate, chromocarbe, <I>centella asiatica</I>, disodium flavodate, french maritime pine bark extract, grape seed extract and aminaftone.</P>
<P>O-Beta-hydroxyethyl rutoside is a semi-synthetic compound; the mode of action is probably based on a direct effect on the capillary wall as well as capillary functions (<LINK REF="REF-Lund-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lund 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tschopp-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tschopp 1970</LINK>). Though rutosides may help women with varicose veins with symptoms (nocturnal cramps, feelings of tiredness, paraesthesia), it is not yet clear that the drug is safe enough to use in pregnancy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Non-pharmacological treatments</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Compression stockings</HEADING>
<P>These may relieve the swelling and aching of the legs and may prevent more varicose veins from developing. They are worn during the day and taken off at night. Graduated compression stockings are tightest at the ankle and gradually get looser further up the leg, as this helps to encourage the blood flow back to the heart.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Rest</HEADING>
<P>Women are advised not to stand for long periods of time and take short breaks from standing either with exercise or elevating their feet and legs. When resting for longer periods, women are advised to rest on their left side (as the inferior vena cava is on the right, left-sided rest relieves it of the weight of the uterus, thus decreasing pressure on the veins in the legs and feet). Gentle flexion of the foot to stretch the calf muscles is also advised.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Reflexology</HEADING>
<P>This is a concept that all body organs and glands have corresponding reflex points in the feet, hands and ears. It has the potential to provide pain relief and symptom relief and induce relaxation without harmful side-effects. Reflexology may be used for specific conditions in the lower limbs and generalised oedema as it moves fluids from extravascular compartments without affecting intravascular fluids (<LINK REF="STD-Mollart--2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mollart 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Water immersion</HEADING>
<P>Historically, water has always been believed to promote healing and has therefore been widely used in the management of medical disorders. In terms of reducing leg oedema, water immersion can help the blood of an individual immersed in water to be displaced upward through the venous and lymphatic systems, firstly into the thighs, then into the abdominal cavity vessels, and finally into the great vessels of the chest cavity and into the heart. This is because that the individual is subjected to external water pressure in a gradient, which within a relatively small depth exceeds venous pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Risch-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Risch 1978</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Foot massage</HEADING>
<P>Foot massage is another example of a non-pharmacological intervention that is proving popular among healthcare providers. The technique in leg and foot oedema works by moving extravascular fluid without disturbing intravascular fluid (<LINK REF="REF-Hayes-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 1999</LINK>), and thus reducing the oedema.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Surgery</HEADING>
<P>This involves removing the affected vein(s). There are many variations of the operation, depending on which veins need treatment. The most common method is called ligation and stripping. Under a general or regional anaesthetic, the vein to be treated is ligated (tied off) at the top of the leg. A flexible wire is passed through the affected vein and attached to one end. By pulling the wire back, the vein is 'stripped' out. Although removed veins cannot reoccur, other leg veins can become varicosed. Vein stripping is often delayed until after the pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Pernoll-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pernoll 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment during pregnancy, however, mainly concentrates on the reprieve of symptoms. For the majority of women, varicose veins subside on their own within three or four months of the baby's birth. Any corrective treatment is often deferred to after this period.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-09-14 17:25:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Treatments for varicose veins are usually divided into three main groups: surgery, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. Treatments of leg oedema comprise mostly of symptom reduction rather than cure and use pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Historically, surgery, for treatment of varicose veins, has been the most widely recommended treatment option. Surgery may reduce the risk of complications of varicose veins (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2006</LINK>). Some pharmacological treatments work through increasing venous tone and preventing oedema (phlebotonics). Non-pharmacological interventions including include avoidance of prolonged standing and straining, external compression devices (e.g. bandages, support stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression devices) and leg elevation can provide relief from discomfort and may improve symptoms in some women. However, evidence to support these therapies is lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Bartholomew-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartholomew 2005</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-09-14 17:25:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>To date, there is no clear recommendations on the best management approach for patients with varicose veins and leg oedema during pregnancy. There is little evidence to preferentially support any single treatment modality. Choice of therapy is affected by many factors, such as symptoms, preference, cost, potential for iatrogenic complications, available medical resources. A formal evaluation of published studies is therefore very important to guide national and international recommendations for appropriate low-cost, safe and effective methods of intervention.</P>

A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>We have not included cluster-randomised trials in this review.</P>
<P>If in future updates we identify eligible cluster-randomised trials, we will include these in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the Handbook <I>[Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6]</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-16 14:24:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this updated review, we examined the effectiveness and safety of any form of intervention used to relieve the symptoms associated with varicose veins and leg oedema in pregnancy. A total of 326 women were recruited into seven trials.</P>
<P>This review unfortunately can provide very little guidance to pregnant women or their carers as the evidence available is insufficient to draw reliable conclusions for clinical practice. The commonest treatments for venous insufficiency in pregnancy are compression stockings and elevation of the feet, however, neither of these methods has been adequately assessed within the context of a randomised controlled trial. No significant differences were found in lower leg volume (oedema) with compression stockings when they were compared against rest or foot massage with routine care.</P>
<P>Rutosides appear to help women with varicose veins experiencing symptoms (nocturnal cramps, feelings of tiredness, paraesthesia). However, it is not yet clear that the drug is safe enough to use in pregnancy and the findings relate to one study only. O-Beta-hydroxyethyl rutoside is a semi-synthetic compound; the mode of action is probably based on a direct effect on the capillary wall as well as capillary functions (<LINK REF="REF-Lund-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lund 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tschopp-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tschopp 1970</LINK>). The trial was done 40 years ago; rutoside is no longer popular and the drug safety in pregnancy is not established.</P>
<P>There was a significant reduction in symptoms associated with oedema (less swelling/tightness, less pain/soreness, more mobility, and comfortable/relaxed) when two different techniques of reflexology (relaxing and lymphatic) were compared with rest alone (<LINK REF="STD-Mollart--2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mollart 2003</LINK>). The same study (<LINK REF="STD-Mollart--2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mollart 2003</LINK>), suggested that women who had reflexology were more satisfied with the intervention.</P>
<P>There was evidence, from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Irion-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Irion 2011</LINK>), suggesting that water immersion for 20 minutes in a swimming pool compared with sitting upright in a chair with legs elevated for 20 minutes reduced leg volume significantly.</P>
<P>There were no differences found in any other outcomes examined in this review. Of note, all of the outcomes that are reported in this review were only examined in single studies, and it would therefore be difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions. Only one trial <LINK REF="STD-Bergstein-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Bergstein 1975</LINK> that included 69 women, reported data on neonatal mortality and congenital malformations, and did not show a difference between groups.</P>
<P>There was a disappointing lack of information from most trials about maternal satisfaction and acceptability with the intervention, especially given that five of the seven trials were published from 1990 onwards. Due to unclear presentation of data in some published reports, we were unable to extract information for certain outcomes.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-05-19 11:04:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the paucity of trials, and the absence of relevant and important information from available trials, no reliable conclusions can be made from this review to guide clinical practice regarding the management of women with varicose veins or leg oedema in pregnancy. The possibility of adverse effects remains; the safety of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions of all the interventions in this review cannot be verified from the available data.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-09-14 17:33:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Three outcomes were chosen to be assessed and assigned a quality rating using the GRADE methods for two comparisons: 1. Rutoside versus placebo and 2. External pneumatic intermittent compression versus rest. Evidence was only available for two outcomes 'Symptoms associated with varicose veins and oedema' (change in lower leg volume) and 'Complications associated with varicose veins (deep vein thrombosis)', which came from one study for the comparison of rutoside versus placebo. The evidence for this outcome was graded as 'moderate quality' and the reason for downgrading of evidence was based on including only one study with a small sample size.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-03-09 15:03:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nancy  Medley">
<P>Evidence in this review was derived from studies identified in a detailed search process. Trials comparing interventions of Doppler ultrasound versus no Doppler that have not been published may not have been identified. We attempted to minimise bias in the review process by having two review authors independently extract data.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-09-16 14:28:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four Cochrane systematic reviews have been performed in the non-pregnant population comparing different interventions (sclerotherapy versus surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Rigby-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigby 2004</LINK>). injection sclerotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Tisi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tisi 2006</LINK>), compression stockings (<LINK REF="REF-Shingler-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shingler 2013</LINK>), surgery (use of tourniquet) (<LINK REF="REF-Rigby-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigby 2013</LINK>)) for the treatment of varicose veins.</P>
<P>The evidence supports the current place of sclerotherapy in modern clinical practice, which is usually limited to treatment of recurrent varicose veins following surgery and thread veins (<LINK REF="REF-Tisi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tisi 2006</LINK>). There have been no reported differences between the use or non-use of a tourniquet in terms of complications and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Rigby-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigby 2013</LINK>).There is insufficient evidence on the use of sclerotherapy or surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Rigby-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rigby 2004</LINK>). There is insufficient, high quality evidence to determine whether or not compression stockings are effective as the sole and initial treatment of varicose veins in people without healed or active venous ulceration, or whether any type of stocking is superior to any other type (<LINK REF="REF-Shingler-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shingler 2013</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-09-14 17:33:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Rutosides appear to help relieve the symptoms of varicose veins in late pregnancy. However, this finding is based on one study (69 women) and there are not enough data presented in the study to assess its safety in pregnancy.</P>
<P>Reflexology and water immersion appears to help improve symptoms for women with leg oedema, but again, the findings are based on single studies.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-07-22 18:11:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We are unable to provide clear guidance regarding any form of intervention used to relieve the symptoms associated with varicose veins and leg oedema in pregnancy. We have identified that there is a need for large, well-designed multicentre randomised controlled trials with clear allocation concealment, which will allow for robust conclusions to be drawn. It is of note that the largest trial included in this review involved only 69 women.</P>
<P>As a result of the findings of this Cochrane review, we make the following suggestions for the design and conduct of future trials investigating the use of any form of intervention used to relieve the symptoms associated with varicose veins and leg oedema in pregnancy.</P>
<P>Large multicentre trials are needed, which look at clinically relevant outcomes; neonatal outcomes, adverse effects and maternal satisfaction.</P>
<P>Data on economic outcomes should be obtained, to allow for allocation of resources and service planning.</P>
<P>It is difficult to blind women and caregivers to their randomised allocation because of the invasive nature of the interventions. It is possible to blind the outcome assessor to treatment allocation, which is strongly recommended. Any blinding should be clearly stated in the trial report.</P>
<P>Trial protocols should be made publicly available in order to allow comparison of the reported outcomes with prespecified outcomes. This will allow outcome reporting bias to be kept to a minimum.</P>
<P>It is essential to involve consumers in any future trials at all stages, and most significantly during the planning stages, in order to identify those outcomes which are deemed of most relevance and importance.</P>
<P>There was no information in any of the included trials regarding long-term outcomes for women and babies. We propose that future trialists should consider instituting some form of long-term follow-up which is feasible and appropriate for the study population in question.</P>
<P>If interventions such as those identified in this review are shown to do more good than harm, the next step would be to establish the optimum dosage, timing of intervention, and which are acceptable to women.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>There are six studies listed as 'awaiting assessment'. It would be helpful to know why there has been a delay in assessing them. Also, these titles do not state what rutoside preparations were used. When the review is updated, I suggest that a clear description of each preparation is included, because they may have differed in various ways.</P>
<P>[Summary of comment received from Andrew Herxheimer, April 2002]</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>The intervention used in Bergstein 1975 was o-beta-hydroxyl ethyl rutoside. </P>
<P>All studies waiting assessment have now been assessed and excluded; reasons for exclusion are summarised in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table.</P>
