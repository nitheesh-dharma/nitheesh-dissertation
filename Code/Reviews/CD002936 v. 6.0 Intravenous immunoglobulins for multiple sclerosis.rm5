<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the nervous system that affects young and middle-aged adults and can lead to permanent disability. Immunoglobulins have several effects on the immune system, and help fight infections. The review of trials found there is some evidence that immunoglobulins can reduce the rate of relapses in people who have relapsing remitting MS. There is no evidence that immunoglobulins can reduce the progression of MS.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-01-08 10:53:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten randomised double-blinded trials were identified and suitable for consideration by this review. Four trials were excluded as they did not use outcome measures specified (2 trials, 122 participants), or were of insufficient methodological quality (2 trials, 34 participants). The remaining six trials met our inclusion criteria. These included four with relapsing remitting cases (367 participants) and two with secondary progressive cases (515 participants), one of which had also primary progressive cases (34 participants).</P>
<P>In the relapsing remitting group there was a reduction in relapse rate (WMD -0.72 95% CI -0.78 to -0.66), increased time to first relapse and higher proportion of cases remaining relapse free (OR 0.63 95%CIs 0.42-0.94) during treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins. There is no robust data on disease progression in this group. In the secondary progressive group treatment had no impact on sustained EDSS progression (OR 0.96 95%CIs 0.68-1.37). Fewer primary progressive patients treated with immunoglobulin progressed that those in the placebo group (p=0.016). There is conflicting evidence of reduction in number of new lesions on T2 weighted MRI and gadolinium enhancing lesions on T1 weighted MRI and total MRI lesion burden in relapsing remitting MS but no evidence in secondary progressive disease.</P>

<P>There is evidence to support use of intravenous immunoglobulins as a preventative treatment for relapses in relapsing remitting MS. There was no evidence of delay in progression of disease in secondary progressive MS, but this needs to be evaluated in relapsing remitting disease. Immunoglobulins were well tolerated with a less than 5% risk of drug related adverse events in participants in included trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-25 15:15:17 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Deirdre Beecher">
<P>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease producing demyelination within the brain and spinal cord. The initial disease course can be characterised by a series of relapses and remissions (relapsing remitting MS), but given time, multiple sclerosis will become a disabling disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 1999</LINK>). In animal models of central nervous system demyelination, the immunomodulatory effects of immunoglobulins were credited with demonstrating a beneficial effect (<LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez 1990</LINK>). These observations led to clinical trials in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) (<LINK REF="REF-Noseworthy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noseworthy 1994</LINK>). The potential mechanism of action of intravenous immunoglobulins remains unclear, although through the action of anti-idiotype antibodies, blockade of Fc receptors and suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, remyelination of demyelinated central nervous system axons may occur (<LINK REF="REF-Noseworthy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noseworthy 1994</LINK>). Significant side-effects of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment have been recorded. Immediate side-effects include anaphylaxis, skin rashes, stroke and headache, and more long term effects include the possibility of precipitating renal failure or transmitting a hepatitis virus to a recipient of an immunoglobulin infusion (<LINK REF="REF-Branagan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Branagan 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Thornton-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornton 1993</LINK>). Immunoglobulin infusions are very labour intensive to produce and administer. Widespread use in a common disorder such as MS may be inconvenient for people with MS, and would carry enormous resource implications. It is therefore important to establish the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, to ensure that people with MS are not exposed to a potentially harmful drug without good evidence of efficacy, and that resources are not unnecessarily devoted to an unproven therapy.<BR/>Recent guidelines on the use of intravenous immunoglobulins have been issued (<LINK REF="REF-ABN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ABN 2005</LINK>), but conclude that they should not be used routinely, although they may have a role in patients with severe, frequent relapses for whom other disease modifying agents are contraindicated.<BR/>We report a systematic review of the literature to determine the safety and efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulins for MS.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-08-15 03:14:00 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objectives of this review were to determine the benefits and risks of intravenous immunoglobulins for the prevention of relapses and delay of disease progression of MS.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2010-01-19 09:55:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We sought randomised controlled trials which assessed the efficacy and tolerability of intravenous immunoglobulins for MS. We excluded unrandomised or quasi-randomised trials.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Trial participants had to have a diagnosis of definite MS (clinically definite or laboratory-supported definite) according to the criteria of Poser et al (<LINK REF="REF-Poser-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poser 1983</LINK>). Participants may have relapsing remitting or secondary progressive MS (<LINK REF="REF-Lublin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lublin 1996</LINK>). </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We restricted this review to trials of intravenous immunoglobulins (usually expressed as a dose in grams per kilogram body weight infused over a day or several days) where the objective of treatment was secondary prevention of further relapses or disease progression. We did not consider trials which assessed the effect of treatment on the duration of an acute relapse. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Outcomes were assessed at the end of the blinded treatment period. Long term unblinded follow-up was not suitable for analysis. <BR/>
<BR/>The protocol specified these primary outcomes:<BR/>1. Progression of disease assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (<LINK REF="REF-Kurtzke-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurtzke 1983</LINK>), where disease progression is defined by sustained worsening (for at least one 3 month period within the duration of a trial) of the EDSS entry score by greater than or equal to 1.0 points for those with an entry score of less than 5.5, or by greater than or equal to 0.5 for those with an entry score of greater than or equal to 5.5. <BR/>2. Relapse rate, expressed as the number of relapses per annum in each treatment arm. Relapses should fulfil the criteria of Poser - the appearance of new or recurrence of an old symptom for at least 24 hours in the absence of fever, which is preceded by a period of disease stability or improvement for at least 30 days.<BR/>3. The proportion of patients remaining relapse free at the end of the treatment period. </P>
<P>These were secondary outcomes:<BR/>1. Time to sustained disease progression (as defined above in 1).<BR/>2. Time to first relapse (as defined above in 2).<BR/>3. Number of new or enlarging lesions on brain T2 weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). <BR/>4. Number of gadolinium enhancing lesions on T1 weighted MRI scans.<BR/>5. Total MRI lesion burden on T2 weighted scans expressed as a volume in cubic millimetres.<BR/>6. Number or rate of treated relapses (defined as a relapse needing corticosteroid treatment or admission to hospital).<BR/>7. Side-effect reports including anaphylaxis, acute renal failure, hepatitis, and aseptic meningitis (these are major side-effects). Minor side-effects, specifically headache and cutaneous rashes. </P>

<P>Of the 913 references retrieved from the original search, we identified 10 clinical trials, four of which were ongoing. We excluded four completed studies for either poor methodological quality (2 studies) or not using any of the outcome measures set in our review (2 studies). Two studies were included in the first review. In our updated search, we identified a further 583 potential articles. Most were either review articles, observational studies or studied other immunosuppressants and not intravenous immunoglobulins. Thirty-eight articles were read (OM and GM) and assessed for suitability for inclusion in the review. Of these 22 articles described 10 randomised controlled trials felt to be suitable for inclusion. All 3 reviewers reviewed the 10 selected papers, and excluded 4 of these. We all verified abstracted data before entry into RevMan 5.</P>
<P>Methodological quality<BR/>The Cochrane Reviewer's Handbook discusses methodological quality under the following headings: (1) Selection bias, (2) Performance bias, (3) Attrition bias and (4) Detection bias.<BR/>(1) Selection bias was determined by assessing allocation concealment and matching of groups. We classified allocation concealment as (A) adequate, (B) unclear, (C) inadequate and (D) not used. An initial concern, when writing the protocol, was that different trials may have had participants with diverse demographic and clinical characteristics. However, randomisation resulted in balanced demographic and clinical groups of patients both within individual trials and between different trials (see Table of included studies).<BR/>(2) We determined whether each trial had a separate treating and evaluating physician, and took measures to minimise inadvertent patient unblinding as a means of assessing performance bias.<BR/>(3) We aimed to include trials with intention to treat analysis to reduce the effect of attrition bias.<BR/>(4) If a separate evaluating physician and treating physician were employed, detection bias was felt to be acceptably low.<BR/>To be included in the review, a trial had to meet these criteria: (1) allocation concealment was adequate (Unclear allocation concealment will be accepted if every other methodological factor was of the best possible standard), (2) treated and non-treated groups had adequate baseline comparability, (3) patients and treating physicians were blind to treatment allocation, (4) analysis was intention to treat, (5) a separate evaluating and treating physician were employed (class A methodology).<BR/>Trials in which allocation concealment was unclear, or separate evaluating and treating physician were not used were excluded from primary analyses (class 'B' methodology). If a randomised trial did not have adequate allocation concealment and did not have a separate treating and evaluating physician, it would have been excluded (class 'C' methodological quality).</P>
<P>Analysis of outcomes<BR/>For dichotomous outcomes we used odds ratios. For continuous measurements we estimated weighted mean differences. Analyses were performed using MetaView. There was insufficient data to explore dose related effects of intravenous immunoglobulins.</P>

However, only six trials also included pre-specified outcome measures, and these trials form the basis of this systematic review (<LINK REF="STD-Fazekas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fazekas 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Achiron-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Achiron 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lewanska-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewanska 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hommes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hommes 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Poehlau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Poehlau 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fazekas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fazekas 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>The six included studies are discussed one outcome measure at a time and have been analysed separately for relapsing remitting, secondary progressive and primary progressive MS:</P>
<P>1. Progression of disease assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).<BR/>Relpasing remitting MS<BR/>Only one study with relapsing remitting participants assessed sustained EDSS progression (<LINK REF="STD-Lewanska-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewanska 2002</LINK>), however it did not use our definition. Lewanska described a significant mean change in EDSS from baseline to study conclusion in favour of intravenous immunoglobulins (-0.029 low dose IVIG, -0.066 high dose IVIG, +0.294 placebo, p=0.0117). Fazekas found that those treated with intravenous immunoglobulin had a small, but statistically significant decrease in mean EDSS score (mean change - 0.23), compared to a small but significant increase in EDSS score (mean change + 0.12) for those in receipt of placebo. Achiron observed that 13% of IVIG recipients and 17% of placebo recipients had an increase in their EDSS score, but this measurement does not appear to be sustained EDSS progression.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Secondary progressive MS<BR/>In secondary progressive MS there was no significant difference between those treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and placebo (OR 0.96 95%CIs 0.68- 1.37) (<LINK REF="STD-Hommes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hommes 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Poehlau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Poehlau 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Primary progressive MS The single study with primary progressive participants, reported significantly fewer participants with EDSS progression in the IVIg treated group than the placebo group (29% IVIg 71% placebo, p=0.016) (<LINK REF="STD-Poehlau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Poehlau 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. Relapse rate.<BR/>Relapsing remitting MS<BR/>Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin resulted in an overall reduction in relapse rate in relapsing remitting cases (Weighted Mean Difference -0.72 95% CI -0.78 to -0.66). Two studies with relapsing remitting participants identified a significant reduction in relapse rate (<LINK REF="STD-Fazekas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fazekas 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Achiron-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Achiron 1998</LINK>). The larger of these (<LINK REF="STD-Fazekas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fazekas 1997</LINK>) observed a relapse rate, during the 2 year study period, of 0.52 relapses per annum (62 relapses in total) on intravenous immunoglobulin, compared to an overall relapse rate of 1.26 per annum in placebo recipients (116 relapses in total). Achiron observed a relapse rate of 0.59 relapses per annum on intravenous immunoglobulin compared to 1.61 relapses per annum on placebo. Each trial found these observations to be statistically significant. A third study of relapsing remitting cases (<LINK REF="STD-Lewanska-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewanska 2002</LINK>) described a non-significant trend towards lower relapse rate in the treatment groups, with mean relapse rate of 1.24 in placebo group, 0.88 in the low dose and 0.86 in the high dose treatment groups. They did demonstrate a significant reduction in relapse rate during the study in both treatment groups compared to the relapse rate prior to treatment. One study did not find any significant difference between relapse rate and treatment with either high or low dose immunoglobulin; in this study the placebo group had a lower annualised relapse rate (<LINK REF="STD-Fazekas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fazekas 2008</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Secondary progressive MS<BR/>The studies of secondary progressive cases (<LINK REF="STD-Hommes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hommes 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Poehlau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Poehlau 2007</LINK>) did not report any difference in relapse rate between treatment at placebo groups.</P>
<P>Primary progressive MS Relapse rate was not assessed in the primary progressive population.</P>
<P>3. The proportion of patients remaining relapse free at the end of the treatment period.<BR/>Relapsing remitting MS<BR/>The proportion of patients remaining relapse free was significantly higher for those treated with intravenous immunoglobulin with an odds ratio of 0.63 (95%CIs 0.42-0.94). There was no significant difference between low and high dose immunoglobulins.</P>
<P>Three trials with relapsing remitting participants (<LINK REF="STD-Fazekas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fazekas 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Achiron-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Achiron 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lewanska-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewanska 2002</LINK>) found clear differences in the proportions remaining relapse free on intravenous immunoglobulins In his first study, Fazekas found that 53% (40 / 75) of immunoglobulin recipients remained relapse free during the 2 year study period (<LINK REF="STD-Fazekas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fazekas 1997</LINK>). In the study performed by Archiron, all 6 participants who remained relapse free were in receipt of intravenous immunoglobulin. Lewanska observed that 47% of those on low dose immunoglobulins and 50% of those on high dose immunoglobulins remained relapse free compared to only 11.8% of the placebo group. The second study by Fazekas (<LINK REF="STD-Fazekas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fazekas 2008</LINK>) was the only study to report no difference in the proportion of patients remaining relapse free. In this study, more patients in the placebo arm remained relapse free than in either the low dose or high dose treatment arm (p=0.29).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Secondary progressive MS<BR/>The studies of secondary progressive cases (<LINK REF="STD-Hommes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hommes 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Poehlau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Poehlau 2007</LINK>) did not show any difference in proportion of patients remaining relapse free.</P>
<P>Primary progressive MS This was not assessed in the primary progressive population.</P>
<P>Of the secondary outcomes stated in our protocol, the following were recorded in the included trials:</P>
<P>4. Time to sustained disease progression (as defined above in 1).<BR/>Relapsing remitting MS<BR/>This was not assessed in the relapsing remitting population.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<BR/>Secondary progressive MS<BR/>Neither study with secondary progressive participants reported a significant difference on time to sustained disease progression between placebo and treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Hommes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hommes 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Poehlau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Poehlau 2007</LINK>). However, Poehlau reports a trend in favour of immunoglobulin, with a longer time to sustained progression in the treatment group than the placebo group (p=0.09).</P>
<P>Primary progressive MS The single study with primary progressive participants, reported a non-significant delay in time to sustained EDSS progression in the IVIg treated group compared the placebo group (mean 96.6 weeks IVIg 68.9 weeks placebo, p=0.16) (<LINK REF="STD-Poehlau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Poehlau 2007</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>5. Time to first relapse (as defined above in 2).<BR/>Relapsing remitting MS<BR/>Two studies with relapsing remitting cases, reported on time to first relapse (<LINK REF="STD-Fazekas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fazekas 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Achiron-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Achiron 1998</LINK>). Both observed an increase in time to first relapse in the treatment groups: mean time to first relapse 237 days (range 4 - 659 days) on intravenous immunoglobulins compared to 151 days (range 2 - 719 days on placebo) (<LINK REF="STD-Fazekas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fazekas 1997</LINK>) and median time to first relapse 233 days on intravenous immunoglobulins compared to 82 days on placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Achiron-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Achiron 1998</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Secondary progressive MS<BR/>One study with secondary progressive cases reported on time to first relapse. They describe no difference in time to first relapse between treatment and placebo groups (mean time IVIg 237 days, placebo 241 days, p=0.774).</P>
<P>Primary progressive MS This was not assessed in the primary progressive population.</P>
<P>6. Number of new or enlarging lesions on brain T2 weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).<BR/>Relapsing remitting MS<BR/>Two studies reported on number of new lesions on T2 weighted MRI in relapsing remitting MS(<LINK REF="STD-Lewanska-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewanska 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fazekas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fazekas 2008</LINK>). One reported that the number of new lesions was significantly higher in the placebo group than either of the treatment groups (placebo v low dose p=0.0005, placebo v high dose p=0.005) with a non-significant trend towards less lesions with the high dose intravenous immunoglobulins (<LINK REF="STD-Lewanska-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewanska 2002</LINK>).The second study found no difference between placebo and either low or high dose immunoglobulin (mean low dose 9.4, high dose 6.4, placebo 6.2).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Secondary progressive MS<BR/>One study reported on number of new lesions on T2 weighted MRI in secondary progressive cases (<LINK REF="STD-Hommes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hommes 2004</LINK>), however they did not report any difference between the placebo and treatment groups.</P>
<P>Primary progressive MS This was not assessed in the primary progressive population.</P>
<P>7. Number of gadolinium enhancing lesions on T1 weighted MRI scans.<BR/>Relapsing remitting MS<BR/>Two studies reported on gadolinium enhancing lesions in relapsing remitting MS(<LINK REF="STD-Lewanska-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewanska 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fazekas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fazekas 2008</LINK>). One study observed a significant reduction in number of gadolinium enhancing lesions in both treatment groups compared with placebo (placebo v low dose p=0.0258, placebo v high dose p=0.0081) with no difference between low and high dose intravenous immunoglobulins (<LINK REF="STD-Lewanska-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewanska 2002</LINK>). The second study showed no difference between either low dose or high dose immunoglobulin and placebo in this variable.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Secondary progressive MS<BR/>One study reported on number of gadolinium enhancing lesions on T1 weighted MRI in secondary progressive cases (<LINK REF="STD-Hommes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hommes 2004</LINK>) but found no difference between the placebo and treatment groups.</P>
<P>Primary progressive MS This was not assessed in the primary progressive population.</P>
<P>8. Total MRI lesion burden on T2 weighted scans expressed as a volume in cubic millimetres.<BR/>Relapsing remitting MS<BR/>Two studies reported on the total MRI lesion burden in relapsing remitting MS (<LINK REF="STD-Lewanska-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewanska 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fazekas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fazekas 2008</LINK>). In one study, the total lesion volume increased by 13.56% in the placebo group, by 3.6% (p=0.6233) in the low dose immunoglobulin group and decreased by 3.95% (p=0.0712) in the high dose immunoglobulin group (<LINK REF="STD-Lewanska-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewanska 2002</LINK>). In the second study did not report a significant difference in total MRI burden between treatment and placebo groups (<LINK REF="STD-Fazekas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fazekas 2008</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Secondary progressive MS<BR/>This was not assessed in the secondary progressive population.</P>
<P>Primary progressive MS This was not assessed in the primary progressive population.</P>
<P>9. Number or rate of treated relapses (defined as a relapse needing corticosteroid treatment or admission to hospital).<BR/>Relapsing remitting MS<BR/>This was not assessed in the relapsing remitting population.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Secondary progressive MS<BR/>Number of treated relapses was reported in this study (<LINK REF="STD-Hommes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hommes 2004</LINK>) with no difference between treatment (51.6%) and placebo groups (49.7%).</P>
<P>Primary progressive MS This was not assessed in the primary progressive population.</P>
<P>10. Adverse effects<BR/>Adverse events were recorded in each trial, although overall immunoglobulin treatment was well tolerated. The most common minor adverse effects included headache, nausea, fever, chills, dizziness, rash and fatigue. Hommes reported high rates of minor adverse events more common in the treatment group (71%) than placebo (57%) (<LINK REF="STD-Hommes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hommes 2004</LINK>). In one study 25 participants withdrew due to adverse effects (16 treatment, 9 placebo) (<LINK REF="STD-Poehlau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Poehlau 2007</LINK>). Major adverse events believed to be related to treatment were rare. One study reported deep venous thrombosis in 6 treatment and one placebo patient which was complicated by pulmonary embolism in 4 treatment cases. Two of these cases have a pre-existing coagulation disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Hommes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hommes 2004</LINK>).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-04-01 10:37:38 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a scientific rationale for attempting to treat MS with intravenous immunoglobulins (<LINK REF="REF-Noseworthy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noseworthy 1994</LINK>), particularly in order to remyelinate axons and potentially reverse clinical impairments. On the basis of the included trials, we found no robust evidence to support a reversal of neurological impairments. When adopting a more conservative approach, we found evidence that people treated with intravenous immunoglobulins may experience a reduction in relapse rate (WMD -0.73) and may remain relapse free for longer. The most important endpoint for MS is to prevent, or more realistically, delay disease progression (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1996</LINK>). Two studies reported on progression of disease and time to sustained disease progression in secondary progressive MS (<LINK REF="STD-Hommes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hommes 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Poehlau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Poehlau 2007</LINK>) and found no difference between treatment and placebo groups. In primary progressive MS a single study reported significantly fewer participants with EDSS progression in the IVIg treated group than the placebo group, with a non-significant trend towards delay in time to disease progression (<LINK REF="STD-Poehlau-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Poehlau 2007</LINK>).Future trials of intravenous immunoglobulin should address the issue of sustained EDSS worsening, ensuring that they are sufficiently large to detect meaningful changes.</P>
<P>MRI data was reported in two studies of relapsing remitting cases (<LINK REF="STD-Lewanska-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewanska 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Fazekas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fazekas 2008</LINK>) and one with secondary progressive cases (<LINK REF="STD-Hommes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hommes 2004</LINK>). In relapsing remitting MS, the studies produced conflicting results. Lewanska reported a significant reduction in both new lesions on T2 and number of gadolinium enhancing lesions on T1 in both treatment groups compared with placebo. He also described a non-significant trend towards reduced total lesion burden on T2 weighted images. Fazekas did not report any difference in any of these variables in his study (<LINK REF="STD-Fazekas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fazekas 2008</LINK>). In secondary progressive cases, there was no evidence of any benefit from treatment. Studies of interferon beta (<LINK REF="REF-INFB-Group-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">INFB Group 1993</LINK>) have demonstrated similar clinical efficacy, but had important supportive evidence of improvements in MRI lesion load. Until there is further MRI data, we feel that it is premature to state that intravenous immunoglobulins influence the natural history of relapsing remitting MS.</P>
<P>We excluded 4 published trials, 2 on exclusively methodological grounds. Although Sorenson's trial (with clinical and MRI endpoints) did find significant differences between placebo and immunoglobulins (<LINK REF="STD-Sorenson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sorenson 1998</LINK>), there were considerable methodological difficulties, particularly with respect to blinding and allocation concealment. The trial published by Teksam is unhelpful, as there were methodological problems in the allocation concealment and blinding, and clinical parameters were not used (<LINK REF="STD-Teksam-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Teksam 2000</LINK>). Two relatively large trials were excluded as they did not meet pre-specified outcome measures in our protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Noseworthy-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Noseworthy 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Noseworthy-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Noseworthy 2001</LINK>). Otherwise these two trials were of an extremely rigorous methodological quality, and are notable for being entirely negative across a wide-range of clinical and paraclinical outcome measures, including a subset of participants undergoing serial MRI examinations. These two trials included 122 participants with either relapsing remitting MS or secondary progressive MS. Essentially these trials (unsuccessfully) tested the hypothesis that intravenous immunoglobulin would reverse established neurologic impairments secondary to the demyelination found in MS. For the purposes of our protocol driven review, we would have liked to have obtained some of the clinical data, as it would be interesting to see whether the lack of effect on isometric muscle strength occurred in the presence of no effect or a positive effect on relapse rate. While one could argue that the weakness in MS is due to axonal loss and not primarily to demyelination, then it is not surprising that improvement in muscle strength was not seen. If prevention of relapses early in the disease protects the axon from subsequent injury and death a case could be made for future clinical trials of intravenous immunoglobulins to assess the effect on longterm relapse rates and longterm clinical disability.</P>
<P>Since the original review, newer medications have been introduced for the treatment of MS, including mitoxantrone (<LINK REF="REF-Martinelli-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinelli 2005</LINK>) and natalizumab (<LINK REF="REF-Poleman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poleman 2006</LINK>). Both natalizumab and mitoxantrone have been shown to reduce relapse rate, delay progression of disease and reduce the number of active lesions on MRI. Natalizumzab (<LINK REF="REF-Poleman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poleman 2006</LINK>) reduces relapse rate by 68% at one year, reduced the risk of sustained progression by 42% at two years and led to an 83% reduction in the accumulation of new or enlarging lesions on MRI at 2 years.</P>
<P>Safety of intravenous immunoglobulins<BR/>In our included studies, intravenous immunoglobulins were well tolerated. Minor adverse effects were reported frequently in one study in both treatment (71%) and placebo groups (57%). Infusion related side effects were reported in 4% of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Fazekas-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fazekas 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hommes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hommes 2004</LINK>) and 3.8% of infusions (<LINK REF="STD-Achiron-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Achiron 1998</LINK>). One study reported six participant with deep venous thrombosis, four of whom also developed pulmonary embolism in the treatment group. However two of these had a known coagulation defect. The immunoglobulin was extremely poorly tolerated in one other excluded trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sorenson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sorenson 1998</LINK>), with 11/21 (52%) experiencing severe cutaneous reactions, one person contracting hepatitis C viral infection and another died from pulmonary embolus. As no other trial had such severe and frequent reactions, it is possible that the problem was specific to local formulations, which need not necessarily apply elsewhere.</P>

<P>There are methodologically rigorous published trials of intravenous immunoglobulins for MS. In relapsing remitting MS there is evidence that intravenous immunoglobulins reduces the relapse rate and increase the probability of remaining relapse free.
