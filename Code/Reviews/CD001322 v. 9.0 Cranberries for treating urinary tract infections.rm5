<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Still waiting for evidence about whether cranberries are a useful treatment for urinary tract infections</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Cranberries contain a substance that can prevent bacteria from sticking on the walls of the bladder. This may help reduce bladder and other urinary tract infections (UTIs). Cranberries (usually as cranberry juice) have been used to try and treat UTIs, particularly in high risk groups such as older people. Cranberries have few adverse effects. The review found no evidence from studies about the effects of cranberry juice or other cranberry products on UTIs.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-07-13 17:01:38 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The search strategy developed by the Cochrane Renal Group was used. Also, companies involved with the promotion and distribution of cranberry preparations were contacted; electronic databases and the Internet were searched using English and non English language terms; reference lists of review articles and relevant studies were also searched.<BR/>
<I>Date of last search: July 2010</I>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of cranberry juice or cranberry products for the treatment of UTIs. Studies of men, women or children were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Titles and abstracts of studies that were potentially relevant to the review were screened by one author, RJ, who discarded studies that were clearly ineligible but aimed to be overly inclusive rather than risk losing relevant studies. Authors RJ and LM independently assessed whether the studies met the inclusion criteria. Further information was sought from the authors where papers contained insufficient information to make a decision about eligibility.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>No studies were found which fulfilled all of the inclusion criteria. Two studies were excluded because they did not have any relevant outcomes and two studies are currently being undertaken.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>After a thorough search, no RCTs which assessed the effectiveness of cranberry juice for the treatment of UTIs were found. Therefore, at the present time, there is no good quality evidence to suggest that it is effective for the treatment of UTIs. Well-designed parallel group, double blind studies comparing cranberry juice and other cranberry products versus placebo to assess the effectiveness of cranberry juice in treating UTIs are needed. Outcomes should include reduction in symptoms, sterilisation of the urine, side effects and adherence to therapy. Dosage (amount and concentration) and duration of therapy should also be assessed. Consumers and clinicians will welcome the evidence from these studies.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2010-07-13 17:01:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The term urinary tract infection (UTI) refers to the presence of a certain threshold number of bacteria in the urine (usually greater than 100,000/mL). It consists of cystitis (bacteria in the bladder), urethral syndrome and pyelonephritis (infection of the kidneys). Lower UTIs involve the bladder, whereas upper UTIs also involve the kidneys (pyelonephritis). Bacterial cystitis (also called acute cystitis) can occur in men and women and the signs and symptoms include dysuria (pain on passing urine), frequency, cloudy urine, occasionally haematuria (blood in the urine), and is often associated with pyuria (urine white cell count greater than 10,000/mL). Urethral syndrome (frequency and dysuria syndrome) is used to describe approximately 50% of women with these complaints who have either no bacterial growth or counts less than 100,000 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL on repeated urine cultures. Pyelonephritis most commonly occurs as a result of cystitis, particularly in the presence of transient (occasional) or persistent backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureters or kidney pelvis (vesicoureteric reflux). Signs and symptoms include flank pain or back pain, fever, chills with shaking, general ill feeling plus those symptoms of a lower UTI. Acute pyelonephritis can be severe in the elderly, in infants, and in people who are immunosuppressed (for example, those with cancer or AIDS). Some people have recurrent UTIs with an average of two to three episodes/year (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wong-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 1984</LINK>). Children typically present with a high fever and systemic symptoms such as lethargy (tiredness), vomiting and poor feeding.</P>
<P>Although UTIs can occur in both men and women, they are about 50 times more common in adult women than adult men. This may be because women have a shorter urethra that may allow bacteria to ascend more easily into the bladder. Symptomatic infection of the bladder (lower tract UTI) has been estimated to occur in up to 30% of women at some stage during their lives (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 1977</LINK>). Most UTIs arise from the 'ascending' route of infection. The first step is colonisation of periurethral tissues with uropathogenic organisms, followed by the passage of bacteria through the urethra. Infection arises from bacterial proliferation (growth) within the otherwise sterile urinary tract. In children, UTI occurs more commonly in boys up to the age of 6 to 12 months, but overall occurs about three times more often in girls (1% to 3% in boys, 3% to 7% in girls) (<LINK REF="REF-Hellstrom-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellstrom 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winberg-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winberg 1974</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cranberries (particularly in the form of cranberry juice) have been used widely for several decades for the prevention and treatment of UTIs. Cranberries contain quinic acid, malic acid and citric acid as well as glucose and fructose. Until recently, it was suggested that the quinic acid caused large amounts of hippuric acid to be excreted in the urine which then acted as an antibacterial agent (<LINK REF="REF-Kinney-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinney 1979</LINK>). Several studies, however, have shown no difference in the levels, or only a transient (short lived) effect thus casting some doubt on this theory (<LINK REF="REF-Kahn-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McLeod-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLeod 1978</LINK>). More recently, it has been demonstrated that cranberries prevent bacteria (particularly <I>E. coli</I>) from adhering (sticking) to uroepithelial cells that line the wall of the bladder (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sobota-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sobota 1984</LINK>). Cranberries contain two compounds which inhibit adherence - fructose and a polymeric compound of unknown nature (<LINK REF="REF-Zafriri-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zafriri 1989</LINK>). Although many juices contain fructose, only cranberries and blueberries contain the polymeric compound (<LINK REF="REF-Ofek-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ofek 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>UTIs are one of the most common medical conditions requiring outpatient treatment, and complications resulting from persistent and repeated infections necessitate well over one million hospital admissions annually in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Patton-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patton 1991</LINK>). Traditionally UTIs have been treated by antibiotic therapy, but these are expensive, can have side effects and may lead to resistance. The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of cranberries in treating symptomatic and asymptomatic UTIs. Although cranberry juice is the form of cranberries most widely used, other cranberry products include cranberry powder in hard or soft gelatin capsules. The amount and concentration of cranberry juice needed to be effective for the treatment of UTIs has not yet been ascertained. One uncontrolled trial, however, found that over 50% of patients had a positive clinical response after consuming 450 mL of cranberry juice for three weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Papas-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papas 1966</LINK>). </P>
<P>Cranberries for the prevention of UTIs in susceptible populations is examined in another review by the same authors (<LINK REF="REF-Jepson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jepson 2008</LINK>).</P>

One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nahata-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Nahata 1982</LINK>) was a randomised cross-over trial, comparing methenamine mandelate alone, methenamine mandelate plus ascorbic acid, or methenamine mandelate plus ascorbic acid and cranberry juice for people with UTIs. No relevant outcomes were presented, however, and the main purpose of the studies was to see the effect of the methenamine on formaldehyde concentration. The author was contacted, but could not provide any further information about the trial. Another cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-DuGan-1966" TYPE="STUDY">DuGan 1966</LINK>) compared cranberry juice with no treatment for the reduction of urinary odours (which could have been caused by a UTI). From the description of the trial it is unlikely it was randomised and the report contained no relevant outcomes. See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> for more details about both these studies.</P>
<P>Two ongoing studies have been identified (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00093054" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00093054</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00305071" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00305071</LINK>).<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-NCT00093054" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00093054</LINK> will enrol women aged 18 to 40 years of age with a culture confirmed UTI. They will be randomised to either 8 ounces of cranberry juice or placebo juice twice a day for 6 months. Participants will have follow-up visits at 3 and 6 months and whenever they experience a symptomatic episode. Urine, vaginal and rectal specimens will be taken at each visit to test for the presence of bacteria. Participants will complete a questionnaire at study entry and at day 3, weeks 1 and 2, and then every month or whenever there is a recurrence of symptoms. This study is due to be completed in December 2008.</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-NCT00305071" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00305071</LINK> will enrol women aged 20 to 65 with non-complicated acute bacterial cystitis. The intervention group will receive 3-day oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (80/400 mg) 2 tablets twice a day on day 1 to 3 plus oral compound cranberry extract tablets (UmayC, 900 mg) 2 tablets three times a day on day 1 to 7. The control group will received same oral antibiotics plus identical placebo prescribed as the same protocol of intervention arm. Outcomes to be assessed are time to symptoms relief and pyuria eradication rate. This study has not started recruiting.</LI>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>No studies assessing cranberries for the treatment of UTIs which met our inclusion criteria were found. Only a few uncontrolled studies examining the effectiveness of cranberry juice in treating the symptoms of UTI have been reported. Two of these did show a beneficial effect (<LINK REF="REF-Papas-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papas 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodgers-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodgers 1991</LINK>) but no firm conclusions can be drawn from such studies.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No RCTs have been performed to assess the effectiveness of cranberry juice or cranberry products for the treatment of UTIs. Therefore, at the present time, there is no evidence to suggest that cranberry juice or other cranberry products are effective in treating UTIs.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More research is need to assess the effectiveness of cranberry juice in treating UTIs. Well-designed parallel group, double blind studies of cranberry juice and other cranberry products for the treatment of UTIs are needed. The outcomes should include reduction in symptoms, sterilisation of the urine, side effects and adherence to therapy. Dosage (amount and concentration) and duration of therapy should also be evaluated. Consumers and clinicians will welcome the evidence from these studies.</P>

<I>Yes (low risk of bias): </I>Random number table; computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots; minimization (minimization may be implemented without a random element, and this is considered to be equivalent to being random).</P>

<I>Yes (low risk of bias): </I>Randomisation method described that would not allow investigator/participant to know or influence intervention group before eligible participant entered in the study (e.g. central allocation, including telephone, web-based, and pharmacy-controlled, randomisation; sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes).</P>

<I>Yes (low risk of bias): </I>No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken; either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, but outcome assessment was blinded and the non-blinding of others unlikely to introduce bias.</P>
