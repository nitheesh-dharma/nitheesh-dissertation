<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-03 17:02:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Globally, about 170 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus and routes of transmission include intravenous drug use, mother-to-infant transmission, unsafe medical practices, high-risk sexual behaviour, and blood transfusion. Chronic hepatitis C is in most patients a benign viral infection, but a minority of patients develop liver cirrhosis and may suffer from complications due to cirrhosis or die from it.</P>
<P>Treatment with interferon clears hepatitis C virus from the blood in about 15% of the patients. Adding ribavirin to interferon (combination therapy) significantly improves the number that clears hepatitis C from the blood to about 40%. Not all patients are tolerant to interferon, and also interferon is costly. This is why ribavirin given as a single drug may be considered as an option for patients with chronic hepatitis C. This review identified 11 randomised trials comparing ribavirin with no antiviral treatment in patient with chronic hepatitis C. Combining the results from all identified trials ribavirin alone seemed without beneficial effects for patients with chronic hepatitis C. Moreover, ribavirin given alone was significantly inferior compared with interferon regarding clearing hepatitis C from the blood and regarding reducing liver enzymes activity in the blood. Furthermore, ribavirin given alone increased the risk of anaemia. Thus, ribavirin given alone cannot be recommended, but more trials may be needed.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-08-07 15:45:40 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>The primary outcome measures were serum sustained virological response (loss of hepatitis C virus RNA at least six months after treatment), liver-related morbidity plus all-cause mortality, and adverse events. Secondary outcome measures were end of treatment virological response, biochemical response (transaminase activity), and histological response. Randomisation methods, blinding, data handling, and funding were extracted as measures of bias control. Random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses were performed for all outcomes. We only present the results of the fixed-effect model if both models provide the same result regarding statistical significance. We present data as risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-03 17:49:37 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>We included 14 randomised trials with 657 patients. The majority of trials had unclear control of bias. Compared with placebo or no intervention, ribavirin had no significant effect on the sustained virological response (RD 0%, 95% CI -2% to 3%, five trials) or end of treatment virological response (RD 0% 95% CI -3% to 3%, ten trials). Ribavirin had no significant effect on liver-related morbidity plus mortality (RD 0%, 95% CI -2% to 3%, 11 trials). Ribavirin significantly increased the risk of adverse reactions, including anaemia. Ribavirin significantly improved end of treatment biochemical and histological response but not the sustained biochemical response. Ribavirin was significantly inferior to interferon regarding virological and biochemical responses (five trials).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-10 17:21:18 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Ribavirin seems without beneficial effects on serum virological response and liver-related morbidity or mortality, and significantly increased the risk of adverse reactions. Ribavirin monotherapy seems significantly inferior to interferon monotherapy. The total number of included patients is small, and more trials are perhaps needed. The use of ribavirin monotherapy for chronic hepatitis C cannot be recommended outside randomised trials.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-08-03 16:22:48 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus affecting about 170 million people worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Consensus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consensus 2004</LINK>). Routes of transmission include intravenous drug use, mother-to-infant transmission, unsafe medical practices, high-risk sexual behavior, occupational exposure, blood transfusion, and infected donor organs (<LINK REF="REF-Alter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alter 2002</LINK>). In up to 40% of patients, however, no identifiable risk factor is found (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2000</LINK>). It is estimated that three to four million persons are newly infected each year. Acute hepatitis C is usually asymptomatic, but about 70% will develop chronic hepatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Seeff-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seeff 1997</LINK>). The majority of chronically infected patiens will never experience symptoms as the onset to cirrhosis stage is very protracted (<LINK REF="REF-Alter-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alter 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoofnagle-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoofnagle 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koretz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koretz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seeff-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seeff 2002</LINK>). The risk of developing cirrhosis probably depends on several factors, eg, age, sex, race, alcohol abuse, obesity, steatosis, transaminase activity, as well as coinfections (<LINK REF="REF-Lindsay-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindsay 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seeff-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seeff 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dienstag-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dienstag 2006</LINK>). Once histological cirrhosis is established, hepatocellular carcinoma develops in 1% to 4% per year (<LINK REF="REF-Hoofnagle-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoofnagle 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poynard-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poynard 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hepatitis C is an RNA virus of the <I>Flaviviridae</I> family. There are six hepatitis C genotypes including several subtypes, and it is characterised by the continuous emergence of virus variants (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). Genotypes differ with geographic regions. Although the genotype does not predict the outcome of the infection, it does predict the treatment response to current antiviral therapy and accordingly influence the choice of treatment regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Hadziyannis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadziyannis 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-08-12 13:02:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Therapy with interferon leads to sustained virological response in about 15% of patients with chronic hepatitis C and was the treatment of choice during the 1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Thevenot-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thevenot 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myers-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2002a</LINK>). Due to the low number with sustained virological response, ribavirin was suggested as an alternative to interferon (<LINK REF="REF-Reichard-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichard 1990</LINK>). Ribavirin is a broad spectrum nucleoside analogue with antiviral activity against a range of RNA viruses (<LINK REF="REF-Patterson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patterson 1990</LINK>). However, subsequent small studies found no clear beneficial effect of ribavirin (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Bisceglie-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Di Bisceglie 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dusheiko-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dusheiko 1996</LINK>), but adding ribavirin to interferons significantly increased the number with sustained virological response to about 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>). Accordingly, combination therapy with ribavirin plus pegylated interferon is currently recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Consensus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consensus 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dienstag-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dienstag 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The primary observed serious adverse reactions to ribavirin is haemolytic anaemia, leukopenia, and skin reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>). Ribavirin is teratogenic in some animals species and thus poses a theoretical reproductive risk in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Querenghi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Querenghi 2001</LINK>). Ribavirin is administered orally as tablets or capsules. The dose of ribavirin is usually adjusted according to body weight and hepatitis C genotype.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-08-12 11:55:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ribavirin significantly increases the sustained viral clearance when added to alfa-interferon or pegylated interferon for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>). The exact mechanism through which ribavirin produces its antiviral response in patients with chronic hepatitis C is unclear. Suggested mechanisms includes an immunomodulatory effect favouring an antiviral T-helper cell-1 cytokine, inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, or inhibition of HCV-RNA dependent RNA polymerase, which both may inhibit viral replication, or that ribavirin is a a viral mutagen causing lethal mutagenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Lutchman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lutchman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Clercq--2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Clercq 2009</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-07-22 11:37:45 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both ribavirin and interferon are expensive drugs and are associated with many adverse events, which often leads to dose reductions or treatment discontinuations (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>). Therefore, ribavirin monotherapy may represent an alternative for some patients. In our previous version of this review we found no clear beneficial effect of ribavirin (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2003</LINK>). This review updates our knowledge about ribavirin monotherapy for chronic hepatitis C.</P>

Because ribavirin is associated with adverse events, is expensive, and the duration of treatment is long, we considered that the minimally clinically relevant number needed to treat to obtain a beneficial effect (NNT = 1/RD) should be relatively low. Thus, we calculated the required information size, ie, number of patients in the meta-analysis to detect or reject the estimated NNT, using an event proportion of 87% (NNT to obtain a beneficial effect = 10 patients) or 92% (NNT to obtain a beneficial effect = 50 patients) without serum sustained virological response in the ribavirin group.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-12 13:02:51 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this systematic review of 14 randomised trials with 657 patients, we found no significant beneficial effect of ribavirin monotherapy on virological response or liver morbidity, but ribavirin may transiently improve biochemical and histological responses. Ribavirin significantly increased the risk of anaemia. Trial sequential analysis found that we could rule out a benefit equalling a number needed to treat to obtain benefit of 10 patients (or fewer) for ribavirin regarding virological response. However, we are unable to rule out that ribavirin could leave a small but clinically relevant effect. Furthermore, compared with interferon monotherapy, ribavirin seemed significantly inferior regarding virological and biochemical responses.</P>
<P>In this review we tried to minimise publication and ascertainment bias by including trials regardless of publication status and language. Furthermore, all data were abstracted independently by two authors to avoid information bias. The main limitations of this review are the low number of patients, lack of clinical outcomes due to short-term follow-up, and the risk of bias in many of the included trials. A study demonstrated that in meta-analyses with 500 patients, the pooled relative risk may change 0.6 to 1.7 fold in the immediate future (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2000</LINK>). Accordingly, this review does not preclude the possibility of a beneficial effect of ribavirin monotherapy. However, our trial sequential analyses indicated that the benefits, if any, are small.</P>
<P>We assessed our outcomes with risk differences as this method offers the advantage of including trials with zero events. Furthermore, the risk difference can be used for calculating the number needed to treat. Risk difference results may overestimate the precision of the meta-analyses as this method results in spuriously narrow confidence intervals (<LINK REF="REF-Keus-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keus 2009</LINK>). Use of relative risk and different handling of zero event trials has, however, not changed the overall results.</P>
<P>The majority of the trials excluded patients with alcohol or intravenous drug abuse, human immune deficiency virus, and hepatitis B. Many patients with hepatitis C have these diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Alter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alter 2002</LINK>). Therefore, the average patient included in this review is not likely to be representative of the average patient with chronic hepatitis C in clinical practice. Furthermore, no trials specifically included patients intolerant to interferon. Such patients are those likely to be considered for ribavirin monotherapy. Thus, it may be difficult to transfer the results of this review to the subset of these hepatitis C patients.</P>
<P>We assessed 11 trials on ribavirin monotherapy versus placebo or no intervention for chronic hepatitis C that included both naive, relapsers, and non-responders to previous antiviral treatment. The dose of ribavirin was relatively consistent (800 mg/day to 1200 mg/day), but the duration of therapy varied between 8 weeks to 52 weeks. We found no significant beneficial effect of ribavirin on liver-related morbidity plus all-cause mortality, and that only 1 out of 200 patients treated with ribavirin had sustained virological response. Most patients had genotype 1 (73%), which is considered the most difficult to treat. Ribavirin monotherapy may be beneficial in other genotypes (eg, 2 and 3) (<LINK REF="REF-Howaizi--2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howaizi 2009</LINK>). Conversely, ribavirin improved biochemical response after end of treatment, but sparse data showed no significant effect on sustained biochemical response. More data are needed to evaluate whether this beneficial effect is transient or sustained. However, biochemical response is a putative surrogate outcome and the clinical importance might be limited (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found that ribavirin had a significant beneficial effect on liver histology. However, we were not able to assess liver inflammation or fibrosis individually and our histology analyses combine both inflammation and fibrosis scores. A weakness of this outcome is that liver biopsies have important technical limitations and histology assessments may have weak inter- and intraobserver reproducibility (<LINK REF="REF-Marcellin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcellin 2002</LINK>). The short-term histological results seem encouraging but are not supported by long-term histological results or clinical benefits.</P>
<P>Ribavirin may be teratogenic (<LINK REF="REF-Ferm-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferm 1978</LINK>), and it causes haemolytic anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Maddrey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maddrey 1999</LINK>). Therefore, patients were required to practice birth control, and patients with cardiovascular disease or low level of haemoglobin were excluded. A total of 20% of patients treated with ribavirin experienced anaemia. Severe anaemia may be reduced with epoetin alfa (<LINK REF="REF-Dieterich-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dieterich 2003</LINK>) or by replacing ribavirin with a prodrug, viramidine (<LINK REF="STD-Benhamou-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Benhamou 2007</LINK>). However, warnings that epoetin alfa may induce pure red blood cell aplasia have recently been published (<LINK REF="REF-Amgen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amgen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2008</LINK>). Due to anaemia and other adverse events, about 10% had to discontinue ribavirin monotherapy. Few data on other adverse events related to ribavirin were reported. However, ribavirin added to interferon increase the risk of several dermatological, gastrointestinal, haematological, and miscellaneous adverse reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two randomised trials observed that continued ribavirin failed to improve sustained virological response in patients who initially responded to combination therapy with interferon plus ribavirin (<LINK REF="STD-Shiffman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shiffman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagayama-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nagayama 2005</LINK>). Pooling these data in a meta-analysis confirm these conclusions (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.44). Furthermore, retrospective studies of larger patients cohorts receiving ribavirin indicated limited changes in HCV viraemia (<LINK REF="REF-Zoulim-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zoulim 1998</LINK>). These results support our finding that ribavirin seems without beneficial effects on virological response.</P>
<P>Sustained virological response is considered the target for chronic hepatitis treatment, but it is only a putative surrogate outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koretz-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koretz 2009</LINK>). Virological response is attractive to use because analysing treatment effects on clinical outcomes are impeded by the protracted course of the hepatitis C infection. Epidemiological studies (eg, comparing morbidity in patients with and without viral clearance) have shown a correlation between sustained virological response and liver-related morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Chander-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chander 2002</LINK>). Unfortunately, this correlation may be biased and has not been validated for any specific intervention in randomised trials (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koretz-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koretz 2009</LINK>). We, therefore, risk that ribavirin causes no response on virological parameters but may still have effect (harmful of beneficial) on clinical outcomes.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Five trials including 151 patients compared ribavirin versus interferon. Compared to ribavirin monotherapy, interferon monotherapy increased the number with virological and biochemical response. Knowing the beneficial effects of interferon monotherapy on viral clearance (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myers-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2002b</LINK>), interferon should be first choice between the two.</P>
<P>Currently, the treatment of choice for chronic hepatitis C is a combination therapy with ribavirin plus pegylated interferon (<LINK REF="REF-Chander-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chander 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Consensus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consensus 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simin 2007</LINK>). The beneficial effect of adding ribavirin to interferon is not fully understood (<LINK REF="REF-De-Clercq--2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Clercq 2009</LINK>) and may theoretically be due to the following scenarios. Ribavirin has its own beneficial effect on the course of hepatitis C. This possibility seems to be contradicted by our present findings. Ribavirin has a beneficial effect on patients who do not respond to interferon. This also seems contradicted by our findings in non-responders and relapsers to previous interferon therapy. Alternatively, ribavirin may potentiate some of the effect of interferon (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myers-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2002b</LINK>) or vice versa which currently seems the most plausible mechanism.</P>

<P>We found no significant effect of ribavirin monotherapy on serum virological response and liver-related morbidity plus all-cause mortality, but ribavirin may have a transient beneficial effect on biochemical and histological responses.

<P>Ribavirin monotherapy for patients with chronic hepatitis does not seem promising. However, ribavirin monotherapy has only been examined in few trials and in a small sample of patients. Furthermore, research on ribavirin monotherapy should be confined to patient groups that cannot be treated with interferon or other antiviral drugs. Trial sequential analysis rejects a NNT to obtain a beneficial effect of 10 patients (or fewer) for ribavirin regarding serum sustained virological response (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). If a larger NNT to obtain a beneficial effect is considered clinically relevant, eg, an additional 2661 patients randomised to ribavirin versus placebo are needed to detect or reject a NNT to obtain a beneficial effect of 50 patients (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Research on the optimal dose and duration of ribavirin administration in combination with interferons seems more important (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>). Such trials should be reported according to the CONSORT statement (www.consort-statement.org) and involve ribavirin placebo and adequate blinding.</P>

<P>This is the second update of the Cochrane review originally entitled 'Ribavirin with or without alpha interferon versus no intervention, placebo or alpha interferon for chronic hepatitis C', first published in The Cochrane Library 2002, Issue 1. Due to an additional large number of included trials, the review was, at the first update, split into two reviews entitled 'Ribavirin monotherapy for chronic hepatitis C' and 'Ribavirin plus interferon versus interferon for chronic hepatitis C'. The latter is published for the first time in Issue 3, 2005.<BR/>
<BR/>In the last updated review from 2005 changes have been made in:<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>This section is updated and written according to the recommendations of RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Electronic searches</B>
<BR/>We also search the <I>Science Citation Index Expanded </I>and searched for ongoing trial and unpublished trials in clinical trial databases: (http://controlled-trials.com, http://clinicaltrials.gov,<SUP> </SUP>and http://centerwatch.com). The updated search revealed one new trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sostegni-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sostegni 1998</LINK>), and we identified a full publication of a previously included abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Pawlotsky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pawlotsky 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical analyses</B>
<BR/>The occurrence of events in the primary outcomes was nil in a number of trials. We, therefore, decided in the updated review to analyse data with risk difference (RD) as this analyses includes trials with no events in the overall analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Bias assessment</B>
<BR/>Bias assessment of each trial now includes assessment of incomplete outcome data, baseline imbalance, early stopping, and source of funding bias according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<BR/>The overall conclusion has not been changed.</P>

Stratton-Hans Popper Department of Pathology, Mount Sinai&lt;br&gt;Medical Center, City University of New York, NY 10029, USA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased levels of hepatic iron may impair the response of patients with&lt;br&gt;chronic hepatitis C to treatment with interferon-alfa, but combination therapy&lt;br&gt;with ribavirin has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of hepatitis C. When&lt;br&gt;used alone or with interferon-alfa, ribavirin may cause a dose-dependent&lt;br&gt;reversible hemolytic anemia. We compared the extent and cellular localization of&lt;br&gt;iron deposition in liver tissue from biopsy specimens obtained before and after&lt;br&gt;36 weeks of therapy with ribavirin or placebo for 59 patients with chronic&lt;br&gt;hepatitis C. Paired slides were available for review from 26 ribavirin and 27&lt;br&gt;placebo recipients. Iron deposition was assessed using coded slides stained with&lt;br&gt;Perls Prussian blue and was semi-quantitated in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and&lt;br&gt;areas of fibrosis. The overall iron score fell by 0.96 in the placebo group and&lt;br&gt;increased 1.69 in the ribavirin recipients. Iron was deposited mainly in&lt;br&gt;hepatocytes; the hepatocyte iron score increased from 2.19 to 3.81 in the&lt;br&gt;ribavirin group. The amount of iron staining in Kupffer cells declined in the&lt;br&gt;placebo group and increased slightly in the ribavirin group. Iron changes in&lt;br&gt;areas of fibrosis were minor and did not differ between groups. Increased total&lt;br&gt;hepatic iron deposition occurred during a 9-month course of ribavirin.&lt;br&gt;Ribavirin-associated hemolysis deposits iron preferentially in hepatocytes. This&lt;br&gt;increased deposition of hepatic iron does not seem to affect the biochemical or&lt;br&gt;histologic response to ribavirin therapy but may have implications for&lt;br&gt;hepatocyte susceptibility to future injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publication Types:&lt;br&gt;Clinical trial&lt;br&gt;Multicenter study&lt;br&gt;Randomized controlled trial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

<P>Trial sequential analysis illustrating that the cumulative Z-curve (blue) has not crossed the monitoring boundary (red) but have surpassed the information size (n = 232) needed to detect of reject an effect size corresponding to a number needed to treat of 10 patient (or fewer) for ribavirin. Thus we can rule out a number needed to treat of 10 patients (or fewer) for ribavirin regarding sustained virological response.</P>
<P>Trial sequential analysis was performed with a type I error of 5% and type II error of 20% (80% power). We assumed a baseline event rate of 97% without sustained virological response in the placebo/no intervention group. We used an event rate of 87% (number needed to treat = 10 patients) without sustained virological response in the ribavirin group.</P>

<P>Trial sequential analysis illustrating that the cumulative Z-curve (blue) has not crossed the monitoring boundary (red) nor reached the information size (n = 3014) needed to detect of reject an effect size corresponding to a number needed to treat of 50 (or fewer) for ribavirin. Thus we can not rule out a number needed to treat of 50 (or fewer) for ribavirin regarding sustained virological response. Additionally 2661 (3014 - 353) patients are needed to detect or reject this effect size.</P>
<P>Trial sequential analysis was performed with a type I error of 5% and type II error of 20% (80% power). We assumed a baseline event rate of 97% for sustained virological response in the placebo/no intervention group. We used an event rate of 95% (number needed to treat = 50) without sustained virological response in the ribavirin group.</P>
