<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Cerebral toxoplasmosis or toxoplasmic meningoencephalitis (hereafter referred to as TE) was one of the first opportunistic infections to be described in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected patients. Treatment of TE has been relatively successful in comparison to other opportunistic infections. Prior to the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a median survival of over a year was reported for patients who could tolerate the toxicity of TE treatment. HAART is becoming increasingly widely available in sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of HIV-infected patients live. Many patients in Africa are diagnosed with HIV only after developing opportunistic infections such as TE. Hence, the optimal management of opportunistic infections such as TE is important if the benefits of subsequently initiating HAART are to be seen.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The purpose of this review is to determine the most effective therapy for TE in HIV-infected adults. Different treatment regimens have been compared with regard to clinical and radiological response, mortality, morbidity, and serious adverse events.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>A comprehensive search of relevant databases and other sources was conducted to identify relevant studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised double-blinded trials were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted using standardised forms and analysed using Rev Man 4.2.7 software.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three trials were found to meet the inclusion criteria. Dannemann et al 1992 and Katlama et al 1996 compared pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine (P+S) with pyrimethamine plus clindamycin (P+C). Torre 1998 compared P+S with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). For the purposes of this review, clinical outcomes were analysed as complete or partial resolution vs. failure. Patients who crossed over or were lost to follow-up were analysed as failures.</P>
<P>Dannemann et al 1992 assessed 59 patients. Five of 26 (19%) patients randomised to P+C died in the first 6 weeks compared with 2 of the 33 (6%) patients randomised to P+S (relative risk (RR) 3.17; 95% CI 0.67-15.06). Complete or partial clinical response was obtained in 12 (46.2%) patients receiving P+C vs. 16 (48.5 %) patients receiving P+S (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.55-1.64).</P>
<P>Katlama et al 1996 assessed 299 patients. Twenty-nine (19%) of the 152 patients randomised to P+C died compared with 22 (15%) of the 147 patients randomised to P+S (RR 1.27; 95% CI 0.77-2.11). We were unable to obtain data on the outcomes of patients who crossed over and therefore excluded these data from the analysis.</P>
<P>Dannemann et al 1992 and Katlama et al 1996 were analysed together for the outcome of death. The two treatment arms did not differ for death (RR 1.41; 95% CI 0.88-2.28).</P>
<P>Torre et al 1998 assessed 77 patients. There were no deaths during the study period. Twenty-eight (70%) of 40 patients randomised to TMP-SMX had a complete or partial clinical response compared with 26 (70%) of 37 patients randomised to P+S (RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.74-1.33).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The available evidence fails to identify any one superior regimen for the treatment of TE. The choice of therapy will often be directed by available therapy. Given the current evidence, TMP-SMX appears to be an effective alternative therapy for TE in resource-poor settings where P+S are not available.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Cerebral toxoplasmosis or toxoplasmic meningoencephalitis (here after referred to as TE) was one of the first opportunistic infections to be described in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected patients. Treatment of TE has been relatively successful in comparison to other opportunistic infections. Prior to the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a median survival of over a year was reported for patients who could tolerate TE treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Sadler-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadler 1998</LINK>). Although the drugs commonly used to treat TE are toxic, these drugs were required for survival prior to HAART. HAART has increased the survival of patients with HIV infection and decreased the incidence of TE (<LINK REF="REF-Morcroft-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morcroft 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Abgrall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abgrall 2001</LINK>). HAART is becoming increasingly widely available in sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of HIV-infected patients live (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2004</LINK>). Many patients in Africa are diagnosed with HIV only after developing opportunistic infections such as TE. Hence, the optimal management of opportunistic infections such as TE is important if the benefits of subsequently initiating HAART are to be seen. </P>
<P>
<I>Toxoplasma</I> <I>gondii</I> is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite whose definitive host is cats. Humans are infected accidentally through the ingestion of food or water contaminated with cat faeces. Humans can also be infected though blood and organ transplantation. </P>
<P>
<I>T. gondii</I>, which replicates in the intestines of cats, exists in three forms: the oocyst, tachyzoite and bradyzoite. Millions of oocysts are released in the cat's faeces, and these are infectious to other mammals, including human, when ingested. Once ingested, tachyzoites emerge from the oocyst and then rapidly replicate in nucleated cells. Tachyzoites can disrupt the host cell and enter the circulation, leading to widespread dissemination of the parasite to many different organs. The rapidly replicating tachyzoites are transformed into bradyzoites and form cysts due to the immune response they elicit. These cysts containing many bradyzoites remain within the host cells in the brain and other organs. If the host immune system is compromised, the bradyzoites can transform into tachyzoites and cause tissue destruction leading to clinical manifestations. </P>
<P>
<I>T</I>. <I>gondii</I> infection in humans can cause a variety of clinical pictures, from asymptomatic latent infection to cerebral toxoplasmosis. This review will not consider primary <I>T. gondii</I> infection or reactivation of infection other than TE in HIV-infected individuals.</P>
<P>Most <I>T. gondii </I>infections are acquired in childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2001</LINK>). HIV-infected patients do not seem to be at increased risk of acquiring <I>T</I>. <I>gondii</I> compared to the general population, and most cases of TE are due to reactivation of latent, not newly acquired, infection (<LINK REF="REF-Porter-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porter 1992</LINK>). There are wide variations in <I>T. gondii</I> prevalence between countries. 7.6-19.5% of British people (<LINK REF="REF-Ades-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ades 1993</LINK>) and 22.5% of people in the USA have antibodies to <I>T. gondii</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2001</LINK>). In Africa there is a wide variation in antibody prevalence with 34% of people in South Africa, 27% of people in Uganda, 27% of people in Botswana, 54% in blood donors in Kenya, and 75% of people in Nigeria having <I>T. gondii</I> antibodies (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 1978</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Griffin-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffin 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Zumla-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zumla 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Onadeko-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onadeko 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>TE was thought to be relatively uncommon in Africa, reported as occurring in around 5-15% of patients in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo and 7% of AIDS patients in an infectious disease hospital in Cote d' Ivoire (<LINK REF="REF-Grant-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grant 1997</LINK>). There is probably a large degree of under-diagnosis due to difficulties with diagnosis. This was reflected in an autopsy study in Cote d'Ivoire that found TE to be a major cause of pathology in HIV-infected adults with advanced disease (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>Patients with TE may present in a number of ways (<LINK REF="REF-Luft-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luft 1993</LINK>) with a combination of signs and symptoms. Focal neurological signs are common and occur in around three-quarters of patients at diagnosis. The signs reflect the site of the lesion and include hemiparesis, cranial nerve palsies, and ataxia. Generalised convulsions, change in mental status, headaches, and fever are also common. Any of these signs and symptoms in an HIV-infected patient should be investigated as possible TE. The differential diagnosis depending on the setting includes tuberculoma and primary central nervous system lymphoma.</P>
<P>Since diagnosis of TE is not straightforward, a computer tomograph of the brain or if possible a magnetic resonance imaging scan is useful because TE has characteristic features that can help distinguish it from other pathologies. Definitive diagnosis by brain biopsy is not often indicated. Many clinicians will treat an HIV-infected patient with signs and symptoms of TE and a suggestive brain scan empirically with antitoxoplasma treatment for several weeks. At the end of this time, the condition of the patient can be reassessed and the scan repeated. If the patient and the scan have improved, then the diagnosis is likely to be TE. If not, other diagnoses must be sought. Clinical algorithms exist to aid management (<LINK REF="REF-Sadler-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadler 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mainstay of treatment for TE has been drugs that affect the ability of <I>T. gondii</I> to synthesize folate. Drugs affecting protein and nucleic acid synthesis have also been used. Commonly prescribed regimens include sulphadiazine with pyrimethamine, clindamycin with pyrimethamine, and atovaquone amongst others. Pyrimethamine often leads to suppression of haematopoiesis and is given with folinic acid supplements. The use of steroids in the treatment of TE is controversial and will not be considered in this review.</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to determine which therapy is most effective for treating HIV-infected patients who present with a first episode TE. Primary and secondary prophylaxis of TE are not considered.</P>

<P>Hand searches of reference lists of reviews were also undertaken. Searches of journals in languages other than English were made. Experts in the field were also contacted.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Trials identified by the search were assessed for inclusion in the review. Abstracts of all studies identified were screened by both reviewers. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed in full by two reviewers. Upon disagreement about the suitability of a study for inclusion, the issue was resolved by discussion or involvement of a third party. Both reviewers graded the methodological quality of identified studies as follows: A-adequate, B-unclear, C-inadequate, D-not done. The assessment of methodological quality was based on the quality of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, baseline characteristics of patients, use of intention to treat analysis and completeness of follow-up.</P>
<P>Data was extracted from the selected studies by both reviewers using a standard data extraction form.</P>
<P>Summary ratio measures between trials (odds ratios, relative risks with 95% confidence intervals), were calculated where appropriate using Cochrane RevMan software. Heterogeneity between trials was tested by Chi squared test. </P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Three trials were found to meet the inclusion criteria. <LINK REF="STD-Dannemann-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dannemann et al 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Katlama-et-al-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Katlama et al 1996</LINK> compared pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine (P+S) with pyrimethamine plus clindamycin (P+C). <LINK REF="STD-Torre-et-al-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Torre et al 1998</LINK> compared P+S with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dannemann-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dannemann et al 1992</LINK> randomised 84 North American and European patients to receive P+C or P+S. Patients were eligible if they had signs, symptoms and imaging consistent with TE, no known allergy to study medications, were not pregnant, did not have Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) pneumonia or concomitant central nervous system (CNS) infection, and had antibodies to T. gondii. The study was open labelled. Unblinded clinical and radiological assessments were conducted after 3 and 6 weeks of therapy. Outcome measures were mortality, clinical resolution (scored as complete, partial, poor, no change, or progression), radiological resolution (scored as complete, partial, poor, no change, or progression), and adverse events. Thirty-seven patients were randomised to P+C and 47 to P+S. Five and 8 patients respectively were excluded after a diagnosis other than TE was made. A further 6 and 6 patients respectively were excluded due to lack of T. gondii antibodies (7 patients), prior TE treatment (4 patients), or concomitant cryptococcal meningitis (1 patient). The 59 patients included in analysis had a mean age of 36 years, 81% were male in the P+C group, and 88% were male in the P+S group. Mean CD4 count was 47 x 106 cells/L in the P+C group and 70 x 106 cells/L in the P+S group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Katlama-et-al-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Katlama et al 1996</LINK> randomised 340 European patients to P+C or P+S. Patients were eligible if they were infected with HIV-1 and presented with their first episode of TE (defined as fever and/or neurological symptoms or signs and the presence of at least one contrast enhancing brain lesion on computerised tomography). Patients were excluded if they had a previous episode of TE, previous severe intolerance to the study drugs, or a poor hematologic profile. The study was open-labelled. Unblinded clinical and blinded radiological assessments were conducted at 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks. Outcome measures were mortality, clinical response, and radiological response. Clinical response was classified as success (complete or partial response at week six with the absence of recurrent masses during maintenance) or disease progression (persistence or increase of signs and symptoms at week 6, death during the first 6 weeks, or recurrence of lesions during maintenance therapy). Radiological success was classified as complete response, partial response, or no response (&lt;50% decrease in number and/or size in lesions or an increase in the number and/or the size of any initial lesion). One hundred seventy-four patients were randomised to P+C and 168 were randomised to P+S, with 22 and 19 patients ineligible for therapy respectively. The authors state that the reasons for ineligibility were evenly distributed between both groups. Fourteen patients were treated with drug regimens different from those specified in the protocol (6 P+C patients received a sulphonamide, 8 P+S patients received inadequate doses of sulfadiazine), and these patients were included in the analysis. One P+C patient received sulfadiazine and was included in the analysis of his treatment arm. Mean age was 34 years in the P+C group and 33 years in the P+S group. Eighty-eight percent of participants were male, and immune status was not reported.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Torre-et-al-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Torre et al 1998</LINK> randomised 77 European patients to receive P+S or TMP-SMX. Patients were eligible for randomisation if they were infected with HIV-1 with signs, symptoms, and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans compatible with TE, were older than 18 years, had no known or suspected allergy to the study drugs, were not pregnant and did not have Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) pneumonia or a concomitant infection of the central nervous system. Patients were excluded if they had a previous episode of TE, previous treatment or prophylaxis with TMP-SMX or a poor haematological profile. The study was open label. Unblinded clinical assessments were conducted at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks and blinded radiological assessments were performed at 30 days. Outcome measures were clinical response (complete, partial, or no change or progression) and radiological response (complete, partial or no change or progression). Thirty-seven patients were randomised to P+S and 40 were randomised to TMP-SMX. All were eligible for treatment. Two and 3 patients were lost for clinical assessment respectively and 4 and 3 patients were lost for radiological assessment. Mean age was 32 years in the P+S group and 34 years in the TMP-SMX group. Men comprised 78% of patients in the P+S group and 70% of the TMP-SMX group. Immune status was not reported.</P>

<BR/>All studies allowed cross-over of patients from one group to the other if they had not responded within 7 days (<LINK REF="STD-Dannemann-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dannemann et al 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Katlama-et-al-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Katlama et al 1996</LINK>) or 15 days (<LINK REF="STD-Torre-et-al-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Torre et al 1998</LINK>) or had severe adverse events. Each paper states that analysis was performed on an intention to treat but none of the studies classified crossovers as failures. Instead, patients were classified based on their eventual outcome. For example, if a patient who showed no response to one regimen was switched over to the second regimen and had a complete response then that patient would be analysed as a complete response for the first regimen. This analysis potentially introduces a bias in favour of the less effective or less well tolerated regimen. <LINK REF="STD-Dannemann-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dannemann et al 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Torre-et-al-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Torre et al 1998</LINK> present outcomes of those who crossed over separately which allows a true intention to treat analysis to be done. <LINK REF="STD-Katlama-et-al-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Katlama et al 1996</LINK> do not present the outcomes of patients who crossed over.

</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Three trials were found to meet the inclusion criteria. <LINK REF="STD-Dannemann-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dannemann et al 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Katlama-et-al-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Katlama et al 1996</LINK> compared pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine (P+S) with pyrimethamine plus clindamycin (P+C). Torre 1998 compared P+S with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). All three protocols allowed crossover to the other treatment arm at the discretion of the investigators if patients were not responding or were suffering from severe adverse events. Outcomes of those who crossed over were reported by Dannemann, and authors of the two other studies were contacted to identify the outcomes of patients who crossed over. For the purposes of this review, clinical outcomes were analysed as complete or partial resolution vs. failure. Patients who crossed over or were lost to follow up were analysed as failures.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dannemann-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dannemann et al 1992</LINK> assessed 59 patients. Five of 26 (19%) patients randomised to P+C died in the first 6 weeks compared with 2 of the 33 (6%) patients randomised to P+S (relative risk (RR) 3.17; 95% CI 0.67-15.06). Complete or partial resolution (defined as resolution of or more than a 50% improvement in the graded neurological examination) was obtained in 12 (46.2%) patients receiving P+C vs. 16 (48.5 %) patients receiving P+S (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.55-1.64). Radiological outcomes were analysed as intention to treat regardless of whether patients crossed over or not. Nineteen (73%) patients randomised to P+C and 20 (61%) patients randomised to P+S had complete or partial radiological responses at 6 weeks (RR 1.21; 95% CI 0.84-1.73). Sixteen (62%) patients randomised to P+C and 19 (58%) patients randomised to P+S experienced adverse events (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.7-1.63). The types of adverse events were similar in both groups with rash being the most common adverse event.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Katlama-et-al-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Katlama et al 1996</LINK> assessed 299 patients. Twenty-nine (19%) of the 152 patients randomised to P+C died compared with 22 (15%) of the 147 patients randomised to P+S (RR 1.27; 95% CI 0.77-2.11). We were unable to obtain data on the outcomes of patients who crossed over and therefore excluded these data from the analysis. One hundred and ten (72%) patients randomised to P+C and 117 (80%) patients randomised to P+S had complete or partial radiological responses at 6 weeks (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.8-1.03). Ninety-two (60%) patients randomised to P+C and 96 (65%) patients randomised to P+S experienced at least one adverse event (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.78-1.1). Adverse events were similar in both groups although skin rash, liver toxicity and crystalluria were more common with P+S while diarrhoea was more common with P+C.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dannemann-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dannemann et al 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Katlama-et-al-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Katlama et al 1996</LINK> were not heterogeneous for the outcomes of mortality, adverse events and radiological outcome. They were therefore analysed together for these outcomes. The two treatment arms did not differ for death (RR 1.41; 95% CI 0.88-2.28), complete or partial radiological response (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.84-1.07), or adverse events (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.81-1.11). </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Torre-et-al-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Torre et al 1998</LINK> assessed 77 patients. There were no deaths during the study period. Twenty-eight (70%) of 40 patients randomised to TMP-SMX had a good clinical response compared with 26 (70%) of 37 patients randomised to P+S (RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.74-1.33). Twenty-seven (68%) patients randomised to TMP-SMX and 23 (62%) randomised to P+S had a good radiological outcome (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.78-1.51). Five (12%) patients randomised to TMP-SMX and 8 (22%) patients randomised to P+S experienced an adverse event (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.21-1.61). Skin rash was significantly more common with P+S.</P>
<P>We also compared patients who received TMP-SMX or P+C with patients who received P+S. There was no statistically significant difference for death (RR 1.51; 95% CI 0.86-2.67).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Searches revealed almost 1000 studies related to toxoplasmosis treatment. The majority addressed issues of prophylaxis. From these records, only three studies were felt to be of sufficient quality to merit inclusion. The reasons for exclusion of the other studies addressing treatment of acute TE are given in the table below. Due to the small number of studies in the final analysis it was not possible to conduct subanalysis of studies. Two (<LINK REF="STD-Dannemann-et-al-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Dannemann et al 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Katlama-et-al-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Katlama et al 1996</LINK>) compared P+C with P+S. These were analysed together for death, radiological response, and adverse events. The pooled analysis for mortality, radiological outcomes and adverse events revealed no differences between the two treatments. Only Danneman was analysed for clinical response but no difference between the two treatments was found. Therefore P+S and P+C can be considered equivalent for the treatment of acute TE in HIV-infected individuals.</P>
<P>One of the aims of the review was to identify treatments that would be suitable for resource-poor settings where sulfadiazine is often not available despite being on the World Health Organisation essential drugs list (complementary list) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-EDL" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO EDL</LINK>). TMP-SMX was compared to P+S by Torre and was not found to be inferior. From this one study the evidence suggests that TMP-SMX which is cheap and readily available in developing countries may be suitable first line therapy for acute TE in HIV-infected individuals. In South Africa, TMP-SMX is already recommended as first line treatment for TE (<LINK REF="REF-EDP-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EDP 2003</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The available evidence fails to identify any one superior regimen for the treatment of TE. No significant difference was found between the different treatment regimens. The choice of therapy will often be directed by available therapy. Given the current evidence TMP-SMX appears to be an effective alternative therapy to P+S for TE in resource-poor settings.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>With the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy in high-income countries opportunistic infections such as TE have declined. They remain a large problem in resource-poor settings where patients frequently present to the health services with opportunistic infections and are diagnosed with HIV infection at the same time. Large amounts of donor funding is currently being devoted to improving care of HIV-infected patients in resource-poor settings but the evidence base for how to do this is thin. Further evaluations of treatment available in resource-limited settings will be important to ensure that funds are used efficiently.</P>
