<P>There is not enough evidence to recommend using probiotics for the treatment of eczema.</P>
<P>Eczema is a skin condition characterised by an itchy red rash, which affects between 5 and 20% of people at some time in their life. People with eczema have different bacteria in their gut to people without eczema, and sometimes they have inflammation in their gut. It may be possible to treat eczema symptoms by changing the mix of gut bacteria or by reducing inflammation in the gut. One type of treatment that might achieve this is probiotics - these are live micro-organisms taken by mouth such as the <I>Lactobacillus</I> bacteria found in unpasteurised milk and yoghurt. This review of twelve trials found that probiotics do not reduce eczema symptoms such as itching, nor do they change the overall severity of eczema judged by patients or their doctors. The results varied between different trials but overall do not suggest that probiotics are an effective treatment for eczema. Further studies of new probiotics are needed, because it is possible that different types of probiotics which haven't yet been studied in eczema treatment could be more effective. Probiotics can rarely cause infections and gut problems.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Disease definition</HEADING>
<P>Eczema is a non-infective chronic inflammatory skin disease characterised by an itchy red rash. The terms 'eczema' and 'dermatitis' have been used synonymously, and eczema is associated with atopy. 'Atopy' is defined as a genetic predisposition to become sensitised and produce IgE antibodies in response to ordinary exposures to allergens (<LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2004</LINK>). Despite the association between eczema and atopy, up to 40% of children with eczema do not have atopy when defined according to allergy tests such as skin prick tests (<LINK REF="REF-Bohme-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohme 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flohr-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flohr 2004</LINK>). A revised nomenclature for allergy (<LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2001</LINK>) has been updated by the World Allergy Organisation (<LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2004</LINK>). The new nomenclature is based on the mechanisms that initiate and mediate allergic reactions. The term 'eczema' is proposed to replace the previous term 'atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome'. What was termed Atopic Eczema Dermatitis Syndrome in 2001 is now thought to be not one single disease but rather an aggregation of several diseases with certain characteristics in common. The term 'atopy' cannot be used until an IgE sensitisation has been confirmed by IgE antibodies in the blood or by a positive Skin Prick Test (SPT) to common environmental or dietary allergens such as pollen, house dust mite, cow's milk or egg. If this is done then the term 'eczema' can be split into 'atopic eczema' and 'non-atopic eczema'.</P>
<P>For the purpose of this review the term 'eczema' will be used and will include eczema where IgE sensitisation has been confirmed, eczema where IgE sensitisation is absent, and eczema where IgE sensitisation has not been assessed.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology and causes</HEADING>
<P>Eczema is the most common inflammatory skin disease of childhood, affecting 5 to 20% of children at any one time (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoare-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare 2000</LINK>). The cumulative prevalence of eczema varies from 20% in Northern Europe and the USA to 5% in the south-eastern Mediterranean (<LINK REF="REF-Thestrup-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thestrup 2002</LINK>). Only 2% of children under the age of 5 years have severe disease, and 84% have mild disease as judged by a specialist dermatology assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Emerson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 1998</LINK>). Around 2% of adults have eczema and many of these have a more chronic and severe form (<LINK REF="REF-Charman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charman 2002</LINK>). Eczema is often associated with other atopic diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 2000</LINK>) such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, or food allergies and sufferers often have a family history of allergic disease. There is wide variation in the prevalence of eczema between different countries, and some studies suggest that the prevalence is increasing in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2004</LINK>). The cause of eczema is not well understood and is probably a combination of genetic and environmental factors (<LINK REF="REF-Cookson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cookson 2002</LINK>). In recent years, research has pointed to the possible role of environmental agents such as house dust mite (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Bever-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Bever 2002</LINK>), pollution (<LINK REF="REF-Polosa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polosa 2001</LINK>), and microbes (<LINK REF="REF-Bjorksten-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjorksten 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical features</HEADING>
<P>Eczema may be acute (short-term and severe) with predominantly redness, vesicles and oozing, or it may be chronic (long-term) with scaling, skin thickening, altered pigmentation and exaggerated surface markings. The condition affects mainly the creases of the elbows and knees, and the face and neck, although it can affect any part of the body. The severity of eczema is variable, ranging from localised mild scaling to generalised involvement of the whole body, with redness, oozing and secondary infection. Itching is the predominant symptom which can induce a vicious cycle of scratching, leading to skin damage which in turn leads to more itching - the so called "itch scratch itch" cycle. There is a tendency to a dry sensitive skin, even in those who have 'grown out' of the disease. This is thought to be due to a defect in the lipid barrier of the epidermis (<LINK REF="REF-Proksch-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Proksch 2003</LINK>). In adulthood, the skin (especially of the hands) may be prone to inflammation in the presence of environmental irritants such as soaps (<LINK REF="REF-Archer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Archer 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Natural history</HEADING>
<P>Eczema usually starts within the first 6 months of life, and by 1 year, 60% of those likely to develop it will have done so. Remission occurs by the age of 15 years in 60 to 70% of cases, although some relapse later. In the more severely affected child, development and puberty may be delayed (<LINK REF="REF-Baum-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baum 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact</HEADING>
<P>Eczema varies in severity, often from one hour to the next. Severity can be measured in a number of ways. A systematic review of named outcome scales for eczema found that of the 13 named scales in use at that time, only one (Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis, SCORAD) had been fully tested for validity, repeatability and responsiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Charman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charman 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The itching and scratching can adversely affect quality of life through chronic sleep disturbance and this may have an impact on family life. In children, the social and emotional impact on the family can be greater than that of type I diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Su-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 1997</LINK>). The disease can be associated with complications such as bacterial and viral infections (<LINK REF="REF-McHenry-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McHenry 1995</LINK>). The unsightly appearance of the skin and the need to apply greasy ointments can limit a child's inclination to participate in social and sporting activities and thus affect their confidence. Adults with eczema often have low self-esteem and relationships can be difficult to initiate and sustain. Everyday tasks such as housework, gardening, childcare and food preparation present problems when the skin on the hands is cracked. Promotion at work may be blocked for people who do not 'look good'.</P>
<P>Eczema also has considerable costs to the community as a whole. For example the cost of childhood eczema to the Australian community was estimated at AU$316.7 million (US$239.3 million; Euro195.9 million) per year in 1999 (<LINK REF="REF-Kemp-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kemp 1999</LINK>). The healthcare costs of eczema in adults are comparable to those of epilepsy, emphysema and other chronic diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2002</LINK>). Direct costs to the family are encountered when purchasing treatments, special clothing and bedding and incurring extra laundry expenses; indirect costs are experienced from lost working days when parents are looking after an unwell child. The wider economic implications lie in the costs of health professionals, the lost opportunities of parents of sick children who do not have the option of seeking employment and the child who, as a result of missing schooling, faces employment limitations.</P>

<P>There is currently no cure for eczema, however, a wide range of treatments are employed which aim to control the symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Fennessy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fennessy 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoare-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lamb-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamb 2002</LINK>). Health professionals assist people in the management of their disease using a variety of treatment methods; these include emollients, topical steroids, topical tars, topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. Other treatments such as wet wrap dressings, phototherapy, the avoidance of triggers such as food allergens and complementary therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2000</LINK>) are also used. Many of the treatments are of unknown effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Hoare-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare 2000</LINK>). Emollients and topical corticosteroids are universally recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Smethurst-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smethurst 2002</LINK>). Treatment regimens can be time consuming and expensive for those affected and their families, and there is a need for new treatments which are effective, cheap and simple to administer.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Rationale for using probiotics to treat eczema</HEADING>
<P>The intestinal microflora (or intestinal microbiota) is the large collection of micro-organisms which live in the human intestine and confer intestinal, immune and nutritional benefits on the host. The composition of the intestinal microflora has been found to be different in those with eczema, and such differences may precede the development of active eczema. The most consistent finding in such studies is a reduced proportion of <I>Bifidobacteria</I> species in the faeces of infants with eczema (<LINK REF="REF-Bjorksten-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjorksten 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kalliomaki-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalliomaki 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2005</LINK>). This has led to the hypothesis that an aberrant intestinal microbiota may cause or worsen eczema.</P>
<P>Gastrointestinal disorders such as eosinophilic enteropathies and food allergies are also more common in children with eczema, and in some cases can exacerbate the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Werfel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Werfel 2004</LINK>). Probiotics are a treatment that may alter the intestinal microbiota of people with eczema. Probiotics are live micro-organisms (for example <I>Lactobacillus</I> species) which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host (<LINK REF="REF-FAOWHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">FAOWHO 2002</LINK>). They are effective treatments for some gastrointestinal disorders characterised by a disturbed intestinal microbiota such as infectious diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Gionchetti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gionchetti 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Allen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2003</LINK>). Their precise mode of action is not well established, but they have been shown to reduce markers of intestinal inflammation and intestinal permeability in disease states, and this might change the way in which antigens present in the intestine are recognised by the immune system (<LINK REF="REF-Pessi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pessi 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenfeldt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenfeldt 2004</LINK>). Some probiotics have also been shown to alter the overall composition of the intestinal microbiota (<LINK REF="REF-Sepp-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sepp 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spanhaak-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spanhaak 1998</LINK>). Probiotics are not the same as prebiotics, which are non-digestible sugars found in some foods that encourage the growth of certain types of bacteria in the intestine.</P>
<P>Probiotics are widely consumed worldwide in the form of fermented milk, and are potentially a cheap and accessible treatment for eczema. Probiotics may be particularly effective in young children, as the composition of the intestinal microbiota is unstable during the first two years of life and might therefore be more amenable to modulation (<LINK REF="REF-Yoshioka-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoshioka 1983</LINK>). Although all probiotics have certain properties in common (low pathogenicity, resistance to gastric acid and bile salt digestion, and adherence to the intestinal mucosa), the clinical and laboratory effects of probiotics can vary markedly between species (<LINK REF="REF-Christensen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Allen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2003</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-05-13 11:19:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Probiotics have recently been marketed in infant formula, and are recommended by some practitioners for the treatment of eczema. They are increasingly used by consumers for the treatment and prevention of a range of disorders, and have now been formally investigated in a number of clinical trials for the treatment of eczema. Their role in treating eczema is nevertheless controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2005</LINK>). Moreover recent reports suggest that probiotics can occasionally cause serious adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Hennequin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hennequin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Groote-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Groote 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Land-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Land 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Besselink-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Besselink 2008</LINK>). It is therefore important to formally assess the evidence for the efficacy of probiotics in treating eczema.</P>
<P>The rationale for this review is therefore:<BR/>1) eczema is a common disease with a negative impact on the individual, their family and their community;
<BR/>2) new treatments are needed for eczema;
<BR/>3) probiotics are increasingly being used for the treatment of eczema;
<BR/>4) cases of probiotic sepsis have been reported;
<BR/>5) no formal meta-analysis of probiotics for the treatment of eczema has yet been published.</P>

<P>Participants of any age with eczema diagnosed by a doctor. Participants with other specific forms of eczema such as contact eczema were not included in the study.</P>
<P>The National Health Service Technology Assessment systematic review of treatments for eczema (<LINK REF="REF-Hoare-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare 2000</LINK>) used specific terms to identify trial participants. A modified classification of these terms was used as listed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. The list classifies conditions as eczema and as specific forms of eczema not included in this review. One of the authors (RB) scrutinized those studies which used the terms in the 'possible atopic eczema' category (such as 'childhood eczema' ) and only included the study if the description of the participants indicated the absence of such specific forms as 'allergic contact eczema'.</P>

This measurement is a visual analogue scale of itch and sleep disturbance ranging from 0 to 20. Pooled data from these studies (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) showed no significant improvement in favour of probiotic treatment MD -0.90 (95% CI -2.84, 1.04; p = 0.36).

<P>Data from 6 studies (433 participants) were available for long-term changes in eczema severity. However, data from only 2 of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Weston-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sistek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sistek 2006</LINK>) comprising of 102 participants could be pooled due to differences or insufficient reporting of data. These two trials reported SCORAD scores at four weeks and eight weeks after cessation of study treatment respectively. A pooled analysis of the data (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) showed a significant improvement in the participant-/parent-rated symptom score in favour of probiotic treatment (MD -2.27 95%CI -3.97, -0.58 points on SCORAD part C). One of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Weston-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 2005</LINK>) also reported a dichotomised global assessment by parents after cessation of probiotic treatment, however no significant long-term difference in the risk of worsened or unchanged eczema was seen between the probiotic and placebo interventions (OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.21, 1.88; data not presented).</P>
<P>The other 4 studies comprised of 331 participants, and none of the individual studies demonstrated a significant difference in outcomes between probiotic and placebo treatments. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Majamaa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Majamaa 1997</LINK>) presented in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> reported median SCORAD scores of 16 (Interquartile range (IQR) 6 to 25) in probiotic-treated infants, and 14 (IQR 2 to 38) in placebo-treated infants 1 month after ceasing the study intervention with no statistical analysis presented. A second study (<LINK REF="STD-Isolauri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Isolauri 2000</LINK>) reported median SCORAD scores of 0 in all active and placebo treated groups at 6 month follow-up, however the duration of study interventions is not clear in this study. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Viljanen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Viljanen 2005</LINK>) reported mean changes in SCORAD score four weeks after the study interventions had ceased. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG)-treated infants had a mean reduction of 22.9 points, Probiotic Mix-treated infants 20.4 points and placebo treated infants 20.3 points, with no statistically significant difference between treatment groups at this time point. Finally one study (<LINK REF="STD-Folster_x002d_Holst-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Folster-Holst 2006</LINK>) reported mean SCORAD scores 4 weeks after the study interventions had ceased - probiotic treated participants had a mean score of 32.8, versus 30.1 for placebo.</P>

Pooled analysis of the data from these studies (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) showed no significant difference between probiotic and control treatment, with a mean difference of -2.46 points (95% CI -7.45, 2.53) in favour of probiotic treatment. We detected extreme levels of heterogeneity between the trials (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 75.8%), which seemed to be related to parallel group trials (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 73.1%), in particular the <LINK REF="STD-Weston-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sistek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sistek 2006</LINK> trials. The reasons for this heterogeneity were not clear, but possibilities include the higher methodological quality of these two studies, their Australasian setting or their small sample sizes. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Sistek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sistek 2006</LINK>) there were significant baseline differences in eczema severity between placebo and probiotic treated groups which might have accounted for the increased difference in end of treatment SCORAD scores. To explore this we performed a sensitivity analysis using change scores ie the difference in SCORAD score between the start and end of treatment for each individual. These data were available for 5 studies with 439 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenfeldt-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenfeldt 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Viljanen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Viljanen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weston-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Passeron-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Passeron 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sistek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sistek 2006</LINK>) and are presented in <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>. The data show a mean difference in SCORAD change of -2.47 points (95% CI -4.72, -0.21; p = 0.03) in favour of probiotic treatment, with no significant heterogeneity between the trials (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%).</P>
<P>Data from the other studies for this outcome measure could not be pooled. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Taniuchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Taniuchi 2005</LINK>) showed a significant reduction in symptom scores from baseline in both probiotic and placebo groups, but the authors did not present any statistical comparison between the two groups. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Majamaa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Majamaa 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Isolauri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Isolauri 2000</LINK>) reported their assessments as median scores with an interquartile range (shown in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>) - Isolauri reported a statistically significant difference between end of treatment SCORAD for probiotic versus placebo groups, whereas Majamaa did not. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2006</LINK>) used a modified SCORAD score (SCORAD parts A/B only) and found no significant difference between probiotic and control treatments. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Kirjavainen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kirjavainen 2003</LINK>) reported mean total SCORAD score at the end of treatment (eight in the placebo and five in the probiotic group) without statistical analysis of this difference; additionally, the duration of active treatment varied greatly between participants in this study. The <LINK REF="STD-Passeron-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Passeron 2006</LINK> trial reported an investigator's global assessment scale of eczema improvement at the end of treatment for 39 participants; however no significant difference in the risk of worse, unchanged or midly improved eczema was seen between probiotic and placebo treatments (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.07, 2.38; data not presented).</P>

In the analysis of SCORAD part C scores, there was heterogeneity attributable to one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gruber-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gruber 2007</LINK>) which assessed children under 2 years of age. However in no age group was there a significant difference in symptom scores between probiotic and control treatments (age under 2 years MD -0.13 95%CI -4.18, 3.91; age 2-12 years MD 0.33 95%CI -1.94 2.60 <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). Global disease severity scores showed no significant heterogeneity according to age stratification (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).We also stratified total SCORAD scores by age group and pooled data for a total of seven trials (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). We detected high levels of heterogeneity in two of the three sub-categories created for the age groups (age under 2 years, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 69.9%; age not categorised, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 77.7%).

Three studies reported global assessments of disease improvement during treatment by parents or participants - pooled dichotomised data from these studies do not support the hypothesis that probiotic treatment leads to an improvement in eczema severity, again with significant heterogeneity between studies. Two studies reported quality of life data (<LINK REF="STD-Weston-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Folster_x002d_Holst-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Folster-Holst 2006</LINK>), and suggest that probiotic treatment does not improve the quality of life of eczema sufferers.</P>
<P>There was evidence from two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Weston-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sistek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sistek 2006</LINK>) that probiotic treatment leads to a small reduction in SCORAD part C eczema symptom score during the period after treatment has ceased. This finding was not supported by the data from four other studies that could not be pooled (<LINK REF="STD-Majamaa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Majamaa 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Isolauri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Isolauri 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Viljanen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Viljanen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Folster_x002d_Holst-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Folster-Holst 2006</LINK>). Furthermore four other studies found that (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenfeldt-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenfeldt 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weston-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Folster_x002d_Holst-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Folster-Holst 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gruber-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gruber 2007</LINK>) probiotic treatment did not reduce the need for other eczema treatment such as topical corticosteroids.</P>
<P>All studies reported at least one investigator-assessed or composite eczema severity score. The data from five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Majamaa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Majamaa 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Isolauri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Isolauri 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kirjavainen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kirjavainen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taniuchi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Taniuchi 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2006</LINK>) could not be pooled, but individually showed no change in eczema severity with probiotic treatment. A meta-analysis of data from the seven remaining studies also showed no change in eczema severity with probiotic treatment. We found significant heterogeneity in this meta-analysis, which was accounted for by three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenfeldt-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenfeldt 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weston-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sistek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sistek 2006</LINK>) reporting greater benefit in favour of probiotic treatment. One of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sistek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sistek 2006</LINK>) had a significant imbalance in disease severity between treatment groups at baseline. We therefore performed the same meta-analysis using change scores rather than end-of-treatment scores - two of the seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Folster_x002d_Holst-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Folster-Holst 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gruber-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Gruber 2007</LINK>) could not be included in this meta-analysis due to insufficient data. The pooled analysis showed a mean difference in SCORAD change of -2.47 points (95% CI -4.72, -0.21; p = 0.03) in favour of probiotic treated participants. No study reported changes in school or work absenteeism due to illness.</P>
<P>We undertook subgroup analyses as per the study protocol, with an additional subgroup analysis according to probiotic strain used. We found no subgroup-specific effects when we analysed the data by age of study population, by the presence of atopy or food allergy in the study population or by disease severity. There were no data available for the planned subgroup analyses of antibiotic exposure or intestinal inflammation. The analysis by probiotic strain used showed a SCORAD score 3.37 points (95% CI 0.55, 6.20; p = 0.02) higher in participants treated with the probiotic LGG compared to placebo. The end of treatment SCORAD score was 7.64 points (95% CI 3.62, 11.65; p &lt; 0.01) lower in participants treated with other <I>Lactobacillus</I> strains compared to placebo. Although this was a post-hoc analysis the results suggest that some probiotic strains may be more effective than others in treating eczema, and this confirms previous data showing that different probiotic strains have different effects on clinical outcomes and immune responses (<LINK REF="REF-Christensen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Allen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2003</LINK>). The implication of this is that novel probiotic strains which have not yet been studied for the treatment of eczema may have significant effects.</P>
<P>Four trials reported adverse events, with no significant difference between probiotic and placebo groups. We identified a number of case reports describing the development of bacterial or fungal sepsis and bowel ischaemia related to probiotic use.</P>
<P>The adverse events search revealed four case reports of sepsis related to probiotic use (<LINK REF="REF-Lestin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lestin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Riquelme-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riquelme 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cherifi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherifi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Groote-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Groote 2005</LINK>), including one death (<LINK REF="REF-Lestin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lestin 2003</LINK>). The adverse events search also found five reports of human safety assessments using probiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Makelainen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makelainen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Connolly-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connolly 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Srinivasan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Srinivasan 2006</LINK>), and four review articles of probiotic safety (<LINK REF="REF-Salminen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salminen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ishibashi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ishibashi 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Borriello-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borriello 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2006</LINK>). The safety assessments demonstrated no adverse effects of probiotics in humans, but the case reports and review articles documented a total of 42 cases of suspected or proven probiotic sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2006</LINK>). The authors did not definitively identify the probiotic origin of the infective organism in all of these 42 cases, and it was not possible to quantify the risk of such outcomes from the data available. A recent report described an increased risk of fatal bowel ischaemia in critically ill patients treated with one particular combination of probiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Besselink-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Besselink 2008</LINK>). One review proposed some relative contraindications to probiotic use in view of the risk of sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-05-13 11:22:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>The number of studies and number of participants included in primary outcome analyses were small. While there was no evidence found that probiotic treatment changes eczema symptoms, the confidence intervals for the findings are wide and there was significant heterogeneity between studies for the primary outcome of eczema symptoms. A reduction in SCORAD part C score of 2.84 points and an OR of worsening/unchanged eczema of 0.14 both fall within the 95% CI for the primary outcomes. Further studies reporting parent or participant-rated eczema symptoms or global eczema severity would help to clarify whether probiotics have a role in eczema treatment.</P>
<P>The number of studies and participants was greater in secondary outcome analyses, leading to narrower confidence intervals. The pooled data for SCORAD scores at the end of treatment show no significant difference between probiotic and control treatments, and suggest that if probiotic treatment does have a beneficial effect then it is unlikely to reduce end of treatment SCORAD scores by greater than 7.45 points relative to placebo treatment.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>No study evaluated the use of probiotics to treat eczema in adults, nor in adolescents over 13 years age. Only two studies reported quality of life data, and just four studies clearly stated the presence and nature of any adverse events, and the treatment groups in which they occurred.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2008-05-13 11:23:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>The overall quality of studies was mixed, largely due to missing information regarding randomisation procedures, blinding and loss to follow-up. We assessed four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Viljanen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Viljanen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weston-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weston 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Passeron-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Passeron 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sistek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sistek 2006</LINK>) as being of high quality. In one of these (<LINK REF="STD-Sistek-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sistek 2006</LINK>) there was a chance imbalance in disease severity at baseline.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-05-13 11:23:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>The analyses of SCORAD change scores was a post-hoc analysis, justified by the imbalance in treatment severity at baseline in one included study. Any conclusions based on these data must therefore be guarded. The subgroup analysis by probiotic strain used was not predefined in the study protocol, and we undertook this due to the observation that seven studies used the same probiotic strain. The analysis suggests that some probiotic strains may be more effective than others for the treatment of eczema, however conclusions based on this post-hoc analysis must also be guarded.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2008-05-13 11:23:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>The data summarised in this review suggest that probiotics are ineffective for the treatment of eczema. Previous studies found an association between the composition of the intestinal microbiota and eczema (<LINK REF="REF-Bjorksten-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjorksten 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kalliomaki-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalliomaki 2001</LINK>), and increased gastrointestinal symptoms in children with eczema (<LINK REF="REF-Caffarelli-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caffarelli 1998</LINK>). These previous studies suggest that either the composition of the intestinal microbiota is important in the pathophysiology of eczema, or that intestinal mucosal abnormalities associated with eczema lead to secondary changes in the resident intestinal microbiota. There is evidence that probiotics can lower the increased intestinal permeability associated with eczema (<LINK REF="STD-Rosenfeldt-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenfeldt 2004</LINK>), and some studies suggest that the use of probiotics or prebiotics during early infancy may prevent the development of eczema (<LINK REF="STD-Kalliomaki-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kalliomaki 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moro-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moro 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kukkonen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kukkonen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2007</LINK>). Probiotics may be therefore be ineffective for treating eczema because the decrease in intestinal permeability associated with their use is insufficient to lead to the resolution of established disease.</P>
</AGREEMENT>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-05-13 11:24:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>The data suggest that probiotics are not an effective treatment for eczema symptoms and are not effective at overall control of eczema. This conclusion is based on analysis of small numbers of participants, and a significant benefit cannot be confidently excluded. However analysis of composite severity score (SCORAD) data suggests that any reduction in eczema severity from probiotic treatment is likely to be modest (less than 7.45 points on the total SCORAD score) and therefore unlikely to be clinically significant. Probiotic treatment is generally safe, however it can lead to adverse events including sepsis and bowel ischaemia - the precise risk of such events is difficult to quantify, but is likely to be very low for most people.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-13 11:24:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Finola M Delamere">
<P>Future studies should stratify the randomisation of participants by eczema severity, in order to avoid baseline imbalances between treatment groups. Future studies should also report parent- or participant-rated symptoms or global assessments of disease control, and should publish quality of life scores such as the Dermatitis Family Impact Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Lawson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawson 1998</LINK>). Thorough reporting of adverse events is needed in future probiotic studies. Further probiotic eczema treatment studies would help to clarify whether specific probiotic strains have a greater effect on eczema severity and symptoms than the strains studied to date, and might evaluate their efficacy in adolescent/adult populations.</P>

<P>We changed the title which was Probiotics for atopic eczema in the protocol to Probiotics for treating eczema on the advice of the referees.</P>
<P>We have made small changes to the Background on the advice of the referees.</P>
<P>We made small changes to the 'Criteria for considering studies for the review' to clarify issues</P>
<P>Data extraction was completed by RB and FB in the review, in place of RB and MT in the protocol due to time availability. </P>
<P>Dichotomous outcome data have been reported as OR in the review, and RR were planned in the protocol. This was due to the inclusion of a cross-over trial in the review. It is not possible to pool the data from cross-over and parallel group trials using the inverse generic variance method with RR, therefore OR have been used throughout this review to maximise the available data for meta-analyses, and for consistency of interpretation. </P>
<P>Finally an extra subgroup analysis was undertaken in the review which had not been specified in the protocol - outcome data were analysed according to the probiotic strain used <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>. This analysis was undertaken due the unexplained heterogeneity between studies for primary and secondary outcomes, and the use of the same probiotic strain in several studies. As discussed above, conclusions from this analysis must be guarded due to its post-hoc nature.</P>
