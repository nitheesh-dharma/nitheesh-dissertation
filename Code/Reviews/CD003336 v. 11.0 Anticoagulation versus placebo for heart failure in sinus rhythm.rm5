<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-03-19 09:46:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Blood clots (thromboembolism) in the lungs, legs and brain (ischaemic stroke) contribute to disability and the death of patients with heart failure. Although anticoagulants such as warfarin are of proven benefit in patients in certain subgroups of patients with heart failure, such as those with atrial fibrillation, there is little evidence that warfarin works well in the wider heart failure population. There may also be serious side effects such as bleeding (causing ulcers and haemorrhagic stroke). At present there are no data to recommend the routine use of anticoagulants to prevent thromboembolism in patients with heart failure who are in normal heart rhythm.</P>

<P>Patients with chronic heart failure (heart failure) are at risk of thromboembolic events, including stroke, pulmonary embolism and peripheral arterial embolism, whilst coronary ischaemic events also contribute to the progression of heart failure. Long-term oral anticoagulation is established in certain patient groups, including patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation, but there is wide variation in the indications and use of oral anticoagulation in the broader heart failure population.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-03-26 10:53:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We updated the searches in June 2030 in the electronic databases CENTRAL (Issue 6, 2013) in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE (OVID, 1946 to June week 1 2013) and EMBASE (OVID, 1980 to 2013 week 23). Reference lists of papers and abstracts from national and international cardiovascular meetings were studied to identify unpublished studies. Relevant authors were contacted to obtain further data.

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-03-19 09:48:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral anticoagulants with placebo in adults with heart failure, and with treatment duration at least one month. Non-randomised studies were also included for assessing side effects. Inclusion decisions were made in duplicate and any disagreement between review authors was resolved by discussion or a third party.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-03-28 10:52:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed the risks and benefits of antithrombotic therapy using relative measures of effects, such as odds ratio, accompanied by the 95% confidence intervals.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-19 09:41:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two RCTs were identified. One compared warfarin, aspirin and no antithrombotic therapy and the second compared warfarin with placebo in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Three small prospective controlled studies of warfarin in heart failure were also identified, but they were over 50 years old with methods not considered reliable by modern standards. In both <A HREF="WASH 2004">WASH 2004 </A>and <A HREF="HELAS 2006">HELAS 2006</A>, there were no significant differences in the incidence of myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and death between patients taking oral anticoagulation and those taking placebo. Four retrospective non-randomised cohort analyses and four observational studies of oral anticoagulation in heart failure included differing populations of heart failure patients and reported contradictory results.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-03-19 09:43:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on the two major randomised trials (<A HREF="HELAS 2006">HELAS 2006</A>; <A HREF="WASH 2004">WASH 2004</A>), there is no convincing evidence that oral anticoagulant therapy modifies mortality or vascular events in patients with heart failure and sinus rhythm. Although oral anticoagulation is indicated in certain groups of patients with heart failure (for example those with atrial fibrillation), the available data does not support the routine use of anticoagulation in heart failure patients who remain in sinus rhythm.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-03-19 09:56:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic heart failure (heart failure) is an increasing clinical and social problem. It is associated with high morbidity rates and annual mortality rates of greater than 30% in patients with severe symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-CONSENSUS-1987" TYPE="STUDY">CONSENSUS 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Heart failure has long been recognised to predispose individuals to stroke and thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism and peripheral arterial embolism. These thromboembolic events contribute to the high morbidity in heart failure (<LINK REF="STD-Fuster-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Fuster 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kyrle-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kyrle 1985</LINK>). In addition, ischaemic and thromboembolic events, particularly stroke, myocardial ischaemia and myocardial infarction, contribute to the high hospital admission rates of these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1998</LINK>). The incidence of ischaemic and thromboembolic events, and the risk factors associated with a high thromboembolic risk, have been addressed in numerous small and large scale studies, although the reported incidence of these events appears to vary between studies, depending on the study methodologies and populations. Nevertheless, as an example, mild to moderate heart failure appears to be associated with an annual stroke risk of approximately 1.5% (<LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_HeFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">V-HeFT 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SOLVD-1998" TYPE="STUDY">SOLVD 1998</LINK>) compared with an annual stroke risk in the general population of less than 0.5%, whilst the annual risk of stroke increases to almost 4% in patients with severe heart failure (<LINK REF="STD-CONSENSUS-1987" TYPE="STUDY">CONSENSUS 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROMISE-1993" TYPE="STUDY">PROMISE 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is evidence of benefit from long-term oral anticoagulation in certain groups of patients as oral anticoagulation has been proven to be extremely effective in reducing stroke and other embolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure (<LINK REF="REF-BAATAF-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">BAATAF 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petersen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SPAF-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">SPAF 1991</LINK>), but the role of anticoagulation in the broader heart failure population is less well established. Indeed, there is wide variation in the use of oral anticoagulants in patients with heart failure (<LINK REF="REF-Edep-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edep 1997</LINK>). In addition, although oral anticoagulation has been associated with a reduction in the number of thromboembolic events in various cardiovascular disease states, the potential risks of bleeding must also be considered. Importantly, the control of anticoagulation is reported to be more difficult, and bleeding complications more frequent, in heart failure (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Husted-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Husted 1976</LINK>) as a result of hepatic congestion and potential drug interactions which occur in these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Landefeld-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landefeld 1989</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Updating this review</HEADING>
<P>Over the course of the original review and updates, five authors (GYHL, IC, BJW, RP and ES) reviewed the inclusion criteria, the search strategies, the methodology criteria and methods for pooling the data for this systematic review.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Trial selection and data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Over the course of the original review and updates, five authors (GYHL, IC, BJW, RP, ES) independently selected suitable trials for inclusion in the review. We identified RCTs that compared the use of oral anticoagulation to placebo for the thrombo-prophylactic management of patients with heart failure and subsequently extracted data on patient characteristics and concomitant treatments as well as data relating to study eligibility, quality and outcomes. We extracted data from non-randomised studies in order to assess possible side effects of anticoagulants.<BR/>
</P>
<P>We expressed the dichotomous data on outcomes as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity appropriately in each meta-analysis using the T, I and &#935; statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if I was greater than 30% and either T was greater than zero or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the &#935; test for heterogeneity. If we identified substantial heterogeneity, we investigated it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We considered whether an overall summary was meaningful, and if it was we used a random-effects meta-analysis to produce it. We conducted sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of trial quality for each comparison by restricting the analyses to those trials rated as 'low risk of bias' for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. For each comparison, we limited the analyses to the primary outcomes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Using the guidelines in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) we assessed six aspects to determine the trial's risk of bias: randomization sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, blinding of participants and personnel, and blinding of outcome assessment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Contacting authors</HEADING>
<P>For unpublished studies or where data were incomplete in published papers, attempts were made to contact authors or researchers to obtain further details. Where relevant, the pharmaceutical industry was contacted to attempt to obtain unpublished trial data on newer antiplatelet drugs that may have been used in patients with heart failure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Resolution of differences</HEADING>
<P>In the rare instances where the four authors disagreed over the grading and inclusion of studies, recourse was made to a fifth author.

<P>The previous searches in 2001 and 2005 retrieved 1100 records of which 1082 were excluded based on the screening of titles and abstracts. The remaining 18 records were assessed in full text. Four studies (four records) were found that met the inclusion criteria. Eleven studies (11 records) were excluded and three studies were ongoing.</P>
<P>The updated search in 2010 retrieved 1219 records of which 1201 were excluded based on screening the titles and abstracts. Eighteen records were obtained in full text. Based on the full texts, one previously ongoing study was included (<LINK REF="STD-HELAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">HELAS 2006</LINK>) and another previously ongoing study was excluded (<LINK REF="STD-WATCH-2009" TYPE="STUDY">WATCH 2009</LINK>). Sixteen studies (16 references) were excluded and one study (WARCEF) remained ongoing.</P>
<P>The updated search in 2013 retrieved 1460 new records of which 1452 were excluded based on screening the titles and abstracts. Four records were abstracts of interest based on two retrospective analyses. However, they did not specify the proportion of patients with atrial fibrillation nor provide information on adverse outcomes and they were thus excluded. Four records were obtained in full text but did not meet the analysis criteria. The completed Warfarin versus Aspirin in Reduced Cardiac Ejection Fraction (<LINK REF="STD-WARCEF-2012" TYPE="STUDY">WARCEF 2012</LINK>) trial compared warfarin to aspirin and thus did not meet the inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>In total this review includes five studies (five references) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mean age of the predominantly male (65%) and Caucasian population of 1266 patients with heart failure was 59.9 years (range 20 to 89 years). The two latest studies (<LINK REF="STD-HELAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">HELAS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WASH-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WASH 2004</LINK>) (WASH and HELAS) exclusively or predominantly involved European countries whereas the three older studies (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1950</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffith-1952" TYPE="STUDY">Griffith 1952</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1950</LINK>) were carried out in the USA.

<P>We included five studies. <LINK REF="STD-WASH-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WASH 2004</LINK> randomised 89 patients to receive oral anticoagulation with warfarin and 99 patients to no antithrombotic therapy. <LINK REF="STD-HELAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">HELAS 2006</LINK> randomised 82 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy to receive either warfarin (38 patients) or placebo (44 patients). Three small prospective controlled studies of warfarin versus control in hospitalised patients with heart failure were identified (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1950</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffith-1952" TYPE="STUDY">Griffith 1952</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1950</LINK>). It would be difficult to describe these as true RCTs by modern criteria but they were considered to be randomised and controlled when they were published.</P>
<P>Two randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-HELAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">HELAS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WASH-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WASH 2004</LINK>) met our trial selection criteria. <LINK REF="STD-WASH-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WASH 2004</LINK> was a pilot study of 279 patients with heart failure randomised to anticoagulation (target international normalized ratio (INR) 2.5), aspirin (300 mg) or no antithrombotic therapy. This was an open label trial design and performance bias could therefore not be excluded (see 'Risk of bias' table). <LINK REF="STD-HELAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">HELAS 2006</LINK> was a study of 115 patients with ischaemic heart disease randomised to anticoagulation (target INR 2.0 to 3.0) or aspirin, and a group of 82 patients randomised to anticoagulation (target INR 2.0 to 3.0) or placebo. This was a double-blind trial with an independent data and safety monitoring committee.</P>
<P>The earlier prospective controlled studies (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1950</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffith-1952" TYPE="STUDY">Griffith 1952</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1950</LINK>) were performed over 50 years ago in hospitalised patients with a high prevalence of rheumatic heart disease and atrial fibrillation. Although described as 'randomised', the trial methodologies in these studies are more properly described as quasi-randomised and cannot be seen as entirely reliable by modern standards. Allocation of patients to anticoagulation or control in these studies may be biased. Patients with heart failure in the <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1950</LINK> study (n = 180) were allocated to dicumarol or control depending on whether their hospital admission was on an even or odd day. In the <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1950</LINK> study (n = 297) the first 61 patients were alternatively allocated to treated and control groups, and for the rest the treated and control groups were alternated weekly between different medical units and rotated between the wards. Thus there was patient alternation, service alternation and ward rotation in allotting patients to anticoagulation or control. In the <LINK REF="STD-Griffith-1952" TYPE="STUDY">Griffith 1952</LINK> study (n = 465), during the first year of this study all admitted patients with heart failure were serially allocated to control, dicumarol or depo-heparin; although in the second year of the study all patients 'on certain designated wards' were used as controls whilst others were assigned anticoagulants.</P>
<P>Anticoagulation monitoring in the older studies was performed using prothrombin activity but was variable in the different studies: 30% by Quick's method (<LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1950</LINK>), 10% to 30% by an unstated method (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1950</LINK>), and 20% by variable methods (<LINK REF="STD-Griffith-1952" TYPE="STUDY">Griffith 1952</LINK>).</P>
<P>In summary, we can distinguish three kinds of study investigating anticoagulation for heart failure in sinus rhythm:<BR/>a) RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-HELAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">HELAS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WASH-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WASH 2004</LINK>);<BR/>b) older quasi-randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1950</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffith-1952" TYPE="STUDY">Griffith 1952</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1950</LINK>);<BR/>c) non-randomised observational studies and post hoc analyses of the effects of warfarin in non-randomised comparisons, including from large trials of ACE inhibitors in heart failure (<LINK REF="STD-CONSENSUS-1987" TYPE="STUDY">CONSENSUS 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EPICAL-2002" TYPE="STUDY">EPICAL 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuster-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Fuster 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kyrle-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kyrle 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Natterson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Natterson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROMISE-1993" TYPE="STUDY">PROMISE 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SAVE-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SAVE 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SOLVD-1998" TYPE="STUDY">SOLVD 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_HeFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">V-HeFT 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wishart--1948" TYPE="STUDY">Wishart 1948</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Excluded studies</HEADING>
<P>We excluded 13 studies (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). Four observational studies were excluded but were assessed for possible adverse effects from treatment with warfarin (<LINK REF="STD-EPICAL-2002" TYPE="STUDY">EPICAL 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fuster-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Fuster 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kyrle-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kyrle 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Natterson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Natterson 1993</LINK>). Adverse event information is presented in the discussion. <LINK REF="STD-Fuster-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Fuster 1981</LINK> was a retrospective study of 104 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy followed up for a total of 725 patient-years. <LINK REF="STD-Kyrle-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kyrle 1985</LINK> was a study of 38 patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy followed for a total of 72 patient-years. <LINK REF="STD-Natterson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Natterson 1993</LINK> was a more recent study of 224 patients awaiting cardiac transplantation. <LINK REF="STD-EPICAL-2002" TYPE="STUDY">EPICAL 2002</LINK> was a study of 417 patients with an average follow-up period of five years. <LINK REF="STD-EPICAL-2002" TYPE="STUDY">EPICAL 2002</LINK> was eventually excluded as 24% had concomitant atrial fibrillation. Only survival was reported and event rates were not reported separately for the sinus rhythm group or those treated with aspirin, warfarin or no therapy. Aspirin was used in 31% of patients, warfarin in 28% of patients, and warfarin plus aspirin in 2% of patients. Patients given any antithrombotic treatment compared to none had a better survival at five years (40.4% versus 31%, P = 0.01).</P>
<P>One case series, conducted over 50 years ago in an heterogeneous heart failure population (n = 61), was excluded but it did report that the prevalence of thromboembolism on dicumarol (6.5%) was lower compared to previously published reports (22%) (<LINK REF="STD-Wishart--1948" TYPE="STUDY">Wishart 1948</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five publications from RCTs were excluded because the participants in the analyses were not randomised to anticoagulant or control in the original study (<LINK REF="STD-CONSENSUS-1987" TYPE="STUDY">CONSENSUS 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PROMISE-1993" TYPE="STUDY">PROMISE 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SAVE-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SAVE 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SOLVD-1998" TYPE="STUDY">SOLVD 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_HeFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">V-HeFT 1993</LINK>). The analyses were post hoc analyses of participants treated with oral anticoagulation at the discretion of the investigators. The <LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_HeFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">V-HeFT 1993</LINK> trials included patients with symptomatic heart failure with radiological, echocardiographic or radionuclide evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (<LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_HeFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">V-HeFT 1993</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-SOLVD-1998" TYPE="STUDY">SOLVD 1998</LINK> trials included patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.35 or more, who were symptomatic and enrolled into the treatment trial (<LINK REF="STD-SOLVD-1998" TYPE="STUDY">SOLVD 1998</LINK>-treatment) or asymptomatic and enrolled into the prevention trial (<LINK REF="STD-SOLVD-1998" TYPE="STUDY">SOLVD 1998</LINK>). Limited information from a retrospective analysis of one trial has been presented in abstract form only (<LINK REF="STD-PROMISE-1993" TYPE="STUDY">PROMISE 1993</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-SAVE-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SAVE 1997</LINK> study included patients post-myocardial infarction with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or more and no overt heart failure, that is, asymptomatic patients. One further study (<LINK REF="STD-Visser-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Visser 2004</LINK>) was a cohort study of people attending an outpatient anticoagulation clinic for a variety of comorbidities. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-WARCEF-2012" TYPE="STUDY">WARCEF 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-WATCH-2009" TYPE="STUDY">WATCH 2009</LINK>) were excluded as the control group received aspirin or clopidogrel, but not placebo.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Evidence from randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials</HEADING>
<P>There have been five prospective controlled studies of oral anticoagulation in patients with heart failure (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1950</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffith-1952" TYPE="STUDY">Griffith 1952</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HELAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">HELAS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1950</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WASH-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WASH 2004</LINK>). Three of these studies were performed over 50 years ago in hospitalised patients with a high prevalence (up to 30%) of rheumatic disease and atrial fibrillation. The methods of randomisation used were open to bias and methods used to monitor the patients and determine patient inclusion and exclusion cannot be seen as reliable by modern standards.</P>
<P>Patient outcomes in the control arm of the WASH study were better (fewer deaths, cardiovascular events and adverse events such as bleeding) than for patients given active treatment with warfarin in the older, quasi-randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1950</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffith-1952" TYPE="STUDY">Griffith 1952</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1950</LINK>). This reflects changes both in the contemporary management of heart failure and in biases likely to be found in the older quasi-randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1950</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Griffith-1952" TYPE="STUDY">Griffith 1952</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1950" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1950</LINK>) compared to the more modern design of <LINK REF="STD-WASH-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WASH 2004</LINK>.</P>
<P>The results from the only two randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-HELAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">HELAS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WASH-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WASH 2004</LINK>) showed that the primary outcomes (mortality and cardiovascular events) were not affected by oral anticoagulation when compared to placebo. Therefore, these two studies do not support the routine use of oral anticoagulation therapy for patients with heart failure in sinus rhythm.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse event data from non-randomised studies</HEADING>
<P>Four observational studies and four large scale non-randomised cohort analyses of oral anticoagulation in heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction were also assessed.

There was no record of bleeding complications in the EPICAL study (<LINK REF="STD-EPICAL-2002" TYPE="STUDY">EPICAL 2002</LINK>). No report of bleeding complications was made in the four large scale non-randomised cohort analyses as these studies were originally designed to assess the value of ACE inhibitors and not antithrombotic therapy use per se (<LINK REF="STD-PROMISE-1993" TYPE="STUDY">PROMISE 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SAVE-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SAVE 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SOLVD-1998" TYPE="STUDY">SOLVD 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_HeFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">V-HeFT 1993</LINK>).</P>

<I>Post hoc, non-randomised comparisons from large trials on heart failure</I>
</HEADING>
<P>The largest post hoc trial analysis included a high proportion of patients with ischaemic heart disease as the cause of left ventricular dysfunction. In this analysis warfarin therapy was associated with a significantly lower risk of all cardiovascular and sudden deaths (<LINK REF="STD-SOLVD-1998" TYPE="STUDY">SOLVD 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a multivariate analysis, the point estimate for the overall risk reduction of sudden death was 32% for warfarin when compared to 25% for beta-blockers, 24% for aspirin, and 11% for enalapril. In addition, multivariate analysis in patients considered to have non-ischaemic heart failure also demonstrated a 70% risk reduction (<LINK REF="STD-SOLVD-1998" TYPE="STUDY">SOLVD 1998</LINK>). Similarly, observations in <LINK REF="STD-CONSENSUS-1987" TYPE="STUDY">CONSENSUS 1987</LINK> suggested that (non-randomised) long-term anticoagulation with warfarin was associated with a 40% lower mortality (<LINK REF="STD-CONSENSUS-1987" TYPE="STUDY">CONSENSUS 1987</LINK>). Interestingly, 75% of the deaths in <LINK REF="STD-CONSENSUS-1987" TYPE="STUDY">CONSENSUS 1987</LINK> were classified as due to progressive heart failure.</P>
<P>The Vasodilator Heart Failure Studies (<LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_HeFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">V-HeFT 1993</LINK>) also provided detailed observational data regarding the effects of long-term oral anticoagulation (<LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_HeFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">V-HeFT 1993</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_HeFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">V-HeFT 1993</LINK> I, during 1068 patient-years of follow-up without antithrombotic therapy (aspirin or warfarin) there were 21 strokes, four recorded events of pulmonary embolism and four recorded events of peripheral embolism, with an overall incidence of 2.7 events in 100 patient-years. In 208 patient-years of follow-up in patients receiving chronic oral anticoagulation with warfarin there were four strokes, one recorded pulmonary embolism and one recorded peripheral embolism, with an incidence of 2.9 events in 100 patient-years (<LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_HeFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">V-HeFT 1993</LINK>). There was no significant difference in the rates of thromboembolism between patients on long-term warfarin therapy and those not on anticoagulation.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_HeFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">V-HeFT 1993</LINK> II, during 1188 patient-years of follow-up without antithrombotic therapy there were 23 strokes, one pulmonary embolism and one peripheral embolism, with an incidence of 2.1 events in 100 patient-years. In the 247 patient-years of follow-up in patients receiving warfarin there were seven strokes, four pulmonary embolic events and one peripheral embolism, an overall incidence of 4.9 events per 100 patient-years. Interestingly, the difference between the incidence of thromboembolic events in patients with and without warfarin was significantly higher in those receiving warfarin (P = 0.01) (<LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_HeFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">V-HeFT 1993</LINK>). In addition, although data from the <LINK REF="STD-SOLVD-1998" TYPE="STUDY">SOLVD 1998</LINK> trials suggest that anticoagulation was associated with a reduction in sudden cardiovascular deaths and all cause deaths, long-term warfarin was not associated with a reduction in the total number of (fatal and non-fatal) thromboembolic events (<LINK REF="STD-SOLVD-1998" TYPE="STUDY">SOLVD 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Similarly, in the <LINK REF="STD-SAVE-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SAVE 1997</LINK> trial warfarin use was associated with a 81% reduction in stroke risk (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.27), but no direct comparison against aspirin (56% reduction) was made. One retrospective analysis of limited data from the <LINK REF="STD-PROMISE-1993" TYPE="STUDY">PROMISE 1993</LINK> trial found that warfarin was used in 324 patients with a significant reduction in stroke in only those who had very severe heart failure (ejection fraction &#8805; 20%, 0.6% versus 3.3% in the controls, P &lt; 0.05).</P>

<I>Observational studies </I>
</HEADING>
<P>Of the observational studies, the first was a retrospective study of 104 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, followed-up for a total of 725 patient-years. This study observed an 18% incidence of thromboembolic events (including those demonstrated at post-mortem) in patients who were not receiving chronic oral anticoagulation (624 patient-years with an estimated annual incidence of 3.5%) although no events were recorded in those who were anticoagulated (101 patient-years) (<LINK REF="STD-Fuster-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Fuster 1981</LINK>). In the second, a study of 38 patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy who were followed for a total of 72 patient-years, the estimated incidence of thromboembolic events was 45 per 100 patient-years in patients not receiving oral anticoagulation while no events were recorded in patients who were anticoagulated (<LINK REF="STD-Kyrle-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kyrle 1985</LINK>). In contrast, a third more recent study of 224 patients awaiting cardiac transplantation reported an annual incidence of thromboembolism of 3.2% and failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the rate of thromboembolism in the 37% of patients receiving (non-randomised) warfarin therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Natterson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Natterson 1993</LINK>). The latter study reported an actual one year survival for patients receiving warfarin of 78% compared with 86% for patients not receiving warfarin (P = 0.30).</P>
<P>Importantly the positive early small studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fuster-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Fuster 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kyrle-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kyrle 1985</LINK>), which suggested an overall benefit from oral anticoagulation, were limited to patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy whilst approximately half of the patients in both <LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_HeFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">V-HeFT 1993</LINK> studies and 70% to 80% of those in <LINK REF="STD-SOLVD-1998" TYPE="STUDY">SOLVD 1998</LINK> had definite coronary artery disease. The patient groups also differed in severity of heart failure. For example, in the <LINK REF="STD-PROMISE-1993" TYPE="STUDY">PROMISE 1993</LINK> study (<LINK REF="STD-PROMISE-1993" TYPE="STUDY">PROMISE 1993</LINK>) the etiology of heart failure (ischaemic versus non-ischaemic) did not predict stroke risk. In <LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_HeFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">V-HeFT 1993</LINK>, patients were New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III (mean LVEF = 30%) (<LINK REF="STD-V_x002d_HeFT-1993" TYPE="STUDY">V-HeFT 1993</LINK>), whilst in the <LINK REF="STD-SOLVD-1998" TYPE="STUDY">SOLVD 1998</LINK> prevention trial over 99% had NYHA class I or II but in the treatment trial two-thirds had NYHA class I or II (<LINK REF="STD-SOLVD-1998" TYPE="STUDY">SOLVD 1998</LINK>). Of note, the <LINK REF="STD-EPICAL-2002" TYPE="STUDY">EPICAL 2002</LINK> study (<LINK REF="STD-EPICAL-2002" TYPE="STUDY">EPICAL 2002</LINK>) found that all of the 417 patients with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 22%, NYHA class III or IV, 45% of ischaemic origin demonstrated a significant reduction in thromboembolic events. It is, therefore, possible that the efficacy of oral anticoagulation may differ according to the cause of heart failure, as patients with idiopathic cardiomyopathy may have a greater risk of cardiogenic thromboembolism whilst patients with atherosclerosis are also at risk of other vascular events including in situ coronary artery thrombosis. The <LINK REF="STD-PROMISE-1993" TYPE="STUDY">PROMISE 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-EPICAL-2002" TYPE="STUDY">EPICAL 2002</LINK> studies suggested that anticoagulation with warfarin was beneficial in patients with severe heart failure, in particular those with NYHA class III or IV.</P>
<P>Clearly, substantial problems exist in interpreting data from non-randomised studies. Indeed, these four large scale non-randomised cohort analyses and four observational studies of oral anticoagulation in heart failure included differing populations of heart failure patients (including asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction) and reported contradictory results. Nevertheless, it is important to note that data from the <LINK REF="STD-SOLVD-1998" TYPE="STUDY">SOLVD 1998</LINK> and VeHeFT studies were observational, without randomisation or a control with respect to oral anticoagulation. The decision to treat with warfarin was made by the study investigator, whilst the target INR, the average degree of anticoagulation, and the INR at the time of thromboembolic events were not reported in either of these studies. The diagnosis of peripheral and pulmonary embolism and stroke was made by participating investigators rather than according to the study protocol. In addition, the interpretation of these data are potentially confounded as it is possible that patients who were considered to be at the highest risk of thromboembolism were treated with warfarin and that this substantially reduced the long-term risk of thromboembolic events in these patients.</P>
<P>In conclusion, although oral anticoagulation is indicated in certain groups of patients with heart failure (for example those with atrial fibrillation), the present (limited) data does not support its routine use in heart failure patients who remain in sinus rhythm, although full data from a modern randomised trial of warfarin in heart failure patients in sinus rhythm are awaited (<LINK REF="STD-WARCEF-2012" TYPE="STUDY">WARCEF 2012</LINK>).</P>

<P>As anticoagulation therapy is itself not without risk, clinicians contemplating antithrombotic therapy for prophylaxis against stroke and thromboembolic events in patients with heart failure have to balance the benefit of risk reduction against the risks of potentiating haemorrhage with warfarin therapy. Data from large, randomised controlled trials are lacking but the two existing small randomised studies (<LINK REF="STD-HELAS-2006" TYPE="STUDY">HELAS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WASH-2004" TYPE="STUDY">WASH 2004</LINK>) do not support the routine use of oral anticoagulation over no therapy.</P>
<P>Based on current evidence, patients with heart failure with poor cardiac function or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation and a protruding, mobile left ventricular thrombus on cardiac imaging are probably at highest risk and require anticoagulant therapy. If patients are in sinus rhythm, anticoagulants should perhaps be reserved especially for patients with severe cardiac impairment, the presence of intracardiac thrombus, and previous thromboembolism or stroke. Thus, until more evidence becomes available clinical decisions to treat patients with heart failure with anticoagulants must be made on an individual basis, based upon individual benefits and risks.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-03-20 11:04:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The clinical question of comparing anticoagulation with placebo for heart failure in patients in sinus rhythm is now an outdated scope and future research will be directed towards randomised trials comparing antiplatelet agents versus control or anticoagulation. Data from large scale randomised controlled trials in ambulant patients with heart failure are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of anticoagulant therapy and antiplatelet therapy.</P>
