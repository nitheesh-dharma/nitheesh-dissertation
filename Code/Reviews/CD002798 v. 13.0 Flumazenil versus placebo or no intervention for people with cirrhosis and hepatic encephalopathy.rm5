<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>What is hepatic encephalopathy?</I>
</P>
<P>Cirrhosis is a chronic disorder of the liver. People with cirrhosis may develop hepatic encephalopathy, a condition which results in poor brain functioning. In some people, there are obvious clinical features of disturbed brain functioning (overt hepatic encephalopathy); these changes may be short-lived or persist for long periods of time. In other people, there are no obvious clinical changes but some aspects of brain function, such as attention and the ability to perform complex tasks are impaired when tested (minimal hepatic encephalopathy). The reason people develop hepatic encephalopathy is complex but changes in brain neurotransmitters, which are the chemical messengers which allow nerve cells to communicate with one another, may play a role. The neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is responsible for slowing or inhibiting brain activity and is thought to play a particularly important role.</P>
<P>
<I>What is flumazenil?</I>
</P>
<P>Flumazenil is a medicine that acts on one of the GABA receptors in the brain to modify its effects on these specialised cells and so may benefit people with hepatic encephalopathy. It has to be given into a vein (intravenous) and its effects do not last for more than a few hours.</P>
<P>
<B>Review question </B>
</P>
<P>We investigated the use of flumazenil for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis by reviewing clinical trials in which people were randomly allocated to treatment with flumazenil or an inactive dummy/placebo or no specific intervention.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>We searched medical databases and conducted manual searches in May 2017.</P>
<P>
<B>Study funding sources</B>
</P>
<P>Five of the included randomised clinical trials received support from pharmaceutical companies.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 14 randomised clinical trials with 867 participants. All randomised clinical trials compared intravenous infusion of flumazenil versus an inactive placebo (dummy infusion, e.g. a salt solution). The duration of treatment ranged from 10 minutes to 72 hours. Ten randomised clinical trials included participants with overt hepatic encephalopathy; three included participants with minimal hepatic encephalopathy; and one randomised clinical trial included participants with overt or minimal hepatic encephalopathy.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The analyses showed no effect of flumazenil on all-cause mortality (deaths of any cause) compared with placebo. People who received flumazenil were more likely to recover from their hepatic encephalopathy than people given a placebo. We found little information about serious side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Overall, the evidence for the effect of flumazenil on hepatic encephalopathy was of low quality; only one randomised clinical trial included had a low risk of bias.</P>

<P>Hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of cirrhosis which results in poor brain functioning. The spectrum of changes associated with hepatic encephalopathy ranges from the clinically 'indiscernible' or minimal hepatic encephalopathy to the clinically 'obvious' or overt hepatic encephalopathy. Flumazenil is a synthetic benzodiazepine antagonist with high affinity for the central benzodiazepine recognition site. Flumazenil may benefit people with hepatic encephalopathy through an indirect negative allosteric modulatory effect on gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor function. The previous version of this review, which included 13 randomised clinical trials, found no effect of flumazenil on all-cause mortality, based on an analysis of 10 randomised clinical trials, but found a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy, based on an analysis of eight randomised clinical trials.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-05-16 08:22:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of flumazenil versus placebo or no intervention for people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-07-24 13:57:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sarah  Klingenberg">
<P>We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, and LILACS; meeting and conference proceedings; and bibliographies in May 2017.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-07-21 15:32:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised clinical trials regardless of publication status, blinding, or language in the analyses of benefits and harms, and observational studies in the assessment of harms.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-07-24 10:41:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Two review authors extracted data independently. We undertook meta-analyses and presented results using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and I<SUP>2</SUP> values as a marker of heterogeneity. We assessed bias control using the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group domains; determined the quality of the evidence using GRADE; evaluated the risk of small-study effects in regression analyses; and conducted trial sequential, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-09 12:55:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>We identified 14 eligible randomised clinical trials with 867 participants, the majority of whom had an acute episode of overt hepatic encephalopathy. In addition, we identified one ongoing randomised clinical trial. We were unable to gather outcome data from two randomised clinical trials with 25 participants. Thus, our analyses include 842 participants from 12 randomised clinical trials comparing flumazenil versus placebo. We classified one randomised clinical trial at low risk of bias in the overall assessment and the remaining randomised clinical trials at high risk of bias. The duration of follow-up ranged from a few minutes to two weeks, but it was less than one day in the majority of the trials.</P>
<P>In total, 32/433 (7.4%) participants allocated to flumazenil versus 38/409 (9.3%) participants allocated to placebo died (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.16; 11 randomised clinical trials; low quality evidence). The Trial Sequential Analysis and the one randomised clinical trial assessed as low risk of bias (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.53) found no beneficial or harmful effects of flumazenil on all-cause mortality. The methods used to evaluate hepatic encephalopathy included several different clinical scales, electrophysiological variables, and psychometric tests. Flumazenil was associated with a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy when including all randomised clinical trials (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.80; 824 participants; nine randomised clinical trials; low quality evidence), or just the trial at low risk of bias (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.84; 527 participants). The Trial Sequential Analysis supported a beneficial effect of flumazenil on hepatic encephalopathy. The randomised clinical trials included little information about causes of death and little information on non-fatal serious adverse events.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-26 11:32:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>We found low quality evidence suggesting a short-term beneficial effect of flumazenil on hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis, but no evidence of an effect on all-cause mortality. Additional evidence from large, high quality randomised clinical trials is needed to evaluate the potential benefits and harms of flumazenil in people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-08-09 12:56:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Hepatic encephalopathy is the term used to describe the spectrum of neuropsychiatric changes that can occur in people with cirrhosis. The joint guideline from the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) defines hepatic encephalopathy as brain dysfunction associated with liver insufficiency or portal systemic shunting (<LINK REF="REF-EASL_x002f_AASLD-guideline-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">EASL/AASLD guideline 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EASL_x002f_AASLD-guideline-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">EASL/AASLD guideline 2014b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinically apparent or<I> overt </I>hepatic encephalopathy manifests as a neuropsychiatric syndrome encompassing a wide spectrum of mental and motor disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Weissenborn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissenborn 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferenci-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferenci 2002</LINK>). Events such as gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, and alcohol misuse can trigger this so-called acute or episodic hepatic encephalopathy. Fifty per cent of instances occur with no obvious precipitating cause. Episodes may recur. Between episodes, people may return to their baseline neuropsychiatric status or retain a degree of impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Bajaj-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bajaj 2010</LINK>). Less frequently, people present with persistent neuropsychiatric abnormalities, which are always present to some degree, but which may vary in seriousness. The clinical features of <I>overt </I>hepatic encephalopathy range from subtle alterations in personality, intellectual capacity and cognitive function to more profound alterations in motor function and consciousness leading to deep coma (<LINK REF="REF-Weissenborn-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissenborn 1998</LINK>). Other abnormalities include impaired psychometric performance (<LINK REF="REF-Schomerus-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schomerus 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Randolph-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randolph 2009</LINK>), disturbed neurophysiological function (<LINK REF="REF-Parsons_x002d_Smith-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons-Smith 1957</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chu-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chu 1997</LINK>), altered cerebral neurochemical/neurotransmitter homeostasis (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor_x002d_Robinson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor-Robinson 1994</LINK>), reductions in global and regional cerebral blood flow and metabolism (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Carroll-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Carroll 1991</LINK>), and changes in cerebral fluid homeostasis (<LINK REF="REF-Haussinger-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haussinger 2000</LINK>). In general, the degree of impairment in these parameters increases as the clinical condition worsens. <I>Minimal</I> hepatic encephalopathy (in the older literature 'subclinical' or 'latent') refers to people with cirrhosis who are 'clinically normal,' but who show abnormalities in neuropsychometric or neurophysiological performance (<LINK REF="REF-Ferenci-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferenci 2002</LINK>). Hepatic encephalopathy, whether minimal or overt, is associated with impairment in the performance of complex tasks, such as driving (<LINK REF="REF-Schomerus-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schomerus 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bajaj-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bajaj 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kircheis-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kircheis 2009</LINK>), and a detrimental effect on health-related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Groeneweg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groeneweg 1998</LINK>), safety (<LINK REF="REF-Roman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roman 2011</LINK>), neurocognitive function post-transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Sotil-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sotil 2009</LINK>), and survival (<LINK REF="REF-Bustamante-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bustamante 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2007</LINK>). About 42% of people with cirrhosis are alive one year after their first episode of hepatic encephalopathy but only 23% are alive after three years (<LINK REF="REF-Bustamante-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bustamante 1999</LINK>). Thus, more than 50% die within one year and more than 75% die within three years. Hepatic encephalopathy also poses a substantial burden for the carers of affected people (<LINK REF="REF-Bajaj-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bajaj 2011</LINK>) and on healthcare systems (<LINK REF="REF-Poordad-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poordad 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stepanova-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stepanova 2012</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prevalence of hepatic encephalopathy</HEADING>
<P>The prevalence of hepatic encephalopathy varies. About 10% to 14% of people with cirrhosis have overt hepatic encephalopathy at the time they are first diagnosed as having liver disease (<LINK REF="REF-Saunders-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 1981</LINK>). In people with decompensated cirrhosis the prevalence of overt hepatic encephalopathy is around 20% (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Jongh-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Jongh 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zipprich-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zipprich 2012</LINK>). The cumulated incidence of overt hepatic encephalopathy is as high as 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Randolph-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randolph 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bajaj-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bajaj 2011</LINK>). The prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy varies but may be as high as 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Lauridsen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauridsen 2011</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnosing hepatic encephalopathy</HEADING>
<P>There is no gold standard for the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. A detailed neuropsychiatric history and examination is important to identify suggestive abnormalities while eliminating other potential causes of similar cerebral changes (<LINK REF="REF-Montagnese-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montagnese 2004</LINK>). The West Haven or Conn criteria are commonly used to assess and grade the mental state (<LINK REF="REF-Conn-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conn 1977</LINK>), while the Glasgow Coma Scale is used to grade the level of consciousness (<LINK REF="REF-Teasdale-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teasdale 1974</LINK>). People with hepatic encephalopathy show impairment on a range of psychometric tests. People with minimal hepatic encephalopathy show deficits in attention, visuo-spatial abilities, fine motor skills, and memory while other cognitive functions are relatively well preserved. People with overt hepatic encephalopathy show additional disturbances in psychomotor speed, executive function, and concentration. The Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score, which employs five paper and pencil tests to assess attention, visual perception and visuo-constructive abilities, is widely used in the assessment of psychometric change in people with cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Schomerus-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schomerus 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weissenborn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissenborn 2001</LINK>). People with hepatic encephalopathy may have a number of neurophysiological abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Gu_x00e9_rit-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guérit 2009</LINK>). The electroencephalogram, which primarily reflects cortical neuronal activity, may show progressive slowing of background activity and abnormal wave morphology. The brain responses, or evoked potentials, to stimuli such as light and sounds may show abnormal slowing or abnormal wave forms. Other potential diagnostic techniques include the Critical Flicker Fusion Frequency (<LINK REF="REF-Kircheis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kircheis 2002</LINK>), and the Inhibitory Control Test (<LINK REF="REF-Bajaj-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bajaj 2008</LINK>). Blood ammonia concentrations are not routinely measured to diagnose hepatic encephalopathy but they are sometimes monitored in clinical trials.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-08-07 13:15:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy is complex and incompletely understood. It is associated with a general depression in cerebral function and a shift in balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission favouring inhibition. Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain; it binds to a specific receptor; the GABA-A-complex, which also has neurosteroid and benzodiazepine modulatory sites (<LINK REF="REF-Butterworth-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butterworth 2016</LINK>). People with hepatic encephalopathy have been shown to have increased 'GABAergic tone'. Use of a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist may counteract this increased tone and benefit people with hepatic encephalopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Ahboucha-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahboucha 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Flumazenil competitively inhibits the activity at the benzodiazepine recognition site on the GABA-A receptor complex, but lacks major intrinsic pharmacological or behavioural activity (<LINK REF="REF-Whitwam-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitwam 1995</LINK>). Flumazenil is used to treat benzodiazepine overdose and in the reversal of anaesthesia. Following intravenous administration, flumazenil distributes extensively in the extravascular space with an initial distribution half-life of 4 to 11 minutes and a terminal half-life of 40 to 80 minutes. Maximum plasma concentrations are reached at around 50 minutes. Flumazenil is completely metabolised primarily by hepatic metabolism and has a relatively high hepatic extraction ratio (<LINK REF="REF-Amrein-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amrein 1990</LINK>). In people with moderate liver dysfunction, the mean total clearance is decreased to 40% to 60%. In people with severe liver dysfunction, clearance is decreased to 25%. This results in a prolongation of the half-life from 50 minutes in healthy volunteers to 1.3 hours in people with moderate hepatic impairment and 2.4 hours in people with severe hepatic dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Amrein-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amrein 1990</LINK>). Nevertheless, even in people with severe liver disease, its duration of action remains relatively short.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-08-08 17:36:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Marsha Y Morgan">
<P>Glutamate dehydrogenase synthesises GABA from glutamate in presynaptic nerves. GABA binds to a specific receptor, which is embedded in the postsynaptic neural membrane. This receptor is part of a larger GABA-A receptor complex, which also has binding sites for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and neurosteroids. The binding of any of these ligands opens a chloride channel; the influx of chloride ions results in hyperpolarisation of the postsynaptic membrane and neuro-inhibition. Neurosteroids are synthesised in the brain, primarily in astrocytes, and mediate the increased GABAergic tone associated with hepatic encephalopathy. Neurosteroid synthesis is mediated via activation of translocator protein, a mitochondrial neuroglial cholesterol-transporter protein (<LINK REF="REF-Butterworth-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butterworth 2016</LINK>). Translocator protein sites were previously known as 'peripheral-type' or mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors. Neurosteroids such as 3&#945;-5&#945;-tetrahydroprogesterone (allopregnanolone) are potent, endogenous, positive allosteric modulators of both the GABA and benzodiazepine sites on the GABA-A receptor complex. Autopsy and imaging studies show consistent upregulation of translocator protein sites in people with hepatic encephalopathy. This upregulation is most likely mediated by ammonia and manganese (<LINK REF="REF-Ahboucha-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahboucha 2008</LINK>), both of which accumulate as a result of hepatocellular failure and portal-systemic shunting of blood. In addition, cerebrospinal fluid and autopsied brains of people with hepatic encephalopathy have increased concentrations of agonist ligands such as diazepam-binding inhibitor and octadecaneuropeptide, which modulate the function of translocator protein sites (<LINK REF="REF-C_x00f3_rdoba-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Córdoba 2002</LINK>). People who die from hepatic encephalopathy have increased cerebral concentrations of allopregnanolone, which modulates components of the GABA-A receptors. The neurosteroids may also act synergistically with other neurotoxins such as ammonia and benzodiazepine-like compounds to further modulate GABA-A receptor function. The net effect is an increase in GABAergic tone and neural inhibition. Involvement of the GABA system in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy is consistent with the increased sensitivity to benzodiazepines observed in these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Batki-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Batki 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Flumazenil is a selective, synthetic benzodiazepine antagonist with high affinity for the benzodiazepine recognition site but is itself devoid of intrinsic activity. This compound functions as an antagonist of positive and negative modulators acting at benzodiazepine recognition sites located in the GABA-A receptor (<LINK REF="REF-Vicini-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vicini 1987</LINK>). Flumazenil may exert an indirect negative allosteric modulatory effect on GABA-A receptor function by reducing the facilitatory action of the central benzodiazepine receptor on GABA-related opening of the chloride ion-channel and in turn the excessive inhibitory effect.</P>

<P>The resource utilisation associated with the management of people with hepatic encephalopathy continues to escalate (<LINK REF="REF-Poordad-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poordad 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stepanova-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stepanova 2012</LINK>). The costs of treatment and rehabilitation are increasing year on year (<LINK REF="REF-Neff-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neff 2010</LINK>). The identification of effective interventions which will facilitate the management of people with hepatic encephalopathy is clearly important. A number of randomised clinical trials have assessed the effects of flumazenil in people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy (<LINK REF="STD-Klotz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hermant-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hermant 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cadranel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cadranel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gooday-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gooday 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gyr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gyr 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amodio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Amodio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbaro-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barbaro 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giger_x002d_Mateeva-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Giger-Mateeva 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dursun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dursun 2003</LINK>). However, the number of randomised clinical trials and of included participants is small and several trials used a cross-over design, which hampers the analyses of clinical outcomes such as mortality and morbidity. A meta-analysis undertaken in 2002 found that use of flumazenil may be associated with clinical and electroencephalographic improvement in people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Goulenok-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goulenok 2002</LINK>). The previous versions of this review included 13 randomised clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Als_x002d_Nielsen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Als-Nielsen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Als_x002d_Nielsen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Als-Nielsen 2004</LINK>) and found no beneficial effect of flumazenil on all-cause mortality, but a potential beneficial effect on manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy. We have updated this review based on current recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2017</LINK>).</P>

<P>One double-blind, cross-over trial involved participants with cirrhosis who were liver transplant candidates (<LINK REF="STD-Kapczinski-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kapczinski 1995</LINK>). The objective of the trial was to evaluate the differential effects of flumazenil versus placebo on cognitive function and anxiety in 10 people with alcohol-related cirrhosis, 10 people with non-alcohol-related cirrhosis, and 10 healthy volunteers. None of the included participants had evidence of overt hepatic encephalopathy. The investigators evaluated a range of psychometric tests and reported the results as group mean values. The trial report did not provide information about the number of participants with abnormal test results, but stated that participants with cirrhosis performed worse than people in the control group on several tests including verbal recall, and on reaction time tasks. Treatment with flumazenil had no effect on the test results, but induced anxiety in the participants with non-alcoholic cirrhosis.</P>
<P>Two prospective non-randomised observational studies involved 47 participants with cirrhosis and overt hepatic encephalopathy (<LINK REF="STD-Marsepoil-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Marsepoil 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jia-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jia 1999</LINK>). The first study included 25 participants with alcohol-related cirrhosis and acute hepatic encephalopathy, 13 of whom received flumazenil in a dose of 0.2 mg intravenously every 10 minutes until clinical improvement up to a maximum total dose of 2 mg followed by a continuous maintenance infusion of 0.3 mg. per hour for 48 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Marsepoil-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Marsepoil 1990</LINK>). Similar mortality rates were reported in the flumazenil and control groups, but information on the number of participants who died was not provided. The second study included 22 participants with cirrhosis and overt hepatic encephalopathy (<LINK REF="STD-Jia-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Jia 1999</LINK>), 12 of whom received flumazenil while the remaining 10 received a traditional Chinese medicine, both infused intravenously. The trial report stated that two participants in the flumazenil group died of liver failure. The report did not mention deaths in the control group.</P>

The study authors defined improvement of hepatic encephalopathy as a three-point or greater reduction in the Conn Score within six hours after the administration of the interventions. Seven (58%) of the 12 participants in the flumazenil plus lactulose group and four (50%) of the eight participants in the flumazenil alone group showed improvement.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-26 11:34:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>This review included 14 randomised clinical trials published between 1989 and 2009. The primary meta-analyses showed no beneficial or detrimental effect of flumazenil on all-cause mortality, but it showed a potential short-term beneficial effect of flumazenil on the manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy. We found little evidence suggesting that flumazenil was associated with serious adverse effects, However, the reporting of serious and non-serious adverse events was generally incomplete or unclear, and our analyses of adverse events may be subject to outcome reporting bias. Based on methodological concerns, we classified the strength of the evidence as low. Therefore, our review remains inconclusive.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-08-09 13:57:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Flumazenil is a short-acting specific benzodiazepine antagonist which acts by inhibiting activity at the benzodiazepine recognition site on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. Its oral bioavailability is poor and hence intravenous administration is necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Brogden-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brogden 1991</LINK>). The main indication for flumazenil is the reversal of benzodiazepine overdose or prolonged anaesthesia. Based on pharmacological studies, the onset of its effect is rapid and its duration of action is short (<LINK REF="REF-Brogden-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brogden 1991</LINK>). In healthy people, the half-life is 50 minutes. Thus, repeated low intravenous doses or continuous infusion is needed if the clinical situation requires a longer lasting effect (<LINK REF="REF-Hood-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hood 2014</LINK>). Hepatic encephalopathy is characterised by an increase in GABAergic tone which is the rationale for use of flumazenil in this condition.</P>
<P>The most important outcomes for people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy include mortality, morbidity, adverse events, and health-related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Bajaj-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bajaj 2011</LINK>). We found no detrimental or beneficial effect on all-cause mortality or adverse events but a potential short-term effect on the manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy. There was no reported information on health-related quality of life. However, the applicability of the evidence will be limited because of the need for intravenous administration. Most trials evaluated single or repeated bolus injections (<LINK REF="STD-Klotz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hermant-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hermant 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pomier_x002d_Layrargues-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pomier-Layrargues 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cadranel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cadranel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gooday-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gooday 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amodio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Amodio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbaro-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barbaro 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giger_x002d_Mateeva-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Giger-Mateeva 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacetti-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lacetti 2000</LINK>). One trial assessed the effect of a 72-hour infusion of flumazenil (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Rijt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Rijt 1995</LINK>), but the investigators changed the intervention to bolus injections because participants found the three-day infusion too stressful. None of the trials compared different doses or different modes of administration. We found no effect of the dose of flumazenil on the estimated effect on all-cause mortality or hepatic encephalopathy. However, based on the limited number of events and trials, important clinical differences may have been overlooked. The half-life of flumazenil is prolonged up to 2.4 hours in people with moderate to severe hepatic decompensation, hence providing some prolongation of action (<LINK REF="REF-Amrein-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amrein 1990</LINK>). However, we found no further or additional effects of flumazenil when analysing trials with more than 24-hour follow-up.</P>
<P>The majority of the included randomised clinical trials enrolled participants with cirrhosis and an acute episode of hepatic encephalopathy although the severity varied between trials. Episodes of hepatic encephalopathy often develop in response to a precipitating event such as gastrointestinal bleeding, which was the most common precipitant identified in the included trials in this review. Identification and treatment of precipitating factors is key to the management of affected people (<LINK REF="REF-EASL_x002f_AASLD-guideline-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">EASL/AASLD guideline 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EASL_x002f_AASLD-guideline-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">EASL/AASLD guideline 2014b</LINK>). We did not have sufficient data to assess potential difference in outcomes between precipitated and non-precipitated hepatic encephalopathy. None of the included participants had surgically created or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts. Likewise, the review contains very little information about people with recurrent or persistent hepatic encephalopathy as only two trials included participants classified as such (<LINK REF="STD-Gyr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gyr 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klotz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 1989</LINK>). Two trials included a small number of participants with fulminant hepatic failure (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Rijt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Rijt 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2009</LINK>). This condition is infrequent in clinical practice. We were unable to gather data that allowed us to evaluate any differential effects of flumazenil on hepatic encephalopathy associated with acute or chronic liver failure. However, subgroup analyses based on aggregated data found no difference between trials including or not including participants with fulminant hepatic failure. Nevertheless, it is likely that the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy in participants with acute liver failure differs from that associated with cirrhosis. Three trials enrolled people with minimal hepatic encephalopathy (<LINK REF="STD-Gooday-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gooday 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amodio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Amodio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giger_x002d_Mateeva-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Giger-Mateeva 1999</LINK>), while a further trial included participants with both minimal and low-grade acute hepatic encephalopathy (<LINK REF="STD-Dursun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dursun 2003</LINK>). In these four trials, the objective appears to be more mechanistic than therapeutic, but based on our subgroup analysis, we found no difference in outcomes between overt and minimal hepatic encephalopathy. However, the diagnostic outcomes for hepatic encephalopathy in these trials were very different, namely clinical assessment versus psychometry and as the number of trials was small, statistical differences may have been overlooked.</P>
<P>Prior intake of benzodiazepines may influence the effects of flumazenil. Ten randomised clinical trial stipulated prior ingestion of benzodiazepines as an exclusion criterion (<LINK REF="STD-Hermant-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hermant 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pomier_x002d_Layrargues-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pomier-Layrargues 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gooday-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gooday 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Rijt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Rijt 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amodio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Amodio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbaro-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barbaro 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giger_x002d_Mateeva-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Giger-Mateeva 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacetti-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lacetti 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dursun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dursun 2003</LINK>), while nine trials undertook baseline screening for benzodiazepines (<LINK REF="STD-Hermant-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hermant 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pomier_x002d_Layrargues-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pomier-Layrargues 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cadranel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cadranel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Rijt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Rijt 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gyr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gyr 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amodio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Amodio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbaro-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barbaro 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giger_x002d_Mateeva-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Giger-Mateeva 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacetti-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lacetti 2000</LINK>). Three randomised clinical trials stipulated negative testing for benzodiazepines as an inclusion criterion (<LINK REF="STD-Hermant-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hermant 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Rijt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Rijt 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lacetti-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lacetti 2000</LINK>). In the remaining six trials, in which baseline testing was undertaken, it was unclear whether the results were available at the time of randomisation or whether participants were included irrespective of the results; in two of these trials, none of the participants tested positive (<LINK REF="STD-Amodio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Amodio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giger_x002d_Mateeva-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Giger-Mateeva 1999</LINK>), while in the remaining four trials, between 1.9% and 21.4% of participants tested positive (<LINK REF="STD-Pomier_x002d_Layrargues-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pomier-Layrargues 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cadranel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cadranel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gyr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gyr 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbaro-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barbaro 1998)</LINK>. Thus, the exclusion of participants based on reports of non-ingestion of benzodiazepines is clearly unreliable. In all four of these trials, the assessment of outcomes in relation to the presence/absence of benzodiazepines were related to the response to flumazenil rather than to intervention allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Pomier_x002d_Layrargues-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pomier-Layrargues 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cadranel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cadranel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gyr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gyr 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbaro-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barbaro 1998)</LINK>. All four showed that the majority of participants who responded to flumazenil did not have detectable circulating benzodiazepines whereas some non-responders had measurable quantities of these substances in their blood. The trials concluded that the presence of benzodiazepines was not predictive of participants' responses to flumazenil. We did not find this information in five trials, which should be considered when evaluating their results (<LINK REF="STD-Klotz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Klotz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gooday-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gooday 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dursun-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dursun 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Administration of flumazenil by sublingual lozenge and topical cream has also been tested, albeit very selectively (<LINK REF="REF-Rye-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rye 2012</LINK>); the preparations are not generally available nor applicable for use in most clinical settings; no trials have been undertaken in people with hepatic encephalopathy using this route of administration.</P>
<P>On the basis of this review, the use of flumazenil in the management of hepatic encephalopathy would be limited. It might be of value in people with severe hepatic encephalopathy not responding to usual management to facilitate procedures or to allow assessment of cognitive status in potential transplant candidates if other conditions, such as hypoxic injury, are suspected.</P>

Seven of the 14 included trial used a cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Pomier_x002d_Layrargues-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pomier-Layrargues 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cadranel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cadranel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gooday-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gooday 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Rijt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Rijt 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Amodio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Amodio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbaro-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barbaro 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giger_x002d_Mateeva-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Giger-Mateeva 1999</LINK>). While this design is suitable for evaluating interventions which are predicted to have a temporary effect on chronic stable conditions, it is not suitable for evaluating interventions which have a short-term effect in unstable conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenkranz-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenkranz 2015</LINK>). The majority of trials in this review included participants with an acute episode of hepatic encephalopathy, and thus, a cross-over design is not appropriate. The problem was further compounded since some of the trials used a modified design with cross-over of only the non-responders to the second treatment period. Therefore, inclusion of both periods in our analyses would introduce potential bias and would have posed statistical problems. We included data from the first period of the seven cross-over trials, obtaining the data which correspond to those available from the more suitable parallel-armed randomised clinical trials. The drawback of the strategy is loss of information from the second period. A further problem with the cross-over design is that it precludes an assessment of risk of relapse.</P>
<P>Only one trial was at low risk of bias in the overall assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Barbaro-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barbaro 1998</LINK>). The trial included the largest number of participants and had a weight of 39% in the analysis of mortality and 56% in the analysis of hepatic encephalopathy. We found no difference between this trial and the remaining trials with a high risk of bias for the two outcomes based on the test for subgroup differences; exclusion of the trial did not change the overall conclusion. We found no evidence of publication bias or other small-study effects and between-trial heterogeneity was negligible. Nevertheless, the CIs were wide. Although these findings support the quality of the evidence, we still have potential problems with the use of the cross-over design. We classified the quality of the evidence as low.</P>
<P>While most trials reported mortality and hepatic encephalopathy, the quality of the reporting of both non-fatal serious and non-serious adverse events was low. We looked for additional information about harms in observational studies, but were unable to retrieve and analyse adverse events in the studies identified.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-07-17 15:43:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We attempted to minimise possible selection biases by using a comprehensive search strategy. Searches in electronic databases were combined with extensive handsearches. In addition, we also searched conference proceedings and abstract books. We think it likely that we have not missed published trials, but we cannot exclude the possibility that we have missed unpublished trials. The intervention is not high-profile and it is possible that negative trials, particularly if small, will not have appeared as abstracts at conferences or been published in full. However, our meta-regression analyses showed no evidence of publication bias or other dissemination biases.</P>

<P>One meta-analysis undertaken in 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Goulenok-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goulenok 2002</LINK>) included six randomised clinical trials with 641 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Pomier_x002d_Layrargues-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pomier-Layrargues 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cadranel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cadranel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Rijt-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Rijt 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Groeneweg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groeneweg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gyr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gyr 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbaro-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barbaro 1998</LINK>). The mean percentages of people with clinical improvement (five trials) were 27% in treated groups and 3% in placebo groups. We believe that two of these involve the same population of participants (<LINK REF="REF-Groeneweg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groeneweg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gyr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gyr 1996</LINK>). The first trial included 49 participants with mild to moderate (Grade I to III) hepatic encephalopathy (<LINK REF="STD-Gyr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gyr 1996</LINK>), while the second trial, which is described by the authors as an ancillary study, reported electroencephalography data from 32 of the original 49 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Groeneweg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groeneweg 1996</LINK>). We excluded the second trial from this review.</P>
<P>The previous version of this review included 13 randomised clinical trials with 805 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Als_x002d_Nielsen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Als-Nielsen 2004</LINK>). This earlier review found no effect of flumazenil on all-cause mortality based on an analysis of 10 trials and a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy based on an analysis of eight trials with a risk difference of 0.28 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.37). We have updated the review by inclusion of two additional randomised clinical trials in the analyses of benefits and harms (<LINK REF="STD-Giger_x002d_Mateeva-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Giger-Mateeva 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2009</LINK>), and by exclusion of one previously included study (<LINK REF="STD-Kapczinski-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kapczinski 1995</LINK>). Our analysis of all-cause mortality included 12 trials and the analysis of hepatic encephalopathy included nine trials. In agreement with the previous review, we found no effect on all-cause mortality and a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy.</P>

<P>This review includes randomised clinical trials evaluating the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. The analyses found some evidence that flumazenil may be associated with a short-term effect on hepatic encephalopathy, but no beneficial effect on important clinical outcomes such as all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, or health-related quality of life. Likewise, we are unable to determine the risk of non-fatal serious or non-serious adverse events based on the available evidence.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-07-26 11:35:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>We used the EPICOT format to define the implications of our review for research (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2006</LINK>). Overall, the evidence is insufficient and additional evidence from randomised clinical trials is needed to evaluate whether flumazenil has a clinically relevant effect on hepatic encephalopathy.</P>
<P>
<B>E</B>vidence (what is the current state of the evidence?): this review includes 14 randomised clinical trials and found low quality evidence that flumazenil may have a beneficial short-term effect on hepatic encephalopathy. The evidence concerning all-cause mortality, non-fatal serious adverse events, and non-serious adverse events is insufficient.</P>
<P>
<B>P</B>articipants (what is the population of interest?): the largest body of evidence evaluated people with cirrhosis and an acute episode of overt hepatic encephalopathy. Only a relatively small proportion had minimal hepatic encephalopathy and chronic overt hepatic encephalopathy; very few had acute liver failure.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2017-07-26 11:36:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>The review has been extensively revised compared to the original protocol and the previously published version of this current review (<LINK REF="REF-Als_x002d_Nielsen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Als-Nielsen 2004</LINK>). The changes mainly reflect the current recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2017</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Als_x002d_Nielsen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Als-Nielsen 2004</LINK>), the primary outcomes included 'recovery' from hepatic encephalopathy defined as complete resolution of symptoms and 'improvement' of hepatic encephalopathy. We removed outcome 'recovery.' The term may be misleading as episodes may recur. Furthermore, people may show some degree of impairment between episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Bajaj-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bajaj 2010</LINK>). Based on current guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2017</LINK>), we assessed 'improvement' as number of participants 'without improvement of hepatic encephalopathy.' We now include all-cause mortality as a primary outcome rather than 'survival.'</P>
<P>The previous version of the review included data from both periods of cross-over trials. In this review, we only included data from the first treatment period because hepatic encephalopathy is fluctuating condition and because participants may die early in the randomised clinical trials.</P>
<P>We now report the results of meta-analyses using risk ratios, instead of risk differences, and include observational studies to improve our assessment of serious adverse events, Trial Sequential Analyses, and regression analysis (Harbord test) to evaluate the risk of small-study effects. The bias assessment is also updated.</P>

<P>Randomised clinical trial comparing intravenous flumazenil plus lactulose enemas versus flumazenil alone. A total of 20 participants (18 men) with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy were included. The maximum dose of flumazenil was 9 mg. The dose was adjusted based on the clinical effect. Investigators assessed hepatic encephalopathy based on Conn Criteria and defined an improvement from Grade IV to I within 6 hours as clinically significant. None of the included participants died and all 12 in the flumazenil plus lactulose group and all 8 in the flumazenil group showed improved manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy.

<P>Trial Sequential Analysis of randomised clinical trials evaluating flumazenil versus placebo for people with hepatic encephalopathy. The outcome is all-cause mortality. The original meta-analysis included 11 randomised clinical trials with 842 participants. The Trial Sequential Analysis ignored three randomised clinical trials due to insufficient information size (<LINK REF="STD-Cadranel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cadranel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gyr-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gyr 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 1998</LINK>). The analysis was made with alpha 3%, power 90%, relative risk reduction 20%, assumed control risk 10%, and diversity 10%. The blue line (Z-curve) corresponds to the cumulative meta-analysis, the black horizontal line is the conventional boundary (3% level of significance), and the inward sloping green line is the Trial Sequential Monitoring Boundary. Futility boundaries are ignored because the information is insufficient. The analysis found no evidence to support or refute a beneficial or harmful effect of flumazenil on mortality.</P>

<P>Trial Sequential Analysis of randomised clinical trials evaluating flumazenil versus placebo for people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. The outcome is hepatic encephalopathy. The original meta-analysis included 11 randomised clinical trials with 824 participants. The Trial Sequential Analysis is made with alpha 3%, power 90%, relative risk reduction 20%, assumed control risk 60%, and diversity 10%. The blue line (Z-curve) corresponds to the cumulative meta-analysis, the black horizontal line is the conventional boundary (3% level of significance), and the inward sloping green line is the Trial Sequential Monitoring Boundary. The analysis found that the Z-curve crossed the monitoring boundary before reaching the diversity-adjusted required information size of 914 participants.</P>
