<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-07 13:21:08 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Patients with nephrotic syndrome, particularly children, are susceptible to infections. Infections can cause frequent relapses of illness, poor response to therapies (e.g. steroids) and severe infections occasionally lead to death. Oral antibiotics, pneumococcal vaccination, some immunomodulators and Chinese medicinal herbs have been used/recommended for reducing the risk of infection. No studies on antibiotics, pneumococcal vaccination and any other non-drug prophylaxis were identified. This review found that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), thymosin, oral transfer factor, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine injection and two kinds of Chinese medicinal herbs (Huangqi granules and TIAOJINING) may help prevent infections in nephrotic children. These studies were methodologically poor. Currently there is no strong evidence for recommending any interventions for preventing infections in nephrotic syndrome. More research is needed.</P>

<P>Two authors independently assessed and extracted information.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-08 13:55:26 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Twelve studies conducted in China, including 762 children with nephrotic syndrome were identified. No studies were identified in adults. All studies compared one kind of prophylactic pharmacotherapy (intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), thymosin, oral transfer factor, mannan peptide tablet, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine injection, polyvalent bacterial vaccine (Lantigen B) and two kinds of Chinese medicinal herbs: a compound of Chinese medicinal herbs (TIAOJINING) and Huangqi (astragalus) granules) plus baseline treatment with baseline treatment alone. No RCTs were identified comparing antibiotics, non-pharmacological prophylaxis, or pneumococcal vaccination. Four studies showed a significantly beneficial effect of IVIG on preventing nosocomial or unspecified infection in children with nephrotic syndrome (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73). Thymosin (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.97), oral transfer factor (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.73), BCG vaccine injection (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95), Huangqi granules (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.83) and TIAOJINING (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.81) were also effective in reducing the risk of infection in children with nephrotic syndrome. However mannan peptide tablet (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.01) and polyvalent bacterial vaccine (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to1.00) were not superior to baseline treatment in reducing the risk of infection for nephrotic children. No serious adverse events were reported.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-02-08 13:55:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>IVIG, thymosin, oral transfer factor, BCG vaccine, Huangqi granules and TIAOJINING may have positive effects on the prevention of nosocomial or unspecified infection with no obvious serious adverse events in children with nephrotic syndrome. However the methodological quality of all studies was poor, the sample sizes small, and all studies were from China, and thus there is no strong evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-02-08 13:26:49 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Hongmei Wu">
<P>Infection is one of the most common complications in patients with nephrotic syndrome, especially in nephrotic children. The majority of infections are closely associated with frequent relapses and steroid dependency in children with nephrotic syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Gulati-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulati 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moorani-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moorani 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yap-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yap 2001</LINK>) which result in significant mortality, morbidity and health care costs, especially in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Choudhary-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choudhary 1977</LINK>). Hospital-based, retrospective case series from the 1960s to 1980s had consistently shown the annual incidence of invasive bacterial infection to be about 1% to 2%, and a cumulative risk of 10% to 20% for the 10-year susceptibility period (<LINK REF="REF-McIntyre-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntyre 1998</LINK>). In China, many studies have also reported a high incidence rate of nosocomial infection of about 34% to 79% in nephrotic children (<LINK REF="REF-Du-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Du 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ma-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ma 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rao-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2009</LINK>), and 22% in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Li-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1996</LINK>). With the introduction and widespread use of corticosteroids and antibiotics in the management of nephrotic syndrome, death from infective complications has now become rare. Despite this, the International Study Group of Kidney Disease in Children indicated that, of the 10 deaths amongst the nearly 400 children with minimal change disease followed for five to 10 years, six occurred after infection, resulting in a cumulative infection-related mortality incidence of 1.5% (<LINK REF="REF-ISKDC-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISKDC 1984</LINK>). Therefore infections still remain a significant cause of morbidity and occasionally mortality in nephrotic patients all over the world (<LINK REF="REF-Tain-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tain 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>With respect to the pattern of infection, a variety of infectious complications have been reported in patients with nephrotic syndrome, particularly bacterial infections. Of these, peritonitis and sepsis are the most serious infections in hospitalised nephrotic children, usually caused by encapsulated organisms (<I>Streptococcus pneumonia</I>) and Gram-negative enteric organisms, predominantly <I>Escherichia coli</I> (<I>E. coli</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-McIntyre-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntyre 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moorani-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moorani 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tain-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tain 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are several explanations for this increased risk, including oedema (which may predispose to entry and spread of infection), urinary losses of factor B and D of the alternative complement pathway, impaired polymorph phagocytic function and secondary effects of corticosteroids and cytotoxic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shroff-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shroff 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many efforts have been made to investigate the effectiveness of various interventions for dealing with this problem worldwide. At present, multiple different prophylactic interventions are used and/or recommended for reducing the risk of infection in patients with nephrotic syndrome in clinical practice. These include avoidance of nephrosis, chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics, pneumococcal vaccines, and immunoglobulin replacement therapies (<LINK REF="REF-McIntyre-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntyre 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shroff-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shroff 2002</LINK>). One study from the USA demonstrated that concomitant use of oral acyclovir might prevent serious varicella infection in patients receiving corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 2000</LINK>). Another study from the USA showed that varicella vaccine was generally well tolerated and highly immunogenic in children with nephrotic syndrome, including those on low-dose, alternate-day prednisone (<LINK REF="REF-Furth-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furth 2003</LINK>). One study from the France indicated that there was high serological response to pneumococcal vaccine in nephrotic children at disease onset on high-dose prednisone (<LINK REF="REF-Ulinski-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ulinski 2008</LINK>). Other studies have reported that serum immunoglobulin (IgG) levels were markedly depressed in nephrotic syndrome with serious infections, and administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may reduce the risk of infection in adult nephrotic syndrome patients with serum IgG levels below 600 mg/dL (<LINK REF="REF-Ogi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tain-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tain 1999</LINK>). In China, several studies have also demonstrated that IVIG, intravenous or intramuscular thymosin (mainly thymosin-&#945;1) are beneficial for preventing nosocomial infection in children with nephrotic syndrome (<LINK REF="STD-Dang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dang 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2000</LINK>). IVIG contains an array of alloantibodies directed against infectious agents. This pooled material also has a broad spectrum of allo- and autoantibodies and other substances, which may be key to immune function and regulation (<LINK REF="REF-Maramica-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maramica 2003</LINK>). With respect to thymosin (mainly thymosin-&#945;1), it is an immunomodulating agent and may influence T-cell maturation and antigen recognition, the stimulation of interferon and cytokine production, and the activity of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2001</LINK>). Whether the existing evidence is scientifically rigorous and which prophylactic intervention can be recommended for routine use based on the current evidence is still unknown. One narrative review about the prevention of bacterial infection in nephrotic children indicated that there were insufficient data (i.e. controlled studies) for recommending prophylactic use of antibiotics and pneumococcal vaccination (<LINK REF="REF-McIntyre-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntyre 1998</LINK>). However where penicillin-resistant pneumococci are common, they recommended the administration of pneumococcal vaccination in paediatric practices and claimed that it would favourably alter the outcome of children with nephrotic syndrome, making treatment with prophylactic antibiotics obsolete. Furthermore, some antibiotics, pneumococcal vaccine and other prophylactic therapies (e.g. IVIG, thymosin) are quite expensive and have some adverse effects. Before these prophylactic interventions can be recommended for routine use in patients with nephrotic syndrome, rigorous randomised evidence should be provided to show its effectiveness.</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to analyse systematically all the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of prophylactic interventions for reducing the risk of infection in nephrotic syndrome in children and adults.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>This review aims to assess the benefits and harms of any prophylactic intervention for reducing the risk of infection in children and adults with nephrotic syndrome, regardless of cause or pathologic change. </P>

<P>The search strategy described was used to obtain titles and abstracts of studies that may be relevant to the review. The titles and abstracts were screened independently by two authors, who discarded studies that were not applicable, however studies and reviews that might include relevant data or information on studies were retained initially. Two authors independently assessed retrieved abstracts and the full text of these studies to determine which studies satisfied our inclusion criteria.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2012-02-07 18:18:14 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Hongmei Wu">
<P>Data extraction was carried out independently by the same authors using standard data extraction forms. Studies not in English or Chinese were translated before assessment. Where more than one publication of one study existed, reports were grouped together and the publication with the most complete data was used. Where relevant outcomes were only published in earlier versions these data were used. Any discrepancy between published versions was to be highlighted. Any further information required from the original author was requested by written correspondence and any relevant information obtained in this manner was included in the review. Disagreements were resolved in consultation with a third author.</P>

<P>We planned to sue subgroup analyses to explore possible sources of heterogeneity (e.g. participants, type of nephrotic syndrome, treatments). Heterogeneity among participants could be related to age, cause of nephrotic syndrome, and renal pathology. Heterogeneity in treatments could be related to the type of nephrotic syndrome (primary or secondary), prior agent(s) used, the agent used, and dose and duration of therapy. Adverse effects were to be tabulated and assessed with descriptive techniques, as they were likely to be different for the various agents used. If possible, the risk difference (RD) with 95% CI was to be calculated for each adverse effect, either compared to no treatment or to another agent.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-02-08 13:59:50 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Hongmei Wu">
<P>Twelve studies enrolling 762 children with nephrotic syndrome were included in this review. Because all the included studies were conducted in China and no data from other country were available, this review on interventions for preventing infection in patients with nephrotic syndrome is not representative of different racial groups. The main results revealed the following.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Compared with control, IVIG, thymosin, oral transfer factor, BCG vaccine injection, Huangqi granules, and TIAOJINING may have positive effects on the prevention of nosocomial infection or unspecified infection in children with nephrotic syndrome.</LI>
<LI>Mannan peptide and polyvalent bacterial vaccine were not superior to control on the prevention of nosocomial infection or unspecified infection in children with nephrotic syndrome.</LI>
<LI>Currently there was no evidence to support the superiority of IVIG, thymosin, oral transfer factor, mannan peptide, BCG vaccine injection, polyvalent bacterial vaccine, Huangqi granules and TIAOJININ over control in the changes of quality of life for children with nephrotic syndrome.</LI>
<LI>There were no serious adverse events reported in children with nephrotic syndrome using IVIG, oral transfer factor, BCG vaccine injection, and Huangqi granules for reducing the risk of infection.</LI>
<LI>No studies were identified that used chemoprophylaxis, pneumococcal vaccination, varicella vaccine or any other non-pharmacological interventions for reducing the risk of infection in children or adults with nephrotic syndrome.</LI>
<LI>No studies were identified on interventions for preventing infection in adults with nephrotic syndrome.</LI>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-02-08 14:03:02 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Hongmei Wu">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Validity of treatment</HEADING>
<P>The validity of prophylactic intervention is closely related to its effectiveness. Information on the time to measurement of outcome and duration of follow-up was not clearly reported in the majority of the included studies. Furthermore, the dosage and treatment period varied across studies involving IgG. Ideally, differences in agents, dosage, duration of therapy and follow-up time in each study when evaluating the efficacy of prophylactic interventions should be considered. We were limited in this respect by the small number of studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The outcome definitions for the appearance of infection varied and were unclearly reported in most of the included studies. It is well known that prophylactic interventions show different effects on a variety of infections. However, data on the spectrum of infection and causative microorganisms were inadequately reported in many studies. Due to the limited number of studies, it was not possible to conduct subgroup analysis for the types of infections. The long-term goal of prevention of infection in nephrotic syndrome is to reduce mortality and ultimately to prolong survival and improve quality of life. There was a lack of data available on clinically relevant outcomes from long-term follow-up such as mortality and quality of life. We were therefore unable to draw conclusions about these important outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Economic evaluation</HEADING>
<P>In current health care practice, judgments often reflect clinical or social values concerning whether intervention benefits are worth the cost (<LINK REF="REF-Napodano-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Napodano 1986</LINK>). Prophylactic use of IVIG and thymosin-&#945;1 should be based on a full economic evaluation and a clinical decision analysis that incorporates baseline risk for serious infection. However, no studies in this systematic review performed such analyses. It is well known that both IVIG and thymosin-&#945;1 are quite expensive, and cost is a burden, even in developed countries. In the US the FDA currently has regulatory control over IVIG as a drug and has approved its use for only six conditions in which efficacy has been proven in well-controlled clinical studies (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, primary immunodeficiency, secondary immunodeficiency due to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, paediatric HIV infection, prevention of graft-versus-host disease and infection in adult BMT and Kawasaki syndrome) (<LINK REF="REF-Maramica-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maramica 2003</LINK>). Thus, further cost-effectiveness evaluation on IVIG and thymosin-&#945;1 should be considered in clinical decision-making.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Chemoprophylaxis and pneumococcal vaccination</HEADING>
<P>Although it is well known that children with nephrotic syndrome are susceptible to a variety of infectious complications (<LINK REF="REF-McIntyre-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntyre 1998</LINK>), no RCTs evaluating prophylactic antibiotics, or pneumococcal vaccines in nephrotic syndrome were identified in this systematic review. A survey of paediatric nephrologists from the USA demonstrated that doctors who did not prescribe prophylactic antibiotics expressed concern about the emergence of resistant organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Shroff-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shroff 2002</LINK>). In one RCT involving children with sickle cell disease, which shares some of the mechanisms implicated in an increased risk of bacterial infection in nephrotic syndrome, chemoprophylaxis with phenoxymethyl penicillin was proved to be beneficial for reducing the incidence of pneumococcal bacteraemia. There did not appear to be an increased rate of colonization with penicillin-resistant pneumococci during long-term administration of prophylactic penicillin (<LINK REF="REF-Gaston-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaston 1988</LINK>). With respect to pneumococcal vaccine, some paediatric nephrologists who were reluctant to immunise nephrotic children were concerned over the possibility of provoking relapses, although there were no data to support this (<LINK REF="REF-Schnaper-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schnaper 1994</LINK>). However, a recent report from the UK indicated the relapse rate of nephrotic syndrome in children under age 18 years increased significantly after administration of a conjugate meningococcal C vaccine (<LINK REF="REF-Abeyagunawardena-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abeyagunawardena 2003</LINK>). Therefore the decision to vaccinate certain children needs to be carefully considered. Further rigorous research should be done to clarify these issues.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prevention of Varicella infection</HEADING>
<P>Since many children with nephrotic syndrome are varicella non-immune, varicella exposure and infection require special consideration. It was reported that concomitant use of oral acyclovir might prevent serious varicella infection in patients receiving corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 2000</LINK>). However this is currently a lack of RCTs on prevention of varicella with acyclovir in patients with nephrotic syndrome. In addition, the research from the USA showed that varicella vaccine was generally well tolerated and highly immunogenic in children with nephrotic syndrome, including those on low-dose, alternate-day prednisone (<LINK REF="REF-Furth-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furth 2003</LINK>). It is reported that once remission is achieved, immunisation with varicella vaccine seems safe and effective for preventing varicella infection in children with nephrotic syndrome, although additional doses may be required to achieve full immunity (<LINK REF="REF-Eddy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddy 2003</LINK>). However, no relevant RCTs were identified in this systematic review.</P>
<P>Other non-pharmacological interventions are also quite important in the prevention of infections in nephrotic syndrome. No relevant RCTs were identified in this systematic review representing a significant gap in the literature in this field.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>A definite conclusion on adverse events associated with prophylactic interventions involving IVIG, thymosin, oral transfer factor, BCG vaccine injection Huangqi granules and TIAOJINING cannot be drawn from this review due to the limited number of studies identified, the limited duration of treatment and follow-up, and inadequate recording and reporting of adverse events. Some serious adverse events have been reported to be associated with using these prophylactic interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Liang-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liang 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maramica-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maramica 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tomlinson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomlinson 2000</LINK>). In clinical studies efficacy and safety should receive equal attention. However, RCTs are often impractical for assessment of rare and/or long-term adverse effects, so observational studies should be included to identify occasional and severe adverse events in future reviews.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-02-08 14:03:24 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Hongmei Wu">
<P>The methodological quality of the included RCTs in this systematic review was very poor. The methodological quality is defined by the internal validity criteria, which refers to characteristics of the study that might be related to (selection, performance, attrition and detection) bias. Many of the studies included in this review were subject to a number of biases. The most remarkable findings of this systematic review were the paucity and the overall poor quality of the studies. The quality of reporting was poor with most studies not describing the procedure of randomisation, blinding, dropouts or withdrawals. Allocation concealment was unclear in all studies. Methodologically less rigorous studies show larger differences between experimental and control groups than do those conducted with greater rigor (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). The small number of studies identified, and their general low methodological quality, prohibited meaningful sensitivity analysis to illuminate the robustness of the results of the review. No large scale, multi-centre RCTs were identified. Nephrotic syndrome is a condition for which many confounding variables exist (e.g. aetiology, types of pathology, age, duration). Sufficient sample size is therefore an essential precondition. It is disappointing that no studies included in this systematic review reported a sample size calculation.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-02-08 14:05:55 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>There were too few studies identified to investigate possible publication bias using a funnel plot in this review. All of the included studies in this review were conducted in China and 11/12 studies were published in Chinese and <LINK REF="STD-Dang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dang 1999</LINK> was published in both Chinese and English. <LINK REF="REF-Vickers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 1998</LINK> found that some countries, including China, publish unusually high proportions of positive results. Although we have conducted extensive searches for published material, we could not disregard the fact that studies with negative findings remain unpublished.</P>
<P>Evidence for one type of patient population may not necessarily be confidently applied to another. All studies in this systematic review were conducted in China. No eligible studies were conducted in adults with nephrotic syndrome and all participants were hospitalised children. Furthermore, the small number of studies made it impossible to conduct subgroup analysis for age, type of nephrotic syndrome and renal pathology. All these issues can considerably limit the applicability/generalizability of these prophylactic interventions for reducing the risk of infection in nephrotic syndrome in clinical practice. Studies outside of China, conducted in adults and including both inpatients and outpatients are needed.</P>
<P>Currently multiple prophylactic interventions have been used to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by infection in children with nephrotic syndrome around the world. Although there are no data to support this, advisory bodies in Canada and the US have recommended routine immunisation (pneumococcal vaccination) except for omission of live vaccines if patients are receiving high-dose corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents. In this review, four RCTs demonstrated consistent positive effects of IVIG on preventing infection in children with nephrotic syndrome. Thymosin, oral transfer factor, BCG vaccine injection, Huangqi granules and TIAOJINING seem to have better effects on reducing the risk of infection in children with nephrotic syndrome. Prophylactic intervention for reducing the risk of infection in children and adults with nephrotic syndrome therefore warrants further study. Such studies should incorporate the following features: sample size estimated by statistical calculation; clear definition of modality of interventions; usage of standard validated outcome measures; randomisation; subject and assessor blinding; and placebo-controlled design with adequate description of the procedure of randomisation and allocation concealment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-02-08 14:06:21 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Hongmei Wu">
<P>Based on this systematic review IVIG, thymosin, oral transfer factor, BCG vaccine injection, Huangqi granules and TIAOJINING may have positive effects on the prevention of nosocomial or unspecified infection, with no obvious serious adverse events in children with nephrotic syndrome. Unfortunately due to the low methodological quality of the RCTs and the small number of studies and probable publication bias, there is currently insufficient evidence for determining which of these interventions could be used for preventing infection in children with nephrotic syndrome. No RCTs were identified in adults with nephrotic syndrome.</P>
<P>No RCTs were available on chemoprophylaxis, pneumococcal vaccination, varicella vaccine and any other non-pharmacological interventions for reducing the risk of infection in children or adults with nephrotic syndrome in this systematic review.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-02-08 14:06:48 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Hongmei Wu">
<P>The promising results and the insufficient quality of the available studies warrant further research. Large, properly randomised, placebo-controlled, blinded studies are needed to confirm (or refute) the available evidence that effects of reducing risks of infection in children or adults with nephrotic syndrome are truly specific. The following features should be addressed in future studies:</P>
<OL>
<LI>sample size estimated by statistical calculation;</LI>
<LI>detailed reporting of the generation of allocation sequence and the allocation concealment;</LI>
<LI>application and clear description of blinding;</LI>
<LI>using placebo as control;</LI>
<LI>clear description of withdrawal/dropout during the study;</LI>
<LI>clear definition of modality of prophylactic interventions such as the dosage, the treatment period and duration of follow-up;</LI>
<LI>usage of standard validated outcome measures;</LI>
<LI>reporting of clinically important outcome measures from long-term follow-up such as mortality and quality of life.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Adverse events should be critically assessed by standardized monitoring or an effective self-report system. Attention should be paid to some rare and severe adverse events relevant to prophylactic interventions. Rigorous studies evaluating pneumococcal vaccination and prophylactic non-pharmacological therapies, conducted outside of china, conducted in adults and including both inpatients and outpatients are needed. Finally the study should be reported according to the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>).</P>
