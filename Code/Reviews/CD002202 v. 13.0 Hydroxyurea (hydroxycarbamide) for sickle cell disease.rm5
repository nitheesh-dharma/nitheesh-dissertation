<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-03-30 12:11:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>What is the effect of hydroxyurea on clinical outcomes (changes in pain crises, life-threatening illnesses, survival, haemoglobin levels, quality of life and side effects) in people with sickle cell disease (SCD) of any genotype?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>SCD is an inherited genetic disorder that creates problems with haemoglobin (the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body). The disease can be inherited in different ways; people can inherit two sickle genes (HbSS genotype) or they can inherit the sickle gene from one parent and a different haemoglobin gene (such as haemoglobin C (HbSC genotype) or a beta thalassaemia gene (HbS&#946;+ or HbS&#946;ºthal genotype)) from the second parent.</P>
<P>In people with SCD the abnormal sickle haemoglobin forms long polymers (chains) within the red blood cells when they become de-oxygenated. This damages the red blood cells and makes them stickier, leading to blockages and reduced blood flow, causing pain and organ damage. Fetal haemoglobin stops these polymers forming in the sickle haemoglobin within the red blood cell. The drug hydroxyurea is used to raise fetal haemoglobin and can reduce the effects of the disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to 16 January 2017.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included eight studies (899 adults and children with SCD (HbSS, HbSC or HbS&#946;ºthal genotypes)). Studies lasted from six to 30 months.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results and quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>In four studies, 577 adults and children with SCD were randomly selected to receive hydroxyurea or placebo. In two studies, 254 children with SCD, who were also at an increased risk of having a first or second stroke, were randomly selected to receive hydroxyurea and phlebotomy (collection of blood) or blood transfusion and chelation (administration of agents to remove excess iron from the body). These six studies only recruited people with HbSS or HbS&#946;ºthal genotypes so results do not apply to people with the HbSC genotype.</P>
<P>There was moderate quality evidence from these six studies that those receiving hydroxyurea experienced significant reductions in the frequency of pain crises, increases in fetal haemoglobin and decreases in neutrophil (white blood cell) counts compared to the comparator treatment. There was no difference between people receiving hydroxyurea or other treatments in terms of quality of life, deaths during the studies and side effects (including serious and life-threatening side effects); however, there is less information about these outcomes in the studies, so the quality of this evidence is low.</P>
<P>Two further studies were included in the review. In one study, 22 children with SCD, who were also at an increased risk of having a stroke, were randomly selected to receive hydroxyurea or no treatment (observation only) and in one study 44 adults and children were randomly selected to receive treatments with or without adding hydroxyurea. Both studies showed an increase in fetal haemoglobin for people receiving hydroxyurea compared to the comparator treatment and there were no deaths during the studies. There was no difference between people receiving hydroxyurea or other treatments in terms of pain crises and side effects (including serious or life-threatening side effects) and these studies did not measure quality of life. The quality of the evidence from these studies is very low, given the studies were very small and only recruited around 20% of the intended number of people and results do not apply to all people with SCD (different genotypes).</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence shows that hydroxyurea is likely to be effective in the short term at decreasing the frequency of painful episodes and raising fetal haemoglobin levels in the blood in people with SCD. Hydroxyurea is also likely to be effective in preventing first strokes for those at an increased risk of stroke and does not seem to be associated with an increase in any side effects (including serious and life-threatening side effects).</P>
<P>There is currently not much evidence on whether hydroxyurea is beneficial over a long period of time, what the best dose to take is, or whether treatment causes any long-term or serious side effects. More studies are needed to answer these questions.</P>

<P>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common inherited diseases worldwide. It is associated with lifelong morbidity and a reduced life expectancy. Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide), an oral chemotherapeutic drug, ameliorates some of the clinical problems of SCD, in particular that of pain, by raising fetal haemoglobin.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-03-30 11:59:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Seventeen studies were identified in the searches; eight randomised controlled trials were included, recruiting 899 adults and children with SCD (haemoglobin SS (HbSS), haemoglobin SC (HbSC) or haemoglobin S&#946;ºthalassaemia (HbS&#946;ºthal) genotypes). Studies lasted from six to 30 months.</P>
<P>Four studies (577 adults and children with HbSS or HbS&#946;ºthal) compared hydroxyurea to placebo; three recruited individuals with only severe disease and one recruited individuals with all disease severities. There were statistically significant improvements in terms of pain alteration (using measures such as pain crisis frequency, duration, intensity, hospital admissions and opoid use), measures of fetal haemoglobin and neutrophil counts and fewer occurrences of acute chest syndrome and blood transfusions in the hydroxyurea groups. There were no consistent statistically significant differences in terms of quality of life and adverse events (including serious or life-threatening events). Seven deaths occurred during the studies, but the rates by treatment group were not statistically significantly different.</P>
<P>Two studies (254 children with HbSS or HbS&#946;ºthal also with risk of primary or secondary stroke) compared hydroxyurea and phlebotomy to transfusion and chelation; there were statistically significant improvements in terms of measures of fetal haemoglobin and neutrophil counts, but more occurrences of acute chest syndrome and infections in the hydroxyurea and phlebotomy group. There were no consistent statistically significant differences in terms of pain alteration and adverse events (including serious or life-threatening events). Two deaths occurred during the studies (one in a the hydroxyurea treatment arm and one in the control arm), but the rates by treatment group were not statistically significantly different. In the primary prevention study, no strokes occurred in either treatment group but in the secondary prevention study, seven strokes occurred in the hydroxyurea and phlebotomy group (none in the transfusion and chelation group) and the study was terminated early.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for the above two comparisons was judged as moderate to low as the studies contributing to these comparisons were mostly large and well designed (and at low risk of bias); however evidence was limited and imprecise for some outcomes such as quality of life, deaths during the studies and adverse events and results are applicable only to individuals with HbSS and HbS&#946;ºthal genotypes.</P>
<P>Of the remaining two studies, one (22 children with HbSS or HbS&#946;ºthal also at risk of stoke) compared hydroxyurea to observation; there were statistically significant improvements in terms of measures of fetal haemoglobin and neutrophil counts but no statistically significant differences in terms of adverse events (including serious or life-threatening events). </P>
<P>The final study (44 adults and children with HbSC) compared treatment regimens with and without hydroxyurea &#8211; there was statistically significant improvement in terms of measures of fetal haemoglobin, but no statistically significant differences in terms of adverse events (including serious or life-threatening events). No participants died in either of these studies and other outcomes relevant to the review were not reported. </P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for the above two comparisons was judged to be very low due to the limited number of participants, the lack of statistical power (as both studies were terminated early with approximately only 20% of their target sample size recruited) and the lack of applicability to all age groups and genotypes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-03-30 12:01:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>There is evidence to suggest that hydroxyurea is effective in decreasing the frequency of pain episodes and other acute complications in adults and children with sickle cell anaemia of HbSS or HbS&#946;ºthal genotypes and in preventing life-threatening neurological events in those with sickle cell anaemia at risk of primary stroke by maintaining transcranial doppler velocities. However, there is still insufficient evidence on the long-term benefits of hydroxyurea, particularly in preventing chronic complications of SCD, recommending a standard dose or dose escalation to maximum tolerated dose. There is also insufficient evidence about the long-term risks of hydroxyurea, including its effects on fertility and reproduction. Evidence is also limited on the effects of hydroxyurea on individuals with HbSC genotype. Future studies should be designed to address such uncertainties.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-03-30 12:48:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-03-30 12:40:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Haemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disease (SCD), are among the most common inherited disorders in the world. SCD affects people originating from sub-Saharan Africa, Arab countries, the Mediterranean, the Indian subcontinent, the Caribbean and South America, as well as African-Americans and descendants from immigrants from the above countries in other parts of the world. The genetic mutation gives carriers some advantage against malaria and for this reason has persisted. There is an estimated global birth rate of around 300,000 affected individuals per year, the majority of which are in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Piel-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piel 2013</LINK>). There are an estimated 90,000 to 100,000 individuals with SCD in the USA and approximately 12,000 to 15,000 in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Brousseau-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brousseau 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hassell-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassell 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Haemoglobin is responsible for transporting oxygen around the body packaged in red blood cells. SCD is caused by the recessive inheritance of abnormal haemoglobins. People who inherit only one sickle gene and the normal gene for adult haemoglobin (HbA) are sickle cell carriers (sickle cell trait or AS) and are healthy. When people are homozygous, because they have inherited two sickle genes (SS), they have sickle cell anaemia, which is a variable clinical condition, with the vast majority of individuals suffering some pain attacks and a reduced life expectancy. Clinically significant SCD also arises when people inherit the sickle gene from one parent and another variant haemoglobin gene from the second parent such as haemoglobin C (SC) or a beta thalassaemia gene (S&#946;+ or S&#946;0). Sickle haemoglobin, when not carrying oxygen, polymerises distorting the red blood cell into the classic 'sickle' shape. The clinical problems arise predominantly as a result of chronic anaemia and the blockage of small blood vessels, which stops oxygen delivery to the tissues causing pain or organ damage or both.</P>
<P>The most frequent clinical problem is pain which causes over 90% of acute hospital admissions (<LINK REF="REF-Brozovic-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brozovic 1987</LINK>) and significant morbidity in the community (<LINK REF="REF-Fuggle-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuggle 1996</LINK>). Other acute complications include acute chest syndrome, stroke, splenic sequestration, priapism and an increased risk of infection. SCD is a multi-organ disease with a high chronic disease burden which increases with increasing age. The majority of individuals are anaemic with haemoglobin levels of 60 to 90g/L in HbSS. Common chronic complications include chronic sickle lung damage, pulmonary hypertension, renal dysfunction, chronic bony damage (avascular necrosis), retinopathy and leg ulceration (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Whilst the majority of those affected used to die in childhood, and still do within parts of the developing world (<LINK REF="REF-Chakravorty-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chakravorty 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grosse-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grosse 2011</LINK>), death rates in children in higher-income countries have fallen over the past decades and the majority of children (over 95%) now survive to adulthood (<LINK REF="REF-Quinn-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinn 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Telfer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Telfer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Plas-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Plas 2011</LINK>). Data from the USA reviewing national mortality data from 1979 to 2005 has confirmed this decrease in mortality in children, but showed an increased mortality rate in adults with a median age of death of 42 years for women and 38 years for men (<LINK REF="REF-Lanzkron-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanzkron 2013</LINK>). Earlier data from the USA showed a median survival for adults with HbSS in the USA of 42 years in men and 46 years in women and in HbSC of 60 years and 68 years, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Platt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platt 1994</LINK>). This contrasts with Jamaican figures which show median survival for HbSS of 53 years for men and 58.5 years for women (<LINK REF="REF-Wierenga-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wierenga 2001</LINK>) and recent single-centre data from the UK has shown median survival of 67 years in people with HbSS and higher in those with HbSC (<LINK REF="REF-Gardner-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner 2016</LINK>). Data from the USA has also shown an increase in deaths following transition from paediatric to adult services (<LINK REF="REF-Quinn-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinn 2010</LINK>). Death is generally SCD-related and is caused either by chronic organ failure consequent to the sickling process (e.g. renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, hepatic failure) (<LINK REF="REF-Manci-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manci 2003</LINK>) or as a result of an acute catastrophic event, such as stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Powars-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powars 1983</LINK>), acute sickle chest syndrome, splenic sequestration (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 1978</LINK>), sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Manci-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manci 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Plas-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Plas 2011</LINK>) or other complications (<LINK REF="REF-Gray-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lanzkron-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanzkron 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perronne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perronne 2002</LINK>). The UK National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) report reviewed UK mortality data over 48 months and found six paediatric and 40 adult deaths. One paediatric death was due to pneumococcal sepsis and two were due to sub-arachnoid haemorrhage. In adults the main causes of death were stroke, multi-organ failure, acute chest syndrome, renal failure and non-sickle causes (<LINK REF="REF-NCEPOD-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCEPOD 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Improvements in paediatric outcomes are related to the introduction of neonatal screening, early enrolment in comprehensive paediatric care, penicillin prophylaxis, vaccination to decrease life-threatening infection and primary stroke prevention with transcranial Doppler screening. In adults, treatment has relied on the avoidance of factors that precipitate crisis (including dehydration, infection and cold), and symptomatic treatment of the acute painful episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davies-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-STOP-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">STOP 2006</LINK>). Hydroxyurea is currently the only licensed treatment for SCD. Blood transfusion is often required and may be used to treat acute complications or in the long term to treat or prevent disease complications. Haemopoeitic stem cell transplantation is the only currently available curative treatment option and is offered to children with severe disease phenotype and an human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor. Other donor transplant options and adult transplant are currently only available in the context of clinical trials. Gene therapy offers another potential curative treatment and is currently being investigated in clinical trials.<BR/>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-03-30 12:46:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Hydroxyurea (also known as hydroxycarbamide) is an anti-neoplastic oral drug and an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>). The drug has been shown to have many beneficial effects for treating SCD; including increasing fetal haemoglobin (HbF) concentration in red blood cells, improving nitric oxide metabolism, reducing red cell-endothelial interaction and erythrocyte density (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 2010</LINK>). Such disease-modifying effects have been shown to decrease episodes of pain, acute chest syndrome, hospital admissions and the need for transfusions among people with SCD (<LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strouse-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strouse 2008</LINK>); however, frequent monitoring of the person's blood count is required, in addition to monitoring of toxicity. There are recognised, but mostly reversible, side effects of hydroxyurea, such as low neutrophil count, low platelet count, anaemia, rash, headache and occasionally nausea. Furthermore, it may have teratogenic effects and may have an effect on male fertility (<LINK REF="REF-Strouse-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strouse 2008;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Zimmerman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmerman 2004</LINK>). Long-term or serious adverse effects (or both) of hydroxyurea are rare (<LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strouse-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strouse 2008</LINK>) and observational data suggest a survival advantage for those treated with hydroxyurea (<LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Voskaridou-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Voskaridou 2010</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-03-30 12:47:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>It has long been recognised that raised HbF levels can ameliorate the clinical effects of SCD (<LINK REF="REF-Perrine-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perrine 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Platt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platt 1994</LINK>). HbF levels are high at birth and decrease over the first year of life and and hence clinical manifestations are often delayed until the HbF levels decrease. In addition, individuals who inherit high levels of HbF display a milder disease phenotype. This is because the HbF interferes with the polymer formation of the sickle haemoglobin within the red blood cell. This polymerisation is the underlying pathology in SCD. The more HbF there is, the greater the inhibition. Hydroxyurea was first shown to raise HbF levels in SCD in the 1980s (<LINK REF="REF-Platt-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platt 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Veith-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veith 1985</LINK>). Its intermittent toxicity on the bone marrow leads to a stress response and enhanced erythropoiesis and levels of HbF. In addition to its effects on SCD via HbF enhancement, hydroxyurea also improves blood flow and reduces vaso-occlusion via other mechanisms including decrease of adhesion molecules and stimulation of nitric oxide production (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2014</LINK>).</P>

<P>For binary outcomes, we aimed to calculate a pooled estimate of the treatment effect for each outcome across studies, (the risk of an outcome among treatment allocated participants to the corresponding risk among controls). For each study, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all important, dichotomous outcomes. We present RR in preference to odds ratios (OR), as OR give an inflated impression of the size of effect where event rates are high, as is the case of these studies. For the continuous outcomes, we aimed to calculate a pooled estimate of treatment effect, using the mean difference (MD).</P>

In addition, this was a cross-over study which started at 20 mg/kg per day and, unless cytopenia developed this was raised to a maximum of 25 mg/kg per day. In this study the participants were randomised to either hydroxyurea or placebo for the initial six months and then crossed over to the other arm. There was no statistically significant period or carry-over effect present for the outcomes of the number of hospitalisations and the number of days in hospital (period and carry-over effects assessed by the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test).</P>
<P>The CHAMPS study was a randomised multicentre, phase II, double blind placebo-controlled study with a 2x2 factorial design (<LINK REF="STD-CHAMPS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CHAMPS 2011</LINK>). Eligible participants were over the age of five years with HbSC and at least one vaso-occlusive event in the previous 12 months (but none in the four weeks prior to study entry). A total of 44 participants were randomised equally across four treatment groups for 44 weeks: hydroxyurea (20 mg/kg per day) and magnesium (0.6 mmol/kg per day in two doses), hydroxyurea (20 mg/kg per day) and placebo, placebo and magnesium (0.6 mmol/kg per day in two doses), placebo and placebo. The study was not designed to measure efficacy and measured only laboratory measures.The study was terminated early due to low enrolment after 44 participants had been randomised (target 188).</P>
<P>The Jain study was a double blind (participants, personnel and outcome assessors) randomised controlled study conducted in a tertiary hospital in Nagpur City, India (<LINK REF="STD-Jain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2012</LINK>). The study was conducted in children with sickle cell anaemia (proportion with each genotype not stated) between the ages of five and 18 years with three or more blood transfusions or vaso-occlusive crises requiring hospitalisation per year despite high HbF. A total of 60 participants were randomised; 30 to hydroxyurea (fixed dose 10 mg/mg per day) and 30 to a matched placebo for 18 months.</P>
<P>The MSH study was a multicentre North American randomised and double-blind study, which compared hydroxyurea with placebo over two years in adults with sickle cell anemia (SS genotype only) with the objective of reducing the frequency pain crises (<LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>). A total of 299 participants were randomised; 152 to hydroxyurea and 147 to matching placebo. Hydroxyurea was started at low dose (15 mg/kg per day) and increased at 12-weekly intervals by 5 mg/kg per day until mild bone marrow depression, as judged by either neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, at that point the treatment was stopped (as reported for the MSH study) (<LINK REF="REF-Handy-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handy 1996</LINK>). Once the blood count had recovered, treatment was restarted at 2.5 mg/kg per day less than the toxic dose. The study was therefore aiming for the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for each individual within the study. The study was blinded and the study centre recorded and held the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and HbF levels, which were not looked at by the caring physicians as the MCV and HbF levels rise in most people with SS taking hydroxyurea. As a result of the beneficial effects observed in terms of the primary pain outcome, as reported for the MSH study (<LINK REF="REF-Barton-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barton 1996</LINK>), the study was stopped by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the USA at a mean follow-up of 21 months, before the planned 24 months of treatment had been completed for all participants (<LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>). Long-term follow-up continued for the study sample, with all participants offered treatment with hydroxyurea.</P>
<P>The SCATE (Sparing Conversion to Abnormal transcranial doppler (TCD) Elevation) study was a Phase III multicentre, randomised, controlled study conducted in three centres in the USA, Jamaica and Brazil (<LINK REF="STD-SCATE-2015" TYPE="STUDY">SCATE 2015</LINK>). The study was conducted in children with sickle cell anemia (SS, S&#946;º, HbSO<SUP>Arab</SUP>, HbSD), haemoglobin SS (HbSS) or haemoglobin S&#946;º thalassaemia and conditional TCD ultrasound velocities (170 cm to 199 cm per second). A total of 22 participants were randomised; 11 to hydroxyurea at 20 mg/kg with escalation to maximum dose of 35 mg/kg and 11 to standard treatment (observation). The primary aim of the study was to establish whether treatment with hydroxyurea could prevent conversion from conditional to abnormal time averaged mean velocity (TAMV) and subsequent stroke in these children. The planned length of follow-up was 30 months but the study was terminated after 15 months of follow-up due to slow participant accrual and the unlikelihood of meeting the trial recruitment target (100) and the primary endpoint.</P>
<P>The SWiTCH study was a non-inferiority study, comparing hydroxyurea and phlebotomy to standard treatment (transfusion and chelation) using a composite endpoint including secondary stroke prevention and improved management of iron overload. It included children with SCA (HbSS and HbS&#946;ºthal, HbSO<SUP>Arab</SUP>) and previous stroke, who had been receiving chronic transfusions for at least 18 months (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>). It was conducted in 26 sickle cell centres across the USA and a total of 134 children were randomised (67 to the standard treatment and 67 to the hydroxyurea and phlebotomy group). Participants randomised to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy commenced hydroxyurea at 20 mg/kg with escalation to MTD (defined by dose causing mild myelosuppression). Transfusion continued for four to nine months during hydroxyurea dose escalation. Once MTD was reached and transfusion stopped, phlebotomy of 10 mL/kg monthly was performed, if haemoglobin was sufficient.</P>
<P>The TWiTCH study was a multicentre phase III randomised open label (partially masked) non-inferiority study conducted at 26 paediatric hospitals and health centres in the USA and Canada (<LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>). Eligible participants were children aged four to 16 years with SCA (HbSS, HbS&#946;ºthal, HbSO<SUP>Arab</SUP>) and abnormal TCD ultrasound velocities (&#8805; 200 cm per second) if they had received 12 months of chronic transfusions. A total of 121 participants were randomised; 60 to hydroxyurea starting at 20 mg/kg per day escalated to the MTD compared to standard treatment (transfusions) for 24 months. Children randomised to the standard treatment group received their usual chelation therapy or deferasirox to manage iron overload. Children randomised to the hydroxyurea group continued to receive transfusions until hydroxyurea was escalated to the MTD and following the discontinuation of transfusions, children received serial phlebotomy to manage iron overload. The primary aim of the study was to establish whether treatment with hydroxyurea could prevent primary stroke in these children. The study was terminated at the first interim analysis when non-inferiority was demonstrated; the target sample size had been recruited by this point.</P>

<P>One study used an automated telephone response system to randomise participants using lists that had been produced by the medical co-ordinating centre (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>). The SCATE and TWiTCH studies used blocked randomisation and central pharmacy allocation (<LINK REF="STD-SCATE-2015" TYPE="STUDY">SCATE 2015;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK> ). All three studies have been assessed as having a low risk of bias.</P>
<P>The MSH study used computerised block randomisation, the Jain trial used random number tables and the CHAMPS study used a sequential allocation algorithm for randomisation (low risk of bias) but none of these studies clearly stated any method of allocation concealment (unclear risk of bias) (<LINK REF="STD-CHAMPS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CHAMPS 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Belgian study described the randomisation of participants as "drawing sealed envelopes, patients were randomly allocated to one of the following treatment sequences", therefore, the generation and the allocation of the treatment sequence are not clear from this statement (<LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Study-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Study 1996</LINK>). The hospital pharmacy provided the treatment and placebo for each participant and both were described as "indistinguishable." The SWiTCH trial did not discuss the method for randomisation or allocation concealment and therefore this has been graded as unclear (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>).</P>

<BLINDING MODIFIED="2017-02-27 14:35:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The BABY HUG study was described as 'double blind', the study paper stated that "participants, caregivers and medical coordinating centre staff were masked to treatment allocation" (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>). The hydroxyurea and placebo powders were identical in terms of appearance and packaging and the liquid formulations had the same appearance and taste. In the Jain study, participants, clinicians and outcome assessors including laboratory technicians were blinded to treatment allocation with placebo capsules of identical appearance (<LINK REF="STD-Jain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2012</LINK>). These studies were assessed as low risk of performance and detection bias.</P>
<P>In three studies, the blinding of participants and personnel was also not possible due to the differences between the treatments (hydroxyurea and standard treatment) (<LINK REF="STD-SCATE-2015" TYPE="STUDY">SCATE 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>). Outcome assessors were partially masked in these studies for assessments around the primary outcomes related to neurological events such as stroke. Given the objective nature of the primary outcomes of the studies judged by the blinded outcome assessors, these studies were assessed as low risk of detection bias.</P>
<P>The MSH study was described as double blind (physician and participant) (<LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>) and in the CHAMPS study, treatment was assigned in combinations of identically appearing capsules and blinding was achieved by 'over-capsulating' tablets (<LINK REF="STD-CHAMPS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CHAMPS 2011</LINK>). These two studies were assessed as low risk of performance bias. The Belgian study was single-blinded (the participant was unaware of the treatment schedule but the physician was aware of the treatment schedule) because of the difficulty of blinding the attending physician to the treatment received (<LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Study-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Study 1996</LINK>). It was not stated whether outcome assessors were blinded in any of these three studies.</P>

<EXCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-03-30 14:11:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>In four studies, the risk of bias was assessed as low since withdrawals from treatment were documented, an intention-to-treat analysis approach in primary analyses was used and all randomised participants were included in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Jain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the BABY HUG study, an intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken for primary outcomes (via multiple imputation methods to account for missing data) and for safety outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>). Some of the secondary outcomes were reported for only the individuals who completed the study or had data recorded for specific measurements, but given that primary and important safety outcomes were reported using an intention-to-treat analysis, this study was judged to be at a low risk of bias.</P>
<P>In the SCATE study, due to the early termination of the study, two randomised participants did not receive their allocated treatment (<LINK REF="STD-SCATE-2015" TYPE="STUDY">SCATE 2015</LINK>). The primary analysis of this study used an intention-to-treat approach and a sensitivity analysis considered the actual treatment received so this study was also assessed as having a low risk of bias.</P>
<P>In the Belgian study, three participants were excluded from the analysis due to their failure to attend their monthly evaluation at four to five months (<LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Study-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Study 1996</LINK>). There was no discussion of whether or not an intention-to-treat analysis was used, therefore, the risk of bias was judged to be unclear.</P>
<P>In the CHAMPS study, only participants who completed eight weeks (primary outcome) or 44 weeks (secondary outcomes) of follow-up were included in the results (<LINK REF="STD-CHAMPS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CHAMPS 2011</LINK>). This is not an intention-to-treat approach so this trial was judged to be at high risk of bias.</P>

<P>Three studies defined outcomes in their methods sections, which were reported in the results, and were thus assessed as having a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>). The CHAMPS study was not designed to measure efficacy and reported only laboratory-based outcomes; all of these outcomes were well-defined in the methods and reported in the results, so this study was assessed to be at a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-CHAMPS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CHAMPS 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the primary publication of the TWiTCH study, it was stated the the secondary outcomes of neuropsychological status, quality of life and growth would be published at a later date (<LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>). For the SWiTCH study, some outcomes (such as growth and development, functional evaluations, neurocognitive evaluations) do not yet seem to have been reported (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>). As we are not able to include the results at this time, we have judged these studies to be at a high risk of selective reporting bias. If these results can be included at a later date then this judgement will be reconsidered (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>). The final two studies planned to measure outcomes which were not reported due to difficulty in collecting the information to inform these outcomes; these studies are also judged to be at a high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Study-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Study 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SCATE-2015" TYPE="STUDY">SCATE 2015</LINK>).</P>

<P>This comparison includes a single study (<LINK REF="STD-CHAMPS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CHAMPS 2011</LINK>). We note that this study recruits only individuals with HbSC; however, this comparison (and other comparisons) are worded to allow for future studies to be included in updates of this review which recruit individuals of all genotypes to contribute to this comparison.</P>
<P>We have conducted meta-analyses for comparisons 1 and 2 (above) where appropriate and presented results narratively or in additional tables (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Data are not entered into analysis for the Belgian and CHAMPS studies due to the presentation of results from cross-over and factorial designs respectively; results are reported narratively (<LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Study-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Study 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CHAMPS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CHAMPS 2011</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Pain alteration</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Hydroxyurea compared to placebo for participants with SCD</HEADING>
<P>The MSH study defined pain crisis as a visit to a medical facility, lasting four or more hours, requiring opiate analgesia (<LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>). There was a statistically significant difference between the hydroxyurea group and placebo group in the mean annual crisis rate (all crises), MD -2.80 (95% CI -4.74 to -0.86) (P = 0.005) and for crises requiring hospitalisation, MD -1.50 (95% CI -2.58 to -0.42) (P = 0.007) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The MSH study also showed a reduction in median time (Kaplan-Meier life table estimate) from the initiation of treatment to first painful crisis (2.76 months in the hydroxyurea arm compared with 1.35 months on placebo (Cox regression P value = 0.014), second painful crisis (6.58 months in the hydroxyurea group compared with 4.13 months on placebo (Cox regression P value &lt; 0.0024), and third painful crisis (11.9 months in the hydroxyurea group compared with 7.04 months on placebo (Cox regression P value = 0.0002) (reported in <LINK REF="REF-Charache-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charache 1995</LINK>). We note that the analysis of time-to-first, second and third painful crisis seems to treat crisis events independently which is unlikely to be a realistic assumption. Furthermore, information relating to the analgesia used by participants in this study has been reported, but has not been presented according to the groups to which the participants were randomised (reported in <LINK REF="REF-Ballas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballas 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Jain study presented the number of clinical events (vaso-occlusive crises) before and after intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Jain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2012</LINK>). We could not calculate change from baseline in the number of clinical events so we have analysed between group data at 18 months and presented the before and after data in an additional table (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). After 18 months of treatment, there was a statistically significant difference between the hydroxyurea group and placebo group, MD -9.60 (95% CI -10.86 to -8.34) (P &lt; 0.00001) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The BABY HUG study showed a statistically significantly lower proportion of participants experiencing pain in the hydroxyurea group compared to the placebo group, RR 0.68 (95% CI 0.5 to 0.92) (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Belgian study stated that "16 patients out of 22 (73%) did not require any hospitalisation for painful episodes when treated with hydroxyurea as compared with only 3 of 22 (14%) when treated with placebo" (<LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Study-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Study 1996</LINK>). In addition, it showed as reduction in mean hospital stay, with a stay of 5.3 days in the hydroxyurea group and 15.2 days in the placebo group. A planned outcome of 'number of days in pain' was not reported in the trial publication due to difficulties in collecting this information from participants.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">5. Adverse effects or toxicity</HEADING>
<P>As it is difficult to distinguish between adverse reactions (i.e. adverse events which are definitely drug-related) and other adverse events which may be sickle- or transfusion-related, we have reported all adverse events (or adverse effects) as they are reported in the study publications. Where possible, we have noted which adverse effects are defined as drug-related, sickle-related or transfusion-related from the study publications.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Hydroxyurea compared to placebo for participants with SCD</HEADING>
<P>The possible adverse effects reported in the MSH study were hair loss, skin rash, fever, gastro-intestinal disturbance, and 'other' reported events (<LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups with these measures (<LINK REF="CMP-001.52" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.52</LINK>). In the MSH study, toxicity relating to the blood count was defined as less than 2500 x 10&#8313; neutrophils/L, less than 95,000 x 10&#8313; platelets/L, and haemoglobin concentration less than 5.3 g/dL (<LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>). Using these definitions 120 of the hydroxyurea-treated participants (79%) and 54 placebo participants (37%) became 'toxic' at least once, resulting in a dose modification. Importantly, no infections were related to neutropenia and no 'bleeding' episode could be related to thrombocytopenia.</P>
<P>The BABY HUG study reported the proportion of participants experiencing a range of adverse events such as dactylitis, priapism, sepsis or bacteraemia, splenomegaly, ANC below 500, ANC 500 to 1250, thrombocytopaenia, severe anaemia, alanine transaminase over 150, bilirubin, creatinine, skin and subcutaneous disorders and splenic sequestration (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>). The rates of these specific events were generally quite similar with only dactylitis and gastroenteritis showing any differences between the two treatment groups, with statistically significantly fewer events in the hydroxyurea group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.52" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.52</LINK>); however, given the number of outcomes measured and the increased probability of type I statistical error and spurious group differences, the statistical significance must be carefully interpreted.</P>
<P>No major adverse events occurred in either group in the Jain study (<LINK REF="STD-Jain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2012</LINK>); three participants in the hydroxyurea group experienced skin rash and two experienced nausea, but this was not a statistically significant difference compared to the placebo group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.52" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.52</LINK>). No participants experienced alopecia, leucopenia, neutropenia, renal or hepatic toxicity.</P>

There were 19 adverse events related to chelation treatment in nine children in the control group (aminotransferases, gastrointestinal symptoms, increased serum creatinine, increased serum bilirubin, rash) and 18 adverse events related to phlebotomy in 14 children in the hydroxyurea treatment group (details not stated). No events related to hydroxyurea were reported. There was insufficient information to enter into the analysis, we hope to include any future information in an update.</P>
<P>In the SWiTCH study, there were a total of 1253 non-neurological adverse events in 128 individuals, there was no statistically significant difference between groups in the number of participants experiencing any adverse event, RR 0.99 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.05) (P = 0.66) (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.17</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-04-10 12:23:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Eight randomised controlled studies were eligible for inclusion in this review, with a total of 899 children and adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Study-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Study 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CHAMPS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CHAMPS 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SCATE-2015" TYPE="STUDY">SCATE 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>). The studies included in the review made the following comparisons: hydroxyurea compared to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Study-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Study 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>); hydroxyurea compared to no hydroxyurea (<LINK REF="STD-CHAMPS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CHAMPS 2011</LINK>); hydroxyurea and phlebotomy compared to transfusion and chelation for the prevention of primary or secondary stroke (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>); and hydroxyurea compared to observation for participants at an increased risk of stroke (<LINK REF="STD-SCATE-2015" TYPE="STUDY">SCATE 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The randomised studies comparing hydroxyurea with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Study-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Study 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>) all showed a decrease in pain crises (albeit with slightly different criteria) in adults and children with sickle cell anaemia. The BABY HUG study also showed decreased rates of pain in the hydroxyurea group compared to placebo. This widening of inclusion criteria has had an important role in increasing indications for and use of hydroxyurea. Two studies comparing transfusion and hydroxyurea showed that transfusion was more effective in preventing 'serious' sickle-related pain (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>), but there was no difference in all pain events between the two groups, as reported by one study (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Rates of acute chest syndrome (ACS) were decreased in those taking hydroxyurea when compared with those taking placebo and this was true in adults (<LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>) and children (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2012</LINK>). Similar decreases were seen in transfusion rates, a surrogate for life-threatening illness (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>). Hydroxyurea did not prevent rates of hepatic or splenic sequestration when compared with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The role of hydroxyurea compared with transfusion in the prevention of stroke has been investigated in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>). The SWiTCH study included people with a previous stroke who had received at least 18 months of transfusion and randomised between ongoing transfusion therapy and hydroxyurea and phlebotomy (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>). Treatment with hydroxyurea and phlebotomy was not expected to be as effective as transfusion in the reduction of secondary stroke but was expected to improve liver iron loads so a composite primary end point was used including stroke recurrence and liver iron concentration. In the 133 participants there were no strokes in the transfusion and chelation group but seven strokes (10%) in the hydroxyurea and phlebotomy group without concomitant improvement liver iron concentration leading to early trial closure. Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy were not as effective as transfusion for secondary stroke prevention. In the TWiTCH study, hydroxyurea was compared with transfusion in children with abnormal transcranial doppler (TCD) velocities who had received transfusion for at least one year and had no evidence of vasculopathy on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) (<LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>). Hydroxyurea was as effective as transfusion in preventing further stroke and final TCD velocity was lower in the hydroxyurea group. These findings are supported by observational data showing that in a non-trial situation in children with abnormal TCDs who have normalised with transfusion, hydroxyurea can be used to maintain normal TCDs (<LINK REF="REF-Bernaudin-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernaudin 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the randomised studies included in this analysis there was no statistically significant differences in mortality between any treatment and control group. Follow-up from cohorts from the MSH study have been published at nine and 17.5 years (<LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>), although randomisation ceased after trial closure and participants could choose whether to take hydroxyurea or not (<LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 2010</LINK>). These follow-up studies both confirmed reduced mortality in the group taking hydroxyurea although the analysis was according to cumulative exposure to hydroxyurea and not the original randomisation. Further supporting evidence for reduced mortality with hydroxyurea comes from a prospective non-randomized trial (LasHS) from Greece with 17 years of follow-up which showed improved probability of 10-year survival in participants who were treated with hydroxyurea (<LINK REF="REF-Voskaridou-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Voskaridou 2010</LINK>). These results should be treated cautiously as the participants were not randomised and the analysis of mortality in an observational study is more complex.</P>
<P>In terms of chronic organ damage; there were no statistically significant differences in renal and splenic function (the primary outcomes of <LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>). Hydroxyurea had no significant effect on glomerular filtration rate over the two years of treatment, but it did improve urine concentrating ability and there was less renal enlargement in the hydroxyurea-treated groups.</P>
<P>Several of the randomised studies showed a statistically significant increase in HbF levels in the groups treated with hydroxyurea, in keeping with the mechanism of action of the drug. This was seen both in participants treated with the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of hydroxyurea (<LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>) and those treated with a standard dose (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2012</LINK>). A statistically significant increase in Hb level was seen in studies which compared hydroxyurea to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Study-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Study 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CHAMPS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CHAMPS 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2012;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-SCATE-2015" TYPE="STUDY">SCATE 2015</LINK>) and a decrease in haemolytic markers with hydroxyurea treatment was seen in some of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2012;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Those studies which used dose escalation to the MTD (<LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SCATE-2015" TYPE="STUDY">SCATE 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>), showed greater rates of cytopenias, which are expected as the dose of the drug is raised. The MSH study showed increased haematological toxicity resulting in a dose reduction in the hydroxyurea group as compared with placebo, but there were no infections related to neutropenia or bleeding episodes due to thrombocytopenia (<LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>). Similarly, the SWiTCH study showed significantly increased rates of reticulocytopenia, neutropenia and anaemia in the hydroxyurea group, compared with transfusion (<LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>). The BABY HUG study which used a standard dose of 20 mg/kg of hydroxyurea showed an increase in neutropenia (in terms of absolute neurophil count) in the hydroxyurea group but no increase in events of thrombocytopenia and no increase in the number of infections (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>). There are no randomised studies comparing the effect of using a standard dose versus dose escalation to the MTD. Clearly, with careful laboratory monitoring and appropriate patient education, cytopenia should rarely represent a major issue as demonstrated.</P>
<P>In the randomised studies comparing hydroxyurea with placebo there was no increase in adverse events related to hydroxyurea including hair loss, skin rash, fever and gastro-intestinal disturbance. In addition, in the MSH study there was no increase in the incidence of leg ulcers and avascular necrosis in those treated with hydroxyurea. This is important as they have both been associated with hydroxyurea use in observational reports and leg ulcers are associated with hydroxyurea use in people with myeloproliferative disease. Furthermore, observational data looking at 15 years of hydroxyurea use from infancy has not shown any concerns about safety (<LINK REF="REF-Hankins-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hankins 2014</LINK>), although as with the mortality data this is not based on randomised data and should be treated with caution.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-04-10 12:30:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Evidence from the eight included studies is extensive and for four of the studies it is reported across many publications (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>). Furthermore as discussed in the <LINK TAG="SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Summary of main results</LINK>, evidence from these randomised studies is generally supported by longer-term or observation evidence (or both).</P>
<P>There are still questions about the impact of hydroxyurea on the chronic organ damage associated with SCD. Results from the BABY HUG study showed improved urine concentrating ability and less renal enlargement in the hydroxyurea-treated groups. These results suggest that hydroxyurea may have some beneficial effect on renal function, but these results do not automatically translate into clinical benefit (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>). The long-term effect of hydroxyurea therefore, would benefit from further study, including effects on brain development, IQ, growth and development, as well as the prevention and management of chronic organ damage.</P>
<P>As a chemotherapeutic agent, the cytostatic effects of hydroxyurea are different from those of radiation, alkylating agents and other anti-cancer drugs, many of which are known to increase the risk of development of either leukaemia or cancer. Long-term follow-up of people taking hydroxyurea for other diagnoses, including polycythaemia rubra vera (<LINK REF="REF-Berk-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berk 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fruchtman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fruchtman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Najean-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Najean 1997</LINK>), essential thrombocythaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Sterkers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterkers 1998</LINK>) and cyanotic heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Triadou-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Triadou 1994</LINK>), has shown no increase in malignancies in those with normal bone marrows and no significant increase in the other groups. There has been no evidence of malignancy in those with SCD treated with hydroxyurea in large observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Steinberg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinberg 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Voskaridou-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Voskaridou 2010</LINK>). Small numbers of case reports have reported myelodysplasia or acute leukaemia in people with SCD treated with hydroxyurea and two of these have been associated with 17p deletions. This is of interest as 17p deletions have also been associated with the development of myelodysplasia or acute leukaemia in people with myeloproliferative disease treated with hydroxyurea (<LINK REF="REF-Aumont-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aumont 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baz 2012</LINK>). In vitro work has not shown increased chromosome breakages or decreased repair in people with SCD on hydroxyurea (<LINK REF="REF-McGann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGann 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Concerns have been raised about whether hydroxyurea is associated with abnormal spermatogenesis and teratogenic effects but there are few data to confirm or refute that. There is a theoretical risk of hydroxyurea affecting sperm development and abnormal spermatogenesis has been shown in animals treated with hydroxyurea. Sperm abnormalities, including oligospermia and azoospermia, have been shown in males with SCD taking hydroxyurea, but it is not clear if these are due to the hydroxyurea as similar abnormalities have been described in males with SCD not taking hydroxyurea. One small study compared semen analysis before, during and after hydroxyurea treatment and showed semen parameters were affected whilst on hydroxyurea and did not seem to recover quickly (<LINK REF="REF-Berthaut-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berthaut 2008</LINK>). This included only small numbers of individuals and needs further investigation.</P>
<P>Evidence of adverse outcomes and teratogenic effects in humans exposed to hydroxyurea in utero is limited. There is case report evidence of women with malignant disease taking hydroxyurea through pregnancy with no adverse effects on the fetus and 17-year follow-up of the MSH study has shown no adverse fetal outcomes in males or females taking hydroxyurea at conception (<LINK REF="REF-Ballas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballas 2009</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>) . An expert panel report evaluating the toxicity of hydroxyurea has led to recommendations that hydroxyurea is stopped in men and women who are trying to conceive and in breastfeeding women (<LINK REF="REF-National-Toxicology-Program-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Toxicology Program 2008</LINK>). The risks of stopping hydroxyurea whilst attempting conception should be carefully discussed with the individual.</P>
<P>The CHAMPS study was the only study to include participants with HbSC (<LINK REF="STD-CHAMPS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CHAMPS 2011</LINK>). It was not powered to measure efficacy and terminated early due to low enrolment so it is not possible to make conclusions about the efficacy of hydroxyurea in prevention of pain episodes in people with HbSC. Observational data suggest it may be safe and effective in selected individuals, but this needs further study with a phase 3 randomised study (<LINK REF="REF-Luchtman_x002d_Jones-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luchtman-Jones 2016</LINK>). A total of 165 people with HbS/B+thalassaemia were included in one observational study but only 44 received hydroxyurea and efficacy on this subgroup was not presented separately (<LINK REF="REF-Voskaridou-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Voskaridou 2010</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-04-10 13:05:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>We judged the quality of the evidence for the comparison 'Hydroxyurea compared to placebo' to be moderate for most outcomes and low for quality of life and adverse events, where data were more limited and imprecise (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Similarly, we judged the quality of the evidence for the comparison 'Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy compared to transfusion and chelation for participants with SCD and risk of stroke' to be moderate (life-threatening illness and measures of fetal haemoglobin and neutrophil counts) or low quality (pain alteration, deaths during the study and adverse events) where data were more limited and imprecise (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The studies contributing the majority of the evidence to these comparison were large, generally well designed and of low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SWiTCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SWiTCH 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>). These studies recruited only individuals with haemoglobin SS genotype (HbSS) or haemoglobin S&#946;º (HbS&#946;º) thalassemia genotypes, therefore, results are not applicable to those with haemoglobin SC genotype (HbSC) genotypes. Furthermore, for the two most recently completed studies, results for secondary outcomes such as neuropsychological status, growth and development, functional evaluations and neurocognitive evaluations have not yet been reported. Any results relevant to this review from further publications will be included in this review.</P>
<P>For the other two comparisons in the review 'Hydroxyurea compared to observation for participants with SCD and risk of stroke' and 'Hydroxyurea compared to no hydroxyurea for participants with SCD,' evidence was limited and of very low quality (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>). Only a single study contributed to each outcome and both of these studies are likely underpowered due to early termination after recruiting only around 20% of their target participants. Furthermore, due to the factorial design of one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-CHAMPS-2011" TYPE="STUDY">CHAMPS 2011</LINK>), a direct comparison between hydroxyurea and a control treatment was not possible so all results for this comparison must be interpreted as indirect.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-04-10 12:33:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>A rigorous methodological approach was applied to the review and a comprehensive search strategy was employed as outlined in <LINK TAG="ELECTRONIC_SEARCHES" TYPE="SECTION">Electronic searches</LINK>, therefore, we do not believe that our methodological approach has introduced any bias into the review.</P>
<P>Given the designs of some of the studies included in this review (e.g. cross-over, factorial) and differing study-defined definitions of the outcomes of interest to this review, in many instances we felt it would be more appropriate to summarise results narratively or perform separate analyses rather than attempting to adjust original results in order to perform meta-analysis.</P>
<P>We encourage particular caution when interpreting results of the outcome 'adverse events or toxicity', as it is difficult to distinguish between adverse reactions (i.e. adverse events which are definitely drug-related) and other adverse events which may be sickle- or transfusion-related. For completeness, we have reported all "adverse events" or "adverse effects" as they are reported in the study publications, regardless of any noted relationship to treatment.</P>

<P>As described earlier in this section, there have been several studies supporting the findings of this review. In addition to these, numerous reviews and other studies discussing the role of hydroxyurea in SCD are available but this is the only Cochrane Review of the topic. A report from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reviewed 414 studies reporting on the role of hydroxyurea in SCD (published up until July 2014) included five of the randomised studies included in this review (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2014</LINK>). In some cases in the NIH review, where a literature search was not conducted or was insufficient, the panel relied on their cumulative expertise and knowledge to make consensus-panel recommendations as outlined below.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-04-10 12:44:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-04-10 12:42:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The initial randomised studies showed efficacy of hydroxyurea in decreasing pain episodes and other acute complications in adults and children with HbSS and HbSßº-thalassemia (<LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Study-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Study 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>). This led to recommendations that hydroxyurea should be offered to this group of individuals. The evidence of similar efficacy in a group of infants not selected for severity (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>) is suggestive that all infants with sickle cell anaemia may benefit from hydroxyurea. This has led to recommendations that it should be offered to all children with sickle cell anaemia regardless of clinical severity (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2014</LINK>) and has led to an increased use of hydroxyurea, particularly in children. There is still insufficient evidence on the long-term benefits of hydroxyurea, particularly in the prevention of the chronic complications of SCD and also insufficient evidence about the long-term risks of hydroxyurea including its effects on fertility and reproduction. Hydroxyurea is the only licensed drug for the treatment of SCD and its efficacy in reducing the acute complications of the disease and potential risks of use should be discussed with all individuals with SCD and the families of children with SCD, allowing them to take an informed decision about its use.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend its routine use in those individuals with genotypes other than sickle cell anaemia, but its potential benefits and risks of use should be discussed with those with a severe disease phenotype.</P>
<P>Randomised comparisons of hydroxyurea and transfusion showed that hydroxyurea seems to be as effective as transfusion in preventing stroke in children with sickle cell anaemia and abnormal TCD velocities who have received at least one year of transfusion therapy and have no evidence of vasculopathy on MRA. Hydroxyurea does not seem to be as effective as transfusion therapy in preventing stroke in children with sickle cell anaemia who have already experienced a stroke. Hydroxyurea should be offered to children in the former group (sickle cell anaemia, abnormal TCD velocity, normal MRA, received at least one year of transfusion therapy) as an alternative to long-term transfusion therapy.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence on whether to prescribe a standard dose or dose escalation to the MTD. All individuals treated with hydroxyurea should remain in long-term follow-up, which should include regular blood monitoring.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-04-10 12:44:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Many questions remain unanswered relating to the role of hydroxyurea in SCD (as discussed below). All of these questions need to be addressed by appropriately structured randomised controlled studies. However, there is a need for international agreement on a baseline common data set which should be collected in such studies so that they can be analysed later using meta-analysis techniques, as well as the need for standardised and validated measures for sickle painful crisis and quality of life in people with SCD.</P>
<P>The continued long-term follow-up of the participants of the MSH and BABY HUG studies, with regular reporting of outcomes, is welcomed (<LINK REF="STD-BABY-HUG-2011" TYPE="STUDY">BABY HUG 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MSH-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MSH 1995</LINK>). Particular issues for future studies include:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the impact of hydroxyurea on the chronic complications of SCD;</LI>
<LI>the role of hydroxyurea in the management of specific hard to treat complications of SCD of all ages;</LI>
<LI>study of the long-term toxicity profile of hydroxyurea in SCD;</LI>
<LI>the impact of low (15 mg/kg per day) or medium dose (20 mg/kg per day) hydroxyurea dosage in SCD versus dose escalation to maximum tolerated dose;</LI>
<LI>role of hydroxyurea in developing countries;</LI>
<LI>the impact of hydroxyurea in genotypes other than HbSS.</LI>

<P>The final secondary outcome (cost effectiveness of hydroxyurea) has been added at the 2005 update of this review but removed in the 2017 update of the review as economic methods which are outside the scope of Cochrane reviews are required to truly reflect cost-effectiveness of an intervention.</P>
<P>The protocol stated that odds ratios would be used as the measure of treatment effect for dichotomous data, however on reflection, we felt it more appropriate to present risk ratios in preference to odds ratios (OR), as odds ratios give an inflated impression of the size of effect where event rates are high, as is the case of these studies.</P>
<P>2017 update: definition of primary outcome 'Pain Alteration' updated to better reflect the measures which are suitable for inclusion under this outcome.</P>
<P>2017 update: We changed the definition of the outcome: "Any reported adverse effects or toxicity of hydroxyurea recorded" to "Reported adverse effects or toxicity" as it is difficult to distinguish between adverse reactions (i.e. adverse events which are definitely drug related) and other adverse events which may be sickle or transfusion related. Where reported in study reports, we have separated reported adverse effects into drug-related, sickle-related, transfusion-related etc.</P>
<P>In the 2017 update of the review, serious adverse events reported in included studies (whether treatment-related or not) were included under the definition of primary outcome 'Life-threatening illness.'</P>

<P>1. Absolute data presented for number of deaths as the confidence interval of the relative effect very large due to the small number of events.<BR/>2. Different measures presented - mean or median change from baseline - therefore data from all studies could not be pooled.<BR/>3. Quality of life data was collected in <LINK REF="STD-TWiTCH-2016" TYPE="STUDY">TWiTCH 2016</LINK>; to date, primary results of this study have been published but not quality of life data. When available, quality of life data will be included in an update of this review.<BR/>4. Downgraded once due to applicability: only children with HbSS or HbS&#946;º-thalassemia were included therefore results are not applicable to adults or individuals with HbSC genotype.<BR/>5. Downgraded once due to imprecision: small number of events and large CI around the relative effect.<BR/>6. Downgraded once due to imprecision/uncertainty: caution is encouraged regarding the interpretation of these results due to the number of separate outcomes considered in analysis and the increased probability of a statistical type I error.</P>
