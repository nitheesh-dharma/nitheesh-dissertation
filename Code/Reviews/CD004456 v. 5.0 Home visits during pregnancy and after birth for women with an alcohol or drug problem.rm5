<P>Not enough information on home visiting in pregnancy and after the birth for women with an alcohol or drug problem.</P>
<P>Women with an alcohol or drug problem in pregnancy are at increased risk of miscarriage, low birthweight babies, infections and postnatal depression, and the babies of withdrawal symptoms or impaired development. Home visits by individuals, teams of health professionals or trained lay people are aimed at improving health and social outcomes for mothers and babies. The review of seven trials, 803 women, found evidence that home visits after the birth may increase the engagement of these women in drug treatment services and their use of contraception, but there were insufficient data to say if this improved the health of the baby or mother. Further research is needed, with visits starting during pregnancy.</P>

<P>Seven studies (reporting 803 mother-infant pairs) compared home visits mostly after birth with no home visits. Visitors included community health nurses, paediatric nurses, trained counsellors, paraprofessional advocates, midwives and lay African-American women. Several studies had significant methodological limitations. There was no significant difference in continued illicit drug use (three studies, 384 women; risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.24), continued alcohol use (three studies, 379 women; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.46), failure to enrol in a drug treatment program (two studies, 211 women; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.94), not breastfeeding at six months (two studies, 260 infants; RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.10), incomplete six-month infant vaccination schedule (two studies, 260 infants; RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.32), the Bayley Mental Development Index (three studies, 199 infants; mean difference 2.89, 95% CI -1.17 to 6.95) or Psychomotor Index (MD 3.14, 95% CI -0.03 to 6.32), child behavioural problems (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.01), infants not in care of biological mother (two studies, 254 infants; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.39), non-accidental injury and non-voluntary foster care (two studies, 254 infants; RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.23) or infant death (three studies, 288 infants; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.12 to 4.16). Individual studies reported a significant reduction in involvement with child protective services (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.74) and failure to use postpartum contraception (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.82).</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-12-01 08:31:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-30 09:33:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Regular use of alcohol and drugs in pregnancy is common, with 12% of pregnant US women reporting recent alcohol use, 3% illicit drug use and 1% illicit drugs other than marijuana (<LINK REF="REF-NHSDA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHSDA 2000</LINK>). In Australia, 75% of pregnant or breastfeeding women reported using alcohol in the previous 12 months, 18% marijuana and 8% illicit drugs other than marijuana (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2000</LINK>). However, these surveys only record the 'regular' use of alcohol or illicit drugs, which is not necessarily at levels where there is evidence of associated harm. Whereas the excessive use of alcohol in pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of miscarriage, a reduction in fetal growth and impaired neurodevelopment (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCOG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 1999</LINK>), the effects of lower levels of alcohol consumption are controversial, with no conclusive evidence that occasional or light consumption (below 120 g per week) has adverse effects on fetal growth or infant development (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 1999</LINK>). The focus of this review is on pregnant women who have an alcohol or drug problem, and not those who use alcohol occasionally or lightly.</P>
<P>Drug addiction in pregnant women is associated with detrimental effects to both the mother's and baby's health. Mothers with drug addictions frequently have a history of poor antenatal and postnatal care and tend to be socially disadvantaged (<LINK REF="REF-Hulse-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulse 1997b</LINK>). This can result in adverse pregnancy outcomes including spontaneous miscarriage (<LINK REF="REF-Lutiger-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lutiger 1991</LINK>), antepartum haemorrhage and abruption (<LINK REF="REF-Hulse-1997a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulse 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hulse-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulse 1998b</LINK>), low birthweight (<LINK REF="REF-Hulse-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulse 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hulse-1997c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulse 1997c</LINK>), and possibly neonatal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Hulse-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulse 1998a</LINK>). Those mothers who attend their primary health carer late in pregnancy and who have infrequent antenatal care have worse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes than those who attend early (<LINK REF="REF-Hulse-1997c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulse 1997c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hulse-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulse 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hulse-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulse 1998b</LINK>). Women injecting drugs are also at risk of infection including hepatitis C and HIV, with the potential for vertical transmission to the infant (<LINK REF="REF-Spencer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 1997</LINK>). Infants born to mothers with a drug use problem, especially those using opiates, may suffer a neonatal abstinence syndrome requiring treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2005b</LINK>). They are probably at increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Fares-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fares 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kandall-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandall 1993</LINK>) and subsequently for reduced developmental goal attainment, either as a result of a direct effect of drug or alcohol use, or as a result of the associated environmental and lifestyle factors associated with their use (<LINK REF="REF-Belcher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belcher 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Faden-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faden 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frank-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frank 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacobson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 2002</LINK>). In some populations, there have been documented increased incidences of child abuse or neglect (<LINK REF="REF-Besinger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Besinger 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nair-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nair 1997</LINK>) and child deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Jaudes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaudes 1997</LINK>). Mother-infant attachment and responsiveness is also compromised with postnatal depression and domestic violence further complicating the relationship. Mothers subsequently tend to be reluctant to attend health facilities for education, medical treatment or social support.</P>
<P>Home visits are one way of facilitating pregnant mothers with a drug or alcohol problem linking in with health care. Home visits have been the subject of several previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Kendrick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendrick 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1996</LINK>). Home visiting may utilise individuals or teams of health professionals (counsellors, nurses, social workers) or trained lay people with the aim of improving health and social outcomes for mothers and infants. Interventions may include those directed at harmful drug and alcohol use, pregnancy care, health surveillance and promotion, counselling, social support, education, facilitation of mother-infant interaction and promotion of parenting. Potential benefits include earlier and more intensive pregnancy care, improved pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, reduced drug and alcohol use, better mother-infant interaction and an improved home environment. As a result, home visits have the potential to improve longer-term outcomes resulting in a reduction in domestic violence, child neglect or abuse and subsequent mother-infant separation, improved neurodevelopmental outcomes, better school performance and fewer problems in adolescence and young adulthood (<LINK REF="STD-Olds-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Olds 2002</LINK>). However, in trials of home visits, separation of mother and infant may be reduced by effective home intervention services but conversely increased by a higher level of surveillance and hence reporting. The potential benefits need to be balanced with the safety of the home visiting team and costs to the community of the services. Concerns have been expressed about the modifying effects of high-level domestic violence on the effectiveness of home visitation (<LINK REF="REF-Eckenrode-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eckenrode 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gomby-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomby 2000</LINK>). Specific home visiting interventions that may be of benefit include: linking the woman into drug and alcohol services including opiate replacement therapy to reduce illicit and intravenous drug use; pregnancy care including monitoring and treatment of infection; nutritional advice and support; recognition of pregnancy complications including preterm labour; facilitation of appropriate delivery care; support for breastfeeding in the postpartum; monitoring of mother's and infant's health including provision for vaccinations and early childhood health care; and the facilitation of the mother-infant interaction through education or the use of specific interventions designed to improve infant development such as the Carolina Preschool Curriculum and the Hawaii Early Learning Program. Home visiting services may take a non-judgmental and supportive role or a more directive approach in which the goals are to monitor the families' compliance with standards of parenting care and ensure the infant's welfare. This has the potential to impact on the ability of the carers to engage the mother and family, resulting in acceptance or rejection of help offered and potential for further disengagement.</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to determine the effects of home visits during pregnancy and after birth for women with an alcohol or drug problem. Outcomes included all important parent and infant related benefits and harms, and community benefits and costs. As alcohol and drug abuse frequently co-exist, this review focused on both alcohol and drug abuse and examined the evidence for a differential effect of home visits in subgroup analyses.</P>

If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if we detected substantial statistical heterogeneity, we planned to use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if we considered an average treatment effect across trials clinically meaningful.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bartu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bartu 2006</LINK> used research midwifes for after birth home visits at weeks one, two and four, then monthly until six months post-partum. Each visit lasted from one to two hours. Any difficulties encountered by the mother were addressed at each visit. Content of visits included assessment of mother and infant well being, parent craft, stress management, relaxation techniques, addressing major issues, and providing immunisation and Pap smear information, and links to community services. Control group received a telephone contact at two months and a home visit at six months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Black-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1994</LINK> used two part-time community health nurses to provide one-hour home visits from two weeks prepartum biweekly to 18 months postpartum. An armed escort was provided for the visits. The visits lasted one hour. The nurses formed an alliance with the clients, addressed personal, family and environmental needs and facilitated mother-infant interaction. They provided information and advocacy, and performed developmental interventions using the Carolina Preschool Curriculum and Hawaii Early Learning Program. The control group received no home visits. Both groups attended a primary healthcare multidisciplinary team dedicated to treatment of infants born to substance abusing and/or HIV infected mothers.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Butz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Butz 1998</LINK> used paediatric nurse specialists to provide 16 postpartum home visits from birth to 18 months. They provided emotional support, modelled positive parent-child interactions, provided health monitoring of infant and parent education, parental skills training, performed developmental interventions using Hawaii Early Learning Program and Carolina Preschool Curriculum. They were supervised by a paediatric nurse practitioner. The control group received no home visits. A description of standard care was not reported.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dakof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dakof 2003</LINK> used trained 'black' specialists with prior experience in drug treatment services to perform the 'Engaging Mums' program, an in-home program designed to facilitate enrolment and retention in drug abuse treatment. Intervention contacts included one to four individual, family or case management sessions per week of varying lengths (20 minutes to one hour). The goal was to enrol the mother in intervention services within eight weeks. The control group received community services as usual. Minimum intervention in control included in-home psychosocial evaluation, referral to a drug treatment program, follow-up phone call within a day of scheduled initial treatment appointment and drug treatment program if entered into.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Grant-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 1996</LINK> used paraprofessional advocates with many similar life experiences to perform weekly home visits after birth for six weeks, then twice monthly or more to three years. A paraprofessional is a non-certificated staff member working under the supervision of a trained and certified professional. They linked clients with health care, parenting classes, therapeutic child care and substance abuse treatment programs. The clients were not required to obtain drug/alcohol treatment. No specific developmental intervention was performed, but development was assessed in the intervention group at four months, two and three years with discussion of progress with parents. The control group had access to community social and health services but no home visits or advocacy. The control children were evaluated at three years only.</P>

Interventions included lactation and mother craft education and advice, general and obstetric health surveillance, contraception and child health advice, information on drug and alcohol use and services provided, education on parenting skills and appointments for vaccinations confirmed. The control group had no structured home visits by midwives. All participants were provided with routine postnatal support, counselling and information services including standard domiciliary home-visiting services.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Schuler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schuler 2000</LINK> used lay African-American women home visitors to provide the Infant Health and Development Program, comprising a home-based intervention in the first year, child attendance at a child-development centre and parent group meetings from the second year. Home visits were weekly from birth to six months, then biweekly to 18 months. Home visits had the goal of increasing maternal empowerment and enhancing mother's ability to manage self-identified problems using existing services and supports. A developmental intervention was incorporated using the child component of Hawaii Early Learning Program. The control group received short monthly home-tracking visits by one African-American lay home visitor. They had an average of 7.7 visits per client with mean time 18.5 minutes. All mothers were given information on drug treatment programs but participation was not mandatory. Mothers were paid for the evaluation visit and given tokens to get home.</P>

<P>Six of the seven studies enrolled women on the basis of drug and/or alcohol use, with <LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2000</LINK> enrolling adolescent pregnant women with a high rate of drug and/or alcohol use. <LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2000</LINK> reported breastfeeding with no significant difference in failure to breast feed at six months (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.23); no significant difference in risk of incomplete vaccination schedule at six months (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.96) and no significant difference in the risk of children not being in the care of their biological mother (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.47). <LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2000</LINK> reported child abuse or neglect (non-accidental injury) with only one infant in the control group with this reported outcome, a reduction in non-accidental injury and non-voluntary foster care of borderline statistical significance (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.23; RD -0.08, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.01) and a significant reduction in no use of postpartum contraception (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.82).</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Schuler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schuler 2000</LINK>) provided outcomes in group of assignment according to women's patterns or drug and/or alcohol use. <LINK REF="STD-Schuler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schuler 2000</LINK> reported developmental outcomes of infants in a post hoc analysis of subgroups based on maternal ongoing drug use. For infants of mothers with no ongoing drug use, there was a statistically significant increase in the Bayley MDI associated with home visits (mean difference (MD) 13.00, 95% CI 3.39 to 22.61), but not for those with ongoing drug use (MD 0.80, 95% CI -5.44 to 7.04). Overall there was no clear difference between the intervention groups in Bayley MDI (MD 4.42, 95% CI -0.82 to 9.65). There was a statistically significant increase in the Bayley PDI (MD 4.21, 95% CI 0.83 to 7.59) in the trial overall, although the difference did not achieve statistical significance in either subgroup. No study provided outcomes in group of assignment according to the co-existence of domestic violence or mental illness, partner with drug or alcohol problem, or those women separated from their infants.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-26 21:29:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The conclusions of this review are substantially affected by the methodological quality of many of the included studies especially those with large losses to follow-up, the wide spectrum of home visitors and interventions provided, the lack of studies providing an antenatal intervention with the goal of improving pregnancy outcomes and the lack of consistency of findings between studies. Of the studies with fewer methodological concerns, <LINK REF="STD-Dakof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dakof 2003</LINK> demonstrated that a short-term, intense intervention by trained counsellors in postpartum women with a drug problem can increase the number of women attending drug and alcohol services. However, the effects of this intervention were not maintained over a longer period of time and longer-term childhood and psychosocial outcomes were not reported. <LINK REF="STD-Bartu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bartu 2006</LINK> did not demonstrate any health benefits to mother or infant from eight home visits over six months by a midwife. <LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2000</LINK> reported that a less intense program of postnatal home visitation by midwives for postpartum adolescents with a high rate of drug and/or alcohol use resulted in a reduction in the combined rate of reported non-accidental injury and non-voluntary foster care which was of borderline significance, as well as a reduction in women not using postpartum contraception.</P>
<P>No study provided a significant antenatal intervention, so effects on pregnancy outcomes including antepartum haemorrhage, placental abruption, premature delivery, intrauterine growth restriction and perinatal mortality could not be ascertained. These adverse outcomes of drug and alcohol use in pregnancy have been well documented in the literature and studies are needed of antenatal interventions to address these issues.</P>
<P>This review failed to find evidence that home visits reduced continuing drug or alcohol use. Potential reasons for this include that many studies did not report ongoing risk of drug or alcohol use, and that no study incorporated drug and alcohol interventions as part of the home visiting intervention. In addition, it is possible that increased engagement or surveillance in the intervention group may increase the quantity of detected drug use.</P>
<P>Relatively few studies reported other maternal outcomes. Of those that did, <LINK REF="STD-Bartu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bartu 2006</LINK> reported no significant difference in screen positive women for depression at six months and <LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2000</LINK> reported a significant reduction in women not using postpartum contraception.</P>
<P>Most studies failed to report actual child abuse or neglect, non-accidental injury, accidents and hospitalisations, reports to community services and non-voluntary foster care. Of those that did, meta-analysis of two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Butz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Butz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2000</LINK>) found no significant different in risk of children not being in the care of their biological mother. <LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2000</LINK> reported non-accidental injury with only one infant in the control group having this reported outcome. No study reported domestic violence. <LINK REF="STD-Schuler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schuler 2000</LINK>, however, reported a significant reduction in use of child protection services. Meta-analysis of two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bartu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bartu 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2000</LINK>) found no significant difference in infant death. Although numbers are small, it should be noted that in these two trials reporting outcomes for 288 infants there were five infant deaths equating to an infant mortality rate of 17 per 1000. The majority of these deaths are reported as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, although criteria for diagnosis were not reported.</P>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Butz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Butz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schuler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schuler 2000</LINK>) incorporated developmental interventions as part of the home visiting program, all using the Carolina Preschool Curriculum and Hawaii Early Learning Program. Effects on longer-term development were inconsistent, with <LINK REF="STD-Black-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1994</LINK> reporting no difference in the Bayley MDI or PDI at 18 months and <LINK REF="STD-Schuler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schuler 2000</LINK> reporting significant improvements in the Bayley PDI for infants receiving intervention. A post hoc subgroup analysis by <LINK REF="STD-Schuler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schuler 2000</LINK> according to pattern of maternal drug use should be treated with caution. In this analysis, <LINK REF="STD-Schuler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schuler 2000</LINK> reported that the greatest effect of home visiting on development was seen in infants of mothers with no ongoing drug use. <LINK REF="STD-Grant-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 1996</LINK> used paraprofessional home visitors but did not provide a specific developmental intervention and also failed to demonstrate any improvement in developmental outcomes. All the studies that reported developmental outcomes had substantial losses to follow-up limiting the validity of any findings. Longer-term cognitive outcomes especially at school age and school achievements have not been reported. Other potentially beneficial outcomes reported included the following: <LINK REF="STD-Schuler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schuler 2000</LINK> reported a reduction in the involvement of child protection services in those families receiving home visits by an African-American lay home visitor, although it is unclear whether this is a result of an effect of the home visits or the increased surveillance in the control group who received weekly tracking visits; <LINK REF="STD-Black-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1994</LINK> reported a reduction in the Child Abuse Potential Inventory score, although not actual child abuse, and the child domain of the Parenting Stress Index in families receiving home visits by a part-time community health nurse experienced with women and children, and with drug using families.</P>
<P>In summary, this systematic review found trials that examined the effects of predominantly postnatal home visits of women with substantial drug use problems. A variety of different visitors were used including midwives, community health nurses, paediatric nurses, trained counsellors and trained lay workers. Interventions varied, although three trials performed a developmental intervention incorporating the Carolina Preschool Curriculum and Hawaii Early Learning Program. There was no consistent evidence that this developmental intervention had a significant effect on the infants' mental or psychomotor development. Four of the seven trials had substantial losses to follow-up that limit any conclusions from them. Some benefits to home visits were reported, including increased enrolment in and attendance for drug and alcohol treatment services from an intense program of trained counsellor home visits, improved contraception use and a trend to a reduction in non-voluntary foster care or non-accidental injury from a postnatal midwife home visiting program.</P>
<P>Trials are required that provide antenatal home visits, provide a flexible approach to home visits using a multidisciplinary team so as to meet individual clients differing needs, focus on stabilising drug use and reducing or eliminating alcohol abuse in pregnancy and postpartum, provide continuity of care throughout pregnancy and postpartum, and continue until the infant is ready for a preschool intervention. The goals of interventions should be to engage the pregnant woman in early and frequent antenatal care so as to reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, reduce or eliminate drug and alcohol use, meet the families' psychosocial needs including housing, financial, mental health and legal advocacy, and to stimulate an appropriate and safe environment for the infant's growth and development.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-11-26 21:33:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>There are substantial design limitations to the studies that limit the generalisability of this review. No study provided a significant antenatal intervention. Given that women who attended their health facility late in pregnancy and who have little antenatal care have worse pregnancy outcomes, antenatal home visits have the potential to improve women's attendance at their health facility and pregnancy care of women with a drug or alcohol problem. Although all studies used home visitors experienced with clients using drugs and/or alcohol, only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Dakof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dakof 2003</LINK>) provided a specific drug and alcohol home intervention which had the goal of linking women with a drug problem to out of home care. This study demonstrated that a short-term intense intervention by a trained counsellor could increase the number of women attending drug and alcohol services, although the effects were not maintained to three months. Other studies used existing out of home drug and alcohol services and no study demonstrated a reduction in drug or alcohol use from a home visiting intervention. No study used a trained social worker to provide home visits. Given the myriad of psychosocial problems of drug or alcohol using women including homelessness, unemployment, low income and domestic violence, the use of a trained social worker has the potential to address issues of housing, transport to care, social services support and advocacy that could have substantial impacts on the lives of pregnant women with a drug or alcohol problem. No study provided a home intervention by a multidisciplinary team. Given that different clients have different needs and that many clients will not adequately attend hospital or centre-based care, it may be that using a specific home visitor (e.g. midwife or paediatric nurse) will not address many clients' needs. Trials of more dynamic models of home visits incorporating case management are needed.</P>
<P>The only studies to provide midwifery home visiting during the first six months provided a low intensity of home visits. <LINK REF="STD-Bartu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bartu 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2000</LINK> reported eight postpartum home visits by a midwife in the first six months. Given that studies (<LINK REF="REF-Olds-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olds 2007</LINK>) that reported beneficial outcomes from nurse home visiting to high psychosocial risk families provided a mean of seven home visits (range: 0 to 18) during pregnancy (same mean number of prenatal visits for groups one and two) and 26 home visits (range: 0 to 71) during the first two years postpartum, the intensity and duration of the intervention in these studies may have been insufficient to demonstrate and effect.</P>
<P>Studies used heterogenous interventions limiting the ability of this review to detect clinically important differences in effects of specific interventions.</P>
<P>Relatively few studies reported any individual outcome reducing the ability of this review to detect clinically important differences in effect of interventions.</P>
<P>The studies in this review are substantially underpowered. The infant death rate was 17 per 1000 reported in two of the studies in this review suggesting that substantially larger studies are needed to detect even a relatively large proportional reduction.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-11-28 09:14:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are substantial methodological limitations to the studies incorporated in this review. Three studies did not report the method of treatment allocation. No study blinded intervention to caregivers or participants given the nature of the intervention. Two studies had adequate randomisation and allocation concealment with &lt; 10% post randomisation losses (<LINK REF="STD-Dakof-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dakof 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Bartu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bartu 2006</LINK> was judged to be at high risk of bias due to unclear allocation concealment and imbalances post randomisation.</P>
<P>Few outcome measurements were performed blind to treatment allocation. Of those that were, <LINK REF="STD-Black-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1994</LINK> reported blinding of measurement of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and found no significant effect, <LINK REF="STD-Butz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Butz 1998</LINK> reported blinding of the Child Behavioural Checklist and Parental Stress Index and reported a significant reduction in the Parental Stress Index, and <LINK REF="STD-Schuler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schuler 2000</LINK> blinded videotaped observations of mother-child interaction and reported no significant differences in mother-infant interaction at 18 months. Studies that reported trends to reduction in combined non-accidental injury or children not in care of the biological mother (<LINK REF="STD-Quinlivan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Quinlivan 2000</LINK>) and a significant reduction in involvement of child protective services (<LINK REF="STD-Schuler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schuler 2000</LINK>) did not report blinding the monitoring of the control groups. Four of the studies reported losses to follow-up that have the potential to substantially bias the reported results.</P>
<P>Several meta-analyses had substantial heterogeneity including those reporting continued illicit drug use, failure to enrol in drug treatment services, psychomotor development and infant not in care of biological mother. There are multiple potential sources of heterogeneity including differences in duration and intensity of home visiting, differences in type of home visitor, differences in type of intervention, and differences in study quality. In general, positive findings have not been reproducibly reported.</P>
<P>In addition, this review does not have adequate power for reliable conclusions. None of the studies were large, several of the bigger studies lost large numbers of participants, and no outcome is reported by more than three of the seven studies.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-11-11 21:47:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review searched extensively for published and unpublished literature, reproducibly assessed eligibility, study quality and extracted data by independent reviewers, and contacted study authors where possible to clarify methodology or obtain missing data. This review combined studies that probably enrolled similar populations of women although there may be substantial cultural differences. The settings of the interventions are also likely to vary with different levels of infrastructure, different organisation and integration of services and differences in the provision of drug health services, obstetric and early childhood services.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-11-28 01:49:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review focuses on the evidence of home visits in pregnant women and women after birth with a drug or alcohol problem. Many of these women will be at high psychosocial risk for other reasons as well. There are a substantial number of trials of home visits for women at high psychosocial risk, either not enrolling women with a drug and/or alcohol problem or not reporting incidences of use of drugs or alcohol. Home visits for socially disadvantaged women is the planned focus of a pending Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald 2008</LINK>). Trials have suggested benefits to home visits for both infant and maternal health and welfare, particularly where the home visitor was a well-trained nurse, the visits were frequent and the focus was on building a trusting relationship and coaching maternal-infant interaction (<I>see </I>reviews: <LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kearney-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kearney 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kendrick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendrick 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNaughton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNaughton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Persily-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Persily 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1996</LINK>). Home violence attenuated the effectiveness of the home visits (<LINK REF="REF-Eckenrode-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eckenrode 2000</LINK>). The effect of lay home visitors is not as clear (<LINK REF="REF-Persily-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Persily 2003</LINK>). This review found that although several of the trials use well-trained nurses and provided relatively frequent and prolonged visiting, they focused on postnatal interventions. In addition, although one trial focused on enrolling in drug treatment services, all drug treatment services were out of home. The trials have not demonstrated an improvement in rates of stabilisation on therapy or reductions in illicit drug or alcohol use. Although some potential benefits were reported, particularly in terms of enrolment in out of home drug treatment services, child behavioural problems, parenting stress and the use of postpartum contraception, the reported effects of the home visits in women with a drug or alcohol problem do not appear to be substantial or consistent across studies.</P>
<P>This review did not find a significant effect on infant mortality, although it is substantially underpowered to do so. There are some data that suggest the possibility that trained nurse home visitors may reduce infant mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Olds-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Olds 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olds-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olds 2007</LINK>).</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-11-28 09:14:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Home visits for women who are pregnant or have recently given birth have been advocated in the hope that they might improve outcome. Whilst there is promising evidence that a brief intensive intervention by trained counsellors may encourage women to attend drug and alcohol treatment services for a few weeks, there is no clear evidence of longer term or more substantive benefit. There is insufficient evidence at present to recommend the routine use of home visits, any particular model of home visits or any specific home interventions in women with a drug or alcohol problem. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-11-28 09:14:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further large, high-quality trials are needed and the women's views on home visiting need to be assessed. Trials particularly needed include those incorporating antenatal home visits with the goal of encouraging pregnant women with a drug or alcohol problem to access early and frequent antenatal care, stabilise drug use, reduce or eliminate alcohol use in pregnancy and remain engaged with services during their child's first years of life. Trials should consider providing flexible care that meets clients needs potentially through the use of case management and multidisciplinary teams including workers trained in drug and alcohol treatment, social workers, midwives and early childhood nurses. Trials should measure important pregnancy, infant and psychosocial outcomes including perinatal mortality, premature delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, use of non-voluntary foster care, childhood accidents, hospitalisations, abuse and neglect, infant deaths and cognitive development at least up to school age. Women's views should be assessed and outcomes measured beyond the end of the intervention.</P>
