<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-19 13:27:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Primary biliary cirrhosis is an uncommon and slowly progressive autoimmune disease of the liver that primarily affects middle-aged women. The cause of the disease is unknown. Over the last 30 years, the prevalence of primary biliary cirrhosis has increased substantially. Primary biliary cirrhosis is now a frequent cause of liver morbidity, and the patients are significant users of health resources, including liver transplantation.</P>
<P>Ursodeoxycholic acid is the only drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for primary biliary cirrhosis, but the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid remain controversial. This review contains updated evidence and re-evaluates beneficial and harmful effects of ursodeoxycholic acid on patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The review includes 16 randomised clinical trials with a total of only 1447 patients. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, all-cause mortality or liver transplantation, adverse events, and quality of life. Although ursodeoxycholic acid indicated a reduction in liver biochemistry, jaundice, and histological progression, this review did not demonstrate any benefits of ursodeoxycholic acid on all-cause mortality, all-cause mortality or liver transplantation, or symptoms (pruritus and fatigue). The use of ursodeoxycholic acid is associated with costs and may cause adverse events. All but one of the trials had high risk of bias and the trials seem to have selective reporting of outcomes. </P>

<P>Two authors independently extracted data. Continuous data were analysed using mean difference (MD) and standardised mean difference (SMD). Dichotomous data were analysed using risk ratio (RR). Meta-analyses were conducted using both a random-effects model and a fixed-effect model, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Random-effects model meta-regression was used to assess the effects of covariates across the trials. Trial sequential analysis was used to assess risk of random errors (play of chance). Risks of bias (systematic error) in the included trials were assessed according to Cochrane methodology bias domains.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-16 22:47:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="dimitrinka nikolova">
<P>Sixteen randomised clinical trials with 1447 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis were included. One trial had low risk of bias, and the remaining fifteen had high risk of bias. Fourteen trials compared ursodeoxycholic acid with placebo and two trials compared ursodeoxycholic acid with 'no intervention'. The percentage of patients with advanced primary biliary cirrhosis at baseline varied from 15% to 83%, with a median of 51%. The duration of the trials varied from 3 to 92 months, with a median of 24 months. The results showed no significant difference in effect between ursodeoxycholic acid and placebo or 'no intervention' on all-cause mortality (45/699 (6.4%) versus 46/692 (6.6%); RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.42, I² = 0%; 14 trials); on all-cause mortality or liver transplantation (86/713 (12.1%) versus 89/706 (12.6%); RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.25, I² = 15%; 15 trials); on serious adverse events (94/695 (13.5%) versus 107/687 (15.6%); RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.12, I² = 23%; 14 trials); or on non-serious adverse events (27/643 (4.2%) versus 18/634 (2.8%); RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.56, I² = 0%; 12 trials). The random-effects model meta-regression showed that the risk of bias of the trials, disease severity of patients at entry, ursodeoxycholic acid dosage, and trial duration were not significantly associated with the intervention effects on all-cause mortality, or on all-cause mortality or liver transplantation. Ursodeoxycholic acid did not influence the number of patients with pruritus (168/321 (52.3%) versus 166/309 (53.7%); RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09, I² = 0%; 6 trials) or with fatigue (170/252 (64.9%) versus 174/244 (71.3%); RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.00, I² = 62%; 4 trials). Two trials reported the number of patients with jaundice and showed a significant effect of ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo or no intervention in a fixed-effect meta-analysis (5/99 (5.1%) versus 15/99 (15.2%); RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.90, I² = 51%; 2 trials). The result was not supported by the random-effects meta-analysis (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.95). Portal pressure, varices, bleeding varices, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy were not significantly affected by ursodeoxycholic acid. Ursodeoxycholic acid significantly decreased serum bilirubin concentration (MD -8.69 µmol/l, 95% CI -13.90 to -3.48, I² = 0%; 881 patients; 9 trials) and activity of serum alkaline phosphatases (MD -257.09 U/L, 95% CI -306.25 to -207.92, I² = 0%; 754 patients, 9 trials) compared with placebo or no intervention. These results were supported by trial sequential analysis. Ursodeoxycholic acid also seemed to improve serum levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase, aminotransferases, total cholesterol, and plasma immunoglobulin M concentration. Ursodeoxycholic acid seemed to have a beneficial effect on worsening of histological stage (random; 66/281 (23.5%) versus 103/270 (38.2%); RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.88, I² = 35%; 7 trials).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-11-16 22:33:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jelena S Rudic">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-11-16 18:25:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jelena S Rudic">
<P>Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic autoimmune-mediated liver disease characterised by progressive destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts, resulting in chronic cholestasis, portal inflammation, and fibrosis that can lead to cirrhosis and, ultimately, liver failure. The disease was first comprehensively described around 1950 (<LINK REF="REF-MacMahon-1949" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacMahon 1949</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ahrens-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahrens 1950</LINK>). The disease primarily affects middle-aged women with a sex ratio of 10:1. Data about the incidence and prevalence of primary biliary cirrhosis have generally been obtained passively and might not indicate the true rates of the disease in the general population. Reported annual incidence of primary biliary cirrhosis ranges from 1 to 49 persons per million, and the prevalence has been estimated between 7 to 402 persons per million (<LINK REF="REF-Prince-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poupon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poupon 2010</LINK>). Primary biliary cirrhosis is now a frequent cause of liver morbidity, and the patients are significant users of health resources, including liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Prince-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aetiology of primary biliary cirrhosis is still unclear, but it is thought to involve multiple genetic factors and environmental triggers leading to an intense autoimmune response against the biliary epithelial cells. Histological staging is based on Ludwig&#8217;s (<LINK REF="REF-Ludvig-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludvig 1978</LINK>) and Scheuer&#8217;s classifications (<LINK REF="REF-Scheuer-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheuer 1967</LINK>), ranging from portal tract inflammation with predominantly lymphoplasmacytoid infiltrates and septal and interlobular bile-duct loss (stage I) to frank cirrhosis (stage IV). The most common symptoms and findings are fatigue, pruritus, hyperlipidaemia, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, and coexisting autoimmune diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 2005</LINK>). Diagnosis is made upon the elevated biochemical markers of cholestasis (particularly alkaline phosphatases) for more than six months in the presence of detectable serum antimitochondrial antibodies, and on exclusion of other possible aetiologies of liver damage (<LINK REF="REF-Heathcote-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heathcote 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EASL-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EASL 2009</LINK>). Characteristic liver histological changes confirm the diagnosis and are used for staging and assessing disease activity before therapeutic intervention. However, according to the latest clinical guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-EASL-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EASL 2009</LINK>), a liver biopsy shall not necessarily be used for diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis.</P>
<P>The clinical features and natural history of primary biliary cirrhosis vary greatly between patients. It may manifest as asymptomatic, slowly progressive, symptomatic, or rapidly evolving. Asymptomatic patients have about equivalent short-term survival compared to an age-matched and sex-matched healthy population (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2005</LINK>). Most asymptomatic people with primary biliary cirrhosis will develop symptoms within five years after the diagnosis has been made. The progress to cirrhosis and end stage liver disease may necessitate liver transplantation as the only treatment option (<LINK REF="REF-Prince-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2004</LINK>). On the other hand, the overall median survival for symptomatic patients is between 10 and 15 years. Serum bilirubin level is an independent predictor of survival and is used for prognosis in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1979</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-11-16 22:32:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jelena S Rudic">
<P>Ursodeoxycholic acid is a secondary bile acid, which is a metabolic byproduct of intestinal bacteria. After oral ingestion and intestinal absorption, ursodeoxycholic acid enters the portal circulation and is taken up by the hepatocytes where ursodeoxycholic acid is conjugated to glycine or taurine and is subsequently transported into the bile ducts (<LINK REF="REF-Kullak_x002d_Ublick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kullak-Ublick 2000</LINK>). Ursodeoxycholic acid undergoes extensive enterohepatic recycling along with the other bile acids (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmann1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmann1994</LINK>). Because of its high first-pass metabolism (70%), the blood level of ursodeoxycholic acid in the systemic circulation is low (<LINK REF="REF-Saksena-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saksena 1997</LINK>). In the colon, the unabsorbed ursodeoxycholic acid is transformed to lithocholic acid by colonic microbial flora and is excreted via the faeces (<LINK REF="REF-Kullak_x002d_Ublick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kullak-Ublick 2000</LINK>). The half life of ursodeoxycholic acid is about 100 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Setchell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Setchell 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ursodeoxycholic acid is theoretically a safe and well tolerated drug but can induce modest weight gain (2 to 3 kg) during the first year of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Siegel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ursodeoxycholic acid acts through several pathways, such as alteration of the bile-acid pool, choleresis (the flow of bile from the liver), immune-modulation effects, and cytoprotective mechanisms. One of the main mechanisms of ursodeoxycholic acid is displacement of endogenous hepatotoxic bile by expansion of the hydrophilic bile acid pool which may correlate with competitive displacement of endogenous bile acids, either at the level of ileal absorption or at the hepatocyte (<LINK REF="REF-Stiehl-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiehl 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ursodeoxycholic acid is the only drug approved for primary biliary cirrhosis by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Doses of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day seem to cause significant improvements in liver tests and immunoglobulin levels and reduce titers of antimitochondrial antibodies (<LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pares-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pares 2000</LINK>). The dose of ursodeoxycholic acid appears to be important. A study comparing three different doses showed that a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg of body weight per day appeared to be optimal, as compared with a dose of either 5 to 7 mg or 23 to 25 mg (<LINK REF="REF-Angulo-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angulo 1999a</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-11-16 22:32:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jelena S Rudic">
<P>Bile duct destruction leads to the retention of hydrophobic bile acids within the liver cell. This most likely contributes to the gradual deterioration of liver function and liver histology observed in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Ursodeoxycholic acid increases the transportation of intracellular bile acids across the liver cell and into the canaliculus in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Jazrawi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jazrawi 1994</LINK>). Mechanisms of action of ursodeoxycholic acid in primary biliary cirrhosis remain unclear, yet the hydrophilic nature of this agent could lead to a reduction in amounts of primary bile acids, and the substance might also regulate cellular signalling and protect against apoptosis (<LINK REF="REF-Crosignani-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crosignani 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paumgartner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paumgartner 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ursodeoxycholic acid treatment in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis might reduce the serum level of IgM class antimitochondrial antibodies and IgG antibodies to pyruvate dehydrogenase. Ursodeoxycholic acid might also reduce the T-cell-mediated hepatocellular damage by decreasing hepatocellular and biliary expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and MHC class II molecules (<LINK REF="REF-Lazaridis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazaridis 2001</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-11-17 00:34:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jelena S Rudic">
<P>The confidence that the design and the report of the randomised clinical trial would restrict bias in the comparison of the intervention defines methodological quality, and hence risk of bias, which we assessed using the following domains (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savovic-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovic 2012</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Allocation sequence generation </B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: sequence generation was achieved using computer random number generation or a random number table. Drawing lots, tossing a coin, shuffling cards, and throwing dice are adequate if performed by an independent adjudicator.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the trial is described as randomised, but the method of sequence generation was not specified.<BR/>- High risk of bias: the sequence generation method is not, or may not be, random. Quasi-randomised studies, those using dates, names, or admittance numbers in order to allocate patients are inadequate for assessment of benefits and were excluded for the assessment of benefits but not for harms.</P>
<P>
<B>Allocation concealment</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: allocation was controlled by a central and independent randomisation unit, sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes or similar, so that intervention allocations could not have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the trial was described as randomised but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described, so that intervention allocations may have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment.<BR/>- High risk of bias: if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned patients or if the study was quasi-randomised. Quasi-randomised studies were excluded for the assessment of benefits but not for harms.</P>
<P>
<B>Blinding</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: the trial was described as blinded, the parties that were blinded, and the method of blinding was described, so that knowledge of allocation was adequately prevented during the trial.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the trial was described as blind, but the method of blinding was not described, so that knowledge of allocation was possible during the trial.<BR/>- High risk of bias, the trial was not blinded, so that the allocation was known during the trial.</P>
<P>
<B>Incomplete outcome data</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: the numbers and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals in all intervention groups were described or if it was specified that there were no dropouts or withdrawals.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the report gave the impression that there had been no dropouts or withdrawals, but this was not specifically stated.<BR/>- High risk of bias: the number or reasons for dropouts and withdrawals were not described.</P>
<P>
<B>Selective outcome reporting</B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: pre-defined, or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes are reported on.<BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: not all pre-defined, or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes are reported on or are not reported fully, or it is unclear whether data on these outcomes were recorded or not.<BR/>- High risk of bias: one or more clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were not reported on; data on these outcomes were likely to have been recorded.</P>
<P>
<B>Other bias </B>
<BR/>- Low risk of bias: the trial appears to be free of other information that could put it at risk of bias. <BR/>- Uncertain risk of bias: the trial may or may not be free of other information that could put it at risk of bias.<BR/>- High risk of bias: there are other factors in the trial that could put it at risk of bias, eg, for-profit involvement, authors have conducted trials on the same topic etc.</P>
<P>Trials assessed as having 'low risk of bias' in all of the specified individual domains were considered trials with low risk of bias. Trials assessed as having 'uncertain risk of bias' or 'high risk of bias' in one or more of the specified individual domains were considered trials with high risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2011</LINK>).</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-11-19 13:28:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jelena S Rudic">
<P>Dichotomous data were expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). When continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the treatment effects, we used the mean difference (MD) (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2002</LINK>). Mean differences based on changes from baseline can usually be assumed to be addressing exactly the same underlying intervention effects as analyses based on final measurements (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Therefore, we combined data reported as change from baseline values with final measurement values in meta-analysis when using the mean difference method in RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We did not use standardised mean differences (SMD) when we combined change scores and final measurements. For trials addressing the same outcome but using different scales of measuring, SMD were used.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2012-11-17 00:34:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jelena S Rudic">
<P>For the previous up-date of this review, review authors sought missing data by contacting trial authors. This is why we have not tried to do this again.</P>
<P>We performed analyses according to the intention-to-treat method for dichotomous outcomes, except for worsening of liver histology, including all patients irrespective of compliance or follow-up. However, for continuous outcomes we performed available patient analysis and included data only on those whose results were known.</P>
<P>Regarding the primary outcome measures, we included patients with incomplete or missing data in sensitivity analyses, by imputing the missing data following the scenarios below (<LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>- Available patient analysis which simply excludes all patients with the missing outcome from the analysis.<BR/>- Extreme-case analysis favouring the experimental intervention ('best-worse' case scenario): none of the dropouts/patients lost from the experimental arm but all of the dropouts/patients lost from the control group experienced the outcome, including all randomised patients in the denominator.<BR/>- Extreme-case analysis favouring the control ('worst-best' case scenario): all dropouts/patients lost from the experimental arm but none from the control arm experienced the outcome, including all randomised patients in the denominator.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-11-19 13:29:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jelena S Rudic">
<P>We explored the presence of statistical heterogeneity by the chi-squared test with significance less than or equal to P = 0.10. We measured the quantity of heterogeneity by I². Values of I² between 0% to 40% were graded as: heterogeneity might not be important; I² statistic between 30% to 60% was graded as representing moderate heterogeneity; I² between 50% to 90% was graded as substantial heterogeneity; and I² between 75% to 100% was graded as considerable heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Between-trial heterogeneity was explored by meta-regression, depending on the available data. We performed a meta-regression analysis with STATA 8.2 (STATA Corp, College Station, Tex). We used the STATA meta reg command for the random-effects meta-regression to assess which covariates influenced the intervention effect across trials. The covariates were: risk of bias of the trials, disease severity of patients at entry, ursodeoxycholic acid dosage, and trial duration (treatment and follow-up). Univariate and multivariate analyses including all covariates were performed. The results are presented with regression coefficients and 95% CI.</P>

<B>Trial sequential analysis</B>
</P>
<P>In order to assess the risks of random errors due to sparse data and multiplicity, we performed trial sequential analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>). We calculated the required information size (i.e., the number of patients needed in a meta-analysis to detect or reject a certain intervention effect) (<LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>). The required information size calculation should also account for the diversity present in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2009</LINK>). In our meta-analysis, the required information size was based on the proportion of patients with the outcome in the control group, assumption of a plausible RR reduction of 20%, a type I error of 5%, and a type II error of 20% (power 80%) (<LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>). We adjusted the required information size for diversity unless otherwise stated (<LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The underlying assumption of trial sequential analysis is that testing for significance may be performed each time a new trial is added to the meta-analysis. We added the trials according to the year of publication, and if more than one trial was published in a year, trials were added alphabetically according to the last name of the first author (<LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>On the basis of the required information size, trial sequential alpha-spending and beta-spending monitoring boundaries were constructed (<LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>). These boundaries determine the statistical inference one may draw regarding the cumulative meta-analysis that has not reached the required information size. If the cumulative Z-curve crosses the trial sequential alpha-spending or beta-spending monitoring boundary, a sufficient level of evidence may have been reached and no further trials are needed. If the Z-curve does not cross the trial sequential alpha-spending or beta-spending monitoring boundary, then there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion. </P>
<P>We applied trial sequential analysis with the Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) program (<LINK REF="REF-TSA-manual-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">TSA manual 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-TSA-program-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">TSA program 2011</LINK>) since it allows us to assess the risk of type I error due to sparse data and multiple updating in a cumulative meta-analysis, and it provides us with important information in order to estimate the level of evidence of the experimental intervention. Additionally, trial sequential analysis provides us with important information regarding the need for additional trials and the required information size of such trials.</P>

<P>Risk of bias was assessed according to six domains: allocation sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding; handling of incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other potential sources of bias. One out of 16 trials was considered as having low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Lindor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 1994</LINK>).

<P>Fourteen trials provided information on all-cause mortality and could be included in the analyses. The included trials reported a total of 91 (6.5%) deaths in 1391 patients (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). In the ursodeoxycholic acid group, 45 (6.4%) out of 699 patients died versus 46 (6.6%) out of 692 patients in the control group. Meta-analyses with both the fixed-effect model and random-effects model showed that ursodeoxycholic acid had no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.42, I² = 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>

Heterogeneity was absent (I² = 0%, P = 0.56).</P>
<P>Trial sequential analysis with data from all included trials showed that only 1382 patients of the diversity-adjusted required information size of 8539 were accrued (16%) and no firm evidence for benefit or harm was reached (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). The cumulative Z-curve did not cross the red trial sequential alpha-spending monitoring boundaries for benefit or harm. Therefore, there is no evidence to support or reject that ursodeoxycholic acid influences mortality.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses to assess intervention effects of 40% or 30% relative risk reduction of mortality showed that we could exclude a very large intervention effect of 40% relative risk reduction of deaths (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). However, we were unable to prove or disprove a relative risk reduction of 30% (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>), and below (data not shown).

<P>Available patient analysis did not result in any changes of effect estimates (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.43; I² = 0%; 1247 patients, 14 trials) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). Analysing the missing data in the best-case scenario (assuming that patients with unknown vital status receiving ursodeoxycholic acid were alive and that all patients from the control group with unknown vital status were dead) or in the worst-case scenario (assuming that patients with unknown vital status receiving ursodeoxycholic acid were dead and all patients with unknown vital status from the control group were alive) showed statistical significant effects of ursodeoxycholic acid ranging from a beneficial effect (best-case scenario: RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.48; 1 391 patients, 14 trials) to a harmful effect (worst-case scenario: RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.97; 1391 patients, 14 trials) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Univariate meta-regression analyses revealed that none of examined covariates (risk of bias of the trials, disease severity of patients at entry, ursodeoxycholic acid dosage, and trial duration) were significantly associated with the estimated intervention effect on mortality. In multivariate meta-regression analysis including all covariates, none were significantly associated with the estimated intervention effect on mortality.

<P>Analysis of data from the extended follow-up for ursodeoxycholic acid&#8594;ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo&#8594;ursodeoxycholic acid into the analyses demonstrated a RR of 0.97 with 95% CI 0.73 to 1.30 (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-19 13:29:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jelena S Rudic">
<P>This review included 16 randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo or 'no intervention' in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. With the inclusion of updated data from 2007 to January 2012, the present systematic review did not demonstrate any benefit or harm of ursodeoxycholic acid on all-cause mortality or on all-cause mortality or liver transplantation. The results from this present review are in agreement with the main findings of Goulis et al meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Goulis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goulis 1999</LINK>) and our previous versions of the present Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gong-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2008</LINK>). New trial data were added to liver biochemistry and clinical symptoms since 2008, and we confirm a reduction in liver biochemistry and jaundice following ursodeoxycholic acid administration. However, these results are based mainly on trials with high risk of bias and there are risks of outcome reporting bias. Due to addition of data on ascites and histology, the result of the effect for ascites changed from significant into insignificant, and the result of the effect for histology changed from insignificant into significant. Ursodeoxycholic acid seems generally well tolerated in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.</P>
<P>Results on all-cause mortality and all-cause mortality or liver transplantation as well as the following secondary outcomes - pruritus, serum bilirubin, and serum alkaline phosphatases - were analysed with trial sequential analysis. According to the results of the trial sequential analyses, there seems to be firm evidence for a beneficial effects of ursodeoxycholic acid on decreasing serum bilirubin concentration and the activity of serum alkaline phosphatases in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis compared with placebo or 'no intervention'. However, these beneficial effects may still be due to systematic errors (bias), as estimated intervention effects were calculated using data from trials assessed as having &#8217;high risk of bias&#8217; except one. Additionally, trial sequential analyses provide us with important information regarding the need for additional trials and the required information size.</P>
<P>The relationship between ursodeoxycholic acid effect and the severity of primary biliary cirrhosis was indicated in the classical meta-regression (<LINK REF="REF-Sharp-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharp 1998</LINK>), suggesting that ursodeoxycholic acid effect on mortality (if any) is more likely to be observed in patients with more severe primary biliary cirrhosis. However, this relationship was not supported by our univariate and multivariate meta-regression analyses, which included 'severity' as a co-variate. Therefore, whether the intervention effect of ursodeoxycholic acid (if any) is related to the severity of primary biliary cirrhosis should be investigated further.</P>
<P>We found statistically significant effect of ursodeoxycholic acid on histological stage. However, the observed effect could be due to systematic errors or random errors. There is a theoretical possibility that ursodeoxycholic acid may still delay progression from early stage disease to late stage disease and then ultimately prolong survival. However, the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid should primarily be assessed via patient relevant outcomes.</P>
<P>We found no difference regarding serious adverse events between the intervention groups. Ursodeoxycholic acid was generally well tolerated. We previously observed that ursodeoxycholic acid was associated with non-serious adverse events, mostly weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2008</LINK>). This finding ensued from new data from the <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 1994</LINK> trial. However, it is presently unclear whether the weight gain should be considered a beneficial or a harmful effect, and it needs to be studied further.</P>
<P>Other non-serious adverse events included mild gastrointestinal disorders like diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, etc. However, there was no significant difference regarding non-serious adverse events between intervention groups.</P>
<P>It has been claimed that ursodeoxycholic acid is a cost-effective therapy for primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Pasha-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pasha 1999</LINK>). However, this claim rests on the extrapolation of results from two selected randomised clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lindor 1994</LINK>). It is evident that cost-effectiveness analyses ought to be performed on the basis of all available high-quality evidence and not just on selected evidence. Considering the annual cost of ursodeoxycholic acid of about $2500 (<LINK REF="REF-Pasha-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pasha 1999</LINK>) and the findings of the present review, we challenge the conclusion drawn by Pasha et al that ursodeoxycholic acid is cost-effective for primary biliary cirrhosis.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-11-19 13:29:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jelena S Rudic">
<P>We conducted this review according to <I>The</I> <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Module (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2011</LINK>). The results of our meta-analyses, however, are only as strong as the primary trials included.</P>
<P>The main limitations in the design and implementation was the lack of clarity of the generation of allocation sequence,<B> </B>concealment of allocation, blinding, and the small number of patients enrolled in the trials. Of the sixteen included trials, six trials (37%) reported adequate allocation sequence generation and allocation concealment; eleven trials (69%) reported adequate blinding; thirteen trials (81%) adequately addressed incomplete data, and reported on clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes; and seven trials (44%) appeared to be free of additional risks of bias. Fifteen out of the sixteen trials were considered at high risk of bias and our evidence base is therefore severely limited even when trial sequential analyses did not show risk of random errors.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-11-19 13:28:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jelena S Rudic">
<P>In this systematic review, a comprehensive and extensive literature search was performed (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>), but the searches did not retrieve any additional trials. A potential limitation of our approach may be that we have not specifically searched for trials in the grey literature (written material that is not published commercially) which may have introduced a slight risk of bias into our meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 2003</LINK>). This bias, however, is unlikely to influence our results in a beneficial way as trials found in grey literature rarely report beneficial effect (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most of the included trials are of a relatively small size, which increases the risk of providing a more unrealistic estimate of the intervention effects due to bias (systematic errors) and chance (random errors). Risk of bias is known to impact the estimated intervention effect, with trials of a high risk of bias tending to overestimate the beneficial intervention effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savovic-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovic 2012</LINK>). We divided the analyses for the primary outcomes into trials with high risk of bias and trials with low risk of bias to examine any influence of bias on the effect estimates of our primary outcomes. Of the sixteen included trials, four trials had low risk of bias regarding five domains (allocation sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, handling of incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting), and only one trial had low risk of bias regarding all six domains (including other potential sources of bias).</P>
<P>There was no statistical signs of publication bias and other bias. Small trials have less power, meaning that there is less chance of detecting a small but true effect as statistically significant (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>). The risk of random error is higher when data come from small information sizes (or 'sample sizes' for individual trials), so information sizes need to be sufficiently large in order to reduce the risk of random error and increase the chance of observing a true intervention effect (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>). This review meta-analysed data (all-cause mortality or liver transplantation) from 15 trials involving a total of 1447 patients. The median length of trial duration was 24 months. This is not sufficiently long considering that the estimated median survival of a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis is 10 to 15 years (<LINK REF="REF-Prince-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2002</LINK>). Therefore, it is difficult to detect a significant difference on mortality based on the trials, most of which are under-powered. To reduce the risk of random errors we have conducted trial sequential analysis on the primary outcomes and some secondary outcomes which showed significant effect estimates applying both the random-effects and fixed-effect models.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity among trials might be due to differences in dose of ursodeoxycholic acid, trial duration, and disease severity of patients at entry. To reflect our concern about heterogeneity, we conducted all analyses using both the random-effects model and fixed-effect model. We presented the results with the fixed-effect model if the results of the two models did not differ. We also considered other important and pre-defined trial-level covariates, including trial risk of bias, severity of primary biliary cirrhosis, ursodeoxycholic acid dose, and trial duration. The random-effects model meta-regression showed that none of examined covariates were significantly associated with the estimated intervention effect on all-cause mortality or all-cause mortality or liver transplantation.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-11-19 13:28:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jelena S Rudic">
<P>In consistency with previous meta-analyses and reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Goulis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goulis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gong-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2008</LINK>), this updated systematic review did not demonstrate any benefit of ursodeoxycholic acid on all-cause mortality, and all-cause mortality or liver transplantation in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. On the other hand, ursodeoxycholic acid seemed to improve biochemical outcomes. This seems to place clinicians and researchers in a dilemma: if therapeutic decisions are based on clinical outcomes (e.g., mortality), there is insufficient evidence to support the use of ursodeoxycholic acid in primary biliary cirrhosis, but if based on non-validated 'surrogate' outcomes (e.g., serum bilirubin level or serum alkaline phosphatases), there is evidence favouring the ursodeoxycholic acid interventions for the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007</LINK>). This dilemma was reflected in a survey regarding the use of ursodeoxycholic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis among Danish doctors (<LINK REF="REF-K_x00fc_rstein-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kürstein 2005</LINK>), who had very different answers to the question why they prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis patients. Sixteen per cent of the doctors thought ursodeoxycholic acid reduced mortality, twenty-seven per cent thought ursodeoxycholic acid reduced morbidity, and twenty-three per cent thought it benefited 'surrogate' outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-K_x00fc_rstein-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kürstein 2005</LINK>). We believe that clinical practice should be based on results from randomised trials using clinically and patient relevant outcomes.</P>
<P>This systematic review did not demonstrate a benefit of ursodeoxycholic acid on our predefined primary outcomes: all-cause mortality and all-cause mortality or liver transplantation, neither in the period during which patients were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid or placebo/no intervention nor during the later period in which all the patients were treated with open label ursodeoxycholic acid. This observation is in contrast to some previous attempts to aggregate data from studies assessing ursodeoxycholic acid interventions for primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Simko-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simko 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poupon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poupon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poupon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poupon 2000</LINK>). However, Simko et al included non-randomised studies in their meta-analysis that are more liable to bias, that is systematic overestimation of benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Simko-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simko 1994</LINK>). Poupon et al only included three and five out of the 16 randomised clinical trials in their meta-analyses, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Poupon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poupon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poupon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poupon 2000</LINK>). Such meta-analyses largely run the risk of trial selection bias (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001a</LINK>).</P>
<P>The previous Lancet meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Goulis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goulis 1999</LINK> and our first Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001b</LINK>) were mainly criticised for including many trials of only two-year duration and with very heterogeneous lengths of follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Talwalker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talwalker 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 2005</LINK>). Furthermore, updated evidence from randomised clinical trials and analyses on longer follow-up data from our previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2008</LINK>) did not seem to support long-term ursodeoxycholic acid treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis. The main finding in our present updated review does not seem to support long-term ursodeoxycholic acid intervention, which was suggested in observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Rust-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rust 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pares-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pares 2006</LINK>). Thus, the results suggest no benefit of ursodeoxycholic acid on mortality.</P>
<P>The Mayo Risk Score Model has identified several prognostic biomarkers for primary biliary cirrhosis, e.g., serum bilirubin. These biomarkers may respond to ursodeoxycholic acid and may be predictive of survival (<LINK REF="REF-Dickson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickson 1989</LINK>). But they do not necessarily predict clinical benefit of the intervention in question because 'a perfect correlation does not a surrogate make' (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2003</LINK>). In the absence of validated surrogate outcomes in ursodeoxycholic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis, confirmatory trials assessing the ursodeoxycholic acid effect should only be based on clinical outcomes, e.g., mortality. We believe that evaluation based on such clinical outcomes-based evaluation will benefit patients in the long run (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>We also realise that the challenge of performing a new trial on intervention for primary biliary cirrhosis is high. The estimated median survival of primary biliary cirrhosis is 10 to 15 years. To spend 15 years planning and carrying out a trial for each new potential treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis would consume many patients' lifetimes, not to mention the expense and difficulty of retaining patients in such a long trial (<LINK REF="REF-Mayo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayo 2005</LINK>). Nevertheless, there are at least an estimated one million patients with primary biliary cirrhosis world-wide. Therefore, it is possible to conduct large trials with appropriate statistical power if international groups of primary biliary cirrhosis investigators collaborate. Such large trials do not need to be conducted for more than two to four years.</P>

<P>This updated review confirms and extends previous observations showing no benefit of ursodeoxycholic acid on all-cause mortality and on all-cause mortality or liver transplantation. Although based on a small number of trials with risk of bias, ursodeoxycholic acid seems to improve liver biochemical variables, including serum bilirubin concentration, and liver histology. This review does not support or refute short-term or long-term use of ursodeoxycholic acid.</P>

<P>It is less likely to find any benefit of ursodeoxycholic acid on patient's survival in a new trial with the average size of the trials included into this updated review. Integration of international groups of investigation for primary biliary cirrhosis will make large trial sizes feasible. Randomised clinical trials which assess ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo in primary biliary cirrhosis with larger sample sizes and minimised risk of bias are needed. Trials should mainly be based on clinical outcomes, e.g., mortality. Multi-centre trials and multinational trials would be necessary to secure patient recruitment as primary biliary cirrhosis is a relatively rare disease. Such trials ought to be reported according to the CONSORT guidelines (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Differences between previous published version of the review and this review</HEADING>
<P>The whole review protocol part was thoroughly updated following the guidelines in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): text was added or rewritten for greater precision and understanding. Outcomes were rearranged so that they now are patient oriented. An attempt to collect evidence on harm was also made. The statistical approach was also revised. Based on updated domains for bias risk, we judged bias risk domains anew (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). In the present update, only one trial was assessed as having low risk of bias. Minor inaccuracies found in data previously extracted were now corrected. Number of patients who died, were liver transplanted, obtained hepatic encephalopathy or were diagnosed with bleeding varices are now added to the analyses on serious adverse events. New trial data were added to some of the secondary outcome measures. Due to addition of data to the outcome measures on ascites and histology, the result of the effect for ascites changed from significant into insignificant, and the result of the effect for histology changed from insignificant into significant. We performed subgroup analyses using data in the already included trials as well data found in follow-up publications of the included trials. Results on all-cause mortality and mortality or liver transplantation as well as the following secondary outcomes - pruritus, serum bilirubin and serum alkaline phosphatases - were analysed with trial sequential analysis. The random-effects model meta-regression showed that none of examined covariates (bias risk of the trials, disease severity of patients at entry, ursodeoxycholic acid dosage, and trial duration) were significantly associated with the estimated intervention effect on mortality or mortality or liver transplantation. Summary of Findings tables and grading of the evidence were also performed. We abandoned our Baysian analyses as they did not seem to add new information.</P>

No differences were observed between the medium and the high dose with respect to liver biochemistry changes, but both these dose groups had significantly greater improvement of liver biochemistry compared to the low dose group. Clinical events such as death, transplantation, or complications of liver disease were rare and were not different between the three dose groups.</P>

<P>This cross-over RCT compares different doses of ursodeoxycholic acid in twenty-four biopsy-proven early-stage PBC patients (one male, 23 female) who received five doses of ursodeoxycholic acid (0, 300, 600, 900, 1200 mg/day) each for eight weeks with four-week washout periods between doses. Symptoms (pruritus, fatigue, diarrhoea) were assessed on a four-point scale (none, mild, moderate, severe). Liver function tests were performed using conventional methods, and serum bile acids were measured using gas liquid chromatography. The dose of 900 mg/day produced the greatest enrichment of ursodeoxycholic acid in serum bile acids, although there was no difference in the enrichment of ursodeoxycholic acid between the different doses. There was a trend towards normalization of the abnormal LFTs in a dose-dependent manner (for Y-glutamyl transferase (yGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT) and IgM). Multi-factorial analysis showed that ursodeoxycholic acid treatment, irrespective of dose, was significantly better than placebo for all the variables. The 900 mg and 1200 mg doses were better than both 300 mg and 600 mg using gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and total bilirubin as variables, better than 300 mg using alkaline phosphatase and IgM as variables, and better than 600 mg using albumin as a variable. No variables showed a significant difference between 900 and 1200 mg. The study concluded that the optimum dose of ursodeoxycholic acid is 900 mg/day (equivalent to 13.5 mg/kg/day). This trial is excluded due to the cross-over design and due to the fact that it did not provide any data on the primary outcome variables.</P>

<P>Trial sequential analysis of the random-effects meta-analysis of the effect of ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo or no intervention on all-cause mortality. The trial sequential analysis is performed with an assumed control proportion of death of 7.7%, an anticipated relative risk reduction (RRR) of 20%, a type 1 error risk of 5% (two-sided) (a), and a power of 80% (a type II error risk of 20%) (b). The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) to detect or reject a RRR of 20% with a between trial heterogeneity of 0% is estimated to 8539 patients. The actually accrued number of patients is 1382, which is only 16% of the required information size. The blue cumulative Z-curve does not cross the red trial sequential alpha-spending monitoring boundaries for benefit or harm. Therefore, there is no evidence to support or refute that ursodeoxycholic acid influences mortality with a 20% RRR of mortality. The cumulative Z curve does not reach the futility area delineated by the trial sequential beta-spending monitoring boundaries (which are not even drawn by the program), demonstrating that further randomised trials are needed.</P>

<P>Trial sequential analysis of the random-effects meta-analysis of the effect of ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo or no intervention on all-cause mortality. The trial sequential analysis is performed with an assumed control proportion of death of 7.7%, an anticipated relative risk reduction (RRR) of 40%, a type 1 error risk of 5% (two-sided) (a), and a power of 80% (type 2 error risk of 20%) (b). The diversity-adjusted required information size to detect or reject a RRR of 40% with a between trial heterogeneity of 0% is estimated to 1914 patients. The actually accrued number of patients is 1382, which is 72% of the required information size. The blue cumulative Z-curve does not cross the red trial sequential alpha-spending monitoring boundaries for benefit or harm. However, the boundaries for futility (the red inner wedge boundaries showing the trial sequential beta-spending monitoring boundaries) are crossed. The red conventional boundaries (horizontal line at Z = 1.96 and Z = -1.96) for harm or benefit are not crossed. Therefore, there is no evidence to support ursodeoxycholic acid and we can refute that ursodeoxycholic acid influences mortality by a 40% RRR of mortality with the chosen error risks.</P>

<P>Trial sequential analysis of the random-effects meta-analysis of the effect of ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo or no intervention on all-cause mortality. The trial sequential analysis is performed with an assumed control proportion of death of 7.7%, an anticipated relative risk reduction (RRR) of 30%, a type 1 error risk of 5% (two-sided) (a), and a power of 80% (a type 2 error risk of 20%) (b). The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) to detect or reject a RRR of 30% with a between trial heterogeneity of 0% is estimated to 3599 patients. The actually accrued number of patients is 1382, which is only 38% of the required information size. The blue cumulative Z-curve does not cross the red trial sequential monitoring boundaries for benefit or harm. Therefore, there is no evidence to support that ursodeoxycholic acid influences mortality. The cumulative Z-curve does not reach the futility area delineated by the trial sequential beta-spending monitoring boundaries (which are not even drawn by the program), demonstrating that further randomised trials are needed.</P>

<P>Trial sequential analysis of the random-effects meta-analysis of the effect of ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo or no intervention on all-cause mortality or liver transplantation. The trial sequential analysis is performed with an assumed control proportion of death of 15.1%, an anticipated relative risk reduction (RRR) of 20%, a type 1 error risk of 5% (two-sided), and a power of 80% (a type 2 error risk of 20%) (b). The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) to detect or reject a RRR of 20% with a between trial heterogeneity of 37% is estimated to 4043 patients. The actually accrued number of patients is 1410, which is only 35% of the required information size. The blue cumulative Z-curve does not cross the red trial sequential monitoring boundaries for benefit or harm. Therefore, there is no evidence to support or refute that ursodeoxycholic acid  influences mortality or transplantation. The cumulative Z curve does not reach the futility area delineated by the trial sequential beta-spending monitoring boundaries (which are not even drawn by the program), demonstrating that further randomised trials are needed.</P>

<P>Trial sequential analysis of the random-effects meta-analysis of the effect of ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo or no intervention on all-cause mortality or liver transplantation. The trial sequential analysis is performed with an assumed control proportion of death of 15.1%, an anticipated relative risk reduction (RRR) of 30%, a type 1 error risk of 5% (two-sided), and a power of 80% (a type 2 error risk of 20%) (b). The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) to detect or reject a RRR of 30% with a between trial heterogeneity of 37% is estimated to 1712 patients. The actually accrued number of patients is 1410, which is 82% of the required information size. The blue cumulative Z-curve does not cross the red trial sequential alpha-spending monitoring boundaries for benefit or harm. However, the boundaries for futility delineated by the trial sequential beta-spending monitoring boundaries (the red inner wedge boundaries) are crossed. Accordingly, the red conventional boundaries (horizontal line at z =1.96 and z =-1.96) for harm or benefit are not crossed. Therefore, there is no evidence to support that ursodeoxycholic acid  influences mortality or transplantation.

<P>Trial sequential analysis of the random-effects meta-analysis of the effect of ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo or no intervention on pruritus. The trial sequential analysis is performed with an assumed control proportion of pruritus of 54%, an anticipated relative risk reduction (RRR) of 20%, a type 1 error risk of 5% (two-sided), and a power of 80% (a type 2 error risk of 20%) (b). The heterogeneity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) to detect or reject a RRR of 20% with a between trial heterogeneity of 0% is estimated to 673 patients. The actually accrued number of patients is 621, which is 92% of the required information size. The blue cumulative Z-curve does not cross the red trial sequential monitoring boundaries for benefit or harm. However, the boundaries for futility delineated by the trial sequential beta-spending monitoring boundaries (the red inner wedge boundaries) are crossed. Therefore, there is no evidence to support that ursodeoxycholic acid influences pruritus and a 20% RRR of pruritus can be rejected with the chosen error risks.</P>

<P>Trial sequential analysis of the cumulative meta-analysis of the effect of ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo or no intervention on serum bilirubin concentration in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) of 1296 patients is calculated based on a minimal relevant intervention effect (MIREDIF) of 7 µmol/l, a standard deviation of 56 µmol/l (variance 3116), a risk of type I error of 5%, a power of 80% (a type 2 error risk of 20%) (b), and a diversity of 0%. The cumulated Z-curve (blue curve) crosses the trial sequential monitoring boundary (red curve) implying that there is evidence for a beneficial effect of 7 µmol/l decrease in the serum bilirubin concentration when the cumulative meta-analysis is adjusted for sparse data and multiple testing on accumulating data.</P>

<P>Trial sequential analysis of the cumulative meta-analysis of the effect of ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo or no intervention on the activity of serum alkaline phosphatases in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The diversity-adjusted required information size (DARIS) of 920 patients is calculated based on a minimal relevant intervention effect (MIREDIF) of 90 IU/L, a standard deviation of 487 IU/L (variance 237214), a risk of type I error of 5%, a power of 80% (a type 2 error risk of 20%) (b), and a diversity of 0%.
