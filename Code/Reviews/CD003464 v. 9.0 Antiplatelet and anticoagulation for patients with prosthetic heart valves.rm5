<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-06-13 11:21:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>After heart valve replacement oral anticoagulation (a blood thinner) is frequently used to keep blood clots from forming on the valve. These blood clots can block the flow of blood through the valve or break off and cause a stroke. Blood thinners, such as coumadin, reduce the risk of these outcomes and require careful monitoring. Drugs that affect the platelets, such as aspirin, are not effective alone but may add benefit to the blood thinners. This updated review of 13 trials found that oral anticoagulation and antiplatelet drugs were more effective than anticoagulation alone. The addition of antiplatelet drugs to anticoagulants increases the risk of bleeding by about 50%. Low-dose aspirin (less than 100 mg daily) may be associated with the lowest risk of bleeding. However, in general the quality of the included trials tended to be low, possibly reflecting the era when the majority of the trials were conducted (1970s and 1980s when trial methodology was less advanced).</P>

<P>Patients with prosthetic heart valves are at increased risk for valve thrombosis and arterial thromboembolism. Oral anticoagulation alone, or the addition of antiplatelet drugs, has been used to minimise this risk. An important issue is the effectiveness and safety of the latter strategy.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-13 11:21:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One new study has been identified and included in this update. In total, 13 studies involving 4122 participants were included in this review update. Years of publication ranged from 1971 to 2011. Compared with anticoagulation alone, the addition of an antiplatelet agent reduced the risk of thromboembolic events (odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 0.59; P &lt; 0.00001) and total mortality (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.78; P = 0.0004). Aspirin and dipyridamole reduced these events similarly. The risk of major bleeding was increased when antiplatelet agents were added to oral anticoagulants (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.18; P = 0.006).</P>
<P>For major bleeding, there was no evidence of heterogeneity between aspirin and dipyridamole and in the comparison of trials performed before and after 1990, around the time when anticoagulation standardisation with the international normalised ratio was being implemented. A lower daily dose of aspirin (&lt; 100 mg) may be associated with a lower major bleeding risk than higher doses.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-06-13 11:21:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adding antiplatelet therapy, either dipyridamole or low-dose aspirin, to oral anticoagulation decreases the risk of systemic embolism or death among patients with prosthetic heart valves. The risk of major bleeding is increased with antiplatelet therapy. These results apply to patients with mechanical prosthetic valves or those with biological valves and indicators of high risk such as atrial fibrillation or prior thromboembolic events. The effectiveness and safety of low-dose aspirin (100 mg daily) appears to be similar to higher-dose aspirin and dipyridamole. In general, the quality of the included trials tended to be low, possibly reflecting the era when the majority of the trials were conducted (1970s and 1980s when trial methodology was less advanced).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-14 11:37:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patients with prosthetic heart valves are at increased risk for both valve thrombosis and arterial thromboembolic events, including stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Chesebro-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chesebro 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2001</LINK>). Consequently, anticoagulation therapy is used to lessen the thromboembolic risk, albeit at the expense of increased anticoagulation-associated haemorrhage. Recently, several systematic reviews have attempted to clarify the current best evidence for prosthetic valve management (<LINK REF="REF-Cannegieter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cannegieter 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loewen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loewen 1998</LINK>). As such, current recommendations tend to be very specific and are tailored to several clinical features including prosthetic valve location and type, presence of atrial fibrillation, and prior history of thromboembolism (<LINK REF="REF-Loewen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loewen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2001</LINK>). Unfortunately, the literature supporting these recommendations is often difficult to interpret due to small numbers of patients, lack of consistent control groups, and older studies with anticoagulation monitoring that predates the international normalised ratio (INR) but uses the prothrombin time ratio. Monitoring of oral anticoagulation with the prothrombin time was, however, imprecise because of differences in thromboplastin responsiveness. The INR was developed in the early 1980s as a means of calibrating the various thromboplastins used for measuring the prothrombin time. In essence the INR is the prothrombin time ratio that would be obtained if the World Health Organization international reference preparation for thromboplastin had been used to obtain the test (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsh 2001</LINK>). It was through the early 1990s that the INR standard was widely implemented (<LINK REF="REF-CAPCSS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">CAPCSS 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>As a means of improving the efficacy of antithrombotic therapy following prosthetic valve implantation, oral anticoagulation has been augmented with antiplatelet drugs. Two such drugs, aspirin and dipyridamole, have been tested in this setting. Aspirin is the most widely investigated antiplatelet drug and has been shown to be effective and safe for many cardiac and other vascular indications (<LINK REF="REF-Patrano-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrano 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Antiplatelet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antiplatelet 2002</LINK>). Dipyridamole, which has both vasodilator and antiplatelet properties, is no more effective than aspirin; the mechanism of action remains controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Patrano-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrano 2001</LINK>). We are unaware of any similar trials underway using the newer thienopyridine compounds such as ticlopidine or clopidogrel.</P>
<P>Although some of the trials demonstrated improved effectiveness of combination oral anticoagulation and antiplatelet drugs over anticoagulation alone, with no substantial increase in bleeding risk, the results are far from consistent. Previous meta-analyses addressing the efficacy and safety of combined antiplatelet drugs and oral anticoagulation in patients with prosthetic valves were potentially limited, having reviewed either English language trials only, or trials limited to aspirin or dipyridamole (<LINK REF="REF-Fiore-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiore 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cappelleri-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cappelleri 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pouleur-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pouleur 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the widespread use of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with ischaemic heart disease and the development of novel oral anticoagulants, which have begun to replace warfarin for stroke prevention in some patients with atrial fibrillation, these strategies are only now being tested in patients with mechanical heart valves (<LINK REF="REF-Eikelboom-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eikelboom 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 2012</LINK>). It is has been argued that the validity of the historical data for current recommendations can be questioned in view of the changes in valve prostheses, the patient population, and antithrombotic therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Hermans-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hermans 2013</LINK>). Large randomised controlled trials of novel oral anticoagulants with or without antiplatelet drugs in contemporary patients with mechanical heart valves are eagerly awaited.</P>

Two French language (<LINK REF="STD-PACTE-1978" TYPE="STUDY">PACTE 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Starkman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Starkman 1982</LINK>) and one Japanese language (<LINK REF="STD-Kasahara-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kasahara 1977</LINK>) publication were identified. One trial was published in abstract form only (<LINK REF="STD-Rajah-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rajah 1980</LINK>). This latter study was identified among the reference lists from previous publications.</P>
<P>Of the trials included, six involved the antiplatelet agent dipyridamole at daily doses of 400 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kasahara-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kasahara 1977</LINK>), 225 to 400 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Rajah-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rajah 1980</LINK>), 375 mg (<LINK REF="STD-PACTE-1978" TYPE="STUDY">PACTE 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Starkman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Starkman 1982</LINK>), or up to 5 mg/kg (<LINK REF="STD-Bran-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bran 1980</LINK>). The remaining seven trials involved aspirin at doses of 500 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Altman-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Altman 1976</LINK>), 1000 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Dale-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Dale 1977</LINK>), 100 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meschengieser-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meschengieser 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LIWACAP-2007" TYPE="STUDY">LIWACAP 2007</LINK>), 200 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Laffort-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Laffort 2000</LINK>), and 75 to 100 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Dong-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dong 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trials conducted before the use of the international normalised ratio reported target anticoagulation control as follows: elevated prothrombin times at twice normal (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1971</LINK>), 1.9 to 3.0 times normal (<LINK REF="STD-Rajah-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rajah 1980</LINK>), 1.8 to 2.3 times normal (<LINK REF="STD-Kasahara-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kasahara 1977</LINK>), 25% to 35% greater than normal (<LINK REF="STD-PACTE-1978" TYPE="STUDY">PACTE 1978</LINK>); Quick time 25% to 35% of control (<LINK REF="STD-Starkman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Starkman 1982</LINK>); as thrombotest equivalents (10% of normal) (<LINK REF="STD-Dale-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Dale 1977</LINK>); or unspecified (<LINK REF="STD-Bran-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bran 1980</LINK>) Quick time or thrombotest equivalents. The five trials published after 1990 reported a therapeutic anticoagulation goal international normalised ratio of 3.0 to 4.5 (<LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LIWACAP-2007" TYPE="STUDY">LIWACAP 2007</LINK>), 2.5 to 3.5 (<LINK REF="STD-Meschengieser-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meschengieser 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laffort-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Laffort 2000</LINK>), and 1.8 to 2.5 (<LINK REF="STD-Dong-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dong 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two trials used different intensities of OAC and were included in this meta-analysis. The <LINK REF="STD-Meschengieser-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meschengieser 1997</LINK> trial was a comparison of high-intensity OAC (international normalised ratio 3.5 to 4.5) versus low-intensity OAC (2.5 to 3.5) and 100 mg aspirin. The <LINK REF="STD-LIWACAP-2007" TYPE="STUDY">LIWACAP 2007</LINK> trial was a comparison of standard intensity OAC (INR between 3.0 and 4.5, target 3.7) versus low-intensity OAC (INR between 2.0 and 3.0, target 2.5) and 100 mg aspirin. One might anticipate that the combination might be less effective than high-intensity anticoagulation and, as such, provide a conservative estimate of effectiveness. Similarly, it is not unreasonable to expect that the risk of bleeding would be less than if the intensity of anticoagulation were similar in both groups. In essence, the inclusion of these trials should push the odds ratios for both effectiveness and bleeding towards the null. We planned sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of these trials on the overall results.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Of the three main study outcomes, an arterial thromboembolic event was well defined and the primary endpoint of all included trials. Definitions were similar and involved either transient or permanent cerebral ischaemic injury or ultrasound and/or surgically confirmed other systemic arterial embolism. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Laffort-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Laffort 2000</LINK>) reported prosthetic non-obstructive thrombi and transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) as minor embolic events. For this meta-analysis, the reported TIAs were classified as major thromboembolic events.</P>
<P>The reported data for major haemorrhagic complications of anticoagulant therapy, with or without antiplatelet therapy, were less consistent. Three of the original publications provided no data on bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Kasahara-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kasahara 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bran-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Bran 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rajah-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rajah 1980</LINK>). Data on bleeding for the Kasahara trial were abstracted from the dipyridamole meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Pouleur-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pouleur 1995</LINK>) that included unpublished data obtained from the registration file reviewed by the US Food and Drug Administration. Data from the Rajah article were also available from the Pouleur meta-analysis but excluded from ours as the denominator from the active treatment groups was reported as 68 rather than 78 as in the original abstract (rendering the results somewhat suspect). The <LINK REF="STD-Meschengieser-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meschengieser 1997</LINK> trial defined significant bleeding as that causing death, requiring transfusion or hospitalisation. In the <LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1993</LINK> trial major bleeding was defined as overt haemorrhage associated with &gt; 20 g/L drop in the haemoglobin level, the requirement for transfusion of more than two units of blood, or any intracranial, intraocular, intraarticular, or retroperitoneal bleeding. Minor bleeding constituted either epistaxis, genitourinary bleeding, or easy bruising. In the <LINK REF="STD-LIWACAP-2007" TYPE="STUDY">LIWACAP 2007</LINK> trial major bleeding comprised intracranial bleeding at computerised tomography (CT) scan, retroperitoneal bleeding at CT scan, ocular bleeding with blindness, articular bleeding, bleeding that reduced haemoglobin concentration by two g/dL or more or requiring the transfusion of two or more units of blood, or bleeding that required surgical intervention. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Altman-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Altman 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dale-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Dale 1977</LINK>) did not distinguish between major and minor bleeding events; for this analysis, any intracerebral or gastroenteric bleeding event or episode of haemoptysis was taken to represent a significant haemorrhage. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1971</LINK>) reported only three non-fatal gastrointestinal bleeding events that were presumed to be clinically severe. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dong-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dong 2011</LINK>) did not include a definition of major versus minor bleeding. A table outlined all types of haemorrhages; for this analysis major bleeding events included the cerebral haemorrhages.</P>
<P>Mortality data were explicit for 12 trials and not provided in the original publication of the <LINK REF="STD-Kasahara-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kasahara 1977</LINK> trial; these data were abstracted from the dipyridamole meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Pouleur-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pouleur 1995</LINK>) that included unpublished data.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Thromboembolic events</HEADING>
<P>The addition of an antiplatelet agent to OAC resulted in a clinically important and statistically significant reduction in thromboembolic events. Compared with OAC alone the combination of OAC and an antiplatelet agent reduced the risk of thromboembolic events with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.43 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 0.59; P &lt; 0.00001; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The test for heterogeneity was not significant (P = 0.83, I<SUP>2</SUP>= 0%). This treatment effect corresponds to a relative risk of 0.45 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.61). Trials were grouped according to study era (performed pre-1990 or later) and the antiplatelet agent used (dipyridamole or aspirin; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). Results were consistent across time and between the available agents. The results were not influenced by the meta-analysis technique used, whether a fixed-effect or random-effects model; all were statistically significant.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mortality</HEADING>
<P>Total mortality was significantly reduced when antiplatelet agents were added to OAC with an OR of 0.57 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.78; P = 0.0004; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). There was no evidence of important heterogeneity (P = 0.15, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 29%). The effect on mortality corresponds to a relative risk of 0.59 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.79). Both aspirin and dipyridamole trials (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>) and trials that were published before or after 1990 reduced mortality similarly.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Major bleeding</HEADING>
<P>Data on major bleeding were available for 12 trials. Major bleeding was increased with combination therapy, with an OR of 1.58 (95% CI 1.14 to 2.18; P = 0.006; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The test of heterogeneity was not significant (P = 0.25, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 20%). The <LINK REF="STD-Meschengieser-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meschengieser 1997 </LINK>and <LINK REF="STD-LIWACAP-2007" TYPE="STUDY">LIWACAP 2007</LINK> trials were a comparison of high-intensity OAC versus the combination of low-dose aspirin and low-intensity OAC; therefore, different degrees of anticoagulation were targeted. In those trials the risk of bleeding was not shown to be different between groups (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.74, P = 0.51; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>). When the <LINK REF="STD-Meschengieser-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meschengieser 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-LIWACAP-2007" TYPE="STUDY">LIWACAP 2007</LINK> trials were excluded from the analysis, there was stronger evidence that the risk of bleeding was increased with the addition of an antiplatelet agent (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.57, P = 0.001; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>). Unpublished data on bleeding from the <LINK REF="STD-Kasahara-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Kasahara 1977</LINK> trial were used in a previous meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Pouleur-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pouleur 1995</LINK>) and included in our analysis. Repeating the analysis with these data excluded did not alter the results. Similarly, the inclusion of the small number of events from the unpublished bleeding data from the <LINK REF="STD-Rajah-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rajah 1980</LINK> trial did not influence the results or conclusions.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of statistical interaction for the risk of major bleeding between the trials using dipyridamole or aspirin (OR 2.22 versus 1.44; P = 0.29; <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>) or whether the studies were published before or after 1990 (OR 2.34 versus 1.26; P = 0.08). We explored an aspirin dose effect. There did not appear to be an excess risk of bleeding among the four low-dose aspirin trials (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.55, P = 0.87; <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). On the other hand, higher-dose aspirin was associated with a significant excess risk of bleeding (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.43 to 4.66, P = 0.002; <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). There was evidence of statistical interaction between high and low-dose aspirin (P = 0.01) and this remained when the <LINK REF="STD-Meschengieser-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meschengieser 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-LIWACAP-2007" TYPE="STUDY">LIWACAP 2007</LINK> trials were excluded (P = 0.04).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-06-13 11:49:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main conclusion of our meta-analysis is that the addition of an antiplatelet agent, either aspirin or dipyridamole, to warfarin in patients with prosthetic heart valves reduces the risk of death and systemic thromboembolic events. Our analysis showed that dipyridamole and aspirin reduced the risks of death and thromboembolism similarly. The risk of major bleeding is increased with both dipyridamole and aspirin. Although the point estimate of bleeding risk seemed to favour aspirin over dipyridamole and for trials performed after 1990 rather than before, there was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity. Lower-dose (100 mg or less) aspirin may have the lowest bleeding risk.</P>
<P>Chesebro and colleagues performed a randomised trial comparing warfarin and dipyridamole (400 mg daily) to warfarin and aspirin (500 mg daily) in patients with a prosthetic heart valve replacement (<LINK REF="STD-Chesebro-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Chesebro 1983</LINK>). The risk of a thromboembolic event was slightly lower, but not statistically significant, among those allocated dipyridamole compared with aspirin (0.5 versus 1.8 per 100 patient-years). Bleeding rates were higher among those receiving concomitant aspirin as compared to dipyridamole (6.6 versus 1.6 per 100 patient-years, P &lt; 0.001). These results are discordant with ours and may reflect the dose of aspirin chosen; 500 mg in the Chesebro study (<LINK REF="STD-Chesebro-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Chesebro 1983</LINK>) as compared to the lower risk of bleeding when doses of aspirin of 100 mg daily (<LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1993</LINK>) are used.</P>
<P>The Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration found that aspirin or other antiplatelet drugs were protective against vascular events in high-risk patients. Furthermore, they felt that the available evidence supports the use of low-dose aspirin (75 to 150 mg daily) as an effective antiplatelet regimen for long-term use (<LINK REF="REF-Antiplatelet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antiplatelet 2002</LINK>). In our meta-analysis the relative effectiveness and safety of aspirin may reflect patient selection, the target intensity of anticoagulation (target international normalised ratio (INR)), or the dose of aspirin used. Among the six aspirin trials there was some evidence of statistical heterogeneity for total mortality (P = 0.09) but not risk of thromboembolism (P = 0.48) or major bleeding (P = 0.15). One possible explanation is the dose of aspirin used: 100 mg daily in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1993</LINK>) compared to 200 to 1000 mg daily in the other aspirin trials (<LINK REF="STD-Altman-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Altman 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dale-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Dale 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laffort-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Laffort 2000</LINK>). The risk of death was lower in the low-dose aspirin trial (<LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1993</LINK>) (odds ratio (OR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.84; P = 0.014) compared with the higher-dose aspirin trials (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.49; P = 0.72) and the test of interaction for the differences between these subgroups was conventionally statistically significant (P = 0.05). For the low-dose aspirin trial (<LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1993</LINK>) the risk of major bleeding (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.44) was not increased compared with warfarin alone. Although the risk of major bleeding was increased for the higher-dose aspirin trials (OR 2.58) and statistically significantly greater than OAC alone (P = 0.002), there was no statistical evidence of interaction based on dose of aspirin (P = 0.13). It must be stressed that these subgroup analyses, although pre-defined, are based on a limited number of events in each subgroup and, as such, are potentially unstable. They should be considered hypothesis generating.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, more detailed discussion of three of the recent trials may provide further insight into the potential role of aspirin. Of the 12 trials, <LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1993</LINK> had the highest methodology score (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). It was a double-blind, randomised controlled trial where 186 patients were assigned to aspirin (100 mg/day sustained release) plus warfarin and 184 to placebo plus warfarin (<LINK REF="STD-Turpie-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Turpie 1993</LINK>). Patients were included if they had a mechanical prosthetic valve or were those with tissue valves and atrial fibrillation or a history of thromboembolism. The target INR was 3.0 to 4.5. The primary endpoint (major embolism or death) was reduced among those assigned to aspirin (1.9% versus 8.5% per year; P &lt; 0.001). The stroke rate (1.3% versus 4.2% per year; P = 0.027) and overall mortality (2.8% versus 7.4%; P = 0.01) was reduced with aspirin. Furthermore, a composite outcome that could reflect net clinical benefit (major systemic embolism, nonfatal intracranial haemorrhage, death due to haemorrhage, and vascular deaths) was also reduced with aspirin (3.9% versus 9.9% per year; P = 0.005). Although the risk of bleeding was increased with aspirin this was primarily due to minor bleeding including bruising, epistaxis, and haematuria. Importantly, the risk of major haemorrhagic events did not differ significantly between groups (8.5% aspirin versus 6.6% placebo; P = 0.43).</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Meschengieser-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Meschengieser 1997</LINK> trial patients were randomised to either a high target INR (3.5 to 4.5; mean achieved 3.98) or a lower target INR (2.5 to 3.5; mean achieved 3.11) plus aspirin 100 mg daily. The primary outcome events were rates of thromboembolism and bleeding. The rates of thromboembolism were similar at 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively. The risk of major bleeding (4.5% warfarin alone versus 2.3% warfarin plus aspirin) and minor bleeding (17% warfarin alone versus 14% warfarin plus aspirin) did not differ between groups but tended to favour the combination of low-dose aspirin and lower target level of anticoagulation. Three intracranial haemorrhages occurred in the warfarin alone arm; none were seen in the combination arm. Therefore, the addition of low-dose aspirin with a lower level of anticoagulation was as effective, and possibly safer, when compared with a higher level of anticoagulation. Similar results were seen in the <LINK REF="STD-LIWACAP-2007" TYPE="STUDY">LIWACAP 2007</LINK> trial in which patients were randomised to standard-intensity OAC (INR between 3.0 and 4.5, target 3.7) versus low-intensity OAC (INR between 2.0 and 3.0, target 2.5) and 100 mg aspirin. Follow-up was only for six months and there were few events in this pilot study. There were no differences in thromboembolic or major bleeding events although the trial was severely underpowered.</P>
<P>These results are consistent with the randomised trial by <LINK REF="REF-Altman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1991</LINK> who compared the effect of a low (INR 2.0 to 3.0) or high (INR 3.0 to 4.3) degree of anticoagulation in combination with dipyridamole (150 mg/day) and aspirin (660 mg/day) in patients with heart valve replacement. The rates of thromboembolic events were similar between the low and high INR groups (1.92 versus 4.94 per 100 patient-years, respectively), although there were very few events overall. The risk of bleeding, however, was less with the lower target INR (3.8 versus 24.7 per 100 patient-years, P &lt; 0.02). They concluded that a lower INR (2.0 to 3.0) used conjointly with platelet inhibitors was effective and safer than a higher target INR (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most recent trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dong-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dong 2011</LINK>) included young patients (mean age of 35 years) with primarily rheumatic heart disease who underwent mechanical valve replacement. The risk of major bleeding was only 0.4%. In addition, they used low-dose aspirin (75 to 100 mg daily) and a target INR of 1.8 to 2.5. In this study the rate of reliable anticoagulation was only 33% to 36%. Thromboembolism rates favoured the combination of OAC and low-dose aspirin at 2.1% versus 3.6% with OAC alone (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.09).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Improvements over previous meta-analyses</HEADING>
<P>The first overview comparing rates of valve thrombosis, major embolism, and bleeding was unable to show an advantage of the combination of aspirin and anticoagulation over anticoagulation alone; bleeding risk was increased, however (<LINK REF="REF-Cannegieter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cannegieter 1994</LINK>). The studies included in that overview were not comparative randomised trials. The meta-analyses performed by Fiore and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Fiore-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiore 1993</LINK>) and Cappelleri and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Cappelleri-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cappelleri 1995</LINK>) were subject to bias through inclusion of English language only trials published as full manuscripts. The Fiore meta-analysis, published in abstract form only, included four trials comparing the use of aspirin as an adjunct to oral anticoagulation. The Cappelleri meta-analysis included five trials; four involving aspirin and one involving dipyridamole. Moreover, the study by Chesebro and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Chesebro-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Chesebro 1983</LINK>) was included in both these meta-analyses, but was excluded from ours, as patients treated with warfarin were only randomised to receive either aspirin or dipyridamole. Although a control group receiving warfarin alone was subsequently included in the analysis, patients were not randomised to warfarin alone or warfarin and either of the two antiplatelet regimens. The Pouleur et al meta-analysis comprised trials of dipyridamole only (<LINK REF="REF-Pouleur-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pouleur 1995</LINK>). It also included previously unpublished data, updated from the original publications, and included in a submission to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For the endpoints of thromboembolic events and death the results of our meta-analysis are in accord with theirs and sensitivity analyses show that inclusion or exclusion of the unpublished data from published trials does not materially change our results or conclusions. The one discrepancy is for the endpoint of bleeding. Our meta-analysis suggests that bleeding risk is increased with dipyridamole but theirs does not (OR 2.22 versus 1.001, respectively). The test of heterogeneity between the analyses is conventionally statistically significant (P = 0.046). This may reflect our emphasis on major bleeding, whereas they included data on any haemorrhagic events, whether fatal or not (<LINK REF="REF-Pouleur-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pouleur 1995</LINK>). The differences may also reflect the use of unpublished data. In this regard, the bleeding risks for two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PACTE-1978" TYPE="STUDY">PACTE 1978</LINK>) were qualitatively different in the Pouleur meta-analysis as compared with the original publications. In both original studies the bleeding risk was slightly higher with dipyridamole; in the data used in the meta-analysis the bleeding risk was lower. As such, our results may represent a more conservative estimate of bleeding risk.</P>
<P>In comparison with the above, our meta-analysis is more powerful, including data on 4122 participants from 13 trials and is less subject to bias through our inclusion of trials in any language, using dipyridamole or aspirin, and publications as a manuscript or abstract. Furthermore, the robustness of our conclusions is reinforced through extensive sensitivity analyses which, among other things, included the impact of unpublished data, English language or other publications, and some measures of individual trial quality. None of these methodological factors impacted on our estimate of the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive antiplatelet therapy.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Potential limitations</HEADING>
<P>The results and conclusions derived from a meta-analysis are governed by the internal validity of the individual studies included. We found no evidence of publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). In general, the quality of the included trials tended to be low (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>), possibly reflecting the era when the majority of the trials were conducted (1970s and 1980s when trial methodology was less advanced). It has also been shown that incorporation of studies of low methodological quality tends to show an increased estimate of benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Moher--1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>). However, our sensitivity analyses did not detect any effect of exclusion of individual trials (some of which were of lesser quality, for example <LINK REF="STD-Rajah-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rajah 1980</LINK> published as an abstract only) or a difference among double-blinded trials on the rates of thromboembolism or death.</P>
<P>We did not use blinded techniques during study selection or data abstraction as such procedures have not been found to be necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Berlin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlin 1997</LINK>). The possibility of publication bias in medical research is important, but difficult to eliminate when performing a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 1997</LINK>). Currently, use of unpublished data in meta-analyses remains controversial, but such data should not be systematically excluded (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1993</LINK>). Our analysis included all published data from the included randomised trials as well as some unpublished data obtained for an FDA submission and used in a previous meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Pouleur-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pouleur 1995</LINK>). We were unable to verify these unpublished data. However, sensitivity analyses excluding the unpublished data did not alter our conclusions. We included trials which claimed to have used proper randomisation techniques but did not seek to authenticate the veracity of these claims (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1995</LINK>). Furthermore, although improper concealment of treatment allocation has been shown to be an important source of bias in randomised controlled trials (and therefore in meta-analyses based upon them) none of the included trials provided adequate information on this (<LINK REF="REF-Schultz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 1995</LINK>). Given the methodological quality of the included studies our conclusions would be of moderate grade.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-06-17 18:57:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-06-13 11:54:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Ackermann">
<P>Our results suggest that antiplatelet drugs, whether aspirin or dipyridamole, could be safely added to anticoagulation with an acceptable risk of bleeding and with the expectation that rates of death and thromboembolism would be reduced. These results apply to patients with mechanical prosthetic valves or those with biological valves and indicators of high risk such as atrial fibrillation or prior thromboembolic events.</P>
<P>As to choice of antiplatelet agent, our data do not allow us to make strong recommendations. The effectiveness of low-dose aspirin (100 mg daily) appears similar to higher-dose aspirin and dipyridamole. Our updated meta-analysis suggests that a daily aspirin dose of 100 mg or less seems to be associated with a lower risk of major bleeding. The Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Antiplatelet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antiplatelet 2002</LINK>) concluded that low-dose aspirin (75 mg daily) is an effective antiplatelet regimen for long-term use and is at least as effective as higher daily doses. Dipyridamole was no more effective than aspirin. Moreover, <LINK REF="REF-Stein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2001</LINK> and colleagues (Antithrombotic Therapy in Patients with Mechanical and Biological Prosthetic Heart Valves) stated: "Data are insufficient to recommend dipyridamole over low dose aspirin in combination with warfarin" and further "...in view of the advantageous effects of low-dose aspirin in combination with oral anticoagulants, the indications for use of dipyridamole require further investigation". Therefore, there appears to be a consensus view that low-dose aspirin is the preferred antiplatelet drug.</P>
<P>It is quite possible that outcomes would be improved with a more widespread use of antiplatelet drugs as compared with existing guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2001</LINK>). A survey performed in 1997 showed that low-dose aspirin was underused by North American cardiac surgeons. Only 21% of respondents routinely used aspirin in conjunction with anticoagulants among patients with prosthetic heart valves. The two most common reasons for not using aspirin were the perceived increase in bleeding risk (49% of non-users) or lack of proven benefit (23% of non-users) (<LINK REF="REF-Ray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ray 1997</LINK>). These concerns are unfounded and not in accord with the available trial and meta-analytic evidence.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-06-17 18:57:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>Prosthetic valve type and position were not specifically reviewed as the original publications did not consistently examine the outcomes using these variables. Certainly, the benefits of combined oral anticoagulant (OAC) and antiplatelet drugs would be expected to be greatest in patients with high-risk characteristics for thromboembolism. For example, patients with a mechanical mitral valve with atrial fibrillation, combined mitral and aortic valve prostheses, or any valve type with prior thromboembolic events would be considered higher risk than a single mechanical aortic or mitral prothesis and no high-risk indicators. Trials of OAC and OAC with various antiplatelet drugs, assessing the balance of thromboembolic event prevention versus increased risk of bleeding, in these relatively lower-risk subgroups would be clinically important.</P>
<P>Although aspirin appears to be the preferred antiplatelet drug, the recent widespread use of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor blockers (e.g. clopidogrel (<LINK REF="REF-Sudlow-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sudlow 2009</LINK>), prasugrel (<LINK REF="REF-TRITON-TIMI_x002d_38-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">TRITON TIMI-38 2009</LINK>), or ticagrelor (<LINK REF="REF-Wallentin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallentin 2009</LINK>)) and favourable results with novel cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (triflusal, <LINK REF="REF-TRAC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">TRAC 2005</LINK>) raises the issue of whether aspirin is indeed the best antiplatelet to combine with OAC in the population of patients with prosthetic heart valves. A contemporary, well-designed randomised controlled trial comparing OAC with low-dose aspirin against OAC with one of the newer antiplatelet agents would also likely be clinically important.</P>
