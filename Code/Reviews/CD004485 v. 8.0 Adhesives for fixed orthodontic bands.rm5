<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Orthodontic treatment involves using fixed or removable appliances (dental braces) to correct the positions of teeth. It has been shown that the quality of treatment result obtained with fixed appliances is much better than with removable appliances. Fixed appliances are, therefore, favoured by most orthodontists for treatment. The success of a fixed orthodontic appliance depends on the metal attachments (brackets and bands) being attached securely to the teeth so that they do not become loose during treatment. Brackets are usually attached to the front and side teeth, whereas bands (metal rings that go round the teeth) are more commonly used on the back teeth (molars). A number of adhesives are available to attach bands to teeth and it is important to understand which group of adhesives bond most reliably, as well as reducing or preventing dental decay during the treatment period.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness of the adhesives used to attach bands to teeth during fixed appliance treatment, in terms of:<BR/>(1) how often the bands come off during treatment; and<BR/>(2) whether they protect the banded teeth against decay during fixed appliance treatment.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-09-21 12:19:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The following electronic databases were searched: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (searched 2 June 2016), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 5) in the Cochrane Library (searched 2 June 2016), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 2 June 2016) and EMBASE Ovid (1980 to 2 June 2016). We searched <A HREF="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</A> and the <A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform</A> for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and controlled clinical trials (RCTs and CCTs) (including split-mouth studies) of adhesives used to attach orthodontic bands to molar teeth were selected. Patients with full arch fixed orthodontic appliance(s) who had bands attached to molars were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>All review authors were involved in study selection, validity assessment and data extraction without blinding to the authors, adhesives used or results obtained. All disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Five RCTs and three CCTs were identified as meeting the review's inclusion criteria. All the included trials were of split-mouth design. Four trials compared chemically cured zinc phosphate and chemically cured glass ionomer; three trials compared chemically cured glass ionomer cement with light cured compomer; one trial compared chemically cured glass ionomer with a chemically cured glass phosphonate. Data analysis was often inappropriate within the studies meeting the inclusion criteria.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient high quality evidence with regard to the most effective adhesive for attaching orthodontic bands to molar teeth. Further RCTs are required.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-09-21 13:47:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Orthodontic treatment involves using fixed or removable appliances (dental braces) to correct the positions of teeth. In England and Wales between April 2001 and March 2002, claims for fixed appliances were made by the General Dental Services at an approximate cost of GBP 57 million to the National Health Service (<LINK REF="REF-DPB-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DPB 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In Finnish municipal health centres, the cost of orthodontic treatment per patient up to the age of 18 was, on average, FIM 7358, ranging from FIM 1299 to FIM 24,751 (<LINK REF="REF-Pietila-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pietila 1998</LINK>). In the US, orthodontic treatment accounted for 39% of the costs (~ USD 2480 +/- USD 364) of surgical-orthodontic treatment in community hospital care (<LINK REF="REF-Panula-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panula 2002</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Who receives orthodontic treatment?</HEADING>
<P>The majority of orthodontic treatment is carried out for children aged 10 to 14 years and is primarily concerned with correcting severe crowding and rotations, buried teeth or very prominent teeth. In the UK, epidemiological data reveal that two thirds of 11 to 12 year old children have either a moderate or severe need for orthodontic treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holmes-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 1992</LINK>). There is also a great demand for treatment with an average time on UK hospital waiting lists of 16 months (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 1999</LINK>). Demand and need for orthodontics, however, is increasing among adults who now make up almost 25% of cases in US orthodontic practices (<LINK REF="REF-Keim-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keim 2002a</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adhesives for fixed orthodontic appliances</HEADING>
<P>It has been shown that the quality of treatment result obtained with fixed appliances is much better than with removable appliances (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richmond-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richmond 1993</LINK>). Fixed appliances, are therefore, favoured by most orthodontists for treatment.</P>
<P>The success of a fixed appliance depends on the metal attachments (brackets and bands) being attached to the teeth so that they do not become detached during treatment. Brackets are usually attached to teeth other than molars, where bands (metal rings that go round each tooth) are more commonly used (<LINK REF="STD-Stirrups-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Stirrups 1991</LINK>). There should be a low rate of failure of brackets and bands. The need to replace bands, during a 2-year course of treatment, slows down the progress of treatment with a fixed appliance. It can also be costly in terms of clinical time, materials and time lost from education/work for the patient. Loose bands also predispose the tooth surface under the band to dental decay.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Ideal properties of adhesive for banding fixed orthodontic appliances</HEADING>
<P>Orthodontic bands are subjected to a large number of forces in the mouth resulting in a complex distribution of stresses within the adhesive and its junctions with the enamel and the band interior (<LINK REF="REF-Durning-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durning 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Millett-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millett 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ideally the adhesive strength should be.<BR/>(1) Strong enough to keep the band on the tooth for the length of the treatment.<BR/>(2) Not so strong that the tooth surface is damaged when the band is removed.</P>
<P>The adhesive should ideally be.<BR/>(1) Easy to use clinically.<BR/>(2) Protective against dental caries (decay).<BR/>(3) Of reasonable cost.</P>
<P>Zinc phosphate, zinc silicophosphate and zinc polycarboxylate cements were used as principal band cements until the early 1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Gottlieb-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottlieb 1996</LINK>). These cements are chemically-cured (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-_x00d8_ilo-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Øilo 1991</LINK>). Zinc phosphate cements are usually supplied as a powder (which is principally zinc oxide) and a liquid, comprising an aqueous solution of phosphoric acid. Zinc silicophosphate cements are also supplied as powder and liquid; the powder is a mixture of zinc oxide and aluminosilicate glass and the liquid is an aqueous solution of phosphoric acid with buffers. Zinc polycarboxylate cements are supplied as either powder and acidic liquid or as powder which is mixed with water. For the former, the powder is finely ground zinc oxide which on occasion contains small quantities of other oxides, such as magnesium oxide. The liquid is an aqueous solution of about 40% polyacrylic acid. For the powder/water materials, the powder is zinc oxide and freeze-dried polyacrylic acid. The setting reaction of zinc polycarboxylate cements is by an acid-base reaction.</P>
<P>Some of these cements are still used by a small proportion of orthodontists for band cementation although most orthodontists now use a glass ionomer or glass ionomer based cement for this purpose (<LINK REF="REF-Keim-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keim 2002b</LINK>). These newer cements may be classified as follows (<LINK REF="REF-McCabe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCabe 1998</LINK>).<BR/>(1) Glass ionomer cements supplied as a powder with acidic liquid, or powder with water.<BR/>(2) Polyacid-modified composite resin (compomer) which are resin-matrix composites, similar to 'white' filling materials, and have some glass ionomer filler particles.<BR/>(3) Resin-modified glass ionomer cements which are hybrids of their resin-matrix and glass ionomer parent groups.</P>
<P>Glass ionomer cements set by an acid-base reaction (chemical-curing) similar to that of zinc polycarboxylate cements whereas polyacid-modified composite resin (compomer) sets via free radicle polymerisation of the methacrylate groups, which is often light-activated (light-curing); there is no acid-base reaction. Resin-modified glass ionomers often have a tri-cure mechanism of setting: an acid-base reaction, a light-cured polymerisation reaction and a self cure polymerisation reaction.</P>
<P>With the number of adhesives available to apply bands to teeth, it is important to understand which group bonds most reliably, as well as reducing or preventing dental decay during the treatment period.</P>
<P>Null hypothesis:<BR/>There is no difference in the effectiveness of different types of adhesives in terms of how often the bands come off during treatment and whether they protect the banded teeth against decay during fixed orthodontic appliance treatment.</P>
<P>Working hypothesis:<BR/>Some types of orthodontic adhesives are better at bonding metal bands to teeth and protecting the teeth against decay during fixed orthodontic appliance treatment.</P>

</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Any patient with full arch fixed orthodontic appliance(s) who had bands attached to molars were included. Patients with cleft lip or palate were excluded due to the higher prevalence of molar crossbite in this group, which has been shown to significantly affect molar band failure rate and band survival time (<LINK REF="REF-Hodges-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodges 2001</LINK>).

<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Dichotomous data on the success of each adhesive (whether the metal band stays cemented to the tooth or not) were recorded. Where these data were not available, annualised failure rates of adhesives, i.e. the rate at which the metal bands become detached during treatment, were noted.</P>
<P>Dichotomous data on the presence or absence of decay (decalcification) associated with or around the bands were recorded. If data exist on size/area of decalcifications, these were also included.</P>

<P>All eligible studies were assessed for the appropriateness of their analysis. The statistical analysis was considered inappropriate if:<BR/>(1) a split-mouth design did not take the clustering of the teeth or 'pairing' into account;<BR/>(2) all failures were included without taking into account multiple failures on the same tooth.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>Comparisons were made firstly between any of the six main types of adhesive. If possible, comparisons were to be made within groups and, where appropriate, between chemical and light-cured adhesives as follows:<BR/>(1) zinc phosphate cement - variables on powder and liquid (product is not light-cured);<BR/>(2) zinc silicophosphate cement - variables on powder and liquid (product is not light-cured);<BR/>(3) zinc polycarboxylate - variables on powder and liquid (product is not light-cured);<BR/>(4) glass ionomer cement - conventional (variables on glass and acid);<BR/>(5) polyacid-modified composite resin (compomer) - variables on composite matrix and glass ionomer particles;<BR/>(6) resin-modified glass ionomer cement - variables on type of acid, resin and polymerisation mechanism; and<BR/>(7) glass phosphonate - variables of type of glass, phosphonate.</P>
<P>Within group comparisons assessing products of different brand names to see if any adhesive of the same type performs better than another of the same type, were also to be undertaken if data allowed.</P>
<P>The following data synthesis was planned if data allowed.<BR/>(1) Heterogeneity was to be assessed by inspection of a graphical display of the estimated treatment effects from the trials along with their 95% confidence intervals and by Cochran's test for homogeneity undertaken before each meta-analysis. Any heterogeneity was to be investigated.<BR/>(2) Meta-analyses were to be undertaken only on studies of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures. The Cochrane Statistical Methods Group guidelines were to be followed, calculating risk ratios along with 95% confidence intervals and they were to be combined using a random-effects model. The number needed to treat (NNT) was to be calculated to prevent one extra band failing, as appropriate.<BR/>(3) Heterogeneity was to be investigated for aspects of study quality and for potential sources of heterogeneity specified a priori as follows: excluding/including unpublished studies, excluding/including studies of low quality and excluding/including one or more large studies to assess how much they dominate the results. Identification of studies of low quality was undertaken using the criteria given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). The association of these factors with estimated effects was to be examined by performing random-effects metaregression analysis in Stata version 7.0 (Stata Corporation, USA), using the program Metareg. Further potential sources of heterogeneity were to be investigated as determined from the study reports, although these would have been clearly identified as 'post-hoc' analyses and the results treated with caution.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-09-21 13:54:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Following application of the exclusion criteria adopted for this review, four of the eight trials identified compared chemically cured zinc phosphate with chemically cured glass ionomer. Fewer studies made comparison of chemically cured glass ionomer with light-cured compomer or chemically cured glass phosphonate. Five studies were excluded because they did not compare two band adhesives and a further seven studies were removed because the study design was unclear or has not been clarified to date by the authors. It is disappointing that several authors did not present the study plan in greater detail.</P>
<P>Of the included studies, band failure has been reported for each adhesive group (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fricker-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fricker 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2005</LINK>) or per site (<LINK REF="STD-Stirrups-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Stirrups 1991</LINK>) but not on a per patient basis. This precluded the undertaking of a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The method of randomisation was only adequate in three of the included trials. In the four other trials, the risk of bias would be regarded as moderate to high (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In one trial, allocation concealment was adequate with sealed envelopes being used for cement and quadrant allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2005</LINK>). Blinding the operator to outcome assessment was unclear in all trials. Regretably, a sample size calculation was only reported in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2005</LINK>). Five studies had no dropouts; one dropout occurred in one trial but the number of dropouts was not adequately clarified in two trials.</P>
<P>Furthermore insufficient reporting of band failure rate was made in all studies. Greater care is required to ensure that the statistical analyses are most appropriate for the trial design adopted. Split-mouth trials can be used when the adhesives being assessed do not release an agent that could influence failure or decalcification. However, where a split-mouth design is used, the mean failure rate or mean survival time per band adhesive type per patient should be reported along with standard deviation or 95% confidence intervals. Where individual patients are allocated to one or other band adhesive type, then the outcome data with respect to adhesive failure /survival should be reported in the same manner.</P>
<P>Only two trials report outcome assessment at the completion of the treatment period (<LINK REF="STD-Galarraga-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Galarraga 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillgrass-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gillgrass 2001</LINK>). A previously published systematic review examining the effectiveness of adhesives for fixed orthodontic brackets excluded all trials that did not follow patients until the end of the appliance treatment period (<LINK REF="REF-Mandall-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandall 2003</LINK>). Whilst the current review has been less restrictive in its inclusion criteria, future trials should report outcomes following the completion of treatment to enable a more objective assessment of the effectiveness of one band adhesive over another.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Qualitative comparison of orthodontic band adhesives</HEADING>

<P>Again, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of one adhesive (chemically cured glass ionomer or light-cured componer) over the other with regard to band failure (<LINK REF="STD-Fricker-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fricker 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillgrass-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gillgrass 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2005</LINK>). One trial presented data in an inappropriate format (<LINK REF="STD-Fricker-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Fricker 1997</LINK>); two trials showed low band failure rates for both adhesives (<LINK REF="STD-Gillgrass-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gillgrass 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2005</LINK>), although one of the trials did not present the number of failures per person (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is weak evidence from one trial that there is no statistically significant difference in enamel decalcification with either cement (<LINK REF="STD-Gillgrass-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gillgrass 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Chemically cured glass ionomer with a chemically cured glass phosphonate</HEADING>
<P>One trial compared chemically cured glass ionomer with a chemically cured glass phosphonate. Low band failure rates were recorded; however, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of one adhesive over the other (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2003</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Reporting quality</HEADING>
<P>Concealment allocation was particularly poor in the trials included, with only one trial reporting this. There were overall high rates of patient follow-up which suggest that it is possible to minimize sample attrition bias in trials of orthodontic band adhesives. However, in two trials the number of dropouts was unclear. Blinding to the study outcome measure(s) was also very poorly reported.</P>
<P>Provided the band adhesives being compared had the same curing mechanism and mixing requirements, then blinding of patient and operator to the adhesive type would be possible. Where different curing mechanisms exist between the two adhesives being compared, blinding of the patient only could be done if the explanations were carried out carefully.</P>

<P>In view of the poor quality of the trials identified for this systematic review, conclusions cannot be drawn. However, in designing future trials, the following should be considered.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Clear inclusion/exclusion criteria should be set.</LI>
<LI>Involvement of a statistician in study design (single blind or double blind if feasible), sample size calculation and projected data analyses.</LI>
<LI>Allocate a single adhesive per patient, rather than a split-mouth study with two adhesives per patient, if either adhesive releases an agent that could influence failure or decalcification.</LI>
<LI>Treatment, except for the intervention, should be similar for each trial subject.</LI>
<LI>Occlusal interferences that may affect band failure should be recorded.</LI>
<LI>Patients should be followed to the end of treatment.</LI>
<LI>All dropouts and withdrawals should be recorded and included in any analysis.</LI>
<LI>The failure rate of each adhesive and the change in decalcification score with treatment should be presented on a per patient basis.</LI>
<LI>Assessors should be calibrated with regard to assessment of decalcification.</LI>
<LI>Include standard deviation (or 95% confidence interval (CI)) with mean number of failures or mean survival time for each adhesive system.</LI>
