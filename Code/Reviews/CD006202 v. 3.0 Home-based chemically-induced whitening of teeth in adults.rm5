<P>Tooth whitening products for use at home work over a short period of time but users should be aware of common side effects and note that long-term data on their use are not yet available.<BR/>Products for whitening teeth at home are available 'over-the-counter' or from dentists. This review looks at whether such tooth whitening products work and, if so, which are more effective. The review focuses on products which have a chemical, bleaching action rather than an abrasive action. Results found that over a short period of time these products do work, and that there are differences between the products, mainly due to the levels of active ingredients, hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide.

</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>During the last decade tooth whitening products have become widely available in the USA for sale over-the-counter or dispensed by dentists for use at home. With the current rapid growth in demand for tooth whitening it is imperative that the dental community base its recommendations to patients on sound scientific evaluations conducted in well-designed and independent studies.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness (versus a placebo or another active product) and side effects of over-the-counter or dentist-dispensed chemically-based tooth whitening products designed for home use.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2005, Issue 3); MEDLINE (January 1966 to September week 2 2005); and EMBASE (1988 to week 39 2005). The tables of content of selected dental journals published since 1995 were searched for additional references. Written requests for additional studies and information were mailed to experts in this area of research. After a final set of studies was identified, the list of references reported in the included reports was reviewed to identify additional studies. Studies published in English and non-English were considered in this review.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials of dentist-dispensed or over-the-counter tooth whitening products with a chemical action (rather than abrasive action), for home use.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Screening of titles and abstracts, data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken independently and in duplicate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>A total of 416 articles were identified, 25 of which met the inclusion criteria and presented data that could be used in the analysis. All included trials measured effectiveness immediately after 2 weeks of product application. Only 13 studies reported outcome data 1 week after the 2-week application period, and of those only six reported outcome data after 1 month or longer. Four of the included trials were assessed as at moderate risk of bias and the remainder at high risk of bias. All trials were sponsored by the manufacturers of tooth whitening products.</P>
<P>Six trials compared different whitening products (gel in trays, paint-on films and whitening strips) with placebo/no treatment and all analyses showed the products to be effective, although most comparisons were based on single trials.</P>
<P>Nineteen trials compared different whitening products with each other. There was only one meta-analysis which included more than one trial which showed statistically significant differences between the different whitening products. Strips (5.5% to 6.5% hydrogen peroxide (HP)) are more effective than gel in tray at 10% carbamide peroxide (CP) mean difference 1.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 3.38). All of these trials were assessed as of high risk of bias.</P>
<P>'Mild' to 'moderate' tooth sensitivity and gingival irritation were the most common side effects. The whitening strips and products with high concentrations of HP caused more users to complain from tooth sensitivity. The protocols for preparation of participants prior to bleaching were inconsistent among the studies. Data on baseline scores of whiteness were not reported by the majority of the studies. The current evidence base on tooth whitening products suffers from methodological and publication biases.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is evidence that whitening products work when compared with placebo/no treatment. There are differences in efficacy between the products, mainly due to the levels of active ingredients, hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. All trials were however short term and the majority of the studies were judged to be at high risk of bias and were either sponsored or conducted by the manufacturers. There is a need for pragmatic long-term and independent clinical studies that include participants representing diverse populations. There is also a need to evaluate long-term harms. Several studies reported (where measured) the common side effects of tooth sensitivity and gingival irritation, and people should be informed of this.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-06 15:00:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Since the mid 1980s, the marketing and availability of tooth whitening products has exponentially increased in the USA. Tooth whitening products are the hottest selling oral care products and the public demand for 'whiter teeth' seems to be consistently growing. Until the 1990s, the focus of dentists and patients was on whitening non-vital teeth that had discoloured after endodontic treatment or teeth discoloured after the use of tetracycline (<LINK REF="REF-Cooley-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooley 1974</LINK>). In the late 1980s, the field of tooth whitening dramatically changed with the increased marketing of new products for vital tooth bleaching at home (<LINK REF="REF-Haywood-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haywood 1989</LINK>). While initially tooth whitening products were applied in dental offices, products that are used by patients in their homes have become widely available since the mid 1990s.</P>
<P>Products available for home use include gels, rinses, gums, toothpastes, paint-on films, and whitening strips. The two common active ingredients in whitening products are either carbamide or hydrogen peroxide (<LINK REF="REF-Sarrett-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarrett 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yarborough-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yarborough 1991</LINK>). There have been claims that hydrogen peroxide whitens teeth and is safe with some minor side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Haywood-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haywood 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haywood-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haywood 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nathanson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathanson 1987</LINK>). There are also claims that carbamide peroxide is less effective than hydrogen peroxide but has fewer side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Darnell-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darnell 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haywood-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haywood 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nathanson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathanson 1987</LINK>). This review evaluates these claims. </P>
<P>The American Dental Association (ADA) has awarded its Seal of Acceptance to Colgate Platinum Daytime Professional Whitening System (Colgate Oral Pharmaceuticals Inc.); Nite White Classic Whitening Gel (Discus Dental Inc.); and Opalescence Whitening Gel (Ultradent Products Inc.) (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2006</LINK>). All these products contain 10% carbamide peroxide and are dispensed by dentists to their patients for use at home. There are other products marketed in the USA that are not approved by the ADA but are sold over-the-counter (OTC). One such product is Procter and Gamble's Whitening Strips. The British Dental Association has only accepted one abrasive-based toothpaste (Macleans Whitening Toothpaste) and has not yet approved any product containing hydrogen or carbamide peroxide for use at home (<LINK REF="REF-BDA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">BDA 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>While regulatory and certifying organizations consider the scientific evidence prior to approval of a product, the scientific validity of the supporting evidence on tooth whitening materials has not yet been critically evaluated in systematic reviews. In the USA, the ADA is developing new guidelines for dentist-dispensed, for home use, and over-the-counter whitening products. The European Commission published its recommendation on December 21, 2005, in which it stated that "the proper use of tooth whitening products containing &gt; 0.1% to 6.0% hydrogen peroxide (or equivalent for hydrogen peroxide releasing substances) is considered safe after consultation with and approval of the consumer's dentist." (<LINK REF="REF-EC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EC 2005</LINK>). The current status of regulations regarding peroxide products for use at home is still unsettled. There are diverse opinions on what is an effective and safe concentration.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To investigate the effectiveness and relative effectiveness of tooth whitening products with chemical, bleaching action, that are available for use at home (dispensed by a dentist or over-the-counter (OTC)).</P>
<P>To evaluate the harms, if any, reported in randomised controlled trials of such tooth whitening products.</P>
<P>The review focuses on bleaching products containing hydrogen peroxide, carbamide peroxide (urea peroxide), or other newer chemicals. Toothpastes containing abrasive ingredients to clean teeth will be considered in a separate review.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing dentist-dispensed or over-the-counter (OTC) tooth whitening products (with chemical, bleaching action) with placebo or other comparable products were included.</P>
<P>Only clinical trials, parallel or split design, involving human subjects were considered.</P>
<P>Full reports (either published or obtained from the investigators) had to be available for inclusion in the review.</P>
<P>The application of the tooth whitening products had to be exclusively carried out at home and outcome data had to be presented for tooth whiteness immediately after 2 weeks of product application.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adults 18 years or older with teeth that were not stained because of use of tetracycline, systemic fluoride intake, or systemic diseases or developmental conditions.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Any tooth whitening product, for use at home, which has a chemical, bleaching action rather than abrasive action. The products could be dentist-dispensed or available OTC. Products include gels applied in trays, paint-on films, and whitening strips. All application regimens and protocols were considered. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The data assessing the whiteness status of teeth are usually measured using one of two methods:<BR/>(1) digital readings of 'whiteness' obtained using a digital imaging device/colorimeter (e.g. Minolta CR-221 Chroma Meter), either from digital images or directly from facial tooth surfaces;<BR/>(2) ordinal scales (e.g. Vita® Shade Guide, Bad Sackingen, Germany) or equivalent guides to evaluate the degree of whiteness.</P>
<P>The Chroma Meter measures the following colour parameters directly from anterior teeth: lightness (black-white) (L); red-green spectrum (a); and, yellow-blue spectrum (b). The changes in the *L*a*b scales, as described by the Commission International de L'Eclariage (<LINK REF="REF-CIE-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">CIE 1978</LINK>), were used in the included studies to compute an overall colour change value (Delta E) by computing the square root of the sum of squared values of the differences in the *L*a*b scales between the baseline and follow-up assessments. The degree of tooth whiteness is a by product of an increase in L and a decrease in 'a' and 'b' spectra (<LINK REF="REF-Rustogi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rustogi 1994</LINK>). The Chroma Meter is considered to be an objective measurement of whiteness in comparison with the shade guide which is subjective (<LINK REF="STD-Matis-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Matis 2000</LINK>). Delta E was used in this review as the outcome measure because it was consistently reported by all included studies and it represents a composite measure of the overall change in colour. Delta E is computed for each subject using the 'a', 'b', and 'L' scores. Hence, because individual scores of Delta E are not reported in published studies, we could not estimate it using averages 'a', 'b', and 'L' scores. Delta E does not indicate the direction of change in the composite assessment of colour. In this review, however, given that all products produce whiter teeth, the direction of change is positive towards an increase in the whiteness and brightness of the examined teeth.</P>
<P>The Vita Shade Guide has 16 tooth tabs with different shades of colour. A low score indicates that the tooth is lighter in colour than a tooth with a high score. Though the shade guides represent ordinal scales, the conventional method of analysis reported in the literature has been to average the scores. This approach may be statistically inappropriate because two individuals with different 'whiteness' profiles may end up with close averages due to the nature of the distribution of the scores.</P>
<P>Both methods of assessing tooth whiteness will be considered, however, the data generated by the Chroma Meter and Vita Shade Guide are not considered quantitatively comparable. </P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-08-06 14:37:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We attempted to identify all relevant studies published between January 1966 and September 2005 in all languages. We searched the following databases:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2005, Issue 3)</LI>
<LI>MEDLINE (January 1966 to September week 2 2005)</LI>
<LI>EMBASE (1988 to week 39 2005).</LI>
</UL>
<P>After several evaluations of different filters, the filter used in the review was found to have the highest sensitivity and specificity compared with other search strategies developed for this review. This filter captured all key clinical studies pre-identified by the review team (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Handsearching of selected dental journals was carried out because of the potential delay at the National Library of Medicine in indexing journals. Handsearching was restricted to the table of contents of journals published since 1995 because the current products on the market were developed during the last 10 years. The following journals were handsearched: <I>Journal of Operative Dentistry</I>, <I>Journal of Esthetic Dentistry</I>, <I>Compendium of Continuing Dental Education</I>, <I>Journal of Clinical Dentistry</I>, <I>Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry</I>, <I>Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry</I>, and the <I>Journal of Dental Research</I>. Handsearching did not identify additional relevant studies. After a final set of studies was identified, the list of references reported in the included reports was reviewed to identify additional studies. Letters were mailed to authors of studies and manufacturers to locate additional unpublished or to-be-published studies.</P>
<P>The search of MEDLINE using the OVID search engine resulted in 230 studies; the search of CENTRAL resulted in 182 studies; and the search of EMBASE did not result in any additional relevant study. Four studies were identified from other sources (two theses and two clinical studies). Hence, in total we started this review with 416 reports. Of those, 163 reports were duplicates and were eliminated from the database. Of the remaining 253 reports, 193 did not meet the inclusion criteria based upon a review of the titles and abstracts. Full reports of the remaining 60 titles were obtained and reviewed.</P>

<P>Titles and abstracts were reviewed by two review authors independently and in duplicate (Hana Hasson (HH) and Gisele Neiva (GN) or HH and Amid Ismail (AI)) for relevance. Disagreements between the two review authors were resolved by consensus. Full copies were obtained of all relevant articles and those where there was uncertainty/disagreement. The full reports of included studies were reviewed and data extracted by two review authors independently and in duplicate and each article categorized by its inclusion status (included or excluded).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of the included studies</HEADING>
<P>This review includes 25 reports of clinical trials. Of the 25 trials, 17 trials used Chroma Meters for assessment of whiteness; and eight evaluated whiteness using only the Vita Shade Guide. (<I>See</I> Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for the list of the trials included.) Out of the 17 Chroma Meter trials, three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cronin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cronin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mokhlis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mokhlis 1999</LINK>) presented data on whiteness using both Chroma Meter and Vita Shade Guide systems.

The other study (comparison 2, outcome 2.1) (<LINK REF="STD-Kowitz-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Kowitz 1994b</LINK>) compared two different in-tray treatments to a placebo, both of which gave significant colour change by a combination colour factor: Colgate Platinum, mean difference 3.61 (95% CI 2.45 to 4.77) and Rembrandt, mean difference 2.01 (95% CI 1.25 to 2.77).</P>
<P>The Vita Shade study (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1998</LINK>) reported that, after 6 months, 48% of the participants had maintained a shade difference from baseline of seven or more levels.

The other (<LINK REF="STD-Sielski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sielski 2003</LINK>) also reported statistically significant shade lightening at 2 and 3-week points and that the significant difference was still evident after 6 months: mean shade difference at 2 weeks 2.38 (95% CI 1.33 to 3.43). This study compared Colgate Simply White (25% CP paint-on gel) to standard dentifrice only. Neither study reported on irritation or sensitivity. The meta-analysis pooling these two studies gave an overall statistically significant benefit for the paint-on film of 2.52 (95% CI 2.19 to 2.86, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.08, degrees of freedom (df) = 1, P = 0.78, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>

The Vita Shade study (<LINK REF="STD-Kugel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kugel 2000</LINK>) reported that use of polyethylene film containing 5.3% hydrogen peroxide (HP) led to statistically significant shade lightening at 2 weeks: mean difference 2.83 (95% CI 2.01 to 3.65). The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 2002a</LINK>) also compared strips containing 5.3% HP to placebo strips and reported statistically significant combination colour index change at 2 weeks: mean difference 2.1 (95% CI 1.71 to 2.49). This study also reported that the whitening strip group continued to maintain a significant lightening at 6 months. Within the colour index, a component gauging change from yellow to blue indicated greater change in younger subjects. However, overall maintenance of colour improvements were not age related.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Kugel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kugel 2000</LINK>) found no exacerbation of baseline pathology and reported statistically significant improvements due to inclusion in the study.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Strip versus gel in tray (comparison 3, outcome 3.3; comparison 4, outcome 4.5)</HEADING>
<P>There were six studies in which the use of Crest Whitestrips containing HP was compared to gel in trays. One of these (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2003</LINK>) assessed white using Vitapan Classical shade guide and the colorimetric method. The other five used colorimetry only. The <LINK REF="STD-Li-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2003</LINK> study found statistically significant shade differences using Day White gel with 16% CP when compared to a 6.5% HP strip, in favour of the gel: mean difference by shade 2.39 (95% CI 1.26 to 3.52); mean compounded colour index difference 2.66 (95% CI 1.36 to 3.96). Differences found using the same strip but substituting a 7.5% HP gel were non-significant. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 2000</LINK>) compared 5.3% HP Whitestrips to 10%, 15%, and 20% Opalescence gel in trays. The 10% and 15% combinations did not reveal significant differences but the 20% Opalescence gel effected a statistically significantly greater compounded colour index change compared to the Whitestrips: mean difference 1.55 (95% CI 0.66 to 2.44). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karpinia-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Karpinia 2003</LINK>) compared the bleaching effectiveness of Crest Whitestrips with 6% HP compared to Rembrandt gel with 10% CP and both found the compounded colour index change to be statistically significantly greater using the Whitestrips: mean differences, respectively 4.77 (95% CI 4.04 to 5.50) and 1.77 (95% CI 1.21 to 2.33). A further two studies by the same authors, one published a year later and the other a year earlier (<LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karpinia-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Karpinia 2002</LINK>) compared the bleaching effectiveness of moderately stronger Crest Whitestrips with 6.5% HP compared to Nite White Excel gel with 10% CP. Once again, the Whitestrips were found to be the most effective at bleaching teeth though with reduced, but still statistically significant, differences in the compounded colour index changes: mean differences, respectively 2.0 (95% CI 0.93 to 3.07) and 0.68 (95% CI 0.17 to 1.19).</P>
<P>Meta-analyses were conducted comparing white strips (5.3% to 6.5% HP) with gel in tray at three levels of CP: 10%, 15/16% and 20% (comparison 04, outcome 05). These found the strip was significantly more effective than the gel in trays with CP 10%, with mean difference 1.82 (95% CI 0.26 to 3.38, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 98.7, df = 4, P &lt; 0.001, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 96%) but the gel in tray was significantly more effective when the level of CP was 20%, although this was only based on one trial.</P>
<P>In terms of adverse effects, <LINK REF="STD-Li-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2003</LINK> reported between 7% and 23% gingival irritation and 12% to 19% sensitivity for Crest Whitestrips, 41% to 62% and 25% to 41% for Day White gel, and 0% to 12% and 8% to 24% for Nite White Excel. Opalescence gel (<LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 2000</LINK>) was reported to cause transient sensitivity in 0% to 60% of participants and minor oral irritation in 27% to 30%.

Six studies compared CP to CP (<LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kihn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kihn 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kowitz-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Kowitz 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kowitz-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Kowitz 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matis-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Matis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathoo-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nathoo 1994</LINK>) whereas the others compared CP to HP. The CP was present at a variety of concentrations, although 10% CP was commonly used in one arm. <LINK REF="STD-Kihn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kihn 2000</LINK> found overnight use of 15% CP gave statistically significantly greater shade lightening than 10% CP overnight: mean difference 1.73 (95% CI 0.26 to 3.2). A similar comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Matis-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Matis 2000</LINK>) reported that the difference obtained by using these two agents became non-significant if monitoring was continued for 4 more weeks. <LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 2000</LINK> compared three different concentrations applied for 2 hours per day and reported no significant difference between 10% and 15% CP but statistically significant differences evident in compounded colour index between 10% and 20% and between 15% and 20%: mean differences, respectively, 1.42 (95% CI 0.45 to 2.39) and 1.48 (95% CI 0.58 to 2.38). 10% CP from two different sources, used for two 1 hour sessions daily, was compared on three occasions by the same team (<LINK REF="STD-Kowitz-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Kowitz 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kowitz-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Kowitz 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nathoo-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nathoo 1994</LINK>).

Among the three studies which compared bleaching by HP to bleaching by CP, one reported a statistically significant difference in efficacy: mean differences, using shade guides and colorimetry respectively, 1.81 (95% CI 0.83 to 2.79) and 2.97 (95% CI 1.55 to 4.39) (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2003</LINK>) and two found that differences were non-significant (<LINK REF="STD-Mokhlis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mokhlis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Panich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Panich 2001</LINK>). The Mokhlis and Panich studies were carried out in the same department as submission for the degree of MSc and found, respectively, no significant bleaching difference between 20% CP and 7.5% HP (2 x 1 hour daily) and between 15% CP and 5.5% HP (2 x 30 minutes daily). <LINK REF="STD-Li-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2003</LINK>, in contrast, found 15% CP to be more effective bleach than 7.5% HP but asked the participants to expose their teeth to the CP agent overnight whereas the HP was used for only 2 x 30 minutes daily.</P>
<P>In terms of adverse effects, 15% CP was reported to lead to slightly greater sensitivity than 10% (<LINK REF="STD-Matis-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Matis 2000</LINK>) and was quantified in a 20-point scale as 2.78 ± 2.44 for 10% CP and 4.19 ± 4.58 for 15% CP (<LINK REF="STD-Kihn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kihn 2000</LINK>). Amongst the three concentrations of CP used by <LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 2000</LINK> there were noted 0% to 60% transient tooth sensitivity and 27% to 30% minor oral irritation but <LINK REF="STD-Kowitz-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Kowitz 1994a</LINK> noted no adverse reactions with CP. Comparison of different agents revealed self reported gingival irritation in 41% to 62% of HP users (2 x 30 minutes) and 25% to 41% sensitivity compared to 0% to 12% irritation and 8% to 24% sensitivity when CP was used overnight (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2003</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Side effects</HEADING>
<P>As reported previously, tooth sensitivity and gingival irritation were the most common side effects reported by 18 out of 28 studies (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). However, tooth sensitivity was more frequently reported when bleaching was carried out using whitening strips in comparison with whitening gel in tray (<LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karpinia-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Karpinia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karpinia-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Karpinia 2003</LINK>). Gingival irritation was more frequently reported after the use of whitening gel in a tray compared with the whitening strips (<LINK REF="STD-Karpinia-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Karpinia 2003</LINK>). One study reported that CP caused more gingival sensitivity than HP. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mokhlis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mokhlis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Panich-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Panich 2001</LINK>) reported that there is no difference between HP and CP in causing tooth sensitivity. Detailed descriptions of the side effects are presented in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>It should be acknowledged that randomised controlled trials are not always the most appropriate study design for obtaining data on harms and that the list of side effects may not be complete.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>Of the 17 included studies that used the Chroma Meter to measure whiteness, 15 were classified with high bias and two were classified with moderate bias (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-Matis-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Matis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mokhlis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mokhlis 1999</LINK>). These two double-blind studies used an independent staff to randomise subjects into the treatment and comparison groups; however, they did not report on the process used in randomisations. The other studies, classified with high bias, did not report on concealment during allocation, randomisation protocol, or training and reliability of the examiners.</P>
<P>The Vita Shade Guide studies suffered from the same problems (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Three of the studies were classified with moderate bias (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kihn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kihn 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mokhlis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mokhlis 1999</LINK>). While we have positively rated the assignment of subjects by a third party rather than by the investigators, this conclusion assumes that the third party kept the assignment concealed from the investigators until the time when products were dispensed. One of the positive findings was the relatively low proportion of drop outs and the reasons for withdrawals were consistently reported.</P>
<P>None of the studies reported masking during data analysis. Most of the studies had masking (blinding) of the products used ("white paper placed over the label to mask the product"). Interestingly, 15 out of 17 of the Chroma Meter and all 11 Vita Shade Guide studies reported masking of examiners.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Examiners' training protocols and reliability assessment </HEADING>
<P>Only two studies reported on their protocol to train and calibrate the examiners (<LINK REF="STD-Matis-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Matis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mokhlis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mokhlis 1999</LINK>). None of the studies reported reliability coefficients that the examiners were experienced or trained and calibrated (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Of all the studies that used the Vita Shade Guide only one study explained in some detail the method of training of examiners (<LINK REF="STD-Mokhlis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mokhlis 1999</LINK>). None of the studies reported the reliability coefficients of the evaluators when using the shade guide.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Correlation analysis between concentrations of the peroxide and the effect size</HEADING>
<P>While there was a linear increase between the concentration of HP and mean Delta E (<LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerlach-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Gerlach 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kugel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kugel 2000</LINK>), the Pearson's correlation coefficient, computed by the review team, between the concentration of HP and the mean Delta E was 0.51 (P = 0.6); and between the concentration of CP and mean Delta E the correlation coefficient was 0.32 (P = 0.20). The correlation coefficients were weaker in the studies using the Vita Shade Guide (0.36 and 0.06, respectively).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-06 15:00:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review was complex to organise because of the significant variation in products, design of studies, application methods, assessments, and reporting. None of the studies met the majority of the current guidelines for reporting clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2003</LINK>). Some of these guidelines have been incorporated into the American Dental Association's Clinical Trials Protocol (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2005b</LINK>). Unfortunately, the incomplete reporting of methods and findings of the included studies may have led in rating some of the studies with high bias. The study of <LINK REF="STD-Mokhlis-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Mokhlis 1999</LINK> presents a strong case for why current scientific reporting standards should be endorsed. In his Masters Thesis, which was published before the current guidelines for reporting of clinical trials were developed, Mokhlis reported details that were not reported in the short paper published a year later (<LINK REF="STD-Mokhlis-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mokhlis 2000</LINK>). Moreover, the studies, which were mostly conducted before the 2004 ADA Acceptance Guidelines for Dentist-Dispensed Home Use Bleaching Products (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2004</LINK>), did not follow standard protocols for evaluating effectiveness of tooth whitening products. We also found inconsistent reporting of the baseline measures of tooth whiteness in the experimental and control groups and how the subjects were matched before randomisation. Overall, the studies included in this review suffer from biases that render their results suspect.</P>
<P>Six trials compared different whitening products (gel in trays, paint-on films and whitening strips) with placebo/no treatment and all analyses showed the products to be effective when compared with placebo/no treatment, although most comparisons were based on only one trial.</P>
<P>There were 19 trials comparing different whitening products with each other. Significant differences were found for the following comparisons:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Paint-on gel three times per day is more effective than paint-on gel twice per day (1 trial; 70 patients)</LI>
<LI>Strip (6% hydrogen peroxide (HP)) is more effective than paint-on gel (18%) (1 trial; 59 patients)</LI>
<LI>Gel in tray (7.5% HP) is more effective than strip (6.5% HP) (1 trial; 56 patients)</LI>
<LI>Custom tray (5% carbamide peroxide (CP)) is more effective than paint-on gel (18% CP) (1 trial; 28 patients)</LI>
<LI>Paint-on gels at higher levels of HP are more effective than those at lower levels (1 trial; 56 patients)</LI>
<LI>Strips at higher levels of HP are more effective than those at lower levels (1 trial; 37 patients)</LI>
<LI>Strips (6% HP) are more effective than gel in tray at 10% CP (6 trials; 178 patients)</LI>
<LI>Strips (6% HP) are less effective than gel in tray at greater than 15% CP (3 trials; 87 patients)</LI>
<LI>Gel in tray is more effective at higher levels of CP than lower levels (3 trials; 80 patients).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Leonard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonard 1998</LINK> suggested that the predictors for tooth sensitivity during home bleaching were the frequency of application and whether the patient had sensitive teeth before bleaching. Gender, age, day or night wear pattern, and absence or presence of tooth abrasion or gingival recession had no significant effect on the development of tooth sensitivity. Unfortunately, the available studies have not fully evaluated the long-term side effects caused by bleaching especially given the higher concentration of peroxide-based agents being used in clinical application. Hydrogen and carbamide peroxides penetrate through the enamel, dentine, and to the pulp in minutes after an application to the teeth (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1992</LINK>). This finding was reported in 1950 (<LINK REF="REF-Wainwright-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wainwright 1950</LINK>). More recently, <LINK REF="REF-Gonzalez_x002d_Ochoa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzalez-Ochoa 2002</LINK> reported that 10% carbamide peroxide used for 14 days caused mild reversible histological changes in the pulp tissues. The effect of this penetration needs further investigation before a final conclusion can be reached on the safety of whitening products.</P>
<P>All studies included in this review excluded participants with previous history of sensitivity, soft tissue lesions, cervical abrasion, or gingival recession. Consequently, the external validity of the studies is limited and post-marketing research is urgently required to assess the long-term side effects of using bleaching agents. Given the lack of information on long-term benefits and harms, there may be a huge void between the state of knowledge based on the trials sponsored by the manufacturers and the experiences of millions of users of tooth whitening products.</P>
<P>Tooth whitening systems remain popular in the dental marketplace. In the UK, for example, the increased demand for cosmetic dentistry has expanded the private market for dental care (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS 2004</LINK>). Similar trends are taking place in other countries. The increased demand for tooth whitening and the less than adequate evidence raises many concerns. There is an urgent need for studies that would independently evaluate the methods and mechanisms of tooth whitening and the long-term effectiveness and harm.</P>
<P>This review highlights several problems that exist in the evidence base of tooth whitening products. Currently manufacturers conduct their own evaluations of products or fund researchers to test their products. While this approach to product development is standard in all industries, there is an urgent need for independent studies conducted using commercially available products. There is also a need to evaluate the long-term harms of whitening products.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>At the present state of knowledge and given the limitation of this systematic review, over-the-counter or dentist-dispensed tooth whitening products can be recommended to the public but with strong cautions. All products have not yet been independently evaluated in long-term studies (over 6 months). Side effects, especially tooth sensitivity and gingival irritation, are a concern, but may resolve after the application of the products.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Research projects in this area should follow the current standards for design and reporting of randomised controlled trials. There is an urgent need for independent long-term studies evaluating the effectiveness and harms associated with the home use of bleaching products. Studies should include individuals who represent the diverse population of users of the products. </P>

<P>The CIE L*a*b* System used in digital colour analysis expresses 3 referenced colour co-ordinate values: L, a, and b. L indicates lightness or brightness, and the co-ordinates a and b indicate varying amounts of red/green and yellow/blue, respectively. Quantifying colour through the use of devices with this digital technology is possible. More importantly, it offers an objective way of determining the differences in tooth colour and studying the effects of whitening agents.</P>
