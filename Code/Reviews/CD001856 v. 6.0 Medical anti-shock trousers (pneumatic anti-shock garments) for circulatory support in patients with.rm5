<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>No evidence that medical anti-shock trousers improve survival for people with trauma, and some suggestion they may worsen outcomes, but more trials are needed</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>About one third of injury deaths are due to shock from blood loss. Preventing shock in people with uncontrolled bleeding is therefore vital. Treatment aims to maintain blood pressure, so that tissue damage is minimised. Medical anti-shock trousers (MAST) are believed to increase blood pressure and blood flow to the heart and brain, helping to stabilise the person until they receive further treatment. The review of trials found no evidence that MAST application decreases deaths, with some suggestion that it may even do harm. More research is needed.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2009-08-06 13:29:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Medical antishock trousers (MAST) have been used to increase venous return to the heart until definitive care could be given. This, combined with compression of blood vessels, is believed to cause the movement of blood from the lower body to the brain, heart and lungs. However, the equipment is expensive, and may have adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To quantify the effect on mortality and morbidity of the use of medical anti-shock trousers (MAST)/pneumatic anti-shock garments (PASG) in patients following trauma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-08-06 13:29:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Trials were identified by searches of the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register (April 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (April 2007), EMBASE (April 2007), ISI Web of Science (April 2007), National Research Register (Issue 1, 2007) and PubMed (April 2006). In addition we checked the reference lists of relevant trials and reviews. We contacted current researchers in the field for unpublished data and ongoing trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of MAST/PASG in patients following trauma (excluding fractures of the extremities in which MAST/PASG may be used as a splint).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted independently by two authors. Data were collected on mortality, duration of hospitalisation and ICU stay, and quality of allocation concealment.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two trials were identified that met the inclusion criteria. These trials included 1202 randomised patients in total; however, data for 1075 of these were available. The relative risk of death with MAST was 1.13 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.32). Duration of hospitalisation and of intensive care unit stay was longer in the MAST treated group. The weighted mean difference in the length of intensive care unit stay was 1.7 days (95% CI 0.33 to 2.98).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence to suggest that MAST/PASG application reduces mortality, length of hospitalisation or length of ICU stay in trauma patients and it is possible that it may increase these. These data do not support the continued use of MAST/PASG in the situation described. However, it should be recognised that, due to the poor quality of the trials, conclusions should be drawn with caution.</P>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>In 1903, Crile described his "pneumatic rubber suit", a device designed to decrease postural hypotension in neurosurgical patients (<LINK REF="REF-Crile-1903" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crile 1903</LINK>). Crile's design was later used in World War II to prevent blackout of pilots subjected to high G forces. During the Vietnam War the suit was used in order to stabilise patients with haemorrhagic shock during transportation (<LINK REF="REF-Schwab-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwab 1983</LINK>). In 1973, MAST (Pneumatic Anti-shock Garments) were developed for clinical use in the treatment of haemorrhagic shock or hypotension in emergency prehospital and emergency department settings (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1986</LINK>). MAST were used to increase venous return to the heart until definitive care (transfusion and/or surgical intervention) could be given. MAST was thought to cause autotransfusion of blood from the lower extremities and an increase in systemic vascular resistance. This, combined with compression of blood vessels, is believed to cause the movement of blood from the lower body to the brain, heart and lungs (<LINK REF="REF-Jennings-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jennings 1986</LINK>). In 1977, the Committee on Trauma of the American College of Surgeons included anti-shock trousers on the list of essential equipment for ambulances (<LINK REF="REF-Schwab-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwab 1983</LINK>). However, the equipment is expensive (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1989</LINK>), and may have adverse effects. </P>

<P>In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Mattox-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mattox 1989</LINK>, 89 patients were excluded due to protocol violations and 38 excluded for other reasons (that is, transfer of patient to another hospital, incomplete or irretrievable hospital records).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review summarises evidence from randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy of MAST/PASG in trauma patients.</P>
<P>No evidence was found to show that mortality, length of hospitalisation or ICU stay were decreased with the application of MAST/PASG in trauma patients (excluding those suffering from extremity fractures). Based on the pooled relative risk for the mortality data, patients randomised to the MAST group are 1.13 times more likely to die than those in the control group (95% CI 0.97 to 1.32). MAST/PASG application may therefore be associated with an increased mortality in trauma patients (excluding extremity fractures).</P>
<P>The data indicate that patients randomised to the MAST group have an increased hospital stay and there is no evidence to suggest that MAST/PASG reduces the length of hospitalisation in trauma patients. However, the skewedness of the data meant that it was inadvisable to calculate the weighted mean difference, therefore conclusions drawn from these data should be cautious. Duration of ICU stay may also be increased in those patients treated with MAST/PASG by about two days. It was anticipated that the possible differences in hospital practices that may have influenced length of hospitalisation and ICU stay were similar for the intervention and the control groups. The effect estimate as opposed to raw data was pooled across studies, therefore a valid pooled estimate of the effect of MAST was estimated even if the hospitals in the two trials had different policies.<BR/> <BR/>The possibility of a survivor effect occurring must be taken into account. This describes the fact that increased length of hospital stay and/or length of ICU stay may be due to the increased survival of sick patients with treatment. However, in this case, as mortality in the treatment group was higher, this explanation is unlikely.</P>
<P>Mortality, length of hospitalisation and ICU stay may all be increased with the application of MAST/PASG in trauma patients (excluding those suffering from extremity fractures).</P>
<P>In 1977, the Committee on Trauma of The American College of Surgeons added antishock trousers to the list of essential equipment for ambulances (<LINK REF="REF-Schwab-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwab 1983</LINK>). This equipment is expensive (<LINK REF="REF-Schneider-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneider 1989</LINK>), and its use seems to have been advocated in the absence of adequate evidence. The results of this review do not support the use of MAST/PASG for the treatment of trauma patients (excluding those suffering extremity fractures).</P>
<P>It is possible that the concept of MAST itself (that is, autotransfusion from the lower limb) may be ineffective in the treatment of traumatic shock. If this were true then the procedure of raising the legs of a patient who is hypovolaemic due to traumatic shock must also be reassessed.</P>
<P>Both trials have poor quality allocation concealment; however, as these were the only trials identified by our searches, they are included and the possibility of bias must be taken into consideration.</P>
<P>Although the losses from the trial involving 911 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Mattox-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mattox 1989</LINK>) have been explained, the groups remaining are very unbalanced (MAST n=345, no-MAST n=439). This suggests that the alternate allocation was violated or that most of the losses occurred from one group. This hypothesis identifies a possible source of bias in the review. The fact that an intention-to-treat analysis was unable to be performed on these data means that the results should be interpreted with caution.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The results of the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Mattox-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mattox 1989</LINK> led to the discontinuation of MAST use in ambulances of the Houston Fire Department where their presence had previously been mandatory. This systematic review does not support the use of MAST/PASG in trauma patients (excluding extremity fracture). However, it should be recognised that, due to the poor quality of the trials, conclusions should be drawn with caution.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The results of this systematic review suggest that MAST/PASG may increase the mortality, length of hospitalisation and ICU stay in trauma patients (excluding extremity fracture). It would be useful to determine, with large randomised controlled trials, whether autotransfusion in general is ineffective in the treatment of hypovolaemic patients due to traumatic shock. </P>
<P>Methodological qualities of subsequent trials could be improved by including data from protocol violations; this would enable intention to treat analyses to be conducted, making the conclusions more reliable.</P>
