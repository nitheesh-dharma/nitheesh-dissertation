<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Seizures occurring with a fever in children are common and affect about one in thirty under the age of six years. On average, one out of three children who have had a febrile seizure will have at least one more. We reviewed the evidence about the effect of drugs to prevent seizures (antiepileptics), drugs to lower temperature (antipyretics) and zinc on children with febrile seizures.</P>
<P>
<B>Objective</B>
</P>
<P>We wanted to know in how many children these drugs would prevent a recurrence or bring unwanted effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Methods</B>
</P>
<P>We included 30 studies with a total of 4256 children in the review. Children who had had at least one febrile seizure were put into groups who either had the study treatment or not. The studies recorded any further seizures at various time intervals between 6 months and up to 6 years of age in each group. Unwanted medication effects were also noted.</P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of study design and evidence provided by these studies was often low or very low for the antiepileptic drugs. Poor methods known to lead to obvious risks of bias were used. This was to do with the way children were put in each group and how random this allocation was. Other issues included whether the parents and/or doctors knew which group each child was in or perhaps if the study was of treatment compared to no treatment. The quality of trials of antipyretics or zinc was better, with the evidence graded moderate to high.</P>
<P>Zinc therapy gave no benefit. Nor was there benefit in treating children just at the time of the fever with either antipyretic drugs or most antiepileptic drugs.</P>
<P>At times a significant result was noted. In statistics this means there was a less than 1 in 20 chance of this happening by chance. For example, at times between 6 and 48 months follow-up, intermittent diazepam (an antiepileptic drug) led to a reduction in the number of recurrent seizures by about a third. Continuous phenobarbitone resulted in significantly fewer recurrences at 6, 12 and 24 months, but not at 18 and 60 to 72 months</P>
<P>However, as recurrent seizures are only seen in about a third of children anyway this means that up to 16 children would have to be treated over a year or two to save just one child a further seizure. As febrile seizures are not harmful we viewed these significant findings (in the statistical sense) to be unimportant. This is particularly so as adverse effects of the medications were common. Lower comprehension scores in phenobarbitone-treated children were found in two studies. In general, adverse effects were recorded in up to about a third of children in both the phenobarbitone and benzodiazepine-treated groups. The benefit found for treatment with clobazam in one study published in 2011 needs to be repeated to show that this finding is reliable.</P>
<P>
<B>Author&#8217;s conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Neither continuous nor intermittent treatment with zinc, antiepileptic or antipyretic drugs can be recommended for children with febrile seizures. Febrile seizures can be frightening to witness. Parents and families should be supported with adequate contact details of medical services and information on recurrence, first aid management and, most importantly, the benign nature of the phenomenon.</P>
<P>The evidence is current to 21 July 2016.</P>

<P>Febrile seizures occurring in a child older than one month during an episode of fever affect 2% to 4% of children in Great Britain and the United States and recur in 30%. Rapid-acting antiepileptics and antipyretics given during subsequent fever episodes have been used to avoid the adverse effects of continuous antiepileptic drugs.</P>

<P>To evaluate primarily the effectiveness and safety of antiepileptic and antipyretic drugs used prophylactically to treat children with febrile seizures; but also to evaluate any other drug intervention where there was a sound biological rationale for its use.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-02-09 13:57:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 7); MEDLINE (1966 to July 2016); Embase (1966 to July 2016); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) (July 2016). We imposed no language restrictions. We also contacted researchers in the field to identify continuing or unpublished studies.</P>

<P>Trials using randomised or quasi-randomised participant allocation that compared the use of antiepileptic, antipyretic or other plausible agents with each other, placebo or no treatment.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-12-06 12:46:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (RN and MO) independently applied predefined criteria to select trials for inclusion and extracted the predefined relevant data, recording methods for randomisation, blinding and exclusions. For the 2016 update a third author (MC) checked all original inclusions, data analyses, and updated the search. Outcomes assessed were seizure recurrence at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months and at age 5 to 6 years in the intervention and non-intervention groups, and adverse medication effects. We assessed the presence of publication bias using funnel plots.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-09 13:51:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 40 articles describing 30 randomised trials with 4256 randomised participants. We analysed 13 interventions of continuous or intermittent prophylaxis and their control treatments. Methodological quality was moderate to poor in most studies. We found no significant benefit for intermittent phenobarbitone, phenytoin, valproate, pyridoxine, ibuprofen or zinc sulfate versus placebo or no treatment; nor for diclofenac versus placebo followed by ibuprofen, acetaminophen or placebo; nor for continuous phenobarbitone versus diazepam, intermittent rectal diazepam versus intermittent valproate, or oral diazepam versus clobazam.</P>
<P>There was a significant reduction of recurrent febrile seizures with intermittent diazepam versus placebo or no treatment, with a risk ratio (RR) of  0.64 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 0.85 at six months), RR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.84) at 12 months, RR 0.37 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.60) at 18 months, RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.95) at 24 months, RR 0.58 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.85) at 36 months, RR 0.36 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.89) at 48 months, with no benefit at 60 to 72 months. Phenobarbitone versus placebo or no treatment reduced seizures at 6, 12 and 24 months but not at 18 or 72 month follow-up (RR 0.59 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.83) at 6 months; RR 0.54 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.70) at 12 months; and RR 0.69 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.89) at 24 months). Intermittent clobazam compared to placebo at six months resulted in a RR of 0.36 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.64), an effect found against an extremely high (83.3%) recurrence rate in the controls, which is a result that needs replication.</P>
<P>The recording of adverse effects was variable. Lower comprehension scores in phenobarbitone-treated children were found in two studies. In general, adverse effects were recorded in up to 30% of children in the phenobarbitone-treated group and in up to 36% in benzodiazepine-treated groups. We found evidence of publication bias in the meta-analyses of comparisons for phenobarbitone versus placebo (eight studies) at 12 months but not at six months (six studies); and valproate versus placebo (four studies) at 12 months, with too few studies to identify publication bias for the other comparisons.</P>
<P>Most of the reviewed antiepileptic drug trials are of a methodological quality graded as low or very low. Methods of randomisation and allocation concealment often do not meet current standards; and treatment versus no treatment is more commonly seen than treatment versus placebo, leading to obvious risks of bias. Trials of antipyretics and zinc were of higher quality.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-12-06 12:46:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found reduced recurrence rates for children with febrile seizures for intermittent diazepam and continuous phenobarbitone, with adverse effects in up to 30%. Apparent benefit for clobazam treatment in one trial needs to be replicated to be judged reliable. Given the benign nature of recurrent febrile seizures, and the high prevalence of adverse effects of these drugs, parents and families should be supported with adequate contact details of medical services and information on recurrence, first aid management and, most importantly, the benign nature of the phenomenon.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-02-07 16:13:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) defines a febrile seizure as &#8220;a seizure occurring in childhood after one month of age associated with a febrile illness not caused by an infection of the central nervous system, without previous neonatal seizures or a previous unprovoked seizure, and not meeting the criteria for other acute symptomatic seizures&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-ILEA-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILEA 1993</LINK>). The cumulative incidence of febrile seizures is estimated between 2% and 5% in the US and Western Europe, (<LINK REF="REF-Shinnar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinnar 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verity-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verity 1991</LINK>) between 6% to 9% in Japan, and 14% in India and Guam (<LINK REF="REF-ILEA-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">ILEA 1993</LINK>). Febrile seizures have a peak incidence at 18 months and are most common between the ages of six months and six years. (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hauser-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Offringa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Offringa 1991</LINK>)</P>
<P>In 2010 the ILAE proposed that febrile seizures could be organised by typical age at onset (that is, infancy and childhood). Conventionally, febrile seizures have been classified as simple or complex based on duration, recurrence during the same illness episode, and the presence of focal features. Most febrile seizures are generalised tonic-clonic seizures, and about 30% - 35% of febrile seizures have one or more complex features (focal onset, duration &gt; 10 minutes, or multiple seizures during the illness episode) (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1996</LINK>). Febrile status epilepticus, a subgroup of complex febrile seizures with seizures lasting more than 30 minutes, occur in about 5% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Causation is thought to be multifactorial with environmental factors and increasing evidence for genetic factors contributing to pathogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Audenaert-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audenaert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Offringa--1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Offringa 1994</LINK>). No single susceptibility gene for febrile seizures is known. In contrast, gene identification has been successful in families with genetic epilepsies with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) where kindreds may well include children with Dravet syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kasperaviciute-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasperaviciute 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2013</LINK>). In these conditions febrile seizures persist beyond the age of six years; mutations have been found in <I>SCN1A</I> and <I>SCN1B</I> (both sodium channel genes important for neurotransmission) and <I>GABRG2</I> (related to &#947;-aminobutyric acid, an important inhibitory neurotransmitter) (<LINK REF="REF-Audenaert-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Audenaert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baulac-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baulac 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-G_x00e9_rard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gérard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirose-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirose 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kananura-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kananura 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Nabbout-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabbout 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nakayama-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakayama 2006</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-01-16 14:08:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the frequent nature of these seizures, debate regarding the optimal management arose at an early stage (<LINK REF="REF-Baumann-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baumann 1999</LINK>) and continues. After resolution of the acute episode, the possibility of recurrent seizures during subsequent febrile illnesses must be addressed. This risk of recurrent seizures in previously healthy, untreated children was estimated in a collaborative study that used the individual data from five follow-up studies with similar definitions of febrile seizures and risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-Offringa--1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Offringa 1994</LINK>). Of 2496 children with 1410 episodes of recurrent seizures in this study, 32% had at least one, 15% had at least two and 7% had three or more recurrent seizures after a first febrile seizure. The hazard of recurrent seizures was highest between the ages of 12 and 24 months. A history of febrile or unprovoked seizures in a first-degree family member, a relatively low temperature at the first seizure, young age at onset (&lt; 12 months), a family history of unprovoked seizures, and a partial initial febrile seizure were all associated with an increased risk of subsequent seizures.</P>
<P>If a child is considered at increased risk of frequent or complicated seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1990</LINK>), prophylactic medication might be considered. However, such treatment may have adverse effects on the child's behaviour and cognitive development. Thus, the decision to treat requires assessment of the potential risks and benefits to the child. Since 1990, at least 300 articles have been published on the drug management of seizures associated with fever (<LINK REF="REF-Gram-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gram 1984</LINK>). This has long been a controversial area, with a persistent variety of opinions on management. Part of this controversy reflects the fact that it is uncertain whether prophylactic medication with antiepileptics and antipyretics is effective and has no important adverse effects. Yet, phenobarbital has adverse effects such as irritability, hyperactivity, and somnolence, and may even lower the cognitive development of the toddlers (<LINK REF="STD-Farwell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Farwell 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herranz-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herranz 1988</LINK>). To avoid the side effects of continuous antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), rapid-acting antiepileptics given only during fever periods have been used in an attempt to reduce the risk of recurrent febrile seizures. Phenobarbital at times of fever has been proven ineffective, probably because of the delay in achieving appropriate serum and tissue levels. Thus far, only prophylactic diazepam, given orally or rectally, has been studied in placebo-controlled trials. The efficacy of intermittent antipyretic treatment during febrile episodes in the prevention of seizure recurrence has recently been studied.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Newton-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newton 1988</LINK> assessed the efficacy of phenobarbitone and valproate for the prophylactic treatment of febrile seizures by summarising the results from all eight British placebo-controlled clinical trials that were done before 1988. Data were pooled and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. The overall odds ratio of recurrent febrile seizures for phenobarbitone was 0.8 and for valproate 1.42; neither result was statistically significant. The author therefore concluded that neither treatment is to be recommended. A second meta-analysis summarised four published non-British randomised, placebo-controlled trials that had been done up to 1996 using phenobarbital as a preventive treatment of febrile seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Rantala-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rantala 1997</LINK>). The risk of recurrences was lower in children receiving continuous phenobarbital therapy than in the placebo group (odds ratio 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.90). On average, eight children would have to be treated with phenobarbital for two years continuously to prevent one febrile seizure (number needed to treat (NNT) 8, 95% CI 5 to 27) (<LINK REF="REF-Rantala-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rantala 1997</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-12-06 12:46:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The rationale for using prophylactic antiepileptic drugs in children with febrile seizures is to raise seizure threshold in the face of a potentially triggering fever. Antipyretics are used to attenuate the effect of fever as a triggering factor. Previous studies demonstrated blood and cerebrospinal fluid zinc levels to be significantly lower in children with a febrile seizure tendency than in children with afebrile seizures. Zinc level is known to stimulate the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and to increase the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino-butyric acid.</P>

<P>We excluded all studies which were not RCTs. Some trials confined the analysis to participants completing the trial period free of unwanted effects, in which case we had no access to the outcome of those who stopped treatment early when they could not tolerate it. As we felt that the lack of intention-to-treat data introduced an important potential for bias, we excluded these trials. One trial of antipyretics did not address the central issue of febrile seizure recurrence but researched the question of effect on temperature, and was also excluded.</P>

<B>Treatment adherence</B>
</P>
<P>Fifteen of 30 trials assessed treatment adherence using various approaches. Their results are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Some measures were relatively crude, e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Camfield-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Camfield 1980</LINK> reported the presence or absence of the drug in serum samples. Others, e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Heckmatt-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heckmatt 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McKinlay-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McKinlay 1989</LINK>, measured drug levels on a random, ad hoc basis. There was no reported consistency between the relationship of drug levels ascertained in this way and seizure control. This is in accordance with current clinical practice, which recommends drug level measurement only when non-adherence is suspected; in such a situation only the presence or absence of the drug is helpful. Our observations serve to emphasise the importance of intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse events and medication effects</HEADING>
<P>Antiepileptic drugs are know for frequent and sometimes severe side effects in children. A variety of adverse effects were reported in some studies. Some were described as &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; or as reasons for the child to stop medication and, in some instances, to leave the trial. A descriptive summary, detailed in so far as was possible from the information provided in the articles, is given in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> 'Unwanted medication effects'. We consider the fact that adverse effects were not addressed at all in eight included studies and only in one arm of the study in a further two as a measure of the generally poor quality of these studies.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Camfield-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Camfield 1980</LINK> was the only one to address behavioural change in a focused way. The authors recorded the incidence of behavioural changes in those allocated to the active phenobarbitone treatment group, comparing them to those in the placebo group, at 12-month follow-up. Fifteen of 35 (42.8%) allocated to phenobarbitone reported behavioural change or sleep disturbance, compared to eight of 30 (26.3%) allocated to the placebo group (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.26). More detail on the adverse effects in this study is given in the summary table under 'adverse effects', see below.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-09 13:52:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We note no significant benefit for intermittent phenobarbitone, phenytoin, valproate, pyridoxine, ibuprofen or zinc sulfate versus placebo or no treatment; nor for diclofenac versus placebo followed by ibuprofen, acetaminophen or placebo; nor for continuous phenobarbitone versus diazepam, intermittent rectal diazepam versus intermittent valproate, or oral diazepam versus clobazam. There was a significant reduction of recurrent febrile seizure risk with intermittent diazepam versus placebo or no treatment at all time points, except for 60 to 72 months, with a risk ratio (RR) ranging from 0.37 to 0.73 and a number needed to treat (NNT) from 5 to 14 patients (rounded to integer). A significant reduction in febrile seizure recurrence risk was also seen in continuous phenobarbitone versus placebo or no treatment in each meta-analyses that included three or more trials (at 6, 12 and 24 months, but not at 18 and 60 to 72 months). Risk ratios ranged from 0.54 at 12 months to 0.69 at 24 months, with a NNT of 8 to 10.</P>
<P>Another significant reduction in febrile seizure recurrence was seen in the intermittent clobazam group compared to placebo at six months follow-up: the risk ratio was 0.36, with a NNT of 2. However, with an extraordinarily high number of recurrences in 25 out of 30 (83.3%) children in the control group, we feel the play of chance has most likely led to an unrepeatable apparent beneficial effect for the treatment group. The median recurrence rate in the control groups of all included trials was approximately 20% at six months (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>), indicating how potentially misleading this study's findings are likely to be.</P>
<P>As has been indicated, the recording of adverse effects in these studies was very variable and often non-existent. <LINK REF="STD-Camfield-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Camfield 1980</LINK> documented lower comprehension scores in phenobarbitone-treated children (yet with small numbers), which correlated with length of phenobarbitone treatment. The findings were supported by the data of <LINK REF="STD-Farwell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Farwell 1990</LINK>. In general, adverse effects were recorded in up to 30% of children in the phenobarbitone-treated group, although notably the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Bacon-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bacon 1981</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Camfield-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Camfield 1980</LINK> (the latter for behavioural change or sleep disturbance) observed no difference with control groups. <LINK REF="STD-Knudsen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Knudsen 1985</LINK> noted mild transient adverse effects in up to 36% of children in the diazepam-treated groups.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fallah-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Fallah 2015</LINK> offered a novel approach by evaluating the effect of zinc supplementation on febrile seizure recurrence risk. Previous studies demonstrated blood and cerebrospinal fluid zinc levels to be significantly lower than in children with afebrile seizures. Zinc level is known to stimulate pyridoxal kinase enzyme activity and the decarboxylation of glutamic acid, as well as increasing brain gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) levels. Although it was hypothesised that decreased zinc levels might play a role in the pathogenesis of febrile seizures supplementation in this study, it conferred no significant benefit over placebo (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.09).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK> offers useful data when counselling parents on the natural history of the condition. As one might predict, there was no significant difference in recurrence rate in those treated with placebo or those who had no treatment. For each follow-up epoch recurrence rates stay remarkably similar at between 20% and 35%, except for the remarkable 36-month follow-up rate in <LINK REF="STD-Pavlidou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pavlidou 2006</LINK> of 60.5%, an outlier unlikely to be repeated. This continuing risk serves to emphasise the importance of conveying appropriate supportive advice to parents (see below).</P>
<P>In summary, we found reduced recurrence rates in children treated with intermittent diazepam or continuous phenobarbitone. Both drugs lead to the advent of mild to moderate adverse effects in up to 30% of its recipients. However, since the long-term outcome of children with febrile seizures is good, irrespective of whether their febrile seizures are successfully prevented or not, only short-term benefits may be expected from treatment and they should be weighed against possible drug-related adverse events. To emphasise the point we should bear in mind we would need to treat 100 children with either intermittent diazepam or phenobarbitone to save up to 10 children from a recurrence, while giving 33 children unwanted effects. The mainstay of intervention should be the provision of information for the families involved on recurrence risk, first aid management and the benign nature of the phenomenon. Parents should be provided with contact details for medical services so that they will feel supported in the event of a recurrence, which inevitably leads to anxiety and fright for the vast majority of those involved.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-01-16 14:07:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Completeness: The two interventions found to be effective in reducing future seizure recurrence were supported by nine (intermittent diazepam) and 10 (continuous phenobarbitone) unique trials of predominantly low quality. The results of the related meta-analyses were fairly consistently in favour of the intervention, more so for diazepam (for which there was only one trial with results favouring control) than for phenobarbitone (which had two trials favouring control). The majority of these trials included children after their first simple febrile seizure. Thus there is reasonable evidence to conclude their effectiveness to prevent a recurrent seizure in this population with a NNT ranging from 5 to 14.</P>
<P>Applicability: All studies concern the population at risk of recurrent febrile seizures, and evaluate commonly-used medical interventions. <LINK REF="REF-Knudsen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knudsen 1991</LINK> have indicated that the long-term outcome of children with febrile seizures is good, irrespective of whether their febrile seizures are successfully prevented or not. His early observations on the benign nature of the phenomenon for most children is in keeping with common experience in clinical practice and the opinion cited in standard texts. No additional long-term benefit can therefore be expected in addition to the reduced risk of recurrence for both intermittent diazepam and continuous phenobarbitone. This benefit should be weighed against the clear risk of adverse events. Hence the decision to treat must rest on whether quality of life and shorter-term morbidity may be altered by the use of drugs.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-12-06 12:51:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most of the reviewed trials date from 20 or more years ago and are of a methodological quality which nowadays would be recognised as needing improvement. Methods of randomisation and allocation concealment often do not meet current standards, and treatment versus no treatment is more commonly seen than treatment versus placebo, leading to obvious sources of bias. Nonetheless, the size of the data pool does allow us to draw some conclusions about the value of intervention with medication for this common childhood phenomenon.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-12-06 12:51:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review authors worked closely together at each step of the review, double-checking each other's assessments. We found that the methodological quality of most of the antiepileptic drug studies was very low, low or moderate. The 'Risk of bias' tables identify examples of selection, performance and detection, attrition, and reporting bias. Publication bias is also likely, as shown in the present analysis. We contacted all UK neurologists and selected North American colleagues before the original review to assess this risk. They were asked to declare if they knew of any studies unpublished for showing a lack of treatment effect. None came forward with an example.</P>

<P>There were some significant results, although no clinically important benefits, for the management of children with febrile seizures for intermittent diazepam and continuous phenobarbitone. No benefit was demonstrated for phenytoin, valproate, pyridoxine, intermittent phenobarbitone or antipyretics in the form of intermittent ibuprofen, acetaminophen or diclofenac in the management of febrile seizures. Intermittent clobazam conferred some benefit at six months follow-up but the result may be difficult to replicate. Zinc supplementation offered no benefit. Parents should be supported with adequate contact details of medical services and information on recurrence, first aid management and, most importantly, the benign nature of the phenomenon.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-06 12:51:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If future studies are to be considered, then due attention should be given to the quality of randomisation allocation and concealment with placebo as a control. Adverse effects should be recorded systematically for both intervention and control groups. However, given the long-term benign nature of the phenomenon of febrile seizures and the relatively higher rate of reporting of adverse effects to date, unless a significant case of justification can be made it seems difficult to justify further research in this area.</P>

<P>Investigators compared intelligence quotients (IQs) of a group randomly assigned to phenobarbitone to a group randomly assigned to placebo. After 2 years mean IQ 8.4 points lower in phenobarbitone group (95% CI ?13.3 to -3.5, P + 0.006). 6 months later after discontinuing medication IQ 5.2 points lower in phenobarbitone group (95% CI -10.5 to 0.04, P = 0.052). Proportion remaining seizure-free did not differ significantly between treatment groups. 14 total sleep time, night awakenings and lengthy awakenings compared in phenobarbitone and placebo groups. No difference noted between groups except subset of predisposed children did experience an increase in night awakenings, (that is, those already recorded to have frequent sleep disturbances at study entry). 35: Retesting of group after school entry. Phenobarbitone treated group had Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT-R) reading achievement score significantly lower than placebo group: 87.6 v 95.6; P = 0.007. No significant difference for IQ on Stamford Binet.</P>
