<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-07-07 16:12:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a movement disorder caused by damage to the brain before, during or soon after birth. The ability for people with CP to communicate effectively is often impaired by problems with speech and also gestures usually used in communication. Speech and language therapy aims to help people with CP maximise their communication skills. This can include ways of enhancing natural forms of communication, introducing aids such as symbol charts or devices with synthetic speech, and training communication partners. The review found some weak evidence that speech and language therapy might help children with CP, but more research is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-07-07 16:11:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The production of speech, language and gesture for communication is often affected by cerebral palsy. Communication difficulties associated with cerebral palsy can be multifactorial, arising from motor, intellectual and sensory impairments. Children with this diagnosis can experience mild to severe difficulties in expressing themselves. They are often referred to speech and language therapy (SLT) services to maximise their communication skills and help them to take as independent a role as possible in interaction activities. Therapy can include introducing augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems, such as symbol charts or communication aids with synthetic speech, as well as treating children's natural forms of communication. Various strategies have been used to treat the communication disorders associated with cerebral palsy, but evidence of their effectiveness is limited.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-12-06 13:54:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effectiveness of SLT that focuses on the child or their familiar communication partners, as measured by change in interaction patterns.<BR/>To determine if individual types of SLT intervention are more effective than others in changing interaction patterns.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-06-16 13:27:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Searches were conducted of MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, LLBA, ERIC, WEB of SCIENCE, Scopus, NRR, BEI, SIGLE (to January 2011). A previous version of this review included studies up to the end of 2002. References from identified studies were examined and relevant journals and conference reports were handsearched.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-07-07 16:11:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Any experimental study containing an element of a control was included in this review. This includes non-randomised group studies and single case experimental designs in which two interventions were compared or two communication processes were examined.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-03-26 09:57:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All authors searched for and selected studies for inclusion. L Pennington (LP) assessed all papers for inclusion, J Goldbart (JG) and J Marshall (JM) independently assessed separate random samples, each comprising 25% of all identified studies. Two review authors independently abstracted data from each selected study. Disagreements were settled by discussion between the three review authors.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-03-26 09:59:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sixteen studies were included in the review. Nine studies evaluated treatment given directly to children, seven investigated the effects of training for communication partners. Participants in the studies varied widely in age, type and severity of cerebral palsy, cognitive and linguistic skills. Studies focusing directly on children suggest that this model of therapy delivery has been associated with increases in treated speech and communication skills by individual children. However, methodological flaws and small sample sizes prevent firm conclusions being made about the effectiveness of the therapy. In addition, maintenance of these skills was not investigated thoroughly. The studies targeting communication partners used small exploratory group designs which often contained insufficient detail to allow replication, although more recent studies have improved in this area. Overall, the studies of indirect intervention have very low power and cannot provide evidence of effectiveness of this type of treatment.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-06-16 13:28:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Firm evidence of the positive effects of SLT for children with cerebral palsy has not been demonstrated by this review. However, positive trends in communication change were shown. No change in practice is recommended from this updated review. Further research is needed to describe this client group, and its possible clinical subgroups, and the methods of treatment currently used in SLT. Research is also needed to investigate the effectiveness of new and established interventions and their acceptability to families. Rigour in research practice needs to be extended to enable firm associations between therapy and the communication change to be made. There are now sufficient data to develop randomised controlled studies of dysarthria interventions and group parent training programmes. Such research is urgently needed to ensure clinically effective provision for this group of children, who are at severe risk of social and educational exclusion.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-07-07 16:15:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cerebral palsy describes a "group of persistent disorders of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitation, that are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain" (<LINK REF="REF-Bax-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bax 2005</LINK>). Subgroups of cerebral palsy have been classified according to the clinical signs of spastic, ataxic and dyskinetic syndromes, plus mixed forms (<LINK REF="REF-SCPE-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">SCPE 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The prevalence of cerebral palsy is approximately 2.5 per 1000 live births in countries with neonatal intensive care facilities (<LINK REF="REF-Colver-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colver 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yeargin_x002d_Allsopp-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeargin-Allsopp 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Himmelmann-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Himmelmann 2010</LINK>). Prevalence is higher in children born with very low birth weight. However, a decline in prevalence in this group from 60.6 (99%CI 37.8-91.4) per 1000 live births in 1980 to 39.5 (28.6-53.0) per 1000 in 1996 has recently been observed in Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Platt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platt 2007</LINK>). Communication difficulties can be associated with any type of cerebral palsy and may relate to limitations in the production of movements for speech, gesture and facial expression; receptive or expressive language; hearing; vision; or a combination of limitations in these functions. Speech impairments are estimated to affect approximately 36% of children with cerebral palsy and communication difficulties are observed in around 42% (<LINK REF="REF-Parkes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkes 2010</LINK>). Prevalence of speech, language and communication impairment increases with severity of motor and intellectual impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Kennes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bax-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bax 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parkes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkes 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sigurdardottir-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sigurdardottir 2010</LINK>). Children may experience communication difficulties from early infancy and, as cerebral palsy is a persistent condition, communication impairments are chronic and children may require long term intervention. In a review of speech and language therapy caseloads in the UK, <LINK REF="REF-Enderby-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enderby 1986</LINK> estimated that cerebral palsy was the sixth most common medical cause of speech disorder, and the proportion of referrals of children with this diagnosis remains static (<LINK REF="REF-Petheram-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petheram 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Speech and language therapists (also known as speech therapists, speech-language pathologists) assess, diagnose and treat the communication disorders associated with cerebral palsy. The aim of treatment is to maximise children's ability to communicate, through speech, gesture and supplementary means such as communication aids, to enable them to become independent communicators. As the problems experienced by children with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy are wide in range there is no single, universally appropriate form of treatment. Intervention can focus directly on spoken output, expressive or receptive language development, or helping children to develop conversation skills such as asking questions and repairing conversation when misunderstandings occur (for example <LINK REF="REF-Letto-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Letto 1994</LINK>). Work to develop children's language or communication skills could involve children using any method of communication. Intervention can also involve children's familiar conversation partners, such as their families, friends and teaching staff (<LINK REF="REF-Culp-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Culp 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pennington-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pennington 1996</LINK>). Such indirect therapy aims to teach people who are in close contact with children with cerebral palsy, to facilitate their communication development by creating opportunities for them to use new skills in conversation. Effective indirect intervention would lead to changes in conversation style for both the familiar conversation partners and the children.</P>
<P>Speech and language therapy may be delivered in a range of settings, including clients' homes, community clinics, hospitals and schools (<LINK REF="REF-RCSLT-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCSLT 1999</LINK>). It is usual for speech and language therapists to liaise with families and teaching staff regarding therapy to ensure that intervention goals are incorporated into daily life, where possible (<LINK REF="REF-Calculator-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calculator 1991</LINK>). Therapy may be delivered on an individual basis or in groups. Interventions may also vary in duration and intensity.</P>
<P>Speech and language therapy for this group of children is often long term, requiring significant health service resources. The effectiveness of speech and language therapy has been called into question (<LINK REF="REF-Enderby-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Enderby 1997</LINK>). For this client group it is necessary to know if changes that occur in children's communication are a result of SLT intervention or other factors, such as maturation. If it is demonstrated that speech and language therapy is effective, information about the effectiveness of different kinds or components of therapy is needed for children from different clinical subgroups to ensure appropriate use of resources.</P>
<P>In 2001 we set out to conduct an exploratory systematic review of studies of speech and language therapy for children who have communication disorders associated with cerebral palsy. This initial, broad review investigated the forms of SLT currently used to remediate different types and severities of communication disorders associated with cerebral palsy, and their relative effectiveness, with a view to providing directions for future research. As little evidence was found in the original review, this current updated review remains exploratory in nature investigating all areas of speech and language therapy intervention.</P>

<P>To provide an overview of the evidence for speech and language therapy interventions provided to a diverse client group we included any controlled study of interventions aimed at improving communication skills, reported in any language, in this review. Translations were sought, when necessary. Controlled studies included group and single case experimental designs. Group studies were included if participants were allocated to different interventions or acted as their own control, receiving the novel intervention following usual treatment. Single case experimental designs were included if communication behaviours were allocated to treatment or control and both behaviours were measured at baseline, intervention and follow-up phases, thereby allowing causal inference. Observational studies which used an AB design replicated across participants were excluded from this review.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-06-20 17:23:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One review author (LP) assessed the studies identified by the search strategies for inclusion according to specified criteria. The other two authors independently assessed separate random samples each comprising 25% of all identified studies plus any studies whose inclusion status was ambiguous. Agreement on inclusion was calculated using the Kappa statistic. The opinion of the third review author was sought if there was any disagreement regarding the inclusion of a trial.</P>
<P>Two review authors reviewed each identified study, abstracted data using forms developed for the review and graded the study's methodological quality. Where necessary, authors were contacted at their last known address to provide missing data for included trials.</P>
<P>As per the Cochrane Handbook, attention was paid to whether studies demonstrated protection from the following types of bias:</P>
<UL>
<LI>selection bias, i.e. true random sequencing, true concealment up to the time of allocation, comparison of known confounding variables between groups, comparison of developmentally similar processes in single case experimental designs;</LI>
<LI>performance bias, i.e. differences in types of treatment (co-interventions) between the two groups;</LI>
<LI>exclusion bias, i.e. withdrawal after entry to the trial;</LI>
<LI>detection bias, i.e. 'unmasked' assessment of outcome.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Decisions regarding potential biases were recorded in the risk of bias table for each study.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of single case experimental designs was also rated on the description of the participant and intervention, whether baseline performance was adequately established, the duration of treatment and follow up and the frequency of measurement across the phases of the experiment.</P>
<P>Individual criteria were rated as 'met', 'partially met', 'unmet' or 'unclear'. Disagreements were resolved with a third review author. Agreement on methodology assessment was calculated using the Kappa statistic (K).</P>
<P>Information from studies meeting criteria for inclusion was entered into RevMan. Most studies that were included used single case experimental designs. Four group trials were identified but only one included randomisation and the participants were heterogeneous. Data were therefore not combined for the review and data were not analysed using RevMan.</P>

<P>Searches yielded 911 abstracts. Of these, 771 clearly did not fit the inclusion criteria for the review. Full texts of 140 papers were considered for potential inclusion. Authors agreed on 78 of the 81 papers randomly selected for reliability check, K = 0.873. Disagreements were resolved with a third review author for the other papers. Seventeen papers (reporting 16 studies) were included for full review. The main reasons for exclusion were that included participants did not have cerebral palsy or those with cerebral palsy could not be disaggregated from other participants, or the study did not include any experimental control. Most reports were written in English. Papers in other languages were read by translators who discussed the content with review authors; none were found to fit the inclusion criteria for the review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Therapy focusing on children</HEADING>
<P>Nine of the included studies evaluated therapy that focused directly on children, who varied widely in age, type and severity of cerebral palsy and additional impairments. These studies aimed to facilitate the development of pre-intentional communication skills (behaviours such as mutual gaze, anticipation of behaviours in familiar routines that can be interpreted as communication by others, but which are not performed with the intention of conveying a message), pragmatic or communicative functions used in conversation, such as asking questions, providing information or repairing misunderstandings, speech production, expressive language structures or receptive vocabulary. The studies focusing on dysarthria are also discussed in a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Pennington-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pennington 2009</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Richman-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Richman 1977</LINK> used operant teaching strategies to train a nine year old girl with severe cognitive impairment, who lived in an institution, to produce three pre-intentional communication skills: maintaining eye contact and head control and increasing vocal imitations (ICF body functions). Forty hours of therapy were given over 20 weeks. Ten minute intervals were sampled for the presence of the three behaviours.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Communicative functions</HEADING>
<P>Five studies focused on the production of nonverbal messages, teaching children to use individual communicative functions (ICF activity level outcomes). <LINK REF="STD-Hunt-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hunt 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pinder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pinder 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sigafoos-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sigafoos 1995</LINK> taught children to use requests for objects or actions. <LINK REF="STD-Hunt-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hunt 1986</LINK> included one seven year old girl with cerebral palsy who had severe cognitive impairment and multiple disabilities in a multiple probe multiple baseline across participants design. Other participants did not have cerebral palsy. The subject was taught to request four objects or events by eye pointing to line drawings symbolising the object or action. Operant teaching methods were used, including interrupted chain training. Treatment was given twice daily, with 55 sessions in total. Requests were probed across the treatment sessions. <LINK REF="STD-Pinder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pinder 1995</LINK> taught four infants with cerebral palsy to produce either requests for objects or requests for more of an activity using micro teaching techniques (creating a communication environment, modelling the target skill, expectant delay, prompting and reinforcement). The children were aged 11 to 13 months, had severe cerebral palsy with no independent sitting and less than 50 on the Mental Development Index. Therapy was given twice a week for up to 12 weeks. Taught and untaught requests were probed in the teaching situation and across a second familiar communication situation. <LINK REF="STD-Sigafoos-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sigafoos 1995</LINK> reported the training of a six year old boy with severe cerebral palsy and moderate cognitive impairment to request three items using micro-teaching strategies, requests were probed throughout treatment.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1998</LINK> taught two children to produce responses to statements made by others in conversation. One of the participants was a 15 year old boy with severe cerebral palsy who usually communicated by yes/no responses only but who had access to a voice output communication device with pre-stored phrases and spelling for novel words. Communication partners provided structured opportunities for the boy to respond to statements in conversation with further information that maintained the interaction. These elicitations were added to the conversation of three partners in succession. Responses to statements were recorded across the treatment sessions with the three partners. Therapy was given two to three times per week, 36 sessions in total.</P>

<P>One study focused on speech production (<LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009b</LINK>), training children to control the loudness of their speech and maintain their respiratory effort for speech. Sixteen children aged 12 to 18 years, 15 of whom had cerebral palsy and one who had Worster Drought Syndrome, were taught to control their speech rate and loudness. Individual sessions, lasting 35 to 40 minutes took place three times per week over 6 weeks. Speech intelligibility in single words and connected speech to familiar and unfamiliar listeners was measured at six weeks before, one week before, one week after and six weeks after intervention (ICF activity level outcomes).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Dada-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dada 2009</LINK> taught three children with cerebral palsy aged 8 to 12 years to understand 24 spoken words (ICF body function level outcome), using an aided language stimulation programme which involved pairing a spoken word with a graphic symbol. Eight vocabulary items were taught in one activity carried out five times in one week (each activity lasting 15 to 25 minutes). In the second week a different activity with eight new vocabulary items was used and the activity and vocabulary items were changed again in the third week, so that 24 vocabulary items were taught in total. Teaching comprised repeated pairing of spoken word and visual symbols representing the target vocabulary.

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Children</HEADING>
<P>Children whose parents and educators received training in the seven studies appear heterogeneous. However, insufficient information was given to provide a clear picture of their overall level of functioning. They ranged from eight months of age to 17 years, had cerebral palsy classed as mild to severe and cognitive skills ranging from within normal limits to severely impaired. <LINK REF="STD-Hanzlik-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hanzlik 1989</LINK> included 20 infants aged 8 to 32 months, who had cerebral palsy of different types and severity ranging from mild to severe. Mental age was at least one standard deviation below the mean, range two to 18 months. None of the infants were able to ambulate either independently or with aids. Some, although it was difficult to tell how many, fell into the category containing speech impairment. However, some of those children may not have been expected to communicate intentionally given their chronological and mental age. Levels of communication development were not specified. <LINK REF="STD-McCollum-1984" TYPE="STUDY">McCollum 1984</LINK> included one child with severe cerebral palsy, of unknown type, aged 18 months. He was reported to vocalise but to exhibit few social behaviours. No other information was given regarding his developmental level. <LINK REF="STD-Basil-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Basil 1992</LINK> studied four Spanish children aged seven to eight years who had cerebral palsy of unstated type. They had no independent mobility and upper limb function was severely affected. One child scored 4.5 years on a test of mental development, the others did not reach baseline. These children communicated by vocalisation, eye gaze, facial expression and produced one symbol messages on their communication boards, which contained 52 to 188 symbols. <LINK REF="STD-McConachie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McConachie 1997</LINK> included nine children aged seven to 17 years who had cerebral palsy of differing types. No information was given on the severity of their motor impairments, cognitive or sensory skills. All had symbol communication systems (six used Blissymbolics, three Rebus Symbols), with access to 175 to 1000 plus symbols. Two children also had voice output communication aids. No information was given about how the children used their communication systems or their communicative level. <LINK REF="STD-Olswang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Olswang 2006</LINK> studied two children with cerebral palsy aged 14 and 20 months, who were unable to sit independently, had severe cognitive impairments and vision and hearing that were within normal limits. Both children were preverbal communicators, who looked at objects, but did not look back to the parents to request items. <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009a</LINK> included 11 children, 10 of whom had cerebral palsy of differing types. The children were aged 19 to 36 months at the start of the study. Gross motor function was rated using the gross Motor Function Classifaction Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Palisano-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palisano 1997</LINK>); most children had difficulty using their hands but could bring two hands together to act on a toy. All had severe dysarthria and were unintelligible to their parents out of context. Most children had severe receptive language delay (Preschool Language Scales mean percentile rank = 6, SD = 9) and severe intellectual impairment. <LINK REF="STD-Tait-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tait 2004</LINK> studied six children aged 16 to 47 months who had spastic type cerebral palsy which affected all four limbs. Two children had cortical visual impairments, one child had a mild visual impairment, one child had a hearing impairment and two children had epilepsy. Four of the children had receptive language scores that were within six months of their chronological age, one child had receptive language skills within nine months of their chronological age and one child had a profound language delay and scored at a two month developmental level.</P>

<P>With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-McConachie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McConachie 1997</LINK>, who trained teachers and education assistants, parents were the subjects of the research. Overall, very little information is provided on the people who were trained, their communication style before intervention, previous training and relationship with the participant children. None of the studies included information on parental stress and coping, which has been found to affect communication (<LINK REF="REF-Dunst-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunst 1988</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Basil-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Basil 1992</LINK> trained three mothers and one father. They were compared with teachers who received no training. No information was given on prior training or other characteristics of either group other than the pre-intervention interaction measures which showed different communication styles between the two groups. The mothers who participated in <LINK REF="STD-Hanzlik-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hanzlik 1989</LINK> had completed varying levels of education, from partial high school to college graduation. Half of the families in each group had other children. The employment of parents ranged from major professionals to semi-skilled workers. However, it was not clear if any of the mothers were employed outside the home or how social status was classified. The mother in <LINK REF="STD-McCollum-1984" TYPE="STUDY">McCollum 1984</LINK> was a single parent with a lower-middle income, no other information was given. <LINK REF="STD-McConachie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McConachie 1997</LINK> included nine teachers and 10 assistants in the experimental group who received training and eight teachers and six assistants who received no intervention. No other information was given on the adult participants, who volunteered to take part and who were assigned by their managers to the two groups. Authors stated that the participants and controls were matched on gender and extent of interaction with the participant children, however no supporting evidence was presented in the paper. <LINK REF="STD-Olswang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Olswang 2006</LINK> trained two mothers. One mother had older children, was Caucasian and had been born and brought up in the USA. The other was a second generation Ukranian immigrant living in the USA with her mother (who spoke only Ukranian) and had no other children. Both mothers had graduated from high school. No other details were provided. <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009a</LINK> trained 11 mothers. Two were single parents; five had completed high school education; three had received received some further education and three had completed university degrees. Five mothers worked outside the home, four on a part-time basis. Families lived in urban and rural areas and levels of deprivation varied across the sample. All mothers were White British or White Australian. <LINK REF="STD-Tait-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tait 2004</LINK> trained mothers of children in their study, but no information on the mothers was provided.</P>

In total 10 weekly home visits were made, in which target behaviours were watched on video-tape and practiced and treated and untreated communication behaviours measured. <LINK REF="STD-Hanzlik-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hanzlik 1989</LINK> gave a generic model of training to each mother, focusing either on interaction and the use of adaptive seating for the experimental group, or neurodevelopmental therapy for the control group. Training in this study was given at home in one session that lasted one hour. <LINK REF="STD-Olswang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Olswang 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009a</LINK> used a specified training protocol in which parents were all taught to create communication opportunities, to wait for their child to communicate, to recognise their child's communication and to shape this communication into more sophisticated signals. <LINK REF="STD-Olswang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Olswang 2006</LINK> devised training specifically for their study. Individual training took place twice per week for three weeks. Each session lasted approximately 45 minutes. The parents in <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009a</LINK> received It Takes Two to Talk®, the Hanen parent program, which was delivered to groups of parents in seven or eight sessions of two and half hours over 12 to 13 weeks. In both the intervention by Olswang and It Takes Two to Talk parents also received home visits for individual coaching. <LINK REF="STD-Tait-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tait 2004</LINK> developed an individualised training programme for each parent-child pair, on how to respond contingently to their child's pre-linguistic communication and how to prompt the use of more sophisticated communication signals. A written summary of the teaching strategies was also provided for parents. Parents then implemented the teaching strategies in 6 to 12 individual sessions of 30 minutes, which comprised three types of interactions: mealtime, play with a toy and social interaction (for example peek-a-boo, pretend play). Parents received feedback on their use of target strategies after each practice session. <LINK REF="STD-Basil-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Basil 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McConachie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McConachie 1997</LINK> both undertook group teaching to facilitate interaction with individual AAC users. <LINK REF="STD-Basil-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Basil 1992</LINK> trained a group of parents in one session then followed this training up with three home visits to each family to individualise intervention and help parents practice techniques. <LINK REF="STD-McConachie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McConachie 1997</LINK> trained teachers and assistants in their own school in five 90 minute workshop sessions which concentrated on one child. Both <LINK REF="STD-Basil-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Basil 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McConachie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McConachie 1997</LINK> used short talks, brainstorming and videotapes in their group teaching.</P>

Teachers and assistants who participated in the <LINK REF="STD-McConachie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McConachie 1997</LINK> study were assigned to treatment and control group by their school managers on the basis of school timetable, as staff were released to participate in training workshops. Allocation was not concealed as the person(s) who allocated participants also decided on their eligibility. Both of the studies, therefore, had significant weakness in their allocation strategies and selection bias was likely. In both <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009b</LINK> an interrupted time series design was used in which participants acted as their own controls. In both studies participants were recruited through the researchers' speech and language therapy colleagues, who were given a list of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Referring therapists selected participants from their caseloads and thus selection bias is likely. <LINK REF="STD-Hanzlik-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hanzlik 1989</LINK> recruited parents through colleagues. Parents who were willing to take part in the study were allocated to group as they were recruited by the investigator by her taking a piece of folded paper out of a bag; 20 papers were created, 10 consigned parents to control and 10 to experimental group.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Similarity of participants at baseline</HEADING>
<P>Information on recruitment to the studies was not provided for <LINK REF="STD-Basil-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Basil 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McConachie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McConachie 1997</LINK>, nor were inclusion and exclusion criteria cited. For <LINK REF="STD-Basil-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Basil 1992</LINK> participants and controls differed in their relationship to the children; parents received training, teachers were controls and received no training. The two groups clearly differed in their pre-intervention patterns of interaction. No information was provided on other possible confounding variables such as previous training in communicating with children who use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), beliefs about interaction, age, education, socio-economic status, and extent of knowledge and experience of AAC. This study was rated as inadequate on participant similarity. Participants and controls in <LINK REF="STD-McConachie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McConachie 1997</LINK> were matched on gender, occupation and extent of contact with the target children by managers. Pre-intervention communication ratings and information on possible confounders such as those listed above were not given. Therefore, it was not possible to detect how similar the two groups were before training. <LINK REF="STD-Hanzlik-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hanzlik 1989</LINK> provided sufficient information on participants to assess the similarity of the groups and to replicate the research with similar samples. She cited inclusion criteria that related to children's locomotor, cognitive and sensory skills and excluded mothers who had received previous training in either of the intervention strategies used in the study. The gender, type and severity of cerebral palsy, extent of locomotor skills, chronological and mental age was given for the children in each group in terms of frequencies, means and SDs, with groups seeming to be equally matched. Mothers were similar across groups in education and half of those in each group had other children. The range of socio-economic status (SES) of the households of the two groups was slightly wider for the control group, and the numbers of participant families in each SES group is not given. Pre-intervention scores (means and SDs) for interaction behaviours were given for the mothers and infants in both groups and appear similar. <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009a</LINK> provided sufficient detail on participants to allow replication. Selection criteria were chosen to reflect the population of children with cerebral palsy referred to speech and language therapy clinics. Criteria related to presence, type and extent of motor disorder; vision; hearing; communication and lack of previous parental communication training. The gender, type and severity of cerebral palsy, extent of locomotor skills, upper limb function, speech production, chronological age, receptive language, nonverbal understanding and expressive vocabulary is given for all children. The number of mothers in the group with university degrees was higher than in the general population. <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009b</LINK> provided exclusion and inclusion criteria.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. Participant numbers</HEADING>
<P>Most of the studies provided information on how the number of participants was chosen. <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009b</LINK> stated that sample size was determined by feasibility, with restrictions imposed by the data collection schedule, therapy duration and by the school day and term times. Number of participants ranged from eight (<LINK REF="STD-Basil-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Basil 1992</LINK>) to 20 (<LINK REF="STD-Hanzlik-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hanzlik 1989</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4. Blinding</HEADING>
<P>Appropriately for therapies involving training and participant co-operation, none of the studies included the blinding of the participants or of the clinicians providing therapy. However, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009b</LINK> the outcomes of the interventions were inappropriately assessed by the clinicians providing the therapy, which increased the risk of detection bias. In <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009a</LINK> the first coder collected the data and was aware of time at which data were collected when analysing behaviour. A second (naive) rater coded a random 20% of set of data from each participant, thereby reducing but not eliminating detection bias. In <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009b</LINK> listeners heard speech recordings blind to the data collection point. In the studies in which the therapists who undertook intervention also measured outcomes bias was reduced, but not eliminated, by the inclusion of a reliability check of coding with a blind assessor. <LINK REF="STD-Basil-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Basil 1992</LINK> checked a nonrandom sample of 12.5% sessions from before, during and after therapy, with agreement 90%, 92%, 98%. <LINK REF="STD-Hanzlik-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hanzlik 1989</LINK> reported K = 0.75 to 1.0 agreement from data from each of the children, across 14 categories but did not state the amount of data on which this was calculated. In <LINK REF="STD-McConachie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McConachie 1997</LINK> half of the data were coded by the second author, half by a blind assessor, with agreement calculated as 76% (71% to 79%) on 15% of the total data. As only small proportions of data were included in the reliability checks, each of the studies was still open to detection bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Participant description</HEADING>
<P>For replication of single case studies and moving from hypothesis generation to hypothesis testing participants need to be described in detail. All of the studies included in the review gave the participant child's chronological age and most gave a rating of their severity of cerebral palsy (mild, moderate, severe). Some gave children's type of cerebral palsy and rated the severity of any additional cognitive impairments. Few gave information on sensory impairments (<LINK REF="STD-Olswang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Olswang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pinder 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tait-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tait 2004</LINK>) and epilepsy or details of children's receptive language development. Most cited children's present modes of communication and gave a very brief overview of their use of their communication skills in interaction. Only <LINK REF="STD-Dada-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dada 2009</LINK> was judged to include sufficient detail to select, with certainty, other participants with a similar type of cerebral palsy, level of locomotor skills, cognitive and communication development. <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hunt-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hunt 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hurlbut-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hurlbut 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Olswang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Olswang 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pinder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pinder 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tait-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tait 2004</LINK> were judged to give a partial account of children's level of functioning. The descriptions given by <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McCollum-1984" TYPE="STUDY">McCollum 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Richman-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Richman 1977</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sigafoos-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sigafoos 1995</LINK> were judged to be inadequate for replicating the study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Equality of skills assigned to treatment and control</HEADING>
<P>Intervention is deemed to have an effect if outcome measures change at the point of, or after, intervention for each child in succession but no change is observed prior to intervention. Allocation of skills to control and treatment and similarity of skills in treatment and control were judged to be not applicable for this study. When different skills are assigned to treatment and control, in order to avoid selection bias and the effect of maturation, skills need to be of similar developmental level and prognostic indication and assigned at random to treatment or control with later treatment in multiple baseline designs. <LINK REF="STD-Richman-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Richman 1977</LINK> compared communication skills with a motor skill. <LINK REF="STD-Tait-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tait 2004</LINK> compared looking at an object with looking at a graphic symbol, for which the visual-cognitive processing is quite different. <LINK REF="STD-Pinder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pinder 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sigafoos-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sigafoos 1995</LINK> selected target skills that were very similar, and which may have been expected to generalise for the included participants. Therefore, an increase in control skill as well as treated skill would be expected. The other studies investigated skills of similar prognostic indication and were rated adequate in skill selection. However, none of the studies stated if skills were assigned to treatment (or a place in a sequence of treatments for multiple baseline across processes designs) or control randomly, which could introduce selection bias. All studies were rated as unclear on this criterion.</P>

Information was usually provided on the frequency and duration of treatment but was lacking on the exact methods of eliciting skills from individual children.

All studies except <LINK REF="STD-McCollum-1984" TYPE="STUDY">McCollum 1984</LINK> used data collected from the participants during the study. Amount of data checked ranged from 17% to 50%; only that used by <LINK REF="STD-Pinder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pinder 1995</LINK> was selected randomly.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">5. Duration of phases and measurement</HEADING>
<P>To show that intervention leads to change in single case experiments, frequent measurements should be taken in baseline, intervention and follow up or maintenance phases, and phases should be of similar duration. Without the use of randomisation tests (<LINK REF="REF-Edgington-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edgington 1995</LINK>), baseline should be adequately established with a plateau across at least three measurements or with a downward trend. If treatment is successful a clear upward trend should be observed during the intervention phase. In studies aiming for the acquisition of new skills the behaviour should continue at similar levels to the intervention phase in follow up or maintenance with no intervention.</P>

Baseline was stable, showing infrequent use of any of the requests. The first request showed a steady increase and reached criterion (three successive correctly produced requests) in 16 sessions, the second in the sequence was produced without direct teaching. The third request in the sequence also increased steadily in the intervention phase reaching criterion in 13 sessions. The final request also generalised without direct teaching. <LINK REF="STD-Pinder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pinder 1995</LINK> taught four children to request either an object or 'more' by looking at the adult and the object, the untaught request acted as a control. Requests were taught in play with toys and also assessed in snack time as a generalisation situation. Baselines were stable for three of the children, with requests made to less than 20% of probes. For one child, who had earlier been taught to make the same requests by actively reaching towards an object, increases in the target behaviour appear to have been made towards the end of baseline. For each of the four children increases in the production of both the taught and untaught requests were observed during intervention across both the treatment and generalisation situations. For two children increases were noted with the onset of intervention. For the other two increases in the behaviours were observed after three to four sessions of therapy. Levels of requests were maintained for four weeks after therapy had been withdrawn. <LINK REF="STD-Sigafoos-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sigafoos 1995</LINK> aimed to teach a boy to use three requests for objects in a multiple baseline design. During baseline percentage correct production of the three requests (not separated) ranged from 0% to 35%. For the first request production increased to 35% to 60% with verbal prompting and increased to 80% to 100% when expectant delay was used and verbal prompts were faded. However, although requests increased from the first to the second phase of intervention they showed a downward trend in the latter part of the second phase.

<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1998</LINK> trained a boy to produce responses to statements in conversation partners in a multiple baseline design across three communication partners, by pairing obligatory requests (questions) with a nonobligatory request (statement). Prior to intervention responses to statements were rare, being produced following 0% to 20% of statements made by each of the three partners in conversation (means = 1.8%, 2.5% and 4.0%). During intervention responses immediately increased, following an average of 41.7% and 52% of statements by the first two partners. Increases were only observed with the individual partners once the treatment had started. However, there was considerable variation in frequency of responses during intervention, ranging from 0% to 60% and 20% to 80% with each partner. Intervention was not carried out with the third partner due to the child's family moving away from the area in which the research was conducted.

For the first two structures baselines were stable, whereas statements seemed to show an upward trend in correct production. During intervention the percentage of correct productions rose steeply for all three targeted structures. Levels were also maintained at a much higher rate than baseline for these structures, but showed considerable variation during the maintenance phase.

In <LINK REF="STD-Basil-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Basil 1992</LINK> prior to parent training children failed to respond to parents' interaction more often than to teachers', but increased their responses to parents after intervention (F (3, 1) = 17.94, P = 0.024). Similarly, children communicated less often using their symbol communication boards with their parents than with their teachers, but their use with parents increased after training (F (3, 1) = 16.93, P = 0.026). <LINK REF="STD-Hanzlik-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hanzlik 1989</LINK> observed an increase in voluntary responsiveness (F (1, 18) = 11.53, P &lt; 0.003) and less physically directed compliance (F (1 to 18) = 4.44, P &lt; 0.05) but no differences in the amount of independent play for the infants whose mothers had received interaction training. The child in the study by <LINK REF="STD-McCollum-1984" TYPE="STUDY">McCollum 1984</LINK> showed an increase in vocalisation concurrent with his mother's training and increase in the frequency with which she brought her face close to her child's. The child of the mother in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Olswang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Olswang 2006</LINK> who used higher rates of target behaviours at the start of each phase of the study but whose rates reduced during each phase showed variable rates of engagement in interaction in each of the three phases, but a gradual increase from baseline to treatment withdrawal. The child of the mother who had a fairly stable baseline, with increases in rates of target behaviours during the treatment phase and a reduction in rates of target behaviours when treatment was withdrawn, showed engagement which was correspondingly stable during baseline, increased during intervention and reduced during the withdrawal phase. The communication patterns of children in <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009a</LINK> showed no differences between recordings taken at four and one month prior to parent training. Children initiated more conversations (<I>t</I>(10) = 3.150, P = .005, d = .950) and used more of their turns in conversation to control the interaction and their mother's behaviour (<I>t</I>(10) = 2.987, P = .007, d =.901) in the month after their parents had received training than in the month prior to training. Changes observed following therapy were maintained at four month follow-up, during which time no further intervention was given to parents or children. <LINK REF="STD-Tait-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tait 2004</LINK> observed children's use of more sophisticated communication signals to make requests, make choices, protest and to show response to their name before, during and after their parents were given training in communication teaching techniques. Four children increased their use of more sophisticated communication signals in three communication activities during treatment and maintained the use of these more sophisticated signals during follow up. Two children produced more sophisticated signals for one out of three messages targeted. One of these two children may have maintained the new behaviour but one reverted to prelinguistic behaviours during follow up.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Principal findings</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>This exploratory review found 17 papers (reporting 16 studies) that investigated the effects of different methods of speech and language therapy (SLT) for children with cerebral palsy, who differed in age, type and severity of motor disorder, presence and severity of intellectual impairment, or their communication partners. Nine of these studies evaluated therapy that focused on children. Seven studies concentrated on adult conversational partners (one study contained data subsumed into another trial and the larger study only is discussed). Therapy for children targeted pre-intentional communication skills, the use of individual communicative functions, expressive language, receptive vocabulary and speech production. Training for conversational partners included parents and education workers, teaching them to facilitate the communication of individual target children, usually augmentative communication system users.</LI>
<LI>Although the results observed suggest possible trends in communication change, the methodological quality of the studies included in the review is generally poor and this review provides insufficient evidence to support the general effectiveness of SLT for either children with cerebral palsy or their communication partners.</LI>
<LI>Since the original review in 2003 group studies have been published and show the potential impacts of therapy on children's speech production and training for parents on parent-child interaction patterns. These studies provide the data necessary to develop rigorous controlled investigations of the effectiveness of therapy.</LI>
<LI>The participants of the studies included in the review are heterogeneous and are often poorly described. Consensus on the description of participants and the choice of outcome measures in research reports is needed to establish potential clinical subgroups. Children and conversational partners within subgroups may resemble those with other primary disorders, for example children with severe cognitive impairment.</LI>
<LI>Consensus is needed on the aims and methods of standard therapies targeting different areas of communication used with clinical subgroups. Once consensus is gained, investigations of the effectiveness of standard therapies can be developed. Consensus among communities of practice could be gained through focus groups followed by a survey of SLTs working in the clinical field.</LI>
<LI>New therapy techniques should be applied in single case experimental designs, which should be rigorously designed and reported. These need to be replicated with similar participants, from a defined clinical subgroup, and evaluated in exploratory group trials. Should they show positive findings, the intervention should be tested in pragmatic trials.</LI>
<LI>Participants in trials of SLT interventions should be followed up to evaluate the long term impact of therapy on communication activity, participation and quality of life.</LI>
<LI>Valid, reliable generic outcome measures are needed to assess communication activity outcomes and allow cross trial comparisons.</LI>
<LI>The acceptability of interventions for families has not been evaluated and needs further study.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Therapy focusing on children</HEADING>
<P>Nine studies were found that investigated the effects of therapy given directly to children. All but one (<LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009b</LINK>) used single case experimental designs to show the impact of treatment for individual children. Children included in the studies ranged in age from infancy to late teens, had moderate to severe motor impairments, mild to severe speech, language and communication disorders and intellectual impairment ranging from mild to severe. Although each of the studies has methodological flaws, the provision of therapy does seem to be associated with increases in the production of pre-intentional communication behaviours (<LINK REF="STD-Richman-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Richman 1977</LINK>), requests for objects or actions (<LINK REF="STD-Hunt-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hunt 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pinder 1995</LINK>), responses to others' communication (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1998</LINK>) use of expressive language structures (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1982</LINK>) and understanding of spoken words (<LINK REF="STD-Dada-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dada 2009</LINK>) for the children studied. For three teenage children with severe cognitive impairment it appeared that iconic communication symbols were easier to acquire than Bliss symbols (<LINK REF="STD-Hurlbut-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hurlbut 1982</LINK>). For the studies using single case methodology we can only conclude that the intervention employed in the studies may have been effective in helping the individual children involved to develop communication skills. Given the methodology employed we cannot extend the findings to other children with cerebral palsy. Replication of the studies with other participants and exploratory group studies are needed to generalise findings to possible clinical subgroups, and move from hypothesis generation to hypothesis testing. The group study by <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009b</LINK>, along with others described in the systematic review by Pennington, Miller and Robson (<LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009</LINK>), suggests that speech and language therapy targeting control of respiration and phonation for speech may be associated with gains in intelligibility to both familiar and unfamiliar listeners. <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009b</LINK> provides the data necessary to develop rigorous controlled trials of the effectiveness of this type of intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Training for conversation partners</HEADING>
<P>The studies that focused on communication partners provided training in facilitating the communication skills of individual children for parents, teachers and education assistants. Four studies were group trials, three studies used single case experimental design. Four of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Basil-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Basil 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCollum-1984" TYPE="STUDY">McCollum 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McConachie-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McConachie 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olswang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Olswang 2006</LINK>) have serious methodological flaws and cannot demonstrate the effects of therapy for the participants who participated. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Hanzlik-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Hanzlik 1989</LINK>, involved parents of infants receiving a one hour individual training session focusing on the use physical and verbal interaction techniques. Results suggest that following the short period of intervention mothers changed their interaction style using more face to face communication and less physical contact with their infants. Overall, interaction was rated as more positive following training, but use of verbal interaction strategies did not appear to change. Follow up was not included in the study, therefore it is not possible to determine if change was maintained for the participants or if children's communication development was facilitated. Replication of this study with follow up is needed to investigate the effectiveness of the training programme used. <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009a</LINK> observed the effects of the group training programme It Takes Two to Talk® for a group of parents and their preschool children aged 19 to 36 months. Although this programme was not specifically designed for parents of children with motor impairments positive changes were observed in the communication patterns of mothers and their children after training. Changes were maintained four months after intervention without any further therapy. Furthermore, in a separate interview study (<LINK REF="REF-Pennington-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pennington 2010</LINK>) parents reported their experiences of the programme as largely positive, although some advised that more reference to augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) should be included when using the programme with families of children with severe motor disorders. Even with this suggestion parents appeared to view the training as acceptable and effective in helping to learn more about their child's communication needs and fostering their child's communication development. The study provides the information needed to develop a pragmatic randomised control trial of the effectiveness of the training programme for parents and their young children with motor disorders. Further, more rigorous investigations are needed of the training given in the other studies, as they aimed to teach the same communication strategies, which are widely acknowledged by clinicians to affect the communication of children with speech disorders and cerebral palsy.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Methodological quality of investigations</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Children with cerebral palsy who receive SLT range in age from infancy to late teens and vary widely in their functional levels of movement, learning, communication, vision and hearing. When reporting new interventions it is necessary to describe for whom they may be suitable. However, the descriptions of children and adults who participated in the studies included in this review were generally poor. It would therefore not be possible to replicate most studies or to decide whether children on clinical caseloads were similar to those in the original study and may benefit from the intervention. Descriptions of subjects should include all features that may confound studies. This includes children's chronological age, type and severity of cerebral palsy, gross and fine motor functioning, cognitive developmental level, presence, type and severity of epilepsy, sensory skills, receptive and expressive language development, educational placement and previous therapy. Valid systems now exist to classify the motor skills of children with cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Eliasson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eliasson 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palisano-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palisano 2007</LINK>) and these should be routinely applied in research. Communication skills should be described in detail, and should include measures of speech intelligibility, methods of communication used and communicative functions produced in conversation. Schemes are currently being developed to classify the communication of children with cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Barty-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barty 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hidecker-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hidecker 2009</LINK>) and it is hoped that in the near future they will be validated for use in research For training of conversation partners details of their relationship to target children, gender, educational level, previous training and present communication style should be given. With such descriptions it may be possible to identify clinical subgroups of children with cerebral palsy who display similar skills and who react to interventions in similar manners. However, as cerebral palsy is associated with a wide range of disorders it is possible that some children will not fit into such groups and the evaluation of interventions for them will comprise N of one trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>The interventions investigated in the studies included in this review were generally well described and their primary features could be replicated. For therapy focusing directly on children, techniques included operant and micro-teaching. Training for conversation partners included short talks, brainstorming, video examples, practice and feedback. Full description with examples of interaction during intervention would facilitate replication. However, some differences would still be likely to occur due to the fluid nature of conversation and effects of different communication environments and circumstances. Some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dada-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dada 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hunt-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hunt 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olswang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Olswang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tait-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tait 2004</LINK>) reported checks of treatment integrity, which should be included in study design to show constancy of treatment across participants and that treatment was undertaken according to the protocol.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>Due to the nature of participation in therapy and training it is not possible to blind participants and clinicians to therapy, which leaves trials of SLT, including those in this review, open to attrition bias. People may agree to participate, but withdraw when allocated to the intervention they least support. Attempts were made in each of the studies to reduce detection bias by including checks of data coding by a second rater. To improve the rigour of studies, outcomes should be assessed by persons other than those giving the therapy, who are blind to the allocation of treatment and control.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sample size</HEADING>
<P>The group studies in the review were exploratory in nature. Some (<LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009b" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009b</LINK>) could be used by future researchers to calculate sample sizes reliably to test the effects of similar interventions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Single case experimental design</HEADING>
<P>It is important to show, in these hypothesis generating studies, that intervention addresses a target behaviour and that changes in behaviour are not due to maturation. This demands the establishment of an adequate baseline, with sufficient data collection points throughout the baseline, intervention and follow-up phases, and the comparison of a treated skill with an untreated behaviour that is similar in prognostic indication. Some studies failed to show that behaviours were stable before therapy, and it is therefore possible that behaviours attributed to intervention may have developed without it. Randomisation tests may have addressed the lack of a stable baseline, but these were not used. Other studies included control behaviours that were untreated, or treated later, which were too similar to the treated behaviour and also changed, probably as a result of the intervention. One of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Richman-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Richman 1977</LINK>) used a motor skill which would not have been expected to show the same pattern of development as the treated communication skills. None of the studies included adequate follow up to show the maintenance of behaviour change, which is vital if we are seeking to show the acquisition of communication skills.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Communication</HEADING>
<P>The aim of SLT is to improve communication. As such, outcome measures should relate directly to aspects of communication behaviour. Depending on the particular difficulties children experience, therapy could aim to improve a child's speech production, understanding, expressive language, voice, range of communicative functions or use of an augmentative or alternative communication system. Training for parents and other communication partners involves changing their communication patterns to give children opportunities to develop and use new communication skills. The studies involved in this review targeted different aspects of communication and used different outcome measures. Even studies that looked at similar skills, for example those targeting requests for objects and actions, used different measures to evaluate outcome. This makes replication of studies harder than if generic tools were used, as clinicians and researchers need to be trained to use the measures reliably. The use of the same outcome measures across studies would also help in the collection of a bank of information about the communication of children with cerebral palsy and their conversation partners, in the formation of clinical subgroups and in the assessment of the clinical significance of reported interventions. In addition to describing the change in the individual skills targeted it would be useful if authors examined the rate of change in other areas of communication, using well known outcome measures. This would provide rates of change for individuals and groups that may or may not be associated with intervention and which may be used to aid clinical practice and to inform future research.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of life and participation</HEADING>
<P>Recent research has observed an negative correlation between communication skill and both relationships with parents and participation of children with cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Dickinson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickinson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fauconnier-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fauconnier 2009</LINK>). With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Pennington-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Pennington 2009a</LINK>, which had an accompanying qualitative study (<LINK REF="REF-Pennington-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pennington 2010</LINK>), the studies included in this review did not examine the wider impact of therapy. In addition to investigating the change in children's communication, and that of their conversation partners, it is important to examine if children and their families find interventions acceptable and worthwhile, and if interventions are associated with children's increased quality of life and participation in social, education and family life. Such additional information could be gained by the use of published measures of participation, family stress and functioning and through interviews with both parents and children. Qualitative studies are now more prevalent (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldbart-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldbart 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lund-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lund 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lund-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lund 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2008</LINK>) and some have shown unexpected results. For example in <LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2001</LINK> young AAC users supported a model in which children are withdrawn from classrooms to learn new communication skills, contrary to current clinical practice in which skills are taught in normal class activities. We cannot assume that parents and families involved in the studies of this review view the intervention they received positively as therapy was of short duration and with minimal follow up, making attrition due to unsuitability of treatment less likely.</P>

<P>Considering the range of aspects of communication targeted, methods used and participants involved in the studies included in this review, and the methodological weaknesses of the studies, it is not possible to conclude at the present time that speech and language therapy focusing on children with cerebral palsy or their communication partners is more effective than no intervention at all. However, no evidence has been found of any harmful effects of SLT for children with cerebral palsy and their families, and therapy has not been shown to be ineffective.

<P>This exploratory review highlights the paucity of rigorous research on the effectiveness of speech and language therapy (SLT) that aims to improve the communication skills of children with cerebral palsy. Further research is needed to define possible clinical subgroups of children with cerebral palsy and their communication partners and to investigate the most effective methods of intervention for these subgroups. To this end a bank of research evidence is needed, including the following.<BR/>

<LI>Detailed description of research participants including their age, type and severity of cerebral palsy, gross and fine motor function (e.g. Gross Motor Function Classification System, Manual Ability Classification System), cognitive level, presence and type of epilepsy, sensory skills, receptive and expressive language skills, method of communication, range of communication skills and speech intelligibility. Where possible researchers should use the same validated measures across reports. Communication partners should also be described thoroughly, including information on their relationship to the child, age, gender, educational history, employment, previous training in communication, attitudes towards augmentation and alternative communication (AAC), present communicative style.</LI>

</UL>
<P>As this review has shown, SLT for children with cerebral palsy is a complex intervention. Children have complex communication disorders, associated with their varied underlying impairments, and each disorder may require a different type of treatment. In addition, children will experience different social relationships and interact with many different people in many different environments, each of which will influence communication and its treatment. It is probable that because of the heterogeneity of the children, their conversational partners and their communicative environments, and the interaction between these variables, that a broad evaluation of the effectiveness of SLT for children with cerebral palsy may not be possible. Instead, evaluations should concentrate on the effectiveness of interventions given to ameliorate disorders affecting different areas and stages of speech, language and communication development for groups of clients with particular sets of skills and needs and to facilitate children's and families' participation in chosen life situations.</P>
