<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-03 10:01:57 -0300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is one of the most common causes of genital discomfort in women of reproductive age. This condition occurs when there is an imbalance in the population of normal vaginal micro-organism with depletion of the dominant lactobacilli and overgrowth of other types of bacteria. Treatment of this condition using recommended antibiotics is often associated with failure and high rates of recurrence. This led to the concept of replacing the depleted lactobacilli using probiotic strains as a treatment approach. This review investigated the evidence for the use of probiotic preparations either alone or in conjunction with antibiotics for the treatment of BV. The current research does not provide conclusive evidence that probiotics are superior to or enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of BV. In addition, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of probiotics either before, during or after antibiotic treatment as a means of ensuring successful treatment or reduce recurrence. Larger, well-designed randomized controlled trials with standardized methodologies are needed to confirm the benefits of probiotics in the treatment of BV.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-03 10:01:57 -0300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is one of the most common causes of genital discomfort in women of reproductive age. This condition occurs as a result of an imbalance in the normal vaginal microbiota and is characterized by a decrease or depletion of the <I>Lactobacilli spp</I> and a concomitant overgrowth of other vaginal anaerobic bacteria. The micro-organisms commonly cultured in BV include <I>Gardnerella vaginalis</I>, <I>Mobiluncus spp</I>, <I>Mycoplasma hominis</I>, <I>Prevotella spp</I>, <I>Preptostreptococcuss spp </I>and more recently, new molecular methods have identified <I>Atopobium vaginae</I> as a BV-associated microbe (<LINK REF="REF-Fredricks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fredricks 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marrazzo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marrazzo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verstraelen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verstraelen 2004</LINK>). Under normal conditions, the production of lactic acid by vaginal lactobacilli, particularly by strong hydrogen peroxide (H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>) producers such as <I>Lactobacillus crispatus</I> and <I>Lactobacillus jensenii</I>, help to maintain the low vaginal pH which prevents the overgrowth of other anaerobic bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Antonio-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antonio 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The underlying cause of BV is still not fully understood, but factors such as vaginal douching, black ethnicity, low socioeconomic status, use of an intra-uterine contraceptive device, and new/multiple sex partners appear to increase the risk of this perturbation in the vaginal ecosystem (<LINK REF="REF-Calzolari-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calzolari 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fonck-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonck 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Royce-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Royce 1999</LINK>). The prevalence of BV varies in different parts of the world and is higher in developing countries, but there is still some controversy about whether or not BV is a sexually transmitted disease in the "traditional" sense (<LINK REF="REF-Larsson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larsson 2005</LINK>). However, current data indicate that the overall prevalence of BV is much higher among STD clinic attendees and commercial sex workers (<LINK REF="REF-Behets-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behets 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eschenbach-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eschenbach 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although some women with BV remain asymptomatic, as many as 50% to 60% of BV patients report symptoms such as occurrence of malodorous "fishy" vaginal discharge. The Amsel criteria for the diagnosis of BV were first described in 1983 (<LINK REF="REF-Amsel-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amsel 1983</LINK>) and a positive diagnosis is based on the presence of at least three of the following: presence of a thin, greyish homogenous discharge; vaginal pH greater than 4.5; presence of clue cells on Gram stain; positive whiff test.</P>
<P>However, there are other diagnostic scoring systems based on the number or ratio of Lactobacilli versus other bacterial morphotypes seen on Gram stained vaginal smears or wet preparations (<LINK REF="REF-Forsum-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsum 2005</LINK>). The Nugent system (<LINK REF="REF-Nugent-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nugent 1991</LINK>) scores the number of Lactobacilli, Gardnerella, and curved bacteria (Mobiluncus) morphotypes per high-power field. Various studies have used the Nugent scoring system as an alternative method to the Amsel criteria and there is a close correlation between both methods due to the high sensitivity and specificity of microbial quantification of Gram stained vaginal smears (<LINK REF="REF-Honest-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Honest 2004</LINK>). New diagnostic methods using molecular techniques are now being developed and applied in various studies (<LINK REF="REF-Forsum-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsum 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verhelst-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhelst 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verstraelen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verstraelen 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is now known that BV is associated with potentially severe gynaecological and obstetric complications and sequelae. Current data suggest a causal association between BV, pelvic inflammatory disease, and tubal factor infertility (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2002</LINK>). Pregnant women with BV have a higher risk of adverse outcomes such as late miscarriage, chorioamnionitis, premature rupture of membranes, preterm birth and postpartum endometritis (<LINK REF="REF-Marrazzo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marrazzo 2004</LINK>). In women undergoing in vitro fertilization, BV may result in lower implantation rates and increased rates of early pregnancy loss (<LINK REF="REF-Eckert-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eckert 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verstraelen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verstraelen 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is growing evidence of an association between BV and sexually transmitted infections, making it of grave concern, particularly in light of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. There are data indicative of a relationship between BV and increased risk of HIV transmission and acquisition (<LINK REF="REF-Cu_x002d_Uvin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cu-Uvin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sewankambo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sewankambo 1997</LINK>). The presence of BV was associated with up to a six-fold increment in quantity of HIV shedding (<LINK REF="REF-Cu_x002d_Uvin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cu-Uvin 2001</LINK>). Furthermore, there is a correlation between the absence of vaginal lactobacilli and a positive result for the carriage of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis (<LINK REF="REF-Wiesenfeld-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiesenfeld 2003</LINK>). BV has been identified as a risk factor for herpes virus type 2 infection and increased viral shedding in infected women (<LINK REF="REF-Cherpes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherpes 2005</LINK>). Recent reports also indicate that BV may increase the risk of acquisition or reactivation of Human Papillomavirus infection, particularly high-risk HPV-types (<LINK REF="REF-da-Silva-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">da Silva 2004</LINK>). The displacement of the H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>-producing Lactobacilli, elevated vaginal pH with the presence of bacteria that produce sialidase and mucin-degrading enzymes as seen in BV, probably combine to create a milieu conducive to the survival of these pathogens (<LINK REF="REF-Olmsted-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olmsted 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In light of all these adverse BV-associated conditions, adequate treatment of this condition is crucial. Current guidelines for treatment of BV stipulate the use of metronidazole or clindamycin administered orally or intravaginally (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marrazzo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marrazzo 2004</LINK>). Other treatment regimens that have been suggested include acidification of the vagina and the use of povidone-iodine vaginal suppositories. Up to 10% to15% of patients fail to respond to initial antimicrobial therapy, and recurrence rates over time among responders remain significant, reaching up to 80% and necessitating repeated administration of antibiotics. Such repeated antibiotic exposure increases the risk of emergence of resistant strains, alteration of microbiota, and possible persistence of BV-associated pathogens. The high recurrence rates associated with antibiotic therapy have stimulated the search for alternative treatment modalities, which could be used with or without the current regimen. The dominance of lactobacilli in healthy vaginal microbiota and its obliteration in BV has given rise to the concept of oral or vaginal instillation of probiotic Lactobacillus strains to restore the balance. Probiotics are defined as live micro-organisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a beneficial health effect on the host (<LINK REF="REF-Senok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senok 2005</LINK>). Available evidence now indicates that certain strains of lactobacilli when administered to patients can colonize the vagina and reduce the risk of BV (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2001</LINK>). Studies have been carried out to assess the efficacy of single strain or cocktail of probiotics administered orally or intravaginal in the treatment of BV (<LINK REF="REF-Falagas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falagas 2007</LINK>). In addition, the effect of probiotics in conjunction with antibiotic regimen has also been evaluated. Lactobacilli probiotics can be used over a long time without adverse effects, making them an attractive option to antibiotics, particularly in addressing the problem of high recurrence rates.</P>
<P>While the scientific community is still trying to determine the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of BV, women with chronic vaginal symptoms are increasingly self-utilizing alternative remedies, in particular lactobacilli replacement therapy, as an alternative to antimicrobials (<LINK REF="REF-Nyirjesy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nyirjesy 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trutnovsky-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trutnovsky 2001</LINK>). It is therefore of essence to conduct a rigorous systematic review of available clinical trials, with a view to ascertaining the efficacy (or lack thereof) of probiotics in the treatment of BV, and possibly to identify strategic areas for future research.</P>

<P>Trials selection:ACS and MF, a trained research assistant, performed the searches. We also received help from the HIV/AIDS and STD Cochrane Review Groups Trials Search Co-ordinator and the Medical Librarian, College of Medicine, University of Sharjah. The titles and abstracts from the search were screened to identify those of potential relevance for the review. In cases where we could not make a decision based on the abstract, we obtained and reviewed the full text. Following this process, we identified 17 trials which were relevant to the review protocol. We designed an eligibility assessment form. ACS, HV and MF obtained the full reports of all relevant trials and independently appraised them for eligibility using this form. We resolved disagreements about trial inclusion by discussion. Excluded trials and reasons for their exclusion are listed in "Characteristics of excluded studies" table.</P>
<P>Assessment of methodological quality: ACS, MF and HV independently assessed the methodological quality of all eligible trials. This included the assessment of random allocation, whether or not there was concealment, whether participants, clinicians and outcome assessors were blinded or not blinded and whether intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was carried out. We also considered whether or not all outcome measures were addressed. Where information was not clearly reported, we contacted trial authors for necessary clarification. A full description of the criteria used in assessing the risk of bias is found in the Risk of Bias Table.</P>
<P>Data Extraction: ACS and MF developed and used a data extraction form, which they used independently to extract and record information on the results of included studies. . Where there were differences HV gave an independent assessment and final resolution was achieved by discussion.</P>
<P>Data analysis: This was carried out using the RevMan Analyses statistical package in Review Manager (version 4.2) and this was completed using Review Manager version 5. For dichotomous outcomes we derived odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each study. For continuous data we intended to calculate the mean differences for each study but this was not done as there were no such data. We had planned to do the following analysis as part of a full meta-analysis: test for heterogeneity using a standard Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test and where appropriate combine the results for each outcome for included studies. Where there was homogeneity, the pooled RR and 95% CI was to be calculated for dichotomous outcomes using a fixed-effect model. For continuous data, we had planned to estimate the pooled weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% CI. In the presence of heterogeneity, we planned to explore the reason for this and if none was found, to use a random-effects model. Funnel plots were to be used for assessment of publication or other reporting bias. The nature of the included studies precluded these analysis. We did not perform a meta-analysis due to significant differences in the methodologies, regimens and probiotic preparations used in the included studies.</P>

<P>We identified about 350 studies from the comprehensive search and reviewed the abstracts for all. In some cases we reviewed the full text before a decision was made. We identified 17 studies for possible inclusion and we reviewed the full text version of all of them. These studies were duplicated across at least two of the databases we searched. ACS and MF independently assessed whether these identified studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria in for the review using a pre-designed form. HV acted as an independent arbiter where there was a conflict of opinion. Four studies (Anukam 2006a; Anukam 2006b; Eriksson 2005; Parent 1996) satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The 12 excluded trials and reasons for their exclusion are listed in the "Characteristics of excluded studies" table. Details of the four included studies are described below and in the Characteristics of Included Studies Table (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>)</P>
<P>Anukam 2006a was a randomized controlled double blinded trial to assess the efficacy of augmentation of oral metronidazole with oral probiotics in the treatment of BV. In this study, over 500 subjects were screened and 125 pre-menopausal women (aged 18 to 44 years) fitting the entry criteria of having clinical features of BV, positive Nugent and BVBlue (salidase test) score were recruited. The exclusion criteria were use of antibiotics in the preceding 14 days, pregnancy, lactation, evidence of gross inflammatory genital process, presence of sexually transmitted infection, use of investigational drugs within 30 days, hypersensitivity to metronidazole, warfarin, lithium or disulfaram and menstruation at time of diagnosis. A power calculation for sample size was carried out. The patients were randomized in a double blind manner and given oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for seven days, plus either oral <I>L. rhamnosus GR-1 </I>and <I>L. reuteri RC</I>-14 (1x10<SUP>9</SUP> CFU per capsule) twice daily for 30 days starting on day one of metronidazole treatment (n = 65) or identical looking placebo capsules (n = 60). At the end of the treatment period three vaginal swabs were collected and evaluated for BV status. Of the 125 women enrolled, only 96 (84.8%) returned for follow up on day 30 (16 patients in the placebo arm and 3 patients in the treatment arm were lost to follow up).The primary outcome was cure of BV as determined by normal Nugent score, absence of clue cells, negative salidase test and no symptoms or signs of BV at day 30. Intention-to-treat analysis was not carried out. There was no occurrence of adverse effects.</P>
<P>Anukam 2006b was a randomized double blind clinical trial in which intravaginal probiotic capsules was compared with metronidazole gel for the treatment of BV. The sample size of twenty women per treatment group was based on the expectation of finding a 50% difference between the two treatment groups. The inclusion criteria were presence of vaginal discharge, unpleasant fishy odour, with or without localized vaginal irritation / discomfort. Exclusion criteria include pregnancy, age &lt; 18years or &gt; 50years, menstruating at time of diagnosis or due to menstruate over the following five days, HIV positive, urogenital infections including yeast vaginitis and sexually transmitted infections. The 40 women enrolled in the study had the diagnosis of BV confirmed based on Nugent score (&gt; 7) and positive salidase test. Twenty women were randomized to receive probiotic intravaginal capsule containing <I>L. rhamnosus</I> GR-1 and<I> L. reuteri</I> RC-14 (1x10<SUP>9 </SUP>CFU per capsule) nightly for five nights. The other 20 women applied 0.75% metronidazole gel twice daily intravaginally for 5 days. The women were assessed on days 0, 6, 15, and 30 at which time two vaginal swabs were collected and assessed for Nugent scoring, KOH and salidase test. There was 100% follow-up on days 6 and 15 and all women demonstrated compliance by returning empty treatment vials. Three women in the probiotic arm and 2 in the metronidaozole group failed to return for follow up on day 30. Adverse effects were not described.</P>
<P>Eriksson 2005 assessed the efficacy of the use of vaginal lactobacilli after open treatment with vaginal clindamycin ovules. The inclusion criteria were based on the diagnosis of BV by Amsel's criteria, age &gt; 18 years and menstruating. The women had to be willing to use a tampon during menstruation. Subjects were excluded if they were pregnant, had used antibiotics in the week preceding the diagnosis of BV or had presence of vaginal yeast or Chlamydia trachomatis infection. A power calculation was carried out to determine sample size. During the open part of the trial all 225 enrolled subjects were treated with clindamycin ovules 100 mg inserted vaginally once daily for three days irrespective of whether they were randomized into the probiotic group or the placebo group. In the following menstruation, patients received either a lactobacilli impregnated tampon (n = 91) or placebo tampons (n = 96). They had to use at least five tampons to be included in the efficacy analysis and all unused tampons were returned. At the second menstruation, the women used their normal menstrual protection. The lactobacilli impregnated tampons contained <I>L. casei</I> var<I> rhamnosus</I>, <I>L. gasseri</I> and <I>L. fermentum </I>(1x10<SUP>8</SUP> per tampon). After the first menstruation (during which study tampons were used) and after the second menstruation, the patients sent self-taken vaginal smears to the study co-ordinator. At the follow-up after the second menstruation, the patients were re-evaluated using Amsel's criteria and another vaginal smear was taken. The microbiological cure rates were determined after the second menstruation using Nugent score and Amsel's criteria. Only 187 participants were included in the 'per protocol' analysis as 30 women were lost to follow up and another 38 were excluded due to violation of protocol. Intention-to treat-analysis was carried out and adverse effects were reported.</P>
<P>Parent 1996 evaluated the efficacy of vaginal tablets containing <I>L. acidophilus </I>and estriol. This was a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial with a parallel-group design. Thirty-two non-menopausal women (24 pregnant and 8 pregnant) diagnosed with BV based on Amsel's criteria were enrolled. Patients were excluded from the study if they had used topical or systemic hormonal treatment (except oral contraceptives) or had undergone any local vaginal treatment in the two weeks prior to the trial, had metrorrhagia or acute vaginitis. The participants were randomly allocated into lactobacilli and placebo groups using a pre-determined randomization scheme. The lactobacilli group received Gynoflor vaginal tablets containing <I>L. acidophilus</I> (10 million viable bacteria per tablet) and 0.03 mg estriol. The placebo tablets did not contain <I>L. acidophilus</I> or estriol. Both groups inserted one vaginal tablet nightly for six days. Two tablets were inserted nightly by pregnant patients with abundant leukorrhea and those women who started menstruating during the treatment period (in which case therapy was interrupted and resumed after menstruation). The patients were examined and smears obtained on days 15 and 28 after onset of therapy. Microbiological cure was determined using Nugent criteria. Intention-to-treat analysis was not carried out. Adverse effects were reported.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies.</P>
<P>Randomization in Anukam 2006a was carried out using a computer generated scheme and allocation schedule was conducted "off-site" by the pharmacy. The two groups were similar at baseline regarding the presence of BV. All assessors and patients were blinded. Measures of the key outcome was obtained from 106 women who returned for a follow-up visit. There was possible attrition bias due to patients lost to follow up and there was no statement on intention-to-treat analysis. The statistical analysis was well described and used appropriately. The results of between-group statistical comparisons as well as the measure of the size of the treatment effect were reported for the key outcome measure.</P>
<P>Randomization in Anukam 2006b was carried out using a computer generated scheme and patients in both study groups were similar at baseline. Allocation concealment was carried out "off-site" by the pharmacy. The patients were not blinded, however the assessors (clinical and laboratory) were blinded. Only 87.5% of patients returned for follow up on day 30,  which may have introduced some attrition bias. All subjects for whom outcome measures were available received the treatment or placebo as allocated. There was no statement on intention-to-treat analysis. The statistical analysis was well described and used appropriately.</P>
<P>Randomization in Eriksson 2005 was carried out but the method used was not described. Allocation concealment was not carried out. Blinding of patients and clinical assessors was inadequate due to slight colour differences between the probiotic and the placebo tampons. Not all the subjects for whom outcome measures were available received the treatment or placebo as allocated. Data for those excluded for protocol violation and drop outs were adequately addressed. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. The results of between-group statistical comparisons as well as the measure of the size of the treatment effect were reported.</P>
<P>Randomization in Parent 1996 was carried using a "pre-determined randomization scheme". Allocation concealment was not stated and there was no mention or description of blinding. We contacted the authors for clarification but received no reply. There was possible attrition bias due to patients lost to follow up. The statistical analysis (per-protocol) was well described and used appropriately. The results of between-group statistical comparisons as well as the measure of the size of the treatment effect were reported for the key outcome measure.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-08-04 11:07:55 -0300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Primary outcome:<BR/>All four included studies assessed microbiological cure as a key outcome measure. Using the reported data for the primary outcome, we calculated the Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for each study.</P>
<P>Anukam 2006a reported a statistically significant difference at the day 30 follow up in the per-protocol analysis with 43 of the 49 (88%) women in the antibiotic/probiotic treatment arm having normal Nugent scores compared to 23 of the 57 women (40%) in the antibiotic/placebo arm: OR 0.09 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.26). This finding is suggestive of a beneficial effect of the antibiotic/probiotic regimen in the treatment of BV.<BR/>
</P>
<P>In Anukam 2006b, according to the per-protocol analysis, 11 of the 17 (64.7%) women in the probiotic arm had normal Nugent scores on day 30 compared to 6 out of 18 (33.3%) in the metronidazole arm: OR 0.27 (95% CI 0.07 to 1.10).</P>
<P>In Eriksson 2005, the ITT analysis of the primary outcome published in the article was based on Amsel's criteria. The assessment of the primary outcome based on Nugent criteria was presented only for those included in the per-protocol analysis. The study authors kindly provided us with the ITT analysis data (for 217 women) based on Nugent criteria. Of the 108 women in the treatment arm, 75 (69.4%) had normal Nugent scores at follow up after the second menstruation compared to 80 out of 109 (73.3%) in the placebo arm: OR 1.21 (95% CI 0.67 to 2.19).</P>
<P>InParent 1996, microbiological cure on day 28 was documented in 7 of the 8 (87.5%) women in the probiotic/estriol arm compared to 1 out of 7 (14.2%) in the placebo/estriol arm: OR 0.02 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.47). This statistical analysis suggests that the probiotic/estriol regimen is beneficial for the treatment of BV.</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes:<BR/>Not all the studies assessed all the five secondary outcomes outlined in our review protocol. None of the studies reported on: (i) persistence or recurrence of BV at follow up from 30 days post treatment or (ii) effect on BV associated outcomes.<BR/>The other three secondary outcomes, (i) resolution of symptoms as reported by the patient, (ii) clinical cure as reported by the physician or investigator and (iii) occurrence of adverse reactions or side effects were reported. We used the data from each study that reported any of these three secondary outcomes to calculate the Odds ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI).<BR/>
<BR/>1. Resolution of symptoms as reported by the patient<BR/>This outcome was reported in Anukam 2006b and Eriksson 2005. In Anukam 2006b , 15 of the 17 (88.2%) women in the probiotic arm reported resolution of symptoms compared to 12 of the 18 (66.6%) women in the metronidazole arm: OR 0.27 (95% CI 0.05, 1.57). The authors of Eriksson 2005 provided us with data on the resolution of symptoms as assessed by the patient at follow up. Data for 55 women was stated as missing and the ITT analysis for 216 women showed that 74 out of 108 (68.5%) in the treatment arm reported complete resolution of symptoms compared to 67 out of 108 (62%) in the placebo arm: OR 0.75 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.32).</P>
<P>2. Clinical cure as reported by physician or investigator<BR/>This was reported in two studies. In Eriksson 2005, clinical cure based on Amsel's criteria was reported. The authors confirmed that these data were used as the assessment of physician-reported clinical cure. Clinical cure was reported for 64 out of 111 (57.6%) women in the treatment arm and 68 out of 113 (60.1%) in the placebo arm: OR 1.11 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.89). Parent 1996 reported clinical cure on day 28 based on Amsel criteria. In the probiotic/estriol group, 7 of the 8 (87.5%) women were reported as clinically cured compared to 2 out of 9 (22.2%) women in the placebo/estriol group: OR 0.04 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.56). The finding from Parent 1996 is suggestive of a beneficial effect with the probiotic/estriol regimen.</P>
<P>3. Occurrence of adverse effects or side effects</P>
<P>Anukam 2006a reported that there were no adverse effects. In Anukam 2006b, 2 out of 17 (11.7%) women in the probiotic arm reported adverse effects versus 11 out of 18 (61.1%) women in the metronidazole group: OR 0.08 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.49)</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the severity, nature and frequency of adverse events between the treatment and control groups in Eriksson 2005. The most common adverse event was clinical C<I>andida</I> infection which occurred in 14.2% of those receiving the probiotic treatment and in 13.5% of the control. The author of Parent 1996 reported good tolerability without giving data on adverse effects.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-03 10:01:57 -0300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>BV occurs as a result of imbalance in the normal vaginal microbiota and is characterized by a decrease or depletion of the <I>Lactobacilli</I> spp and a concomitant overgrowth of other vaginal anaerobic bacteria. It remains a common cause of genital discomfort in women and it is associated with potentially severe gynaecological and obstetric sequelae. Unfortunately, currently available treatment of BV with the use of metronidazole or clindamycin administered orally or intravaginally has been shown to be associated with poor initial cure rates in 10% to 15% of patients and recurrence rates of up to 80% in those who show initial response. The dominance of lactobacilli in healthy vaginal microbiota and its obliteration in BV has given rise to the concept of oral or vaginal instillation of probiotic <I>Lactobacillus</I> strains to restore the balance. Indeed, available evidence now indicates that certain strains of lactobacilli administered intravaginally are capable of colonizing the vagina. This systematic review assesses the evidence for the use of probiotic regimen in the treatment of BV.</P>
<P>We identified four randomized controlled trials which investigated the use of probiotics in women with BV and met the inclusion criteria outlined in the protocol for this systematic review. There were significant variations in the design of the trials identified. Anukam 2006a assessed the efficacy of augmentation of oral metronidazole with oral probiotics in the treatment of BV. In contrast, Anukam 2006b compared intravaginal probiotic capsules with metronidazole gel for the treatment of BV. Eriksson 2005 used clindamycin ovules for the open treatment followed by use of probiotic impregnated tampons versus placebo tampons. Parent 1996 used combined probiotic/estriol vaginal tablets with both pregnant and non-pregnant women included in the study population. As per our protocol, the results of included studies were to be combined for each outcome where appropriate and a meta-analysis conducted. However, due to these significant differences in the types of probiotics used and the trial methodologies, we did not perform a meta-analysis. Variation in the methodologies and probiotic preparations is thus identified as a major hindrance in comparing the outcome of different trials, making it difficult to conclude on the beneficial effect of probiotics in the treatment of BV and we recommend that this should be addressed in the design of future trials.</P>
<P>Methodological quality was inadequate in two studies (Eriksson 2005; Parent 1996). The randomization method was not adequately described and allocation concealment was not carried out in either study. Although described as a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial with parallel group design, there was no mention or description of blinding in Parent 1996. Although three studies (Anukam 2006a; Anukam 2006b; Eriksson 2005) did power calculations to determine sample size, in all the trials patients were lost to follow up leading to considerable possible attrition bias. It is therefore possible that the sample size of these included studies were ultimately not large enough to detect statistical significant differences between the treatment groups.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, for dichotomous outcomes, the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived for each study. This analysis of OR and CI for individual studies for the outcomes of microbiological cure was suggestive of a beneficial effect only for the augmentation of oral metronidazole with oral probiotics regimen (Anukam 2006a) and the probiotic/estriol regimen (Parent 1996). In addition, physician reported resolution also favoured the probiotic/estriol regimen (Parent 1996). However, for the resolution of symptoms as assessed by the patient, analysis of the data was not suggestive of a beneficial effect for the use of probiotics and the finding was similar irrespective of the routes of administration of the probiotic (oral, vaginal capsules or impregnated tampons), antibiotic use before/during the probiotic treatment or the type of probiotic preparation (single or cocktail, combined with estriol). In general, good tolerability and safety profiles were reported in all included studies. Analysis of OR which could only be carried for one study (Anukam 2006b) was suggestive of good tolerability: OR 0.08 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.49).</P>
<P>However, irrespective of the findings of the derived OR and 95% CI, it must be emphasized that a meta-analysis is still required to conclusively determine the beneficial effect and safety profile of probiotics in the treatment of BV. Thus we recommend large scale, well-designed clinical trials  which are standardized to address issues of differences in methodologies and probiotic preparations ensuring that strains which have been shown to colonize the vagina are used. The oral metronidazole/oral probiotic regimen appears promising, and we suggest further trials to investigate this treatment approach. The high incidence of recurrence is a major limitation associated with the use of antibiotics and should be evaluated as an important outcome if probiotics are to be considered successful for the treatment of BV. However none of the studies reported data on BV recurrence following probiotic use. In addition, as BV is associated with a number of gynaecological and obstetric complications, the effect of probiotics on such sequelae is an important secondary outcome. Unfortunately, this was not evaluated in any of the studies.</P>

<P>Not all the subjects for whom outcome measures were available received the treatment or placebo as allocated. The authors reported that 224 (87%) out of the 255 women allocated at the start of the study returned for follow up visit. Thirty patients were lost to follow up, and 38 more were excluded from the "per protocol analysis" due to violation of the protocol. Data for those excluded for protocol violation and drop outs were addressed. Intention-to-treat analysis was carried out for the microbiological cure which is a key study outcome</P>
