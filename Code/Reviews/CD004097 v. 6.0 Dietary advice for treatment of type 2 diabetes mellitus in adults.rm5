<P>No high quality data on the efficacy of diet alone exists for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This systematic review assesses the effects of studies that examined dietary advice with or without the addition of exercise or behavioural approaches. Eighteen studies were included. No data were found on micro- or macrovascular diabetic complications, mortality or quality of life. It is difficult to draw reliable conclusions from the limited data that are presented in this review, however, the addition of exercise to dietary advice showed improvement of metabolic control after six- and twelve-month follow-up.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>While initial dietary management immediately after formal diagnosis is an 'accepted' cornerstone of treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a formal and systematic overview of its efficacy and method of delivery is not currently available. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of type and frequency of different types of dietary advice for adults with type 2 diabetes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We carried out a comprehensive search of <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, bibliographies and contacted relevant experts.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled trials, of six months or longer, in which dietary advice was the main intervention.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The lead investigator performed all data extraction and quality scoring with duplication being carried out by one of the other six investigators independently with discrepancies resolved by discussion and consensus. Authors were contacted for missing data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty-six articles reporting a total of eighteen trials following 1467 participants were included. Dietary approaches assessed in this review were low-fat/high-carbohydrate diets, high-fat/low-carbohydrate diets, low-calorie (1000 kcal per day) and very-low-calorie (500 kcal per day) diets and modified fat diets. Two trials compared the American Diabetes Association exchange diet with a standard reduced fat diet and five studies assessed low-fat diets versus moderate fat or low-carbohydrate diets. Two studies assessed the effect of a very-low-calorie diet versus a low-calorie diet. Six studies compared dietary advice with dietary advice plus exercise and three other studies assessed dietary advice versus dietary advice plus behavioural approaches. The studies all measured weight and measures of glycaemic control although not all studies reported these in the articles published. Other outcomes which were measured in these studies included mortality, blood pressure, serum cholesterol (including LDL and HDL cholesterol), serum triglycerides, maximal exercise capacity and compliance. The results suggest that adoption of regular exercise is a good way to promote better glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients, however all of these studies were at high risk of bias.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There are no high quality data on the efficacy of the dietary treatment of type 2 diabetes, however the data available indicate that the adoption of exercise appears to improve glycated haemoglobin at six and twelve months in people with type 2 diabetes. There is an urgent need for well-designed studies which examine a range of interventions, at various points during follow-up, although there is a promising study currently underway. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-27 13:36:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (i.e. elevated levels of plasma glucose)<BR/>with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group on the Cochrane<BR/>Library (see 'About the Cochrane Collaboration', 'Collaborative Review Groups'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main Glossary on the Cochrane Library. There is now unequivocal evidence that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or at least delayed by dietary effort, generally resulting in weight loss and increased physical activity in those at high risk of progressing to diabetes. Risk of such progression was decreased by over half in the two major trials to date (<LINK REF="REF-Tuomilehto-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuomilehto 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DPP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DPP 2002</LINK>). The United States Diabetes Prevention Program reported a 58% reduction in the incidence of diabetes when participants were treated with the lifestyle intervention compared with a 31% reduction of incidence of diabetes for the metformin-treated participants, (<LINK REF="REF-DPP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DPP 2002</LINK>). However the role and type of dietary advice following diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, how often thereafter and its efficacy during longer-term follow-up over subsequent years is much less clear. It may be that using different methods of helping people to learn the principles behind these diets, and different patterns of support and follow-up, could have effects on long term adherence.<BR/>This Cochrane review aims to establish the evidence that exists on what kind of dietary advice is effective in treating type 2 diabetes.<BR/>There are an estimated 2.35m people with diabetes in England, with up to another 750,000 undiagnosed cases and this is predicted to grow to more than 2.5m by 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-website" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH website</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Diabetes-UK-website" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diabetes UK website</LINK>).<BR/>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the more common of the two main types and accounts for between 85 - 95% of all diabetic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Diabetes-UK-website" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diabetes UK website</LINK>). In the United Kingdom alone, treatment of type 2 diabetes costs around £1.8 billion per annum (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2000</LINK>).<BR/>It has been recommended for many years that people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes should be<BR/>treated with diet, and in those overweight to achieve weight loss and, independently, to lower blood glucose (glycaemia). On average, there is a 9% relative increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes, for every 1kg weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Mokdad-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mokdad 2000</LINK>). Eighty to ninety percent of type 2 diabetics are obese (BMI &gt;30kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>) (<LINK REF="REF-Wing-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 2000</LINK>) and obesity worsens the metabolic and physiologic abnormalities associated with diabetes, particularly hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension (<LINK REF="STD-Maggio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Maggio 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wing-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wing 2000</LINK>). Initiation of medication becomes necessary in addition to diet and exercise when the latter alone fail to control glycaemia adequately, (<LINK REF="REF-Nathan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathan 1999</LINK>). While short-term benefits are assumed, attempting to treat type 2 diabetes using diet alone is not a particularly successful long-term intervention, as illustrated by the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 1998b</LINK>). This study showed that after three years of regularly reinforcing dietary advice in those randomised to the 'diet alone' arm, only 20% of patients, and after nine years only 8%, maintained the target fasting plasma glucose of less than 7.8 mmol/L, (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1999</LINK>). Part of the uncertainty in this field is whether the dietary and other non-pharmacological measures actually 'fail' or whether patients themselves fail to continue implementing them adequately. Despite this, diet is usually the first treatment implemented on diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and is maintained throughout the addition of other interventions.<BR/>Some observational studies have shown that exercise may have an additional benefit for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, possibly through lowering body fat and reducing blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Wallberg_x002d_H.-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallberg-H. 1998</LINK>), and several studies have produced some compelling evidence to show that regular physical exercise can serve to protect and decrease severity of type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Frisch-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frisch 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dowse-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dowse 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manson-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manson 1992a</LINK>). The review by Thomas et al, 2006, found that exercise improves blood glucose control and that this effect is evident even without weight loss (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Diets commonly used to control blood glucose levels include low fat and high unrefined carbohydrate, (those which take around 25-30% of energy from fat and around 50% of the total energy from unrefined carbohydrate), or low glycaemic index diets (foods that have a low glycaemic index include pasta products, oats, beans and some fruits and vegetables) usually both in combination with weight reducing advice. Recently, research has also looked into the effect of individual macro- and micro-nutrients such as fibre, chromium, and so called 'functional foods', but much of this evidence seems to be incomplete, with relatively few intervention trials carried out long-term (<LINK REF="STD-Riccardi-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Riccardi 2005</LINK>). Similar diets may be of value in those with metabolic syndrome in preventing or delaying progression to frank diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Riccardi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riccardi 2000</LINK>). Given the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the potentially serious outcomes of the disease, it is important to establish which type of diet, either alone or in combination with other interventions (the addition of exercise, behavioural approaches and alternative treatments), is most effective.</P>
<P>
<B>This Review</B>
<BR/>This review is a 2007 update of the initial (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2004</LINK>) review. It aimed to provide an update of evidence from studies which have employed a study design which sought to examine the effect of dietary advice and interventions to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus in the adult population.<BR/>Although no additional included studies were identified, the review referenced further relevant background research and excluded studies, and has generated a QUOROM (quality of reporting of meta-analyses) flow-chart of study selection.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-10-27 13:37:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effects of type and frequency of dietary advice to all adults (overweight and normal weight) with type 2 diabetes on morbidity, quality of life, total mortality, weight and measures of diabetic control, using all available randomised clinical trials and meta-analytic techniques where appropriate. The primary objectives were to assess:</P>
<P>a) the effects of different types of dietary advice through weight change, and development of micro- and macro- vascular complications in people with type 2 diabetes, and<BR/>b) the effects of dietary advice plus other lifestyle interventions (i.e. the addition of exercise, behavioural approaches and alternative therapies to dietary advice) through weight change, and development of micro- and macro-vascular complications in people with type 2 diabetes.</P>
<P>
<B>Management of hits</B>
<BR/>We prepared a QUOROM (quality of reporting of meta-analyses) flow-chart of study selection to describe how we processed the references identified through our searches.<BR/>The hits identified from the searches of the electronic databases [Medline (492), AMED (2), CINAHL (87) , Cochrane Library (16) and EMBASE (1,110)] were combined (n = 1,707) and de-duplicated (n = 1,413).<BR/>These hit lists were then de-duplicated against the hits of the previous version of this review. The reduced list of hits was then screened on titles and abstracts (LN).</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All randomised controlled clinical trials of interventions that involved patients for at least six months were included. Randomisation of individuals or clusters of individuals were accepted.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>All studies had to include adult participants (those who were 18 years or older), who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. To be consistent with changes that have occurred over time in the classification and diagnostic criteria of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the diagnosis of diabetes should have been established using the standard criteria valid at the time of the beginning of the trial. Ideally, the diagnostic criterion was described in the article. Diagnostic criteria used included those described by the National Diabetes Data Group standards (<LINK REF="REF-NDDG-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">NDDG 1979</LINK>), the World Health Organisation standards, (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>), and the American Diabetes Association Standards, (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ADA-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 1999</LINK>). Studies performed on participants suffering from impaired glucose tolerance were not included in this review. Where a study reported combined results for participants with type 2 diabetes and participants with impaired glucose tolerance, then efforts were made to contact the authors of the study to obtain individual patient data. Where this was unsuccessful, the trial was excluded. In the protocol for this review we omitted to state how a study looking at a mixture of type 1 and type 2 diabetic participants would be dealt with. We decided that unless a majority of the participants (i.e. 90% or more) were classified as having type 2 diabetes, or the author of the paper could provide the data for the type 2 diabetic participants only, the trial was excluded. <BR/>Participants could be of either sex, but those who were acutely ill or pregnant were excluded. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Studies where the intervention was dietary advice with an aim of reducing weight and the severity of type 2 diabetes were included in the review. Dietary advice is taken to mean advice given with the intention of improving dietary habits (i.e. to either produce weight loss or to change diet composition). Studies were not included if they included medication that was provided differently in the control and intervention groups. Studies evaluating the effects of fish oils (omega-3) advice or supplementation on type 2 diabetes mellitus were excluded as this had previously been addressed in a recent Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Farmer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farmer 2001</LINK>). Studies looking at the effects of Chinese medical herbs on type 2 diabetes mellitus were also excluded as these are addressed by another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2002</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two reviewers undertook assessment of results data independently. Results data were assessed by the lead reviewer (LN) and duplicated by one of the co-reviewers (HM, CS, VW, LH, KC and AV). Information on a number of measures of methodological quality of the included studies was assessed independently by two reviewers; study design, method of allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment and drop out rates. Where there was uncertainty, authors were contacted to clarify aspects of study design. Differences between reviewers' extraction results were resolved by discussion. Multiple publications were collated and assessed as one study.</P>
<P>In the first instance, relevant studies were determined from the initial search of electronic databases, and then through screening by the lead reviewer (LN). Articles were rejected during this initial screening if the reviewer could determine from the title and/or abstract that it did not meet the inclusion criteria, if rejection was not possible, full text copies were retrieved. For the 2007 update, full text copies of 68 papers were retrieved and assessed independently by two reviewers (LN plus one other from HM, CS, VW, LH, KC and AV) using an inclusion/exclusion form. Inter-rater agreement (using Cohen's kappa (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1960</LINK>)) was good with all of the reviewers achieving kappa scores of 0.7 or greater in the first review (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2004</LINK>), Inter-rater agreement of this review achieved a value of 1.0 (using Cohen's kappa). Thirty-six of the original 287 retrieved papers were included in this review, which reported a total of eighteen studies. In the update, none of the sixty-eight papers were thought to fit the inclusion criteria, so no new papers were added. Where full text copies of articles were retrieved, but then were judged to not meet the inclusion criteria, the reasons were reported in the excluded studies table. </P>

<P>Two reviewers (the lead reviewer (LN) plus one other from HM, CS, VW, LH, KC and AV) independently extracted data from each study using a data extraction form based on the one<BR/>provided by the Metabolism and Endocrine Disorders Review Group. Differences between reviewers' extraction results were resolved by discussion, and where necessary, in consultation with a third reviewer. Data concerning participants, interventions, and outcomes, as described above in the selection criteria section, were extracted. Trial quality characteristics, including method of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors and losses to follow-up, were extracted onto this form. In addition, data were collected on potential effect modifiers including age, presence of diabetic micro or macrovascular disease, blood pressure, lipids, bodyweight, mortality and current use of diabetic medication.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-10-19 15:46:53 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The quality of each trial was assessed based largely on the quality criteria specified by Jadad and Schulz (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). In particular the following factors were assessed:<BR/>1. Minimisation of selection bias - score: 0 or 1 or 2.<BR/>One point was given if the study could be described as randomized (which included the use of words such as 'random', 'randomly' and 'randomisation').<BR/>One additional point was given if the study described the method of randomisation and was an appropriate method.<BR/>One point was taken away if the study described the method of randomisation, but was an inappropriate method.<BR/>2. Minimisation of detection bias - score: 0 or 1 or 2.<BR/>One point was given if the study could be described as blinded (in any capacity).<BR/>One additional point was given if the method of blinding was described and was appropriate.<BR/>One point was taken away if the method was described as blinding but was inappropriate.<BR/>3. Minimisation of attrition bias - score: 0 or 1.<BR/>One point was given if the withdrawals and dropouts from the study were described.<BR/>We did not score on performance bias.<BR/>Based on these criteria, studies were broadly subdivided into the following three categories (see Cochrane Handbook):<BR/>A - all quality criteria met: low risk of bias. (Studies with scores of four and five points (and with at least one point allocated from each section) were allocated to this category.)<BR/>B - one or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate risk of bias. (Studies with scores of three points (and with at least one point in each section) were allocated to this category.)<BR/>C - one or more criteria not met: high risk of bias. (Studies with scores of zero, one, two and three points were allocated to this category. (i.e. studies with no points in at least one section))<BR/>These subdivisions of the studies were not used as the basis of a sensitivity analysis, as the included studies received similar quality scores, (between one and three points). These quality scores and categories are reported in the 'characteristics of included studies' table.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Studies</HEADING>
<P>Wide ranges of dietary approaches were examined in this review. Within the studies that compared two types of diabetic dietary advice that did not differ in intent to lose weight, there were three distinct groups; those studies that used exchange diets versus those that did not use exchange diets, (<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1990</LINK>), those studies that used low-fat versus moderate fat or low-carbohydrate diets, (<LINK REF="STD-de-Bont-1981" TYPE="STUDY">de Bont 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hockaday-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hockaday 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milne-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Milne 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pascale-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pascale 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsihlias-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tsihlias 2000</LINK>), or very-low-calorie diets versus low-calorie diets, (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wing-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>From the studies that assessed dietary advice versus dietary advice plus exercise, it was seen that the types of exercise examined in the studies that are contributing to the review included various forms of aerobic exercise, (in general participants chose their exercise from suggestions that included walking, jogging, swimming, ball games or skiing).</P>
<P>There were similar interventions included within the grouping for dietary advice versus dietary advice plus behavioural approaches. Generally, the mode of imparting the dietary advice was what was changed in these interventions; either through a touch-screen method, (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1997</LINK>), or through community resources, (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keyserling-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Keyserling 2000</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Thirty-six articles reporting a total of eighteen trials following 1467 participants were included. There were 724 participants in the control groups, and 743 participants in the intervention groups included in this review. The samples used in the trials were generally representative of the overall diabetic population. Diagnostic criteria for the trials in this review included physician confirmed diabetic status, type 2 diabetes classified according to the National Diabetes Data Group, (<LINK REF="REF-NDDG-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">NDDG 1979</LINK>), and diabetes mellitus as defined by the World Health Organisation, (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1985</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The participants in the trial run by Campbell, (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1990</LINK>), were randomised to one of two groups, to a typical portion exchange diet or to a reduced fat (focusing on reducing fat) diet. de Bont conducted a trial of a low-fat diet versus a low-carbohydrate diet, (<LINK REF="STD-de-Bont-1981" TYPE="STUDY">de Bont 1981</LINK>). The Gallagher study, (<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1987</LINK>), evaluated the usual American Diabetic Association exchange diet (40% carbohydrate, 40% fat and 20% protein) compared to a reduced fat diet, which was based upon the four basic food groups, (see Results section for more details). Hockaday conducted a trial where participants were randomised to either a low-carbohydrate or a low-fat diet, (<LINK REF="STD-Hockaday-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hockaday 1986</LINK>). Milne randomised the participants into groups that either followed a low-carbohydrate or a low-fat diet, (<LINK REF="STD-Milne-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Milne 1994</LINK>). Pascale described a trial that randomised the participants to follow either a calorie restricted diet or a calorie restricted and low-fat diet (less than 20% of energy to come from fat), (<LINK REF="STD-Pascale-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pascale 1995</LINK>). The participants in the Tsihlias trial, (<LINK REF="STD-Tsihlias-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tsihlias 2000</LINK>), were randomised to receive either a low-fat or a monounsaturated fat diet.</P>
<P>The participants in the trial described by Wing were randomised to either a balanced low-calorie diet (1000-1200 kcal per day) or a balanced low-calorie diet with two periods of twelve weeks of a very-low-calorie diet (of 400-500 kcal per day), (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1994</LINK>). Another trial by Wing<I>,</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1991</LINK>), randomised the participants to either a low-calorie yet balanced diet (with a calorie goal of ~1000 to 1500 kcal per day) or to a low-calorie (balanced) diet with a period of very-low-calorie diet (~500 kcal per day) added for eight weeks.</P>
<P>The study conducted by Agurs-Collins randomised participants to either a 'usual care' group or a 'usual diet with exercise' group, (<LINK REF="STD-Agurs_x002d_Collins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Agurs-Collins 1997</LINK>). In the study conducted by Uusitupa and colleagues, (<LINK REF="STD-Uusitupa-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Uusitupa 1996</LINK>), participants were randomised to either a standard dietary treatment group or a diet and exercise group. The trial by Ligtenberg randomised the participants to either continue with their usual diet or to receive their usual diet plus physical training instructions, (<LINK REF="STD-Ligtenberg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ligtenberg 1997</LINK>). Samaras randomly assigned participants to receive either their usual diet or to receive their usual diet plus a structured exercise programme, (<LINK REF="STD-Samaras-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Samaras 1997</LINK>). The participants in the Kaplan, (<LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 1986</LINK>), trial were randomly allocated to either weekly sessions of diet education, which focused on promoting a low-fat (30% of total energy), high carbohydrate (55% of total energy) or to weekly sessions of diet and exercise education. Wing conducted a trial which randomised participants to either a diet only group or a diet plus exercise group, (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Glasgow conducted a trial that randomised the participants to either receive usual care or usual care plus the brief intervention added in, (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1997</LINK>). Another trial by Glasgow<I>, </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 2000</LINK>), randomly assigned its participants to receive either a basic intervention (received information about low-fat eating) or the community resources intervention. The trial conducted by Keyserling randomised the participants to receive either a clinic-based intervention or a clinic-based intervention plus community intervention, (<LINK REF="STD-Keyserling-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Keyserling 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>Weight was generally well reported, whereas development of micro and macrovascular diabetic complications was only reported in one trial, (<LINK REF="STD-Hockaday-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hockaday 1986</LINK>), and even here, this was only a brief description.</P>
<P>The secondary outcome measures that we intended to look at were:</P>
<P>1. Quality of life (ideally, measured using a validated instrument),<BR/>2. Change in anti-diabetic medication use (as an indicator of improving or worsening diabetic control),<BR/>3. Overall cardiovascular disease risk assessment (using any of the scales which include at least three risk factors),<BR/>4. Mortality,<BR/>5. Glycated haemoglobin,<BR/>6. Serum cholesterol (LDL and/or HDL) and serum triglycerides,<BR/>7. Maximal exercise capacity (VO<SUB>2 </SUB>max),<BR/>8. Blood pressure,<BR/>9. Compliance.</P>
<P>These additional outcome measures were reported with varying degrees of comprehensiveness. Measures of quality of life and cardiovascular disease risk assessment were not reported in any studies. Change in anti-diabetic medication and maximal exercise capacity were measured and reported in a few trials, although they used different outcome measures. Mortality was briefly reported in a few trials (<LINK REF="STD-de-Bont-1981" TYPE="STUDY">de Bont 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milne-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Milne 1994</LINK>) although details of cause of death were not often disclosed. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides and blood pressure were reported in some trials, although generally only the means (and not their associated standard deviations or standard errors) were reported. Glycated haemoglobin was recorded by nearly all trials and compliance was recorded by some trials, usually in the form of three day food diaries, and although generally not reported in any way, a few studies did report that 'compliance was generally good' (<LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaras-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Samaras 1997</LINK>).</P>

However, there were seven studies that did describe the drop-outs and withdrawals to an acceptable degree, (<LINK REF="STD-de-Bont-1981" TYPE="STUDY">de Bont 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hockaday-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hockaday 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wing-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milne-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Milne 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pascale-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pascale 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keyserling-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Keyserling 2000</LINK>) and these studies all received a point to add to their quality scores. Eleven studies reported follow-up data of more than 80% of the baseline sample, (<LINK REF="STD-de-Bont-1981" TYPE="STUDY">de Bont 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hockaday-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hockaday 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wing-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milne-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Milne 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pascale-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pascale 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ligtenberg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ligtenberg 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaras-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Samaras 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keyserling-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Keyserling 2000</LINK>). A number of studies reported higher drop-out rates; 30% at twelve months (<LINK REF="STD-Pascale-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pascale 1995</LINK>), 32% at six months (<LINK REF="STD-Tsihlias-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tsihlias 2000</LINK>), 40% at six months and 44% at twelve months (<LINK REF="STD-Keyserling-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Keyserling 2000</LINK>). The study reported by Hockaday (<LINK REF="STD-Hockaday-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hockaday 1986</LINK>) assessed subsections of the initial study population, so analysis of attrition bias was not appropriate. Two other studies did not describe attrition at all (<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1997</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Allocation concealment to intervention or control was unclear in all but one, (<LINK REF="STD-Hockaday-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hockaday 1986</LINK>), of the eighteen studies. In the published article, allocation concealment was unclear, but as a result of a personal communication from Dr Hockaday, this was then revised to 'adequate'.</P>
<P>The source of funding for more than half of the included studies (12 out of 18) was stated in the published papers. Generally, the funding came from national sources so conflicts of interests were avoided (i.e. operators/providers of treatment/intervention) were not paying for the study to be carried out.</P>

<BR/>A fixed effects model was used to analyse these data. Significant heterogeneity was found within the studies included in category 3.02 (I<SUP>2</SUP> value of 56.8%, a chi<SUP>2</SUP> value of 4.63 with 2 degrees of freedom and a P-value of 0.10, (when analysed using a random effects model, these values remained the same)). Although in usual circumstances we would take this P-value to be an indicator of significance, we believe that this meta-analysis may have been affected by the large difference between the endpoint data for the two groups in the Samaras trial, (<LINK REF="STD-Samaras-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Samaras 1997</LINK>). Although the participants in this trial were randomly allocated to one of two groups, at baseline the mean weight of the control group was 15kg more than the intervention group, and therefore when we looked at endpoint data, even though the participants in both groups had actually gained a small amount of weight, there was still a large difference between the control, (mean weight at twelve months was 99.0kg) and intervention groups, (mean weight at twelve months was 83.1kg), which suggested that the intervention was particularly successful, when indeed this could not be concluded from the change data provided. The studies included within category 3.03 were not heterogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> value of 34.1% and a P-value of 0.21), and showed a statistically significant change in glycated haemoglobin in favour of the addition of exercise to dietary advice. The studies included within category 3.04 were not heterogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP> value of 0% and chi<SUP>2</SUP> value of 0.16 with 2 degrees of freedom and had a P-value of 0.92) and showed a statistically significant change in glycated haemoglobin in favour of the addition of exercise to dietary advice.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparison 01: Two types of diabetic dietary advice that did not differ in intent to lose weight</HEADING>
<P>Nine studies assessed two types of diabetic dietary advice that did not differ in intent to lose weight (dietary advice versus another form of dietary advice).</P>
<P>Campbell randomised 70 participants to one of two groups, usual diet or a reduced fat diet, (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1990</LINK>). Usual diet was a typical portion exchange diet where caloric restriction was discussed. The intervention diet focused only on reducing fat. Change in weight was not reported in the paper using kilograms but through Body Mass Index. Body Mass Index decreased in the intervention group from 30.4 ± 4.8kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> at baseline to 29.6 ± 4.6kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> at six months compared to 32.0 ± 5.5kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> at baseline to 31.1 ± 5.1kg/m<SUP>2 </SUP>at the six month follow-up. Glycated haemoglobin was not reported in the paper.</P>
<P>de Bont conducted a trial of a low-fat diet versus a low-carbohydrate diet, (<LINK REF="STD-de-Bont-1981" TYPE="STUDY">de Bont 1981</LINK>). One hundred and forty eight type 2 diabetic participants were randomised and 136 were followed up six months later. The primary outcome of the study was body weight, although this was reported separately for obese and non-obese participants. Weight in the obese participants decreased from 84.2kg at baseline to 81.5kg at six months, and in the non-obese participants weight decreased from 60.1kg to 59.7kg, which represents a decrease of 2.7kg for the obese participants and of 0.4kg for the non-obese participants in the low-fat diet. This was compared to the group following the low-carbohydrate diet where the subset of obese participants went from a baseline weight of 84.8kg to 83.9kg at six months, which was a decrease of 0.9kg; the non-obese participants began the trial with a mean weight of 59.0kg which by the end of six months had risen to 59.1kg, a rise of 0.1kg. Glycated haemoglobin was reported for all participants, and at baseline was 10.0% and decreased to 9.3% in the low-fat diet group at six months, whereas glycated haemoglobin was 10.1% at baseline and decreased to 9.5% in the low-carbohydrate group at six months. (Although mean changes were reported, the associated standard deviations/errors were not.)</P>
<P>The papers describing the Gallagher study, (<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1987</LINK>), evaluated the American Diabetic Association exchange diet (40% carbohydrate, 40% fat and 20% protein) compared to a reduced fat diet, which was based upon the four basic food groups (which are: 1) fruits and vegetables, 2) whole grains, cereals, and bread, 3) dairy products, 4) meats, fish, poultry, eggs, dried beans, and nuts). Fifty-one male type 2 diabetic participants were randomised to one of the two groups. Weight and glycated haemoglobin was measured but not reported in the published articles. Attempts at personal communication with the authors proved to be unsuccessful.</P>
<P>Hockaday conducted a trial of 250 diabetic participants who were randomised to either a low-carbohydrate or a low-fat diet, (<LINK REF="STD-Hockaday-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hockaday 1986</LINK>). However only subgroups of this trial have been reported in press. In the Hockaday study, the biggest subgroup of the trial was reported which was made up of 93 participants; 39 participants in the low-carbohydrate group and 54 participants in the low-fat group. Between baseline and one year, participants in the low-carbohydrate group had a mean weight loss of 3.8kg compared to a mean weight loss of 4.6kg in the low-fat diet group. (Although mean weight change was reported, the associated standard deviations/errors were not.) Changes in glycated haemoglobin were measured but not reported, although 'changes in glycated haemoglobin were not significant'.</P>
<P>Milne randomised 44 participants into either a low-carbohydrate or a low-fat diet, (<LINK REF="STD-Milne-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Milne 1994</LINK>). At baseline, participants had a mean weight of 83.1 ± 16.9kg and 80.8 ± 7.8kg for the low-carbohydrate and the low-fat diet groups respectively. At follow-up six months later, mean weight of the low-carbohydrate group had decreased to 82.1 ± 15.0kg (a decrease of 1.0kg) and the low-fat group mean weight had decreased to 80.7 ± 7.8kg (a decrease of 0.1kg). At the 18 month follow-up the mean weight of the low-carbohydrate group had remained stable at 82.1 ± 15.0kg and the low-fat group mean weight had also remained stable at 80.7 ± 13.8kg. Glycated haemoglobin decreased in the low-fat group from a baseline value of 9.8 ± 3.1% to 9.5 ± 2.6% at six months and then rose to 9.7 ± 2.6% at 18 months (an overall decrease of 0.1%) and a decrease in the low-carbohydrate group from a baseline measurement of 8.7 ± 2.3% to 8.5 ± 2.0% at six months and then remained stable at 8.5 ± 2% at the 18 month follow-up (an overall decrease of 0.2%).</P>
<P>Pascale described a trial that randomised 44 participants to follow either a calorie restricted diet (1000-1500 kcal per day) or a calorie restricted and low-fat diet (1000-1500 kcal per day, but less than 20% of energy to come from fat), (<LINK REF="STD-Pascale-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pascale 1995</LINK>). Thirty-one participants were followed up (16 in the calorie restricted group and 15 in the calorie restricted and low-fat diet group) one year from baseline. Participants in the calorie restricted diet group decreased their mean weight one year later by 0.96 ± 3.7kg from a baseline measurement of 93.1 ± 13.0kg, compared to the calorie restricted and low-fat diet who decreased their mean weight one year later by 5.2 ± 7.3kg from the baseline measurement of 94.4 ± 9.5kg. At the twelve month follow-up, glycated haemoglobin levels rose in the calorie restricted diet group by 0.2 ± 1.7% (from 10.9% ± 2.7% at baseline). In contrast, at twelve months in the calorie restricted and low-fat diet group, the mean glycated haemoglobin levels remained the same (10.4 ± 1.9% at baseline with a change of 0.0 ± 1.9% at the one year follow-up).</P>
<P>In the study reported by Tsihlias, (<LINK REF="STD-Tsihlias-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tsihlias 2000</LINK>), 61 participants were randomised to receive either the low-fat (high-carbohydrate) or the monounsaturated fat diet; six months later 41 participants were followed up. The participants in the monounsaturated fat diet had an overall weight gain of 0.1kg over the six month period (from 78.8 ± 12.5kg at baseline to 78.9 ± 13.0kg at six months), compared with the participants in the low-fat diet group who lost an overall weight of 1.2kg over the six month period (from 77.4 ± 14.7kg at baseline to 76.2 ± 13.8kg at six months). There were 'no significant changes in glycaemic control' during the study period. Glycated haemoglobin data were obtained through a personal communication from Dr Wolever, and at baseline the monounsaturated fat diet group had a measurement of 7.7 ± 1.1%, which rose to 8.1 ± 1.5% at follow-up six months later. The participants in the low-fat (high carbohydrate) diet group at baseline had a blood glycated haemoglobin concentration of 8.1 ± 1.2%, which rose to 8.3 ± 1.5% at the six months follow-up.</P>
<P>As mentioned previously, there are three distinct groups that the above studies can be assigned to, (two groups are assessed here, the third (very-low-calorie diets versus low-calorie diets) is discussed in the next section). Clinical similarity, the decision to pool or not, study quality and an overview of the primary and secondary results will be discussed for each.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">(a) Studies that assessed exchange diets versus not using an exchange diet</HEADING>
<P>In both of these two studies, (<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1990</LINK>), the American Diabetes Association exchange diet was compared with a standard reduced fat diet. The two trials recruited similar participants, (the only difference being that the Gallagher trial recruited solely male participants and the Campbell trial had mixed participation). The quality of the these two studies were assessed to be at high risk of being biased. Weight change was measured in the Gallagher study, where 9% of the intervention group lost weight compared to 25% of the control group losing weight, although no hard data were reported. Development of micro and macrovascular diabetic complications were not reported. Body Mass Index (as a measure of weight) was reported in the Campbell study, and the intervention group lost an average 0.8kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> compared to 0.9kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>. Both studies measured, but did not report change in glycated haemoglobin.</P>
<P>These studies were clinically similar to permit pooling, but with only two studies in this category, pooling of the data was not possible. There were a total of 121 participants in this comparison grouping, where the quality of the trials was judged to be at high risk of being biased. No firm conclusions could be drawn from this comparison.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(b) Studies that assessed low-fat diets versus moderate fat or low-carbohydrate diets</HEADING>
<P>In these five studies, (<LINK REF="STD-de-Bont-1981" TYPE="STUDY">de Bont 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hockaday-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hockaday 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milne-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Milne 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pascale-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pascale 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsihlias-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Tsihlias 2000</LINK>), a low-fat diet was compared with either a moderate fat or a low-carbohydrate (although not necessarily mutually exclusive) diet. The trials recruited similar participants (with regards to age and sex). The quality of the trials were assessed, and five out of the six trials were assessed to be at a high risk of bias, and the other trial was assessed at a moderate risk of bias. Weight change was measured in all of the studies and in general more weight was lost in those groups that were following a low-fat diet. Development of micro and macrovascular diabetic complications were reported in one trial, (<LINK REF="STD-Hockaday-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hockaday 1986</LINK>), although not in great detail, and these outcome measures were not reported in the other five trials. Glycated haemoglobin was reported, but there were only marginal changes in the trials, so no firm conclusions could be drawn from this.</P>
<P>All of these studies were clinically similar enough to permit pooling, but there were only two studies at six months which had data that could be pooled, (two of the other trials reported means without their associated standard deviations, (<LINK REF="STD-de-Bont-1981" TYPE="STUDY">de Bont 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hockaday-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hockaday 1986</LINK>)), and one reported change data, (<LINK REF="STD-Pascale-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pascale 1995</LINK>) therefore it was not possible to look at the statistical heterogeneity in this comparison. There were a total of 378 participants in this comparison grouping, where generally the quality of the trials was judged to be at high risk of being biased. Conclusions could not be drawn from this comparison.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparison 02: very-low-calorie Dietary Advice versus Another Form of Dietary Advice</HEADING>
<P>Two studies assessed very-low-calorie dietary advice versus another form of dietary advice (low-calorie diet).</P>
<P>Wing described a study in which 93 participants were randomised to either a balanced low-calorie diet (1000-1200 kcal per day) or a balanced low-calorie diet with two periods of twelve weeks of a very-low-calorie diet (of 400-500 kcal per day), (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1994</LINK>). Glycated haemoglobin was reported at 6 and 12 months, whereas weight was only reported at 12 months. Glycated haemoglobin for the low-calorie diet group was 10.5 ± 2.0% at baseline, decreasing to 8.8 ± 1.8% at six months, which rose to 9.2 ± 2.0% at twelve months and then rose again to 10.7 ± 2.4% at twenty-four months, compared to 10.4 ± 2.0% at baseline, a decrease to 8.4 ± 2.2% at six months, and then a slight rise to 8.9 ± 2.5% at twelve months and a greater rise to 10.4 ± 2.2% at twenty-four months for the very-low-calorie diet group. Mean body weight for the low-calorie diet group at baseline was 107.7 ± 18.7kg, which rose to 118.2 ± 11.6kg at twelve months, whereas participants in the very-low-calorie diet group had a mean baseline weight of 105.8 ± 19.4kg, which decreased to 91.6 ± 10.3kg at twelve months.</P>
<P>Wing randomised 36 people to either a low-calorie yet balanced diet (with a calorie goal of ~1000 to 1500 kcal per day) or to a low-calorie (balanced) diet with a period of very-low-calorie diet (~500 kcal per day) added for eight weeks, (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1991</LINK>). At baseline, the low-calorie group had a mean weight of 104.5 ± 21.5kg and at follow-up twelve months later their mean weight had dropped to 97.7 ± 17.4kg, compared with the very-low-calorie diet group who at baseline had a mean weight of 102.1 ± 11.7kg and twelve months later had a mean weight of 93.5 ± 10.4kg. Both groups lost a significant amount of weight and weight loss was not improved by use of a very-low-calorie diet. Glycated haemoglobin was 10.4 ± 2.0% at baseline, which rose to 11.8 ± 2.7% at twelve months for the low-calorie group compared with a baseline glycated haemoglobin concentration of 10.4 ± 2.2%, which decreased to 9.2 ± 2.1% at the twelve month follow-up for the very-low-calorie group. The changes in glycated haemoglobin were statistically significant in both groups.</P>
<P>Both studies, (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wing-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1994</LINK>), assessed the effects of a very-low-calorie diet against the effects of a low-calorie diet. The quality of these trials was judged to be at high risk of bias. Weight change was measured and reported and more weight was lost in the very-low-calorie diet groups at twelve months, although in the first trial, (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1994</LINK>), at twenty four months more weight loss was recorded in the low-calorie diet group. Development of micro and macrovascular complications were not reported in these studies. Glycated haemoglobin was recorded and reported, at twelve months there was a greater decrease in glycated haemoglobin in the very-low-calorie dietary advice group, compared with the very-low-calorie dietary advice group, however there was very little change from baseline to twenty-four months in either group.</P>
<P>The two studies were clinically similar enough to permit pooling, but as there were only two studies, it was not statistically possible to carry out an analysis on the heterogeneity of the data. One hundred and twenty-nine participants took part in these two trials and overall the trial quality was assessed to be at high risk of bias. The evidence suggests that longer term (twenty-four months) weight loss and glycaemic control is best achieved by low-calorie dietary advice, compared with the very-low-calorie dietary advice, although once again, the high potential for bias should be considered, and no firm conclusions could be drawn from this data.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparison 03: Dietary Advice versus Dietary Advice plus Exercise</HEADING>
<P>Six studies compared interventions that examined the effect of dietary advice alone or dietary advice plus exercise on participants with type 2 diabetes.</P>
<P>Agurs-Collins randomised 64 participants to either a 'usual care' group or a 'usual diet with exercise' group, (<LINK REF="STD-Agurs_x002d_Collins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Agurs-Collins 1997</LINK>). Published details of the usual care control were brief; participants in this group attended a class that discussed methods of glycaemic control and they also received two mailings of nutrition information. Participants in the intervention arm (the diet plus exercise group) were advised to adhere to a diet that had ~55% of kcal from carbohydrate, 20% from protein and less than 30% from fat. The exercise component consisted of a five minute warm up, 20 minutes of low-impact aerobic activity and 5 minutes of cool-down exercises and was carried out three times a week. Participants were also encouraged to exercise on their own twice more per week. At the end of the trial period, (i.e. six months later) participants in the usual care group had gained a mean weight of 2.0kg, (from 94.9 ± 20.1kg at baseline to 96.9 ± 21.6kg at the six month follow-up) compared to the participants in the diet plus exercise group who lost a mean weight of 2.6kg (from a baseline measurement of 93.3 ± 18.6kg to the six month follow-up value of 90.7 ± 20.1kg). Concentration of glycated haemoglobin in the usual care group rose over the six month period from a mean of 10.0 ± 1.9% to 11.5 ± 4.4%, compared to the diet plus exercise group whose mean glycated haemoglobin concentration decreased from 11.0 ± 1.7% to 9.9 ± 2.0% over the six month period.</P>
<P>In the study conducted by Uusitupa and colleagues, (<LINK REF="STD-Uusitupa-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Uusitupa 1996</LINK>), 86 participants were randomised to either a standard dietary treatment group or a diet and exercise group. Standard dietary treatment consisted of reduced energy intake with emphasis on reducing intake of total fat and cholesterol. In the diet only group the mean weight changed from 92.2 ± 14.7kg at baseline to a measurement of 90.2 ± 14.3kg at the follow-up appointment at twelve months (which equates to a loss of 2.0 ± 11.4kg), compared to a weight change of 91.6 ± 14.5kg at baseline to a measurement of 86.5 ± 13.7kg at follow-up at twelve months (a loss of 5.1 ± 11.1kg) in the diet plus exercise group. Over the twelve months between baseline and follow-up, blood concentration of glycated haemoglobin decreased by 0.3 ± 1.5% in the diet only group (from 7.8 ± 2.0% at baseline to 7.5 ± 1.7% at twelve months) and by 0.5 ± 1.3% in the diet plus exercise group, (from 7.1 ± 1.8% at baseline to 6.6 ± 1.6% at twelve months).</P>
<P>Ligtenberg describes a study that randomised 58 participants to either continue with their usual diet or to receive physical training instructions for six weeks and then to continue training (with encouragement) at home for a following six weeks with a further fourteen weeks non-encouraged exercise at home, (<LINK REF="STD-Ligtenberg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ligtenberg 1997</LINK>). Weight was measured for both groups at the start and the endpoint of the trial, although no data were reported in the article, but the authors did state 'body weight did not change in either group during the whole study period'. Glycated haemoglobin was measured and reported at baseline and follow-up. In the diet only group, glycated haemoglobin rose by 0.2 ± 1.2% from baseline to follow-up at six months (from 8.8 ± 1.5% to 9.0 ± 1.6%) compared to a decrease of 0.2 ± 0.8% from baseline to follow-up for participants in the diet plus exercise group at six months (from 8.9 ± 1.0% to 8.7 ± 1.1%).</P>
<P>Samaras randomly assigned 26 non-exercising participants to receive either their usual diet or to receive their usual diet plus a structured exercise programme that ran for one hour, once a month for six months, (<LINK REF="STD-Samaras-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Samaras 1997</LINK>). This was a moderately paced aerobic exercise session run by an exercise physiologist. This paper reported baseline and change data. Baseline measurement of weight for the diet only group was 98.2 ± 12.3kg which rose by 1.0 ± 2.9kg after six months and then rose (compared to the baseline measurement) at the twelve month follow-up by 0.8 ± 3.9kg compared to the diet plus exercise group where the baseline measurement was 83.0 ± 13.0kg, which decreased by 0.1 ± 2.7kg at the six month follow-up and then rose (compared to the baseline measurement) by 0.1 ± 3.9kg at the twelve month follow-up. Glycated haemoglobin concentrations in both groups of participants rose over the six month period of the trial, by 0.6 ± 0.9% in the control group (from 6.8 ± 2.2% at baseline) and by 0.1 ± 1.1% in the diet and exercise group (from 5.6 ± 1.1% at baseline). Measures of glycated haemoglobin also rose from baseline to the twelve month follow-up in both control and intervention groups, rising by 0.9 ± 1.0% in the diet only group (from 6.8 ± 2.2% at baseline) and by 0.9 ± 1.0% in the diet and exercise group (from 5.6 ± 1.1% at baseline).</P>
<P>In Kaplan's trial, (<LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 1986</LINK>), 76 participants were randomly allocated to either ten weekly sessions of diet education, which focused on promoting a low-fat (30% of total energy), high carbohydrate (55% of total energy) or to ten weekly sessions of diet and exercise education. Five of these weekly sessions were spent on diet education (as for the control group) and the following five were spent on supervised exercise in an adult fitness programme that included stretching and walking/jogging. Some data on weight change were measured and reported in the text of the article; the mean weight loss over six months for the diet only group was 3.5kg compared to a loss of 0.2kg for the diet plus exercise group from baseline to six months. (Although mean weight change was reported, the associated standard deviations/errors were not.) Glycated haemoglobin was measured but not reported except to say that there was 'no significant difference between the groups at baseline and six month follow up'.</P>
<P>Wing conducted a trial that had 30 participants randomised to either a diet only group or a diet plus exercise group, (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988</LINK>). The diet only group had an individualised daily calorie goal and participants were taught to try and increase their complex carbohydrate intake and to decrease their intake of fat. Participants in the diet plus exercise group had the same dietary advice imparted but also walked for three miles a day three times a week and were instructed to exercise (on their own) for another session per week. At the twelve month follow-up, participants in the diet only group had lost a mean weight of 3.8 ± 15.4kg (from 102 ± 19.4kg to 98.2 ± 20.0kg) compared to a mean weight loss of 7.9 ± 18.3kg in the diet and exercise group at twelve months (from 104.1 ± 23.2kg to 96.2 ± 23.4kg). Glycated haemoglobin decreased in a similar fashion, in the diet only group, the concentration decreased by 0.8 ± 1.4% from baseline to follow-up at twelve months, (from 10.9 ± 1.9% to 10.1 ± 1.6%), compared to a decrease of 1.4 ± 1.5% in the diet plus exercise group (from 10.6 ± 1.9% to 9.2 ± 1.8%) over the same time period.</P>
<P>In these six studies, (<LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uusitupa-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Uusitupa 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Agurs_x002d_Collins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Agurs-Collins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ligtenberg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ligtenberg 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaras-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Samaras 1997</LINK>), dietary advice was compared with dietary advice plus exercise. The trials recruited participants with similar characteristics (age and sex) and the quality of the trials were assessed to be at high risk of bias. Weight change was assessed in all trials, although not reported in two trials, (<LINK REF="STD-Ligtenberg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ligtenberg 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 1986</LINK>), and more weight was lost on average in the diet and exercise groups. The development of micro and macrovascular diabetic complications were not reported. Glycated haemoglobin was reported in most trials and decreased more in the participants in the dietary advice and exercise groups than those in the dietary advice only groups.</P>
<P>The six studies were clinically similar enough to permit pooling, (although the participants in the Samaras intervention group (<LINK REF="STD-Samaras-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Samaras 1997</LINK>) were generally less heavy than the participants in the other trials in this category) and as there were three or more studies (with data that could be entered into the tables) in all but one category, (weight at six months), it was statistically possible to carry out an analysis on the heterogeneity of the data. For weight at twelve months the fixed effect model test for heterogeneity was significant. The test for heterogeneity was not significant for change in glycated haemoglobin at six and twelve months. At six months, dietary advice plus exercise was associated with a statistically significant mean (pooled weighted mean difference) decrease in glycated haemoglobin of 0.9% (with 95% confidence intervals of 0.4 to 1.3), and at twelve months, dietary advice plus exercise was associated with a statistically significant mean (pooled weighted mean difference) decrease in glycated haemoglobin of 1.0% (with 95% confidence intervals of 0.4 to 1.5). Three hundred and forty participants took part in these trials and overall the trial quality was assessed to be at high risk of bias. The evidence suggests that dietary advice plus exercise has the potential to have an impact on weight and glycaemic control, although the high potential for bias should be considered when interpreting the evidence.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparison 04: Dietary Advice versus Dietary Advice plus Behavioural Approaches</HEADING>
<P>Three studies assessed dietary advice versus dietary advice plus behavioural approaches.</P>
<P>Glasgow conducted a trial that evaluated the efficacy of a personalised medical office-based intervention, (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1997</LINK>). Two hundred and six participants in this study were randomised to either receive usual care or usual care plus the brief intervention added in. All participants went half an hour early to their physician appointment and completed the baseline assessment, which included a touch screen assessment. Usual care participants received a high quality quarterly medical care intervention including regular assessment and follow-up of micro and macrovascular risk factors in addition to the touch screen computer assessment, although there was no focus on behavioural or psychosocial issues. The participants randomised to the 'brief' intervention group completed another five to ten minute touch screen dietary barriers assessment which immediately generated two printed feedback forms (one for the participant and one for the physician). No results were available in the articles, and attempts at personal communication proved to be unsuccessful.</P>
<P>Glasgow randomly assigned 160 participants to receive either the basic intervention or the community resources intervention, (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 2000</LINK>). Participants assigned to the basic intervention group received information about low-fat eating. Participants assigned to the community resources group received the same information about low-fat eating as the basic group but in addition they had access to 'community resources' which was comprised of three-ring binder of indexed community resources, four newsletters identifying opportunities for participants to obtain support, a food frequency was mailed and tailored feedback was sent with advice to decrease intake of dietary fat. The participants in the community resources group decreased their mean weight from 96.2 ± 22.2kg at baseline to a follow-up value of 95.3 ± 20.9kg at six months, compared to the participants in the basic care group who decreased their mean weight from 90.3 ± 16.3kg at baseline to a follow-up value of 89.4 ± 16.8kg at six months. The concentration of glycated haemoglobin remained stable in the community resources group (a value of 7.3 ± 1.5% at baseline to a value of 7.3 ± 1.4% at the six month follow-up) compared with the basic intervention group who decreased their mean glycated haemoglobin from 7.6 ± 1.2% at baseline to 7.4 ± 1.2% at the six month follow-up.</P>
<P>Keyserling describes a trial that had 133 participants randomised to receive a clinic-based intervention or a clinic-based intervention plus community intervention, (<LINK REF="STD-Keyserling-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Keyserling 2000</LINK>). All participants were given a single loose-leaf notebook from which assessment and monitoring pages could be removed and filed. The clinic-based intervention consisted of four individual visits to a counsellor (sessions lasting for 195 minutes in total) where counsellors would negotiate with the participant on the selection of two or three goals from each assessment area within the provided notebook. The additional community intervention included phone calls to participants and also three group sessions (two sessions between zero and six months and one between six and twelve months of the trial duration) which specifically addressed issues relating to cultural translation. Measurements were made at baseline, six and twelve months. In the clinic-based arm of the study, mean weight decreased from a baseline of 92.5 ± 22.1kg to 91.6 ± 21.7kg at the six month follow-up (a weight loss of by 0.9kg). Weight then increased by 1.9kg (92.5 ± 22.1kg at baseline to 94.4 ± 23.2kg) at the twelve month follow-up. In the clinic and community resources group, the mean weight remained the same from baseline measurement (93.9 ± 19.3kg) to six months (96.2 ± 19.3kg) and then increased by 2.3kg from baseline (93.9 ± 19.3kg) to the twelve month follow-up measurement (96.2 ± 19.3kg). In the clinic-based group, concentration of glycated haemoglobin increased from a baseline measurement of 11.0 ± 3.2% to the six month follow-up value of 11.1 ± 3.1%; from baseline measurement to the twelve month follow-up, there was a decrease from 11.0 ± 3.2% (baseline) to 10.9 ± 3.8% (twelve month follow-up). In comparison, concentration of glycated haemoglobin in participants in the clinic-based and community resources arm of the study remained stable at the six month follow-up (baseline measurement of 10.7 ± 2.3% compared to a six-month measurement of 10.7 ± 3.1%). At the twelve month follow-up, the glycated haemoglobin had risen from 10.7 ± 2.3% to 10.8 ± 2.9%.</P>
<P>In the three studies, (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keyserling-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Keyserling 2000</LINK>), dietary advice was compared with dietary advice plus a behavioural approach. The trials recruited participants with similar characteristics (age and sex) and the quality of the trials were assessed to be at high risk of bias. Weight change was assessed in all trials, although not reported at all in one of the trials, (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1997</LINK>), and although more weight was lost on average in the usual care (dietary advice only) groups, the amount of weight lost was not substantial. The development of micro and macrovascular diabetic complications was not reported in any of the studies. Glycated haemoglobin was reported in all but one trial, (<LINK REF="STD-Glasgow-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glasgow 1997</LINK>), and generally more improvement in glycaemic control was seen in the usual care groups, although once more the changes were not significant.</P>
<P>Although the three studies were clinically similar enough to permit pooling; data were only available for two of these studies, therefore it was not possible for an analysis for heterogeneity to be carried out. There were a total of 499 participants in these three trials and overall the trial quality was assessed to be at high risk of bias. Firm conclusions could not be drawn from this comparison.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-09-29 15:18:17 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review assessed eighteen randomised controlled trials of dietary advice studying a total of 1467 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Only a minority of the trials examined hard clinical endpoints (such as death or development of macrovascular or microvascular diabetic complications), and those that did offered no details; most articles concerned themselves with the reporting and discussion of the participants' weight and blood glucose control.</P>
<P>Meta-analyses could not be carried out for the data within the dietary advice versus another (different) form of dietary advice, the very-low-calorie dietary advice versus low-calorie dietary advice category and the dietary advice versus dietary advice plus behavioural approaches categories, as there were not sufficient data to allow this.</P>
<P>Within the dietary advice versus dietary advice plus exercise category, there were small, yet significant changes seen in mean glycated haemoglobin at six months and twelve months in the four (<LINK REF="STD-Uusitupa-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Uusitupa 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Agurs_x002d_Collins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Agurs-Collins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ligtenberg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ligtenberg 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaras-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Samaras 1997</LINK>) and three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uusitupa-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Uusitupa 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaras-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Samaras 1997</LINK>) that contributed data to these analyses. At six months, dietary advice plus exercise was associated with a statistically significant mean (pooled weighted mean difference) decrease in glycated haemoglobin of 0.9% (with 95% confidence intervals of 0.4 to 1.3), and at twelve months, dietary advice plus exercise was associated with a statistically significant mean (pooled weighted mean difference) decrease in glycated haemoglobin of 1.0% (with 95% confidence intervals of 0.4 to 1.5).</P>
<P>A recent systematic review published in the Cochrane Library by Pirozzo, (<LINK REF="REF-Pirozzo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pirozzo 2002</LINK>), suggested that there was no real difference between a low-fat diet and other weight reducing diets (when looking at long term weight loss) in overweight or obese people. The reviewers found that generally there were small, non-significant differences in weight loss between the participants in the control and intervention groups, however this difference was so small it was clinically insignificant. In this review, there were insufficient data to permit a meta-analysis, so conclusions on the effects of low-fat or other weight reducing diets were limited. However, clinically meaningful differences in glucose profile were not achieved.<BR/>Recently, some small-scale studies discussed the importance of dietary composition and low-carbohydrate diets in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (<LINK REF="STD-Boden-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boden 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 2005</LINK>). Low carbohydrate diets appeared to have a significant effect on decreasing HbA1c and weight reduction. However, more research is required on larger populations and with a strict control group.</P>
<P>This update review yielded no further studies which fit the criteria for inclusion and exclusion, and thus, no further trials have been added to the meta-analyses. However, one study by Ash (<LINK REF="STD-Ash-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ash 2003</LINK>), investigated the effectiveness of three isocaloric dietary intervention groups (intermittent energy restriction, pre-portioned meals, and self-selected meals) for a duration of 12 weeks, with a follow-up after 18 months. Despite this study being a randomised control trial, of male adults with type 2 diabetes, it was excluded from any further analyses due to a dubious control arm to the study. However, the study concluded that a moderate energy restriction of 1400-1700kcal/day was effective in achieving a 6% weight loss and an improvement in glycaemic control. The method of implementation was found to be insignificant, whilst the weekly contact with health care professionals was suggested as the facilitator of the successful outcomes.<BR/>This review is relevant to physicians treating patients with type 2 diabetes, the results suggest that the addition of exercise alongside a reduced energy diet is the best way to promote better glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients, with this achieving consistent success in the trials reported in this review. We found no significant results in relation to weight.<BR/>In terms of the relevance of this review to future researchers, it is important to use these findings as a basis from which to generate hypotheses. As this review is high quality, we believe it can form a firm foundation for research project proposals and identifying gaps in areas of further research.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Limitations of the review</HEADING>
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a major and growing health problem, and it has been predicted that the number of people with diabetes will double over the next 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_FAO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/FAO 2003</LINK>). The adoption of a more affluent and westernised lifestyle (i.e. a lifestyle where energy consumed is not matched or exceeded by energy expended) by some non-Western populations is also contributing to an increase in the diabetic population (<LINK REF="REF-Roman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roman 1997</LINK>). For all diabetic patients, achieving good glycaemic control is central to their well-being. Eighty to ninety percent of type 2 diabetic patients are overweight. With a decrease in weight, an improvement in glycaemic control is often observed.</P>
<P>There were not enough data in the studies that assessed one dietary advice versus another (different) type of dietary advice to enable us to reach any satisfactory conclusions. The data included in the trials in this review which assessed dietary advice plus behavioural approaches did not have the data to allow us to reach any satisfactory substantial conclusions. The studies which examined dietary advice versus dietary advice plus physical activity do suggest benefit from adoption of increasing physical activity levels alongside a reduced energy diet. We found no randomised controlled trials that examined dietary advice versus dietary advice plus alternative therapies.</P>
<P>Despite the frequency and severity of this condition, there are comparatively few trials and participants which have studied the impact of dietary advice and interventions. This may be partly due to type 2 diabetes being diagnosed relatively late by which time islet cell decompensation is reasonably advanced. As a consequence, even impressive degrees of weight loss can result in a rise rather than a fall in glycated haemoglobin. This is not an indication that the dietary intervention has failed but that the patient requires an oral anti-diabetic agent.</P>
<P>There is a need for far more research into effects of dietary change (with and without the addition of physical activity) on micro and macrovascular diabetic complications, weight and glycaemic control. Many of the outcomes we initially wished to look at in this review were not investigated in the included studies. Work carried out in the future should take care to record and publish mortality, change (or delay) in onset of anti-diabetic medication and also quality of life as these are outcomes of importance to people with type 2 diabetes. It would be desirable if measures of compliance would also be recorded and reported in published works.</P>
<P>The new long term study (known as 'look AHEAD' (Action for Health in Diabetes, (<LINK REF="STD-Kelley-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kelley 2002</LINK>)) sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, began in 2002 and aims to look at the long-term health effects of weight loss in men and women who are overweight and have type 2 diabetes who are 45 to 75 years of age. It is envisaged that participants will be assessed up to eleven and a half years after enrolling in the programme, which will reveal the long-term health effects of the trial.</P>
<P>Long-term, high-quality research in this area is necessary as the increase of type 2 diabetes is currently mirroring the recent rise of obesity that has been concerning health care professionals for the last ten years. Diabetes has now reached epidemic proportions and further immediate work is required in an attempt to halt it.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Using exercise as an adjunct to dietary advice, compared with dietary advice alone, appears to improve glycated haemoglobin at six and twelve months in people with type 2 diabetes. There were small, yet significant changes in glycated haemoglobin in the four (<LINK REF="STD-Uusitupa-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Uusitupa 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Agurs_x002d_Collins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Agurs-Collins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ligtenberg-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ligtenberg 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaras-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Samaras 1997</LINK>) and three (<LINK REF="STD-Wing-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wing 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Uusitupa-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Uusitupa 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaras-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Samaras 1997</LINK>) studies that contributed data to these analyses. Dietary advice plus exercise was associated with a statistically significant mean (pooled weighted mean difference) decrease in glycated haemoglobin of 0.9% (with 95% confidence intervals of 0.4 to 1.3) at six months and of 1.0% (with 95% confidence intervals of 0.4 to 1.5) at twelve months (it should be noted that there is insufficient evidence to suggest what the effects of the dietary advice would be on weight or diabetic micro- and macrovascular diseases).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-09-29 15:23:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The current available evidence assembled in this review points towards the benefit of increasing exercise in people with type 2 diabetes. Further high quality research to examine the addition of exercise alongside a reduced energy diet would be of great importance to either corroborate or contradict these findings. High quality research is needed to identify what types (low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet, modified-fat diet, restricted protein diet etc.), frequency and style (addition of behaviour modification or not) of dietary advice are most efficacious in the long-term for use by people with type 2 diabetes.</P>
<P>This review has also highlighted the lack of outcome studies of effects of dietary change on micro- and macrovascular diabetic complications. Many of the outcomes we wished to look at were not investigated in the included studies and therefore we recommend that any research carried out in the future should take care to note and report mortality, change (or delay) in onset of anti-diabetic medication and also quality of life as these are outcomes of importance to people with type 2 diabetes. Measures of compliance should also be recorded and reported in published works.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Conclusions</HEADING>
<P>There are no high quality data on the efficacy of the dietary treatment of type 2 diabetes programmes, however the data we do have indicate that the adoption of exercise appears to improve glycated haemoglobin at twelve months in people with type 2 diabetes, although the data presented are at high risk of bias. There is a need for well-designed studies which examine a range of interventions, although there is a promising study currently underway.</P>

Cholesterol was restricted to a maximum of 2.1grams per week. The advice to participants was given once only at the time of diagnosis. </P>
<P>Comparison intervention(s):<BR/>Standard low-carbohydrate diet. The advice given to participants was to restrict carbohydrate up to a maximum of 40% of total energy.

<P>Trial intervention(s): <BR/>IG: A clinic and community based intervention designed to reduce total dietary fat. The clinic based intervention included individual counselling visits at month 1 (60 minutes), 2 (45 minutes), 3 (45 minutes) and 4 (45 minutes). All counselling and educational materials were included in a single loose-leaf notebook from which assessment and monitoring pages could be removed for filing and subsequent follow-up. Counsellors were encouraged to negotiate with the participant on the selection of two or three goals from each assessment area to accomplish before the next visit. The goal sheet was designed so it could be placed on the refrigerator where it would be seen frequently. The community intervention included phone calls to participants and group sessions. Alongside the four individual meetings IG participants had during the first six months, participants also had two group sessions of 90 minutes each and monthly telephone calls from the Community Diabetes Advisor. During the second six months, participants met for one group session of 90 minutes and maintaining monthly telephone contact with their Community Diabetes Advisor.</P>

</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Trial intervention(s): <BR/>A diet and exercise programme. The diet component of the intervention remained the same as diet for the control group (i.e. low fat high/carbohydrate diet). The exercise component was made up of walking a three mile route with therapists three times a week and were instructed to exercise once more (on their own) during the week. </P>
<P>Comparison intervention(s): <BR/>Participants were taught to increase their intake of complex carbohydrates, and to decrease their intake of fat in keeping with the revised American Diabetes Association dietary guidelines. A calorie goal was prescribed, calculated by taking the patients pre-intervention weight, multiplying by 26 and subtracting 1000 calories. </P>
<P>Participants in both groups attended three meetings a week, for ten weeks, where they were shown demonstrations and films of low calorie cooking techniques, and how to practise behaviours such as portion size estimation and learning through role-play.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Participants in the diet only group had a mean weight of 102 ± 19.4kg at baseline and a mean weight of 98.2 ± 20kg twelve months later. <BR/>Participants in the diet and exercise group had a mean weight of 104.1 ± 23.2kg at baseline and a mean weight of 96.2 ± 23.4kg at the twelve month follow-up. </P>
<P>Glycated haemoglobin decreased in the diet only group, from a baseline value of 10.9 ± 1.9% to a follow-up value (at twelve months) of 10.1 ± 1.6%. <BR/>In the diet plus exercise group, glycated haemoglobin also decreased from a baseline value of 10.6 ± 1.9% to a twelve month follow-up value of 9.2 ± 1.8%.</P>

Information was presented regarding the different caloric content of protein, fat and carbohydrate. Subjects were encouraged to increase their complex carbohydrate intake especially fibre, while decreasing dietary fat. Participants allocated to the IG followed this diet for one month, and then switched to a very-low-calorie diet (VCLD) for the second and third months of this program. While following the VCLD, participants were instructed to consume 1680 joules per day of lean fish, meat or fowl and had the option of using a liquid meal for occasional meals. After the two months, other foods were gradually re-introduced so that by week 17 all subjects were back onto a 4200 to 6300 joules per day diet. </P>
