<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-04-01 11:46:37 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="jane clarke">
<P>In western countries, cervical ectropion or erosion caused by the movement of columnar epithelium onto the vaginal portion of the cervix is considered a normal physiological process not requiring intervention. In China, however, cervical ectropion is considered as one of the most common types of chronic cervicitis and is often treated. One of the topical treatments widely used is microwave tissue coagulation (MTC). From Chinese databases, the authors identified 131 potential randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) that compared microwave therapy to no treatment or other treatments. Only three of these studies involving a total of 540 participants were identified as RCTs. Two studies (420 participants) compared MTC versus laser, and one study (120 participants) compared MTC with an interferon-alpha suppository. The follow-up period of the RCTs was adequate. None of the studies assessed relief of symptoms or quality of life and satisfaction, which are very important to women. The authors of the review considered that they could not answer the review question about the appropriate use of microwave therapy as only these three low quality RCTs were found. Although the trials showed improved appearance of the cervix with microwave treatment compared with the control therapy, it was not possible to ascertain whether the women were symptomatic before treatment. The review protocol also required participants to be symptomatic with mucopurulent discharge or to have contact bleeding before treatment. At present, intervention for inflammatory cervical ectropion is still controversial.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-03-28 23:53:24 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The term cervical ectropion (CE) has replaced that of cervical erosion. It is also sometimes referred to as the transformation zone of the cervix. A cervical ectropion occurs when, due to hormonal changes, the columnar epithelium moves onto the vaginal portion of the cervix. A cervical ectropion appears red and may have an inflamed appearance due to the columnar epithelium being thinner than squamous epithelium. This makes the underlying blood vessels more apparent. Along with the red appearance, the columnar epithelium may also secrete mucus which, if abundant, causes a vaginal discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1991</LINK>). In western countries, cervical ectropion is considered as a physiological process not requiring treatment. In China, however, cervical ectropion is considered as one of the most common types of chronic cervicitis and it is thought that severe cervical ectropion may cause infertility (<LINK REF="REF-Dalgic-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalgic 2001</LINK>). As a result, treatment for cervical ectropion is widely practiced in hospitals in China. It is reported that 20% to 50% of Chinese women of reproductive age have cervical ectropion (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cai-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cai 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peng-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peng 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Xiao-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xiao 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the Chinese medical literature, the occurrence of cervical ectropion is not considered to be caused solely by estrogenic hormonal changes; inflammation and trauma have also been implicated in its etiology (<LINK REF="REF-Yue-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yue 2000</LINK>). Inflammatory ectropion presents as a defect or degeneration and necrosis of cervical squamous epithelium combined with infiltration of large numbers of inflammatory cells as evidenced using histopathology. On a smear, superficial, intermediate and basement cells can be found with degenerated and necrotic cells, mild dyskaryotic cells and large numbers of neutrophils; small numbers of monocytes, lymphocytes, plasmocytes and macrophages can also be seen (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cervical ectropion has been associated with both the combined oral contraceptive pill and chlamydia trachomatis (<LINK REF="REF-Critchlow-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Critchlow 1995</LINK>). Changing the method of contraception may be considered for those women who are unable to accept the increase in physiological discharge associated with cervical ectropion. Screening for chlamydia and other sexually transmitted infections should be considered for those women who are at risk. Ectropion has also been found in 5% to 25% of women presenting with postcoital bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Selo_x002d_Ojeme-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selo-Ojeme 2004</LINK>). These women need appropriate follow up with a cervical smear and colposcopy.</P>
<P>Clinical macroscopic examination describes three grades (I, II and III) based on size, the severity of the lesion and the rate of growth of columnar epithelium. These are described as simple pattern, granular pattern and mammilla pattern (<LINK REF="REF-Yue-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yue 2005</LINK>). Macroscopically it may be difficult to distinguish cervical ectropion from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), cancer in situ. Thus a cervical smear for cytological examination should be routinely performed to exclude dysplasia. In addition, colposcopy and a biopsy may also be needed for histopathologic examination.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-03-28 22:47:44 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Microwave therapy uses electromagnetic waves at a frequency of up to 2.45 billion Hz. The biophysical effect at the target site is through both an internal heating effect and a non-heating effect. Unlike the external heating of other physical treatments, microwave tissue coagulation (MTC) involves internal heating using human tissue as the heat source (<LINK REF="REF-Guan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guan 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatments are only performed after excluding malignancy and specific or non-specific cervical or vaginal infections. The purpose of treatment is to induce necrosis and exfoliation of the columnar epithelium at the affected site and allow repair by neoformative squamous epithelium. This, in turn, is considered likely to reduce the chances of development of abnormal metaplasia and infection.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-03-28 22:49:39 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When the microwave electrode touches the topical lesion, a microwave magnetic field forms in the tissue and the small-scope high temperature produced instantly, which induces degeneration, coagulation and necrosis of the topical tissue protein. New squamous cells then migrate from peripheral tissue and repair the wound. The general non-heating effect of microwave induces dilation of superficial blood vessels, acceleration of blood flow and enhancement of tissue metabolism, which in turn promote the elimination of inflammatory products. There is, therefore, a synergistic action within the therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Guan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guan 2004</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-03-28 22:51:00 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Presently, the rationale for use of microwave therapy for asymptomatic cervical ectropion is unclear.</P>
<P>Although this systematic review was first published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Review in 2007, many methods, including microwave treatment, are still used to treat cervical ectropion in China. It is necessary to evaluate these interventions.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-03-28 23:38:07 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In China, cervical ectropion is considered as one of the most common types of chronic cervicitis and requires treatment. Three randomised studies involving 540 participants were found. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Song-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Song 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2004</LINK>) compared MTC versus laser (420 participants) and one study (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK>) compared MTC versus interferon-alpha suppository. Relief of symptoms, quality of life and satisfaction were not reported in any of the three studies. The study results suggested that microwave therapy gave similar or greater improvements in the appearance of the cervix over laser or interferon suppository use. One study reported the rate of bleeding during operation (<LINK REF="STD-Song-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Song 1994</LINK>). The difference was statistically significant (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.37; 300 participants, one trial) between the MTC and laser groups. Other adverse effects such as bleeding and topical infection after operation were also reported in <LINK REF="STD-Song-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Song 1994</LINK>. No differences were found between the two groups. The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Xu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2004</LINK>) reported a statistically significant difference for the duration of vaginal discharge post-treatment (mean difference -3.30, 95% CI -5.27 to -1.33; 120 participants, one trial).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK> reported that bleeding after operation occurred in a few participants with no difference between MTC and an interferon-alpha suppository (120 participants, one trial).</P>
<P>However, none of these trials employed assessor blinding, which raises the possibility of assessor bias. In addition, there were no data to clarify whether these women were symptomatic before treatment or received any benefit from the treatment in addition to improved cervical appearance. No study compared microwave therapy with no treatment. This is important as the rationale for use of this therapy for cervical ectropion is not clear.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-03-28 23:38:45 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Up to now, no clearly applicable evidence has been found to show any benefit from MTC in the treatment of cervical ectropion.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-03-28 23:48:15 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The information on quality issues for the three RCTs was poorly reported. Although we were finally able to access this information, from the original authors, the risk of recall bias is high. There were also varying standards of classification for the grade and subtype of cervical ectropion. Consideration of sample sizes was not reported, which may lead to a low-test power. We found that most Chinese authors misunderstood the concept of randomisation. One hundred and thirty-three studies were reported as RCTs, however only three were authentic RCTs (2.3%, 3/131). Some of studies were experience collections or case collections and most of them were written retrospectively.</P>
<P>The quality of the three RCTs was poor (see Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was not enough information in the trial reports to determine whether the allocation sequence was adequately concealed. We contacted the authors by telephone. Two trials used random number tables (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2004</LINK>). One trial used adequate concealment (envelopes) prior to allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Song-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Song 1994</LINK>). Concealment was not used in the other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>No trial mentioned blinding. By interviewing the authors it was identified that only one trial was single blind, for the participants (<LINK REF="STD-Song-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Song 1994</LINK>). The assessors were not blinded in any trial.</P>
<P>As follow up and withdrawal rates were not reported in all trials, and no participant 'Flow diagram' was available, it is unclear whether all the participants were followed up. As a result, we judged the losses to follow up and withdrawal from the trials by the data presented.</P>
<P>The three trials did not report on 'relief of symptoms' or 'quality of life or satisfaction', which were primary outcomes for this review. We were unable to obtain any information about the protocol for these trials. They were judged ;Unclear' due to insufficient information.</P>
<P>No trial mentioned other potential sources of bias, and the source of funding was not clear.<B> </B>

<P>This review was originally published two years ago and there has not been any other systematic review about this intervention. It is not clear whether the methods, including microwave treatment, have any benefit for women. However, women with cervical ectropion continue to have treatment with various topical treatments. Many of these studies are published in Chinese journals and suggest effectiveness but none of them meet the requirements of a randomised controlled clinical trial.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-03-28 23:50:36 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the appearance of the cervix can be improved with microwave and other therapies it is not clear whether this has any benefit for the women. Women presenting with increased vaginal discharge from an ectropion can be advised that this is physiological, following swabs to rule out sexually transmitted infections, bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis. Postcoital bleeding, with an associated ectropion, requires follow up with cervical cytology and colposcopy to exclude cervical cancer or its precursors.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-04-11 15:34:31 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further studies should be undertaken and they need to consider the rationale for treating cervical ectropion, including primary outcomes that are important for women. Only symptomatic women with cervical ectropion should be included and their characteristics clearly reported. Treatment needs to be compared with no treatment. Correct randomisation is required for allocating the participants along with allocation concealment, long-term follow up, blind assessment of the results, presentation of complete outcome data, clarification of other potential sources of bias and more careful and detailed monitoring of adverse effects. Reporting on the quality issues should be improved according to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>).</P>

<TH>
<P>Questions</P>
</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Question 1</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Introduce myself and purpose: How do you do? I was a student of Lanzhou University, was doing a review about microwave tissue coagulation in the treatment of cervical ectropion. Purpose of my study was to compare the effects of variety randomisation methods. I had searched out a paper that published in (time, journal) written by you. Could you please tell me what method to be used in this trial?</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Question 2</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>If the subject cannot describe the method clearly, change the question like this: could you please tell me when a new participant enrolled, how did you decide which group the participant should be allocated to?</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Question 3</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>If there was any problem about the first author, the second author or others should be interviewed.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Question 4</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Next two questions aim to understand the category of support source for investigated study, I selected one of them or both: (1) Was your study funded by government or any other source? (2) Was your study for new drug development?</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Question 5</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Judgment should be made immediately for whether it was a real RCT or not. If it be judged as real RCT, next questions aim to understand the status of allocation concealment: (1) Do you know allocation concealment? If so, please clarify. (2) Did you use any method to mask allocation sequence? If any, please clarify.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Question 6</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Next question aims to understand the validity of blinding particularly pay attention to whether the detector was blinded or not: Please tell me who were blinded in your trial?</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Question 7</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>We said "thank you" to author.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Question 8</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Finally, We needed to judge whether the subject knew well the trial principle or not: if anyone persisted in the method of randomisation as correct but actually wrong or ineligible, it should be judged didn't know; if anyone claimed that "I knew we performed not good enough" or "it was impossible to perform a completely correct RCT" and so on, it should be judged as knew well about the principle of trial but violated knowingly claimed the non-RCT as RCT.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
