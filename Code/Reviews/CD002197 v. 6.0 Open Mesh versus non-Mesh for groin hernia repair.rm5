<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-09-07 15:06:17 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review examines the evidence from studies comparing different types of open surgery for people with groin hernia. We included only randomised studies comparing either 1) methods using synthetic mesh versus methods without mesh or 2) flat mesh methods versus plug and mesh methods. We divided mesh methods into flat mesh, plug and mesh or preperitoneal mesh and non-mesh methods into Shouldice or other non-mesh repair.</P>
<P>We found 20 studies comparing mesh with non-mesh repair and two studies comparing flat mesh with plug and mesh. For 13 studies we re-analysed data supplied by the study author, for four studies we received additional results from the study author and for five studies only published information was used.</P>
<P>There was strong evidence that fewer hernias recur after mesh repair than following non-mesh repair. There was a suggestion that people had less persisting pain after mesh repair but results were only available for nine out of 20 trials. Open mesh methods were shorter to perform than Shouldice procedures, but took longer than other types of non-mesh repair. We found no clear differences between mesh and non-mesh methods for operative complications and persisting numbness. Overall, people spent less time in hospital and returned to their usual activities quicker after mesh repair but this pattern was not observed for all studies.</P>
<P>We did not find clear evidence of differences between flat mesh repair and plug and mesh repair.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Inguinal hernia repair is the most frequent operation in general surgery. Until recently the standard procedure has been open musculo-aponeurotic repair using sutures under tension to close the defect but 'tension-free' repair using prosthetic mesh is becoming increasingly common in many countries.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The purpose of this review is to evaluate open mesh techniques in comparison with open non-mesh techniques for the surgical repair of groin hernia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Electronic databases were searched and further trials were sought from the reference lists of reports of known trials. Through the EU Hernia Trialists Collaboration authors of identified randomised controlled trials were asked for information on any other trials known to them. There was no language restriction. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing either a) open mesh with open non-mesh repair of groin hernia or b) open flat mesh repair with plug and mesh repair of groin hernia.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>For each outcome the results were derived using data from the best available source. The majority of data for this review came from individual patient data (IPD) supplied by the trialists. When these were unavailable data came from additional aggregated information or from published trial reports. All trials were analysed using the 'intention to treat' principle.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty trials comparing open mesh with open non-mesh repair were identified. Open mesh methods, on average, took 7-10 minutes less to perform than Shouldice procedures, but took 1-4 minutes longer than other non-mesh methods. There were no clear differences between mesh and non-mesh groups for haematomas, seromas or wound/superficial infections. Three serious operative compications were reported after open mesh repair and three following non-mesh repair. Overall, those in the mesh groups had a shorter length of hospital stay and quicker return to usual activities, but this pattern was not observed for all trials. There was a suggestion that persisting pain was less frequent after mesh repair than after non-mesh repair but this result was dependent on one trial and data were not available for 11 trials. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups with respect to persisting numbness. Fewer hernia recurrences were reported after mesh repair (Peto OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.51).</P>
<P>There were too few data to reliably address differential effects for patients with recurrent, bilateral or femoral hernias.</P>
<P>Two trials comparing flat mesh with plug and mesh were identified. There was no clear evidence of differences between the groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is evidence that the use of open mesh repair is associated with a reduction in the risk of recurrence of between 50% and 75%. Although the trials were heterogenous there is also some evidence of quicker return to work and of lower rates of persisting pain following mesh repair.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Groin hernia repair is the most frequent operation in general surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Rutkow-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutkow 1993</LINK>). The number of times it is performed each year is approximately 80,000 in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Kingsnorth-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kingsnorth 1992</LINK>), 100,000 in France (<LINK REF="REF-Levard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levard 1996</LINK>) and 700,000 in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Rutkow-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutkow 1993</LINK>). Because inguinal hernia repair is performed so frequently, relatively modest improvements in clinical outcomes or savings in resource use would have significant medical and economic impact (<LINK REF="REF-Simons-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simons 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The standard method for groin hernia repair had changed little over the hundred years since Bassini introduced the modern era of herniorrhaphy (<LINK REF="REF-Bassini-1887" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassini 1887</LINK>). Bassini's method relies on a musculo-aponeurotic repair to close the abdominal wall defect, eliminate the presence of a lump and relieve the patient's discomfort. Minor postoperative problems are not uncommon, while more serious complications, such as damage to the spermatic cord, the femoral vein or artery, or the genitofemoral or ilioinguinal nerves are occasionally reported. However, its major drawback is recurrence. Annual statistics from various countries show that, despite many modifications introduced by Shouldice, McVay and others, 10-15% of groin hernia operations are for recurrent hernias (<LINK REF="REF-Liem-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liem 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The concept of 'tension-free' open repair (<LINK REF="REF-Lichtenstein-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichtenstein 1989</LINK>) has proved popular amongst many surgeons. In this method, a synthetic mesh is placed over the defect so that the hernia is repaired without the need to pull the tissues together under tension. The advantages claimed for this approach are that it is technically easy, can be performed using local anaesthetic as a day procedure, is associated with less pain, and allows more rapid return to work. However, longer-term rates of recurrence and chronic pain are uncertain, particularly in direct comparison with other techniques.</P>

</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>1. A database search for randomised controlled trials was conducted using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Controlled Trials Registry, and relevant websites.<BR/>The first two stages of the MEDLINE search strategy for identifying randomised clinical trials were used with the following specific search terms:</P>
<P>1. explode inguinal hernia/surgery (MeSH)<BR/>2. inguinal herni$.tw<BR/>3. shouldice.tw<BR/>4. bassini.tw<BR/>5. mcvay.tw<BR/>6. stoppa.tw<BR/>7. (laparoscop$ adj25 herni$).tw<BR/>8.

<P>This search strategy was used in conjunction with another review (<LINK REF="REF-McCormack-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormack 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. The reference lists of identified trials, journal supplements and relevant book chapters were searched for further relevant trials.</P>
<P>3. Personal communication took place with authors of identified randomised controlled trials to ask for information of any other recent and ongoing trials known to them.</P>
<P>4. Specialists involved in research on the repair of inguinal hernia were contacted through the EU Hernia Trialists Collaboration to ask for information about any further recent and ongoing trials.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The review was conducted under the auspices of the EU Hernia Trialists Collaboration. This included representatives of nearly all eligible studies. Data collection closed in July 2000.<BR/> <BR/>The review was conducted in two stages. In the first stage a systematic review of the published data was undertaken. All studies that met our selection criteria were reviewed by two reviewers independently and assessed for methodological quality. Where a difference of opinion existed, another member of the review team acted as arbiter. The results of this exercise have been published in the Cochrane Library (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2000</LINK>) and in the British Journal of Surgery (<LINK REF="REF-EU-HTC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">EU HTC 2000</LINK>). </P>
<P>In the second stage, members of the EU Hernia Trialists Collaboration were requested to provide their raw individual patient data (IPD) to the project Secretariat for central re-analysis. These datasets were then recoded by the Secretariat into a standard format. Summary statistics were generated for each outcome. Impossible or unlikely values were queried with the trialist who provided the data. Routine checks for randomisation integrity were also made. These included checks for balance in numbers randomised to each arm and in baseline categories. Graphs were also produced to examine the pattern of randomisation to each group by date. These checks were used for guidance only and the results treated conservatively. No studies were excluded as a result of these checks.</P>
<P>All studies were analysed using the 'intention to treat' principle, that is, using the original random allocation regardless of the actual method of repair. Where patients had been excluded because they did not receive the allocated procedure details for these patients were sought from the trialist and included where possible. The results of the re-analysis were then incorporated into a report and sent to the trialist for verification. Once these results had been agreed these data were included in our meta-analyses.</P>
<P>Where IPD were not available the trialists were asked to verify the information abstracted from their publications and where possible supplement this information, for example by providing means and standard deviations where they had been reported as medians. In some cases updated information was also provided.</P>
<P>If IPD or additional aggregated data were not provided, information was abstracted from published reports. Some denominators were unclear for dichotomous outcomes and were assumed to be the numbers randomised. For a small number of trials standard deviations were estimated using data from other trials in the review.</P>
<P>For each outcome the results were derived using data from the best available source: if IPD were not available, information from aggregate data provided by the trialist or data from the trial publications were used. For most dichotomous outcomes, data were combined using Peto's odds ratio method and data for continuous outcomes using the weighted mean difference. The primary results are reported using a fixed-effect model. Where there was evidence of significant heterogeneity possible reasons were explored.<BR/> <BR/>For return to usual activities the results were combined using hazard ratios. The necessary statistics required for this analysis are O-E (observed minus expected events in the treatment (mesh) group) and V (= variance(O-E)). For each trial dataset Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to derive estimates of E and V. Only IPD were used for this outcome.</P>
<P>The results are reported in a series of 20 comparisons. Results for mesh versus non-mesh stratified by the type of mesh used (flat mesh, plug and mesh or preperitoneal mesh) are comparison 1. Comparisons 2 to 4 repeat the results for these three types of mesh stratified by whether the non-mesh repair was Shouldice or another method. Comparison 5 gives results for the separate flat mesh versus plug and mesh comparison. Comparisons 6 to 10 repeat the first five comparisons but limited to patients with recurrent hernias only. Similarly, comparisons 11 to 15 and 16 to 20 have the same analysis structure but are based on patients with bilateral hernias and femoral hernias respectively.</P>
<P>Some non-mesh arms included a mixture of Shouldice and other non-mesh repairs. Where possible, we used the IPD to split a trial into two groups of centres which mainly used the different types of repair, and included the resulting two strata of the trial separately in our meta-analyses. Where this was not possible, the trial has been included according to the most common type of repair used. </P>
<P>Duration of operation was defined as time from first incision to final stitch. Other definitions, such as time in theatre, were used if this was not available. 'Opposite' method was defined as mesh repair actually initiated when randomised to non-mesh, or vice versa. Haematoma included wound or scrotal haematoma or ecchymosis but not bruising; seroma included hydrocele. Wound/superficial infection comprised wound-related infections only and pus from wound, fistula and sinus formation were all included within this definition. Serious complications included potentially life-threatening visceral and vascular injuries, and mesh or deep infections. If length of postoperative stay was not available, time from admission to discharge was used instead. 'Usual activities' were defined as normal social activities but if this was not available work was used instead. Persisting pain was defined as groin, thigh or testicular pain (including slight) at one year after the operation, or at the closest timepoint to one year provided it was more than three months post-surgery. Persisting numbness was defined in the same way and included paresthesia, dysesthesia and discomfort. Reports of hernia recurrence were included regardless of whether or not it was stated that the recurrence was clinically confirmed. </P>
<P>Results are presented such that odds ratios (or hazards ratios) less than unity, and negative weighted mean differences indicate a favouring of mesh repair (flat mesh repair for comparisons 5, 10, 15 and 20).</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Twenty-two studies were identified that met the eligibility criteria; this included three unpublished studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gdansk-_x0028_unpub_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Gdansk (unpub)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lisbon-_x0028_unpub_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Lisbon (unpub)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ostersund-_x0028_unpub_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ostersund (unpub)</LINK>) identified through the Collaboration. Twenty compared open mesh with open non-mesh repair and two compared flat mesh with plug and mesh repair (<LINK REF="STD-Gdansk-_x0028_unpub_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Gdansk (unpub)</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Plymouth-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Plymouth 2000</LINK>). Of the 20 mesh versus non-mesh studies, 17 used flat mesh, two plug and mesh, and one preperitoneal mesh. A variety of different types of non-mesh repair were used (see description of included studies).</P>
<P>Individual patient data were received for 13 studies with additional aggregated data for a further four. Only published data were available for the remaining five studies: three reported as full publications and two as conference abstracts which were identified too late to allow time to approach the trialists.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Only five trials reported that a method of allocation concealment (all sealed envelopes) was used. Of the remaining 17 trials three reported the use of random number tables or computer randomisation and one reported randomisation was stratified by surgeon. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lansing-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lansing 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lisbon-_x0028_unpub_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Lisbon (unpub)</LINK>) are known to have used an inadequate method of concealment (the coin toss method). The method of allocation concealment is not known for the remaining trials.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Results for Mesh versus Non-mesh Repair (Comparisons 1-4)</P>
<P>There was marked heterogeneity in respect of duration of operation (comparison 01, outcome 01). To an important extent this reflected differences in the type of non-mesh procedure performed (02.01). Open mesh methods took an average 7 to 10 minutes less to perform than Shouldice procedures, but 1 to 4 minutes longer than other open non-mesh methods.</P>
<P>It was reported in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-New-Hampshire-1998" TYPE="STUDY">New Hampshire 1998</LINK>) that patients had not received the randomised operation (01.02). Thirteen patients in three studies were known to have been converted to the opposite type of repair: seven originally allocated mesh, and six originally allocated non-mesh (01.03).</P>
<P>There were no clear differences in reports of haematomas (01.04; overall Peto OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.26); seromas (01.05; overall Peto OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 0.92 to 2.52); and wound/superficial infections (01.06; overall Peto OR: 1.24; 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.84), irrespective of the types of operation being compared (02.04-06; 03.04-06; 04.04-06).</P>
<P>Serious operative complications were rare (01.07). After allocation to open mesh repair there was one bowel perforation (<LINK REF="STD-Ostersund-_x0028_unpub_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Ostersund (unpub)</LINK>), a reoperation for haematoma (<LINK REF="STD-Padova-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Padova 1996</LINK>) and a reoperation for bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-SCUR-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SCUR 1997</LINK>). Following allocation to non-mesh repair there was one visceral injury (type not known) (<LINK REF="STD-Rome-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rome 1995</LINK>), one vascular injury (type not known) (<LINK REF="STD-Rome-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rome 1995</LINK>) and one deep infection (<LINK REF="STD-SCUR-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SCUR 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Overall, length of postoperative hospital stay was shorter following mesh repair by between 0.22 and 0.35 days (01.08). However, there was considerable heterogeneity, which was not explained by the method of non-mesh repair (02.08). The individual trials fell into two groups. One group (11 trials) showed no difference, whereas the other group (6 trials) showed clearly shorter stays after mesh repair. This pattern is likely to reflect the discharge policies used by the hospitals during the trials.</P>
<P>Overall, return to usual activities or work was shorter following mesh repair (01.09, overall HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.91). However, again there was heterogeneity. To an extent this was explained by one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rome-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rome 1995</LINK>). After removal of these data the result was only marginally statistically significant (overall HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.00).</P>
<P>The available data suggest that persisting pain was less frequent after mesh repair than after non-mesh repair (01.10, overall Peto OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.98). However, this result was dependent on one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bietigheim-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bietigheim 1998</LINK>) which had high rates of pain and data were available for only nine of the 20 eligible studies, and so should be interpreted very cautiously. As there was marked heterogeneity a random effects model was also fitted for these data (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.43 to 1.73).</P>
<P>Persistent numbness was reported in only three trials, and then only infrequently (01.11; Peto OR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.29 to 1.72).</P>
<P>Recurrence after mesh repair was consistently less often reported in individual trials (11 versus 2 trials) and overall was reduced by between 50% and 75% (01.12; Peto OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.51). This was seen regardless of whether Shouldice or another non-mesh method was used. In the one trial that was inconsistent with the overall pattern (<LINK REF="STD-SCUR-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SCUR 1997</LINK>), a preperitoneal technique was used.</P>
<P>Thirty-one participants in the trials are known to have died (01.13). There was no evidence of a difference between the mesh and non-mesh groups and no death was related to trial surgery.</P>
<P>Results for Flat Mesh versus Plug and Mesh (Comparison 5)</P>
<P>Only 221 people participated in the two trials comparing flat mesh with plug and mesh. Hence the data are few and the confidence intervals wide. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Plymouth-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Plymouth 2000</LINK>) the mean operation time was shorter in the plug and mesh group, but the pattern was not seen in the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gdansk-_x0028_unpub_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Gdansk (unpub)</LINK>) (05.01). There was no clear evidence of difference in respect of other outcomes (05.02 - 05.13). The three recurrences occurred after plug and mesh repair.</P>
<P>Subgroup Analyses (Comparisons 6-20)</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses are performed for three categories of patients: patients with recurrent hernias (comparisons 6-10), bilateral hernias (comparisons 11-15) and femoral hernias (comparisons 16-20). Data were only available for two trials for recurrent hernias (<LINK REF="STD-Gdansk-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gdansk 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-SCUR-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SCUR 1997</LINK>), two trials for bilateral hernias (<LINK REF="STD-Gdansk-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gdansk 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lisbon-_x0028_unpub_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Lisbon (unpub)</LINK>) and one trial for femoral hernias (<LINK REF="STD-Gdansk-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gdansk 1997</LINK>) and there were no available data for seven comparisons (7,10,14,15,17,19 and 20). There were too few data to compare mesh and non-mesh techniques in these specific circumstances.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review was conducted through the formal structure of the EU Hernia Trialists Collaboration which ensured as complete identification as possible of relevant trials. Three unpublished trials were identified and included in the review. In addition, individual patient data were received for 13 studies and additional aggregated data for a further four of the 22 eligible. This greatly enhanced the amount of data able to be included in the review compared with the original version based on published data (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2000</LINK>) and helped ensure a greater standard of data and randomisation integrity. However, despite maximum effort, published data had to be used for five trials (two of which were published as conference abstracts shortly before data collection closed) and the usefulness of these was often limited by the way in which the data were reported.</P>
<P>Our results provide evidence that the use of mesh in open repair is associated with a substantial reduction in the risk of recurrence of between 50% and 75%. The Shouldice repair is widely regarded as the gold standard non-mesh open method but the difference was observed regardless of whether or not the type of non-mesh repair was Shouldice. Although the trials showed some heterogeneity there is also an indication that mesh repair is associated with faster return to normal activities and with lower rates of persisting pain. No clear differences were observed with respect to operative complications or persisting numbness.</P>
<P>It has been suggested that specific types of repair may be optimal for different types of patients, such as those with recurrent, bilateral or femoral hernias. However, although we were able to collect the raw data for many trials, there were still insufficient data to explore the differential effects of mesh or non-mesh repair for these subgroups of patients.</P>
<P>We also found insufficient evidence to reliably address different types of open mesh repair, particularly flat mesh and plug and mesh repair.</P>
<P>In addition to the open approaches to mesh repair reviewed here, mesh can also be placed laparoscopically, using minimal access techniques. We have considered this method in a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-McCormack-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormack 2002</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The use of mesh during open groin hernia repair is associated with a considerable reduction in the risk of hernia recurrence (OR 0.37, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.51). There are no apparent disadvantages and suggestive evidence of both less short-term and less persisting groin pain. Mesh is not available in some countries because of the associated extra costs, but an economic evaluation (not reported here) suggests that these are offset over one to four years by the reduced costs of reoperation following recurrence.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>To our knowledge this is the first time that trialists in general surgery have collaborated in this way by contributing their trial data for the purposes of a systematic review. We have demonstrated that, although costly, the collection of IPD can greatly enhance the data available for a Cochrane systematic review compared with using published data alone.</P>
<P>An important finding was less persisting pain after mesh repair. However, this was based on a minority of trials and we use a broad 'inclusive' definition. Further research could clarify whether there really is less persisting pain after mesh repair and, if so, whether this applies to severe pain. Also, the site of any persisting pain may depend on the type of repair and this too merits further research.</P>
<P>There are currently too few data to allow reliable comparisons of alternative types of open mesh repair, and to test for differential effects of mesh versus non-mesh in the specific subgroups of recurrent hernia, bilateral hernia and femoral hernia. Ideally, further trials should be conducted in these specific clinical groupings.</P>
