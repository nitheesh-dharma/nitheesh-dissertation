<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-05-28 13:33:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bleeding into the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) occurs mainly in infants born before term (37 weeks' gestation) because of severe lung disease (particularly respiratory distress syndrome, a disease caused by the lack of the normal lining chemicals of the lung (surfactant))
 and the need for a breathing machine (assisted ventilation). The risk factors for pulmonary haemorrhage include preterm birth, poor growth while in the womb (intrauterine growth restriction), respiratory problems, abnormal blood flow around the blood vessels in the lungs (patent ductus arteriosus), bleeding problems (coagulopathy), the need for a breathing machine and surfactant treatment. The underlining cause of pulmonary haemorrhage is thought to be a rapid increase in pulmonary blood flow due to a patent ductus arteriosus. Some studies have shown promising results with the use of surfactant treatment in infants with pulmonary haemorrhage. However, no randomised controlled trials were identified in this review. Currently, no recommendation for clinical practice based on randomised controlled trials can be presented; further research is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-05-28 13:33:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the 1960s and 1970s, pulmonary haemorrhage (PH) occurred mainly in full-term infants with pre-existing illness with an incidence of 1.3 per 1000 live births. Risk factors for PH included severity of illness, intrauterine growth restriction, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), coagulopathy and the need for assisted ventilation. Presently, PH occurs in 3% to 5% of preterm ventilated infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) who often have a PDA and have received surfactant. The cause of PH is thought to be due to rapid lowering of intrapulmonary pressure, which facilitates left to right shunting across a PDA and an increase in pulmonary blood flow. Retrospective case reports and one prospective uncontrolled study have shown promising results for surfactant in treating PH.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-05-28 13:40:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-05-28 13:40:36 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the incidence of pulmonary haemorrhage (PH) was quoted as 1.3 per 1000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1973</LINK>). Currently, PH complicates the hospital course of 3% to 5% of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (<LINK REF="REF-Wiswell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiswell 2001</LINK>). PH occurs mainly in preterm ventilated infants with severe RDS, who often have a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and who have received surfactant (<LINK REF="REF-Papworth-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papworth 2001</LINK>). Risk factors for PH include severity of associated illness, intrauterine growth restriction, PDA, coagulopathy and surfactant therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Papworth-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papworth 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the early 1970s, Cole et al (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1973</LINK>) conducted a study on 15 infants with sudden clinical deterioration associated with blood-
stained liquid flowing from their tracheas. The investigators performed clinical observations, coagulation studies, and analyses of simultaneously obtained samples of lung effluent and arterial or venous blood for haematocrit and protein composition. In most cases, the haemorrhagic effluent was oedema fluid and not whole blood. The most important precipitating factor for PH was acute left ventricular failure due to asphyxia. Coagulation disorders probably served to exacerbate the condition, but did not appear to be the initiating factor (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1973</LINK>).</P>
<P>PH appears to be a complication of surfactant therapy. In a meta-analysis of seven placebo-controlled trials using synthetic surfactant and four trials using animal-derived surfactant given either as prophylaxis or treatment of RDS, surfactant therapy was associated with an increased risk of PH (typical risk ratio (RR) 1.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 2.07) indicating an increased risk for PH with surfactant treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Raju-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raju 1993</LINK>). In five multicentre, placebo-controlled trials of the synthetic surfactant Exosurf Neonatal in infants weighing at least 700 g, the incidence of clinical PH was 1.9% in treated infants and 1.0% in control infants (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Houten-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Houten 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are several Cochrane reviews on the use of surfactant in neonates that report on PH (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soll-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 2007</LINK>). The RR for PH was statistically significantly increased with the use of prophylactic synthetic surfactant versus control treatment (intratracheal administration of normal saline or air placebo) (typical RR 3.28; 95% CI 1.50 to 7.16) (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1997</LINK>) but not for treatment of established RDS versus control (intratracheal administration of air placebo) (typical RR 1.44; 95% CI 0.68 to 3.05) (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 1997</LINK>). In contrast to clinical diagnosis, the pathological diagnosis of PH at postmortem was not more common in infants treated with Exosurf Neonatal (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Houten-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Houten 1994</LINK>). Surfactant therapy may be a contributing factor, causing PH by inducing a rapid lowering of intrapulmonary pressure, which facilitates left-to-right shunting across a PDA and an increase in pulmonary blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Wiswell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiswell 2001</LINK>). Surfactant may be associated with in-vitro cytotoxicity. The degree of cytotoxicity differs for different surfactants and different dosages (<LINK REF="REF-Findlay-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Findlay 1995</LINK>). These activities may be initiated at the two-cell interface of the alveolar-capillary membrane barrier, with PH occurring as a result of disruption of membrane integrity at this interface (<LINK REF="REF-Findlay-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Findlay 1995</LINK>). In a postmortem study, infants treated with surfactant who developed PH were shown to have more extensive intra-alveolar haemorrhage compared to infants with PH who were not treated with surfactant (<LINK REF="REF-Pappin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pappin 1994</LINK>). In neonates treated with surfactant, moderate and severe PH is associated with an increased risk of death and short-term morbidity, but not with increased long-term morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Pandit-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandit 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-05-28 13:34:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although surfactant therapy may be a contributing to factor leading to PH, PH has been effectively managed using surfactant instillation, including in those infants who have previously been treated with surfactant (<LINK REF="REF-Pandit-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandit 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Amizuka-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amizuka 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finer 2004</LINK>). It may seem counterintuitive that surfactant therapy should be suggested for treatment of this disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Wiswell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiswell 2001</LINK>). However, haemoglobin, plasma proteins and cell membrane lipids (molecular components in haemorrhagic pulmonary oedema) can inactivate endogenous lung surfactant and adversely affect lung mechanics (<LINK REF="REF-Holm-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holm 1987</LINK>). Exogenous surfactant replacement can reverse this process even in the continued presence of inhibitor molecules (<LINK REF="REF-Holm-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holm 1987</LINK>) and thus has potential utility in the therapy of PH in preterm infants. Surfactant treatment has been suggested in the context of other lung aspirations such as meconium (<LINK REF="REF-Finer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-El-Shahed-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">El Shahed 2007</LINK>). In a Cochrane systematic review El Shahed et al (<LINK REF="REF-El-Shahed-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">El Shahed 2007</LINK>) identified four trials including 326 infants testing the effect of surfactant in infants with meconium aspiration syndrome. The authors concluded that: "In infants with meconium aspiration syndrome, surfactant administration may reduce the severity of respiratory illness and decrease the number of infants with progressive respiratory failure requiring support with ECMO [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]. The relative efficacy of surfactant therapy compared to, or in conjunction with, other approaches to treatment including inhaled nitric oxide, liquid ventilation, surfactant lavage and high frequency ventilation remains to be tested".</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-05-28 13:34:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In a retrospective case series of 15 neonates treated with surfactant following PH, Pandit et al (<LINK REF="REF-Pandit-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandit 1995</LINK>) noted improvement in the oxygen index three to six hours following surfactant treatment. No infant deteriorated following surfactant treatment. The primary respiratory diagnosis was RDS in eight infants (all had received surfactant prior to the PH), meconium aspiration syndrome in three infants, and isolated PH in four infants. Amizuka et al (<LINK REF="REF-Amizuka-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amizuka 2003</LINK>) treated 26 out of 27 neonates with haemorrhagic pulmonary oedema/PH occurring at 1.5 hours ± 0.1 hours (mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM)) after birth with surfactant. Treatment was at 3.0 hours ± 1.3 hours after the onset of PH. A good response to exogenous surfactant, defined as ventilatory index &lt; 0.047 at one hour after surfactant administration, was seen in 82% of cases. Both Pandit et al (<LINK REF="REF-Pandit-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandit 1995</LINK>) and Amizuka et al (<LINK REF="REF-Amizuka-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amizuka 2003</LINK>) recommended further investigations, including randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of surfactant for PH.</P>

<P>For this update <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 2, 2012; MEDLINE; EMBASE' CINAHL; Clinicaltrials.gov; Controlled-trials.com' proceedings (2000 to 2011) of the Annual Meetings of the Pediatric Academic Societies (Abstracts2View) and Web of Science were searched on 8 February 2012.</P>
<P>For the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Aziz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aziz 2008</LINK>) the following databases were searched:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 4, 2007),</LI>
<LI>using the OVID interface: MEDLINE from 1966 and EMBASE from 1980 to time of full review (January 2008).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Surfactant search terms in EMBASE were the EMTREE terms 'lung surfactant' and 'surfactant', and in MEDLINE, the MeSH term 'pulmonary surfactants'. To ensure that all potentially relevant references would be retrieved, additional search terms were identified by looking at the 'Used For' sections of the scope notes of each EMTREE and MEDLINE term. All additional terms were then searched in both EMBASE and MEDLINE using the command '.mp,hw.' to designate the fields in which the search should be conducted. The resultant search sets were combined using the Boolean operator 'OR' to create a single set of results.</P>
<P>Alveolar haemorrhage search terms used in EMBASE were the EMTREE term 'lung haemorrhage' and additional terms identified by looking at the 'Used For' sections of the scope notes for the EMTREE term. The truncation symbol colon ":" was used to replace the last letter 'e' in each instance of the word haemorrhage or haemorrhage to account for variations in word endings. The additional terms identified for the EMBASE search, as well as the phrase 'lung haemorrhage' were used to search MEDLINE. In both databases, to ensure that all potentially relevant references were retrieved, the search command '.mp,hw.' was used to designate the fields in which the search for terms should be conducted. The resultant search sets were combined using Boolean operator 'OR' to create a single set of results. The set of surfactant terms were combined with the set of alveolar search terms using the Boolean operator 'AND'. This final set of results was not limited by age or language.</P>
<P>Science Citation Index (Web of Science) was searched for authors quoting the publications by Pandit et al (<LINK REF="REF-Pandit-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandit 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pandit-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandit 1999</LINK>).</P>

We would note whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we would re-included missing data in the analyses. We would categorise the methods with respect to the risk of attrition bias as:</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate (&lt; 10% missing data);<BR/>High risk - inadequate (&gt; 10% missing data);<BR/>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided.</P>

<LI>Reporting bias</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each included study, we would describe how we investigated the risk of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We would assess the methods as:</P>
<P>Low risk - adequate (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);<BR/>High risk - inadequate (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);<BR/>Unclear risk - no or unclear information provided (the study protocol was not available).</P>

<UL>
<LI>Other bias</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each included study, we would describe any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We would assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>Low risk - no concerns of other bias raised;<BR/>High risk - concerns raised about multiple looks at the data with the results made known to the investigators, difference in number of patients enrolled in abstract and final publications of the paper;<BR/>Unclear - concerns raised about potential sources of bias that could not be verified by contacting the authors.</P>

<P>We would make explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We would assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it was likely to impact on the findings.

<P>We planned to perform statistical analyses according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (<A HREF="http://neonatal.cochrane.org/en/index.html">neonatal.cochrane.org/en/index.html</A>).

We planned to use a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis in the first instance to combine the data. Where substantial heterogeneity existed, the potential cause of heterogeneity would be examined in subgroup and sensitivity analyses. When we judged meta-analysis to be inappropriate, we planned to analyse and interpret individual trials separately. For estimates of typical RR and RD, we would use the Mantel-Haenszel method.

<P>No randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials were identified through an extensive literature search conducted in July 2007 and February 2012. One review made no reference to any randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lacaze_x002d_Masmonteil-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lacaze-Masmonteil 2007</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-04-16 11:06:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No trials were identified for inclusion in this review.</P>
<P>Observational studies have shown promising results in physiological variables when surfactant has been used to treat PH. In a retrospective case series of 15 neonates treated with surfactant following PH, Pandit et al (<LINK REF="REF-Pandit-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pandit 1995</LINK>) noted improvement in the oxygen index following surfactant treatment. One infant died from infection and BPD and an additional four infants developed BPD. Amizuka et al (<LINK REF="REF-Amizuka-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amizuka 2003</LINK>) gave surfactant to 26 of a total of 27 neonates with PH occurring soon after birth. A good response to exogenous surfactant, defined as ventilatory index &lt; 0.047 at one hour after surfactant administration, was seen in 82% of cases. No neonate died or developed BPD. These observations need to be confirmed in well-designed and conducted randomised controlled trials, which include the primary and secondary outcomes identified in this review. Until such trials have been conducted, no recommendations for clinical practice based on evidence from randomised clinical trials can be made.</P>
<P>It should be noted that in a Cochrane systematic review El Shahed et al (<LINK REF="REF-El-Shahed-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">El Shahed 2007</LINK>) identified four trials involving 326 infants that tested the effect of surfactant in infants with meconium aspiration syndrome. The authors concluded: "In infants with meconium aspiration syndrome, surfactant administration may reduce the severity of respiratory illness and decrease the number of infants with progressive respiratory failure requiring support with ECMO. The relative efficacy of surfactant therapy compared to, or in conjunction with, other approaches to treatment including inhaled nitric oxide, liquid ventilation, surfactant lavage and high frequency ventilation remains to be tested". Surfactant could potentially be an effective treatment of aspiration of a number of substances such as antenatal aspiration of meconium, blood, vernix and amniotic fluid or postnatal aspiration of blood.</P>

<P>The data available from retrospective and prospective uncontrolled studies that have shown a potential benefit of surfactant for PH justify the conduct of randomised controlled trials. Infants enrolled in such trials should be stratified by preterm/term status. The primary outcome should be all-cause mortality during initial hospital stay. Secondary outcomes should include those listed in this review.</P>
