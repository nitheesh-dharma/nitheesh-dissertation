<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Combined calcium, magnesium and potassium supplementation for the management of primary hypertension in adults</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Elevated blood pressure (BP) or hypertension can lead to cardiovascular disease, stroke and renal disease. Epidemiological studies suggest that changing the dietary levels of calcium, potassium, magnesium or sodium can affect BP in some people. This systematic review focuses on the effects of concurrently attempting to change any combination of calcium, magnesium, or potassium levels in the diet of adults with primary hypertension.</P>
<P>This review found no robust evidence to suggest that combinations of potassium, calcium or magnesium can reduce high blood pressure (BP) in adults. Only three trials assessing a total of 277 participants were found. The only combination assessed by all three trials was potassium and magnesium, demonstrating a statistically non-significant reduction in BP among people receiving this combination. One trial assessed both calcium &amp; magnesium and calcium &amp; potassium and found that neither combination had very much effect on BP. None of the trials were of high quality, so their results may not be reliable. Very few mild adverse effects were reported. These were of short duration and participants did not have to stop taking their treatment. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Previous research suggests that increasing dietary intakes of calcium, potassium or magnesium separately may reduce BP to a small degree over the short term. It is unclear whether increasing intakes of a combination of these minerals produces a larger reduction in BP.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effects of combined mineral supplementation as a treatment for primary hypertension in adults.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, CAB abstracts, and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review. The search was unrestricted by language or publication status.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Inclusion criteria were: 1) RCTs of a parallel or crossover design comparing oral supplements comprising a combination of potassium, and/or calcium, and/or magnesium with placebo, no treatment, or usual care; 2) treatment and follow-up &gt;=8 weeks; 3) participants over 18 years old, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;=140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;=85 mmHg with no known primary cause; 4) SBP and DBP reported at end of follow-up. We excluded trials where participants were pregnant, or received antihypertensive medication which changed during the study.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-13 12:00:51 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>We included three RCTs (n=277) with 24-28 weeks follow-up. Three combinations of minerals were investigated: potassium-magnesium, calcium-magnesium, and calcium-potassium. One trial investigated combinations of calcium-magnesium and of calcium-potassium, and for each found a statistically non-significant increase in both SBP and DBP. All three trials investigated the potassium-magnesium combination. None of the trials provided mortality or morbidity data. The potassium-magnesium combination compared to control resulted in statistically non-significant reductions in both SBP (mean difference = -4.6 mmHg, 95% CI: -9.9 to 0.7) and DBP (mean difference = -3.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -9.5 to 1.8), although the results were heterogeneous (I<SUP>2</SUP>=68% and 85% for SBP and DBP respectively).</P>
<P>A sensitivity analysis using alternative reported values which accounted for missing data had very little effect on DBP but resulted in a larger, statistically significant reduction in SBP (mean difference = -5.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -10.5 to -1.0).</P>
<P>The quality of the trials was not well reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>We found no robust evidence that supplements of any combination of potassium, magnesium or calcium reduce mortality, morbidity or BP in adults. More trials are needed to investigate whether the combination of potassium &amp; magnesium is effective. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-13 11:44:06 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Elevated blood pressure (BP) or hypertension can be associated with a variety of structural changes in the blood vessels and heart which can lead to cardiovascular disease, stroke and renal disease. It is one of the ten leading risk factors influencing the global burden of disease and is estimated to lead to over 7 million deaths each year, about 13% of the total deaths worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). In England and Wales, hypertension (defined as BP&gt;140/90 mmHg) affects about 40% of the population (<LINK REF="REF-Primatesta-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Primatesta 2001</LINK>); heart disease and stroke account for over 30% of all deaths and over 4 million bed days annually in secondary care, 8% of the total capacity of the National Health Service (<LINK REF="REF-OHE-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">OHE 2001</LINK>). The most common form of hypertension, occurring in around 95% of all cases, is primary hypertension which is defined as high BP with no identifiable cause (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1997</LINK>). Secondary hypertension is elevated BP where a cause has been identified, e.g. renal disease or endocrine disturbances.</P>
<P>Epidemiological studies suggest that changing the dietary levels of calcium, potassium, magnesium or sodium can affect BP in some people. BP has been reported to decrease with a reduction in sodium intake (<LINK REF="REF-Buemi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buemi 2002</LINK>) or an increase in calcium (<LINK REF="REF-Cappuccio-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cappuccio 1995</LINK>), potassium (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 1999</LINK>) or magnesium (<LINK REF="REF-Mizushima-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mizushima 1998</LINK>). A trial of dietary interventions to reduce hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-DASH" TYPE="REFERENCE">DASH</LINK>) found a marked reduction in blood pressure after 8 weeks follow-up among hypertensive participants on a "combination" diet high in potassium and magnesium, compared to those on a control diet low in these minerals; however, as the "combination" diet also had other differences than the control diet (eg. higher fibre and protein intake), it is not possible to know what component(s) of the diet may have been responsible for the decrease in blood pressure. </P>
<P>The functions and cellular concentrations of calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium in the body are inter-related. They are all involved in muscle contraction and nervous system function. Sodium affects BP in two ways: it leads to retention of water which increases the volume of blood and hence the pressure in the blood vessels and cardiac output; and it increases the activity of the renin-angiotensin system which is one of the body's primary mechanisms for controlling BP (<LINK REF="REF-Laragh-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laragh 1995</LINK>). Three recent meta-analyses have shown that interventions to restrict the intake of sodium can reduce BP by a small amount (<LINK REF="REF-He-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Jurgens-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jurgens 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Potassium and sodium work together to maintain the correct amount of fluid (osmotic balance) inside cells. Boosting potassium intake increases sodium excretion and hence is likely to reduce BP (<LINK REF="REF-Laragh-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laragh 1995</LINK>). Raising calcium levels in the diet increases the excretion of sodium and also affects the function of calcium-active hormones, both potential mechanisms by which it could reduce BP (<LINK REF="REF-Laragh-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laragh 1995</LINK>). Magnesium can decrease BP both directly by relaxing blood vessels and indirectly through ion exchange mechanisms which alter cellular concentrations of ions.</P>
<P>Meta-analyses have suggest that increasing intakes of calcium or potassium separately may cause a small reduction in BP (<LINK REF="REF-Bucher-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucher 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Whelton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whelton 1997</LINK>). However, recent meta-analyses have called those conclusions into question with regard to calcium (<LINK REF="REF-Dickinson-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickinson 2006a</LINK>), magnesium (<LINK REF="REF-Dickinson-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickinson 2006b</LINK>) and potassium (<LINK REF="REF-Dickinson-2006c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickinson 2006c</LINK>) (see discussion). Despite this, the consequence of altering dietary intakes of these minerals may be cumulative, so that apparently insignificant results of increases in levels of individual minerals may combine to make an effective therapy. A potential complicating factor is that some people may be more sensitive to sodium chloride than others: not only is their BP more sensitive to levels of sodium, but the impact of other ions on their BP may be sensitive to sodium levels. Furthermore, response to increases in dietary intakes of these minerals may partly depend on their existing levels in the diet, type of medication, or level of hypertension. We have found no systematic reviews of the effects of changing dietary intake of several minerals simultaneously.</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to summarise the evidence about the benefits and harms of concurrently changing any combination of calcium, magnesium, or potassium levels in the diet of patients with primary hypertension, in order to inform decisions about recommendations for treatment.</P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included RCTs of parallel or crossover design that had an intervention period of at least 8 weeks and allowed an intention to treat analysis. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adults over 18 years of age, with elevated BP (a minimum of 140 mmHg for SBP or 85 mmHg for DBP), without a known primary cause. The inclusion criterion for DBP is slightly lower than the standard (90 mmHg) for hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-JNC-VII-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">JNC VII 2003</LINK>) since lifestyle interventions are often recommended for patients at the lower end of the spectrum of raised BP. We excluded:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>studies of pregnant women, since hypertension during pregnancy is often due to syndromes such as preeclampsia, with a pathophysiology very different from that of other forms of hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2000</LINK>)</LI>
<LI>studies including patients on anti-hypertensive medication which varied during the course of the study, since the results of such studies are difficult to interpret.</LI>

</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<UL>
<LI>Intervention: increased consumption of at least two of calcium, potassium, or magnesium simultaneously. </LI>
<LI>Control: placebo, no treatment, or usual care.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>We restricted the review to trials in which the active intervention consisted of dietary supplements (such as tablets or modified table salt). We excluded trials where dietary advice or a particular foodstuff was used to modify the intake of calcium, potassium, or magnesium, as other substances occurring in the foodstuff may confound the effect of these minerals.</P>

<BR/>If the mean or standard deviation of final BP was not reported, the difference in BP between randomisation and the end of the study (change score) was used instead, if its standard deviation was available. If BP was measured both supine and standing, supine measurements were preferred; if BP was measured both sitting and supine, sitting measurements were preferred. If blood pressure was measured in clinic and at home or in the workplace, clinic measurements were preferred. If only ambulatory blood pressure was measured, 12/7 was added to these measurements, as the British Hypertension Society recommends an upward correction of 12/7 mmHg to ambulatory values before comparing them with clinic values (<LINK REF="REF-Bruce-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruce 1999</LINK>).</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>All titles and abstracts retrieved by electronic searching were screened independently by two reviewers and those studies which clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded. Copies of the full text of potentially relevant references were obtained and their eligibility was assessed by one of two methods: one reviewer was primary assessor and decisions were checked by a second reviewer or assessments were done independently by two reviewers. Differences between reviewers were resolved by discussion or by appeal to a third reviewer. </P>
<P>Methodological quality of included trials was assessed independently by two reviewers using the following criteria:</P>
<P>
<U>Blinding</U> <BR/>We coded the blinding of participants, treatment providers and outcome assessors as:<BR/>

<LI>yes</LI>
<LI>no</LI>

</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (A) i.e. where the allocation sequence could not be foretold</LI>
<LI>inadequate (B) e.g. a method of allocation which allowed treatment providers to predict which arm of the trial the next participant was assigned to; this included use of sealed opaque envelopes;</LI>
<LI>unclear (C) e.g. not reported.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
<U>Loss to follow-up</U>
<BR/>We recorded the number of participants in each intervention arm whose blood pressure was not reported at the end of the study. We noted if loss to follow-up was not reported.</P>
<P>
<U>Carryover effects</U>
<BR/>For crossover trials, we noted whether carryover effects were assessed and, if so, whether any were detected.</P>
<P>Two reviewers used a prespecified form to independently abstract endpoint data and data which might facilitate interpretation of any heterogeneity in the findings of trials: country in which the study was conducted, inclusion criteria, patient characteristics at baseline (age, gender, ethnicity, mean blood pressure, whether previously treated with antihypertensive drugs, sodium chloride sensitivity), intervention (e.g. dose of calcium, magnesium, potassium; whether combined with other interventions such as restricted sodium chloride intake), trial quality and duration of follow-up . Differences were reconciled by discussion or by consultation with a third reviewer. Authors were contacted for missing endpoint data.</P>
<P>We planned to aggregate in a meta-analysis the findings of trials which investigated the same combination of minerals. For crossover trials, the estimated treatment effect and its standard error were abstracted. For parallel trials, the treatment effect was estimated from the difference in BP between intervention and control (based on either final values or change scores as available), and its standard error was calculated from the standard deviations of the final values (or change scores) in each treatment arm. These estimated treatment effects were aggregated using a random effects model within the generic inverse variance facility of RevMan. We considered clinical heterogeneity between trials in a narrative discussion and assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). A sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the robustness of the results of the meta-analysis using change scores rather than final values for the one study for which both were available (<LINK REF="STD-Geleijnse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Geleijnse 1994</LINK>). We interpreted the findings of the meta-analyses in relation to the quality of the included studies, in particular: (i) adequate concealment of allocation, (ii) double blinding, (iii) triple blinding, and (iv) reporting of data which allowed estimation of the standard deviation of the treatment effect. </P>
<P>For parallel trials, we assessed the tolerability of the intervention by calculating the difference in the rate of withdrawal in treatment and control arms, and using a random effects model to calculate a pooled risk difference. Crossover trials are designed with the intention that all participants receive both the active and control interventions, and the treatment effect is estimated from the differences in response of the same participant to the different treatments. Hence participants who withdraw from either treatment cannot be included in the analysis and so the question of differential withdrawal between treatment arms does not arise. </P>
<P>Adverse effects and withdrawals were assessed where feasible by grouping them appropriately (e.g. gastro-intestinal, other), calculating the difference in the rate of such effects in treatment and control arms, and using a random effects model to estimate a pooled risk difference.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Geleijnse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Geleijnse 1994</LINK> randomised 100 participants and <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1995</LINK> randomised 140. <LINK REF="STD-Patki-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patki 1990</LINK> stated that 37 participants completed the trial but did not specify the number initially randomised.</P>
<P>The entry criteria in the three included RCTs were similar with respect to DBP, requiring participants to be mildly hypertensive (DBP=85-110 mmHg). In <LINK REF="STD-Patki-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patki 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Geleijnse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Geleijnse 1994</LINK>, nearly all patients had previously been on medication to lower BP, whereas in <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1995</LINK> they were nearly all treatment naive and had a lower baseline SBP. All patients were free of anti-hypertensive medication throughout the trials. Mean baseline BP across the three trials was 148/92 mmHg. Exclusion criteria were similar, except that <LINK REF="STD-Patki-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patki 1990</LINK> did not exclude patients with diabetes (neither was any incidence of diabetes reported), whereas the other two did. </P>
<P>The mean ages were 50 years (range not reported), 66 years (range: 55-75) and 53 years (range: 21-70) in <LINK REF="STD-Patki-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patki 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Geleijnse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Geleijnse 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1995</LINK> respectively. The gender mix of participants was very different between trials: 22%, 51% and 66% male respectively. The ethnicity of participants was only reported in <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1995</LINK> where 65% were white, 27% were black, 5% were Asian and 3% Hispanic. Although <LINK REF="STD-Patki-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patki 1990</LINK> did not specifically report ethnicity, it can be assumed that most participants were Asian because the trial was conducted in India. </P>
<P>Only one of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1995</LINK>) reported the dietary calcium, magnesium or potassium intakes of the populations studied, but the other two reported baseline serum concentrations. All studies reported the baseline levels of the minerals excreted in the urine. Vitamin D status was not reported in any of the trials.</P>
<P>
<U>Interventions</U>
<BR/>Each trial administered a different combination of minerals by a different method. <LINK REF="STD-Patki-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patki 1990</LINK> provided potassium supplementation <I>(</I>2340 mg/day<I>)</I> both alone and in combination with magnesium <I>(</I>480 mg/day<I>)</I> in a liquid formulation which was taken mixed with 200ml water twice daily. <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1995</LINK> provided supplements as slow-release tablets in combinations of magnesium &amp; calcium, potassium &amp; magnesium or potassium &amp; calcium (1000 mg/day calcium, 360 mg/day magnesium and 2340 mg/day potassium in each case). Both of these trials used identical placebos as controls. In <LINK REF="STD-Geleijnse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Geleijnse 1994</LINK> participants received meals prepared with a mineral salt which was high in potassium and magnesium (ratio of sodium:potassium:magnesium=8:6:1, giving an extra <I>7</I>02 mg/day potassium and 168 mg/day magnesium, and a reduction of 874 mg/day of sodium)<I>.</I> The control for this trial was meals prepared using common table salt (sodium only). Participants from each group also used the different minerals at the table as a substitute for common salt (sodium chloride). (Conversion factors for the weights of the minerals are: 1 g calcium=25 mmol; 1 g magnesium=41.1 mmol; 1 g potassium=25.6 mmol). </P>
<P>Participants were followed up for 24 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Geleijnse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Geleijnse 1994</LINK>), 26 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1995</LINK>) and 28 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Patki-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patki 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<U>Outcomes</U>
<BR/>None of the trials were designed to investigate cardiovascular outcomes and none of them reported whether participants experienced any of these events. Other outcomes were reported: final blood pressure in <LINK REF="STD-Geleijnse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Geleijnse 1994</LINK> (with standard errors) and <LINK REF="STD-Patki-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patki 1990</LINK> (with standard deviations), and change scores in <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1995</LINK>. Geleijnse also reported the difference in BP change scores between study groups. <LINK REF="STD-Geleijnse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Geleijnse 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Patki-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patki 1990</LINK> reported serum levels of each of calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium electrolytes, and <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1995</LINK> reported urinary excretion of each of these. Although BP was measured in the clinic in all the trials, two of them (<LINK REF="STD-Geleijnse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Geleijnse 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1995</LINK>) took the average of 3 seated BP readings, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Patki-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patki 1990</LINK> used a single BP reading either supine or standing. </P>
<P>
<U>Adverse effects</U> <BR/>All three trials reported occurrence of mild adverse effects, although only Patki specified exactly what these effects were. The other trials merely stated that they were mild and occurred equally across all groups.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Geleijnse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Geleijnse 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Patki-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patki 1990</LINK> both reported statistically significant reductions in DBP among participants receiving the active intervention compared to control (mean difference = -4.1 mmHg, 95% CI: -7.4 to -0.8 and -9.6 mmHg, 95% CI: -14.9 to -4.4 respectively). Both also reported reductions in SBP but in the case of Geleijnse it was not statistically significant: (mean difference = -5.1 mmHg, 95% CI: -10.4 to 0.2 and -8.9 mmHg, 95% CI: -13.8 to -4.0) respectively. <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1995</LINK> reported little difference in either SBP or DBP (mean difference = 0.4 mmHg, 95% CI: -5.0 to 5.8 and 1.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -1.9 to 4.3 respectively).</P>
<P>Overall, the meta-analysis showed small, statistically non-significant reductions in both SBP and DBP (mean difference = -4.6 mmHg, 95% CI: -9.9 to 0.7 and -3.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -9.5 to -1.8<I> </I>respectively) among participants receiving the combination, with substantial heterogeneity for both SBP (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 68%) and DBP (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 85%).</P>

<BR/>Although final BP values were used to calculate the treatment effect for <LINK REF="STD-Geleijnse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Geleijnse 1994</LINK>, the paper also reported the difference between treatment arms in the change in BP between baseline and end of follow-up, with confidence intervals.

The reduction in DBP changed very little (mean difference = -3.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -7.6 to 1.2) but the reduction in SBP increased and became statistically significant (mean difference = -5.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -10.5 to -1.0).</P>

<B>Withdrawals</B>
<BR/>All three trials narratively reported good compliance with the interventions. In <LINK REF="STD-Geleijnse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Geleijnse 1994</LINK> two patients withdrew from the control group and 1 from the intervention group (3% in total) for reasons not associated with the trial. In <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1995</LINK> eight patients spread across the four groups (6%) withdrew from the trial because their DBP increased to over 102 mmHg. Additionally 13 patients (9%) withdrew for reasons not associated with the trial, giving an overall withdrawal rate of 15%. Meta-analysis of these trials confirmed that there was no significant difference in the proportion of withdrawals between the treatment and control groups (risk difference=-0.01, 95% CI: -0.07 to 0.05, see <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). There was no indication of differential withdrawals due to adverse events, but these were not reported according to treatment arm so a meta-analysis was impossible. <LINK REF="STD-Patki-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patki 1990</LINK> did not report withdrawals.</P>

The latter two trials did not specify what the side effects were nor report numbers of participants experiencing them by treatment arm, so it was impossible to categorise and pool them as planned.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>
<U>Overview</U>
<BR/>This review found only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1995</LINK>) that investigated the effect on BP of combining a) calcium &amp; magnesium and b) calcium &amp; potassium supplements. This provided no evidence of reduction in BP in response to these combinations. For calcium &amp; magnesium a small, statistically non-significant increase in both SBP and DBP was reported, and for calcium &amp; potassium little change in BP was found.</P>
<P>Three trials investigated the effect of combined potassium &amp; magnesium on BP. The meta-analysis showed statistically non-significant reductions in both SBP and DBP (mean differences of -4.6 mmHg, 95% CI: -9.9 to 0.7 and -3.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -9.5 to 1.8 respectively). The sensitivity analysis using alternative change score values for <LINK REF="STD-Geleijnse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Geleijnse 1994</LINK> made very little difference to the reduction in DBP, but the reduction in SBP increased and became statistically significant.</P>
<P>
<U>Strength of evidence</U>
<BR/>The findings of the meta-analysis should be treated with caution for several reasons:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The methodological quality of the trials was generally not well reported: allocation concealment was either inadequate or unclear in all trials and in only one was it clear that the randomisation procedure was adequate. All trials blinded the participant and the treatment provider adequately, but in each case it was unclear whether the person measuring BP was blinded as well.</LI>
<LI>The evidence is gathered from a total of only 277 participants.</LI>
<LI>In the crossover study (<LINK REF="STD-Patki-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patki 1990</LINK>) it is unclear whether there were carryover effects.</LI>
<LI>Three different mineral combinations were compared with the same placebo group in <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1995</LINK>, which means the same control population was used in each of the three comparisons. If this control group was unusual in any way, it would have undue influence on the findings.</LI>
<LI>The trials showed substantial heterogeneity in terms of participant characteristics, measurement of BP outcomes, dose of minerals ingested and method of administration. </LI>
<LI>Although DBP was part of the inclusion criteria of each trial and baseline DBP was broadly similar, SBP at baseline was much lower in <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1995</LINK> than the other two trials. Sacks noted that previous trials of potassium supplementation (alone) had shown a larger effect when participants' baseline BP had been higher, and little or no effect if the participants were normotensive (<LINK REF="REF-Geleijnse-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geleijnse 2003</LINK>). The lack of effect of the supplement in this trial was attributed by the authors to the low baseline SBP which barely falls into the category of hypertensive. <B>
<I> </I>
</B>
</LI>
<LI>BP outcomes were measured differently: <LINK REF="STD-Patki-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patki 1990</LINK> used single measures whereas the other two trials used the average of three measurements, which would tend to decrease the variance. </LI>
<LI>The dose of minerals was very different between the trials: <LINK REF="STD-Geleijnse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Geleijnse 1994</LINK> used a much smaller dose and also was the only trial which reduced participants' sodium intake in the treatment group. A reduction in sodium has been reported to reduce BP (<LINK REF="REF-Hooper-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooper 2002</LINK>), so this could partly explain the relatively large BP reductions reported here. </LI>
<LI>The method of administration of the treatments and frequency of intake was also different between trials: tablets two or three times a day in <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 1995</LINK>; liquid mixed with water twice a day in <LINK REF="STD-Patki-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Patki 1990</LINK>; and continual intake as part of the daily diet in <LINK REF="STD-Geleijnse-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Geleijnse 1994</LINK>.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>Withdrawals are unlikely to have introduced bias, since the proportion of patients who withdrew from treatment was similar in treatment and control groups. Most withdrawals were not associated with adverse effects.</P>
<P>
<U>Previous work</U>
<BR/>We found no existing systematic reviews which investigated the effect of combining potassium, magnesium or calcium on BP. Some meta-analytic evidence suggests that calcium supplements may have a small effect on lowering high BP over the short term (<LINK REF="REF-Bucher-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucher 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Dickinson-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickinson 2006a</LINK>, in a meta-analyses restricted to trials with a follow-up greater than 8 weeks, found a similar effect but suggested that this small effect was due to bias resulting from the inclusion of poor quality studies. Meta-analyses have found no evidence of a BP lowering effect from supplements of magnesium alone (<LINK REF="REF-Jee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jee 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Dickinson-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickinson 2006b</LINK>). In a meta-analysis of 21 RCTs with no restriction on length of follow-up, <LINK REF="REF-Whelton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whelton 1997</LINK> reported that potassium supplements resulted in a significant reduction in BP. However, <LINK REF="REF-Dickinson-2006c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickinson 2006c</LINK>, in a meta-analysis restricted to five RCTs with at least 8 weeks follow-up, found a substantial but statistically non-significant reduction in BP.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis in the current review suggests that potassium supplements may produce a small reduction in BP. This is consistent with the findings of the meta-analyses of trials of potassium supplements reported by <LINK REF="REF-Whelton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whelton 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Dickinson-2006c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickinson 2006c</LINK>. Because hypertension is so common, small changes in BP across the general population could substantially affect the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. However, in our meta-analysis of combined minerals, it was impossible to separate any possible effect of potassium from the reduction in dietary sodium which simultaneously occurred in one of the trials. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review found no evidence to suggest that supplements of calcium &amp; magnesium or of calcium &amp; potassium can reduce BP. While we cannot discount the possibility that potassium &amp; magnesium supplements lower BP, the evidence for this was not robust.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further trials are needed, firstly to clarify the influence of potassium supplementation (alone) on BP, and secondly to clarify the combined effect of potassium &amp; magnesium, bearing in mind that their effects may be synergistic. High quality randomised trials are required, with a large enough number of participants over a long enough time span to detect any long term effects on BP, and which are unconfounded by an alteration in sodium intake. </P>
