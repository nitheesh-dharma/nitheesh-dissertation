<P>Sexual health promotion is a major public health challenge. There is huge potential for health promotion via technology such as the Internet, but it is not known whether interventions are effective. An interactive computer-based intervention provides information, and also offers personalised feedback. We searched databases for studies which were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of computer/Internet-based interventions which aimed to improve sexual health. We included trials of computer-based interventions delivered to people of any age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity or nationality. The review evaluated 15 RCTs involving 3917 participants. Results showed that computer-based interventions have a moderate effect in improving people's knowledge about sexual health in comparison to minimal interventions such as &#8216;usual practice' or a leaflet. We also found a small effect on safer sex self-efficacy (a person's belief in their capacity to carry out a specific action), a small effect on safer-sex intentions, and also an effect on sexual behaviour (such as condom use for sexual intercourse). We found that computer-based interventions seem better than face-to-face interventions at improving sexual health knowledge, but there were insufficient data to analyse other outcomes. No studies measured potential harms (apart from reporting any deterioration in outcomes). Interactive computer-based interventions for sexual health promotion are feasible in a variety of settings. They are effective tools for learning about sexual health, and they also improve self-efficacy, intention and sexual behaviour, but more research is needed to establish whether computer-based interventions can change outcomes such as sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy, to understand how interventions might work, and to assess whether they are cost-effective.</P>

<P>We searched more than thirty databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on ICBI and sexual health, including CENTRAL, DARE, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, British Nursing Index, and PsycINFO.

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-07-08 11:18:51 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Two review authors screened abstracts, applied eligibility and quality criteria and extracted data. Results of RCTs were pooled using a random-effects model with standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (ORs) for binary outcomes. We assessed heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. Separate meta-analyses were conducted by type of comparator: 1) minimal intervention such as usual practice or leaflet, 2) face-to-face intervention or 3) a different design of ICBI; and by type of outcome (cognitive, behavioural, biological outcomes).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-07-15 11:28:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We identified 15 RCTs of ICBI conducted in various settings and populations (3917 participants). Comparing ICBI to 'minimal interventions' such as usual practice, meta-analyses showed statistically significant effects as follows: moderate effect on sexual health knowledge (SMD 0.72, 95% CI 0.<I>27</I> to 1.18); small effect on safer sex self-efficacy (SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.29); small effect on safer-sex intentions (SMD 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.30); and also an effect on sexual behaviour (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.59). Data were insufficient for meta-analysis of biological outcomes and analysis of cost-effectiveness.</P>
<P>In comparison with face-to-face sexual health interventions, meta-analysis was only possible for sexual health knowledge, showing that ICBI were more effective (SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.58). Two further trials reported no difference in knowledge between ICBI and face-to-face intervention, but data were not available for pooling. There were insufficient data to analyse other types of outcome.</P>
<P>No studies measured potential harms (apart from reporting any deterioration in measured outcomes).</P>

<P>Sexual health promotion is a major public health challenge throughout the world (<LINK REF="REF-Chambers-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DOH-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tripp-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tripp 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). For example, epidemics of sexually transmitted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are gaining hold in Eastern Europe and Asia (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2004</LINK>), and there have been marked increases in sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as genital chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis in Western Europe in the last decade (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicoll 2002</LINK>). Sexual coercion is common (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Moreno-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Moreno 2005</LINK>), as are psychosexual problems such as erectile dysfunction, orgasmic dysfunction and/or lack of sexual desire (<LINK REF="REF-Nazareth-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nazareth 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicolosi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolosi 2006</LINK>). It is evident that safe, satisfying expression of sexuality is often difficult (<LINK REF="REF-Kaschak-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaschak 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Particular socio-demographic groups are at disproportionate risk of poor sexual health, for example young people, men who have sex with men (MSM), refugees, sex workers (especially drug users and street workers) and prisoners (<LINK REF="REF-Elford-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elford 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gray-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 2002</LINK>). Sexual health concerns may not be addressed in healthcare encounters because of pressure on health services (<LINK REF="REF-White-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2005</LINK>) and patients' and physicians' reservations about raising complex and potentially sensitive topics (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gott-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gott 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Viner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viner 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Sexual health interventions</HEADING>
<P>Face-to-face interventions (such as school sex education programmes, and individual or group-based sexual health promotion) have had mixed success (<LINK REF="REF-Kirby-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rees-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Speizer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speizer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swann-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swann 2003</LINK>). Systematic reviews of face-to-face interventions show moderate success in promoting condom use (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 1999</LINK>) and reducing unprotected sex (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2008</LINK>), but much smaller impact on partner numbers (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2008</LINK>), contraceptive use (<LINK REF="REF-DiCenso-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiCenso 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>), STIs (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Underhill-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Underhill 2008</LINK>), or unplanned/unwanted pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-DiCenso-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiCenso 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Underhill-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Underhill 2008</LINK>). However, good quality evidence is often lacking for particular populations, and more needs to be known about the mechanism of action of interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Downing-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downing 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2003</LINK>). It is clear that improving sexual health presents a huge challenge, and that face-to-face behavioural interventions for individuals are only partially successful.</P>
<P>Technology such as the Internet provides access to increasing quantities of sexual health information (<LINK REF="REF-Kanuga-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanuga 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skinner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skinner 2003</LINK>). However, simply providing information does not necessarily lead to behaviour change (<LINK REF="REF-Mellanby-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mellanby 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 2003</LINK>). There are large inequalities in access to Internet technology worldwide, for example, it is estimated that 74% of people in North America have access to the Internet, 49% of people in Europe, 30% in Latin America/Caribbean, 23% in the Middle East, 17% in Asia, and only 6% in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Miniwatts-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miniwatts 2009</LINK>). Some populations at higher risk of adverse sexual health have less access to computers and the Internet, for example children not attending school, and poorer people within particular populations (<LINK REF="REF-Dutton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dutton 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gray-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kalichman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalichman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 2004</LINK>). However, Internet and mobile phone access is increasing rapidly worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Kanuga-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanuga 2004</LINK>), so there is huge potential for delivery of health promotion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Interactive computer-based interventions</HEADING>
<P>Interactive computer-based interventions (ICBI) are programmes that provide information and also decision support, behaviour-change support, and/or emotional support for health issues. 'Interactive' programmes require contributions from users to produce tailored material and feedback that is personally relevant. ICBI have been effective in promoting behaviour change in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes or heart disease, leading to improved knowledge, social support, health behaviours and clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wantland-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wantland 2004</LINK>). Computer-based interventions are also feasible in health promotion contexts such as problem drinking (<LINK REF="REF-Linke-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linke 2004</LINK>), smoking cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Strecher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strecher 1999</LINK>), and nutrition and physical activity (<LINK REF="REF-Patrick-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrick 2001</LINK>). A systematic review of computer-delivered interventions for health promotion showed improved health behaviours for nutrition, tobacco use, substance use, safer sexual behavior, and binge/purge behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Portnoy-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Portnoy 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Computer-based interventions offer potential advantages over face-to-face interventions in that access can be anonymous, repeated, and at convenient times (<LINK REF="REF-Kanuga-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanuga 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skinner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skinner 2003</LINK>). Interventions can offer individualised feedback, and can promote active learning through interactive elements (<LINK REF="REF-Barak-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barak 2001</LINK>). Computer-based interventions have the potential to provide types of health promotion/treatment which may be difficult or embarrassing to access face-to-face, for example sex therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Ochs-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ochs 1994</LINK>), and dissemination can be fast and relatively cheap online (<LINK REF="REF-Barak-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barak 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Internet is a particularly appropriate route for the delivery of sexual health promotion to young people, since they are already confident and frequent users of Internet technology (in well-resourced countries) (<LINK REF="REF-Kanuga-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanuga 2004</LINK>). The Internet is widely used to access pornography, and the web can also facilitate finding new sexual partners and/or contact with commercial sex workers (<LINK REF="REF-Kanuga-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanuga 2004</LINK>). Meeting sexual partners via the Internet is associated with increased sexual risk-taking (<LINK REF="REF-Elford-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elford 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McFarlane-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarlane 2000</LINK>). In this context it makes sense for health educators to take advantage of new technologies to promote sexual health.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-06-25 17:53:09 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Digital technology such as the Internet offers exciting potential for sexual health promotion, and ICBI seem effective for HIV-related sexual health promotion (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2009</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="AGREEMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</LINK>). However, it is not known whether ICBI are effective for other sexual health problems, nor whether they are as effective as face-to-face sexual health interventions. It is also unclear how ICBI might work (in other words which components are an essential part of the intervention) and whether they are cost-effective. There is also the potential that Internet-based interventions may cause harm. This systematic review therefore identifies trials of ICBI, to assess their effects in comparison with minimal interventions, face-to-face interventions and other designs of computer-based intervention.</P>

<P>Interventions meeting our definition of ICBI, and our definition of sexual health promotion.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interactive computer-based interventions</HEADING>
<P>We defined 'interactive' as meaning packages that require contributions from users (e.g. entering personal data, making choices) which alter pathways within programmes to produce tailored material and feedback that is personally relevant to users of the programme (<LINK REF="REF-Bellis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellis 2002</LINK>). Users may interact with programmes as members of a small group as well as individually.</P>
<P>Definitions of computer-based interventions are not used consistently in the e-health literature. Adapting the definitions for 'Consumer Health Informatics Systems' (<LINK REF="REF-Gustafson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gustafson 2002</LINK>) and 'Interactive Health Communication Applications' (<LINK REF="REF-Eng-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eng 1999</LINK>) we have defined eligible interventions for this review as interactive computer-based programmes that provide information and one or more of the following: decision support, behaviour-change support, or emotional support for health issues. Programmes should be available directly to users and allow independent access without needing expert facilitation. The Internet is likely to be the most common delivery route, although other technologies such as interactive television, mobile telephone, CD-ROM and handheld computers (personal digital assistants) are possible.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sexual health promotion</HEADING>
<P>'Sexual health' and 'health promotion' are difficult to define because these concepts are socially and culturally relative (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). Risk factors can be seen as individual (e.g. accurate knowledge, beliefs, motivation and skills to change behaviour) and environmental (e.g. socio-cultural norms, the law, availability and access to services) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). It is a complex interplay of these factors that leads to outcomes such as condom use, or acquisition of an STI (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have adapted the Public Health Agency of Canada's definition of health promotion (<LINK REF="REF-PHA-Canada-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">PHA Canada 2006</LINK>), taking sexual health promotion to mean strategies for improving the sexual health of the population by providing individuals, groups and communities with the tools to make informed decisions about their sexual well-being.</P>
<P>Sexual well-being can be thought of as "a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled" (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies meeting our definition of sexual health promotion could therefore include those aiming to enhance 'life skills' such as decision-making and assertiveness with the aim of enhancing sexual well-being, as well as studies aiming to reduce adverse biological outcomes such as STI or unwanted pregnancy. Seeking sexual health care may also improve the sexual health of others, for instance where genitourinary screening or HIV testing result in a reduction in the spread of disease.</P>
<P>We therefore included interventions which facilitate the active seeking of sexual well-being, including accessing sexual health services (e.g. vaccination, STI screening, contraceptive advice, psychosexual counselling, etc.), but we excluded interventions that aim to optimise health care once in a healthcare setting.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2010-07-15 11:55:38 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Outcome measures for individual participants can be divided into cognitive, behavioural and biological (<LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 2003</LINK>). The first two are generally self-reported, whilst biological outcomes may be measured objectively. Whilst self-reported outcomes are more susceptible to inaccuracy and bias than objectively measured outcomes, they give valuable information about the possible mechanisms of action of interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 2003</LINK>). Many trials measure cognitive and behavioural outcomes because biological measurement may be costly to obtain, less acceptable to participants, and trials may need to be very large to detect changes in relatively rare outcomes such as STI or pregnancy rates. We analyse these different types of outcomes (cognitive, behavioural and biological) in separate meta-analyses since the relationship between them is complex and non-linear (<LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 2003</LINK>); for example, someone may become motivated to use condoms but their partner refuses; or increases in condom use may make little difference to HIV acquisition in populations with low initial prevalence of HIV.</P>
<P>Populations at risk of sexual health problems (e.g. adolescents, MSM), their risk behaviours, and the contexts in which sexual risk occurs are obviously very diverse (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 2003</LINK>). Similarly, patterns of computer or Internet use vary (see '<LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK>'). However, we postulate that the underlying psychological pathways of behaviour change with ICBI are similar for participants in different contexts. For example, increase in knowledge, change in self-efficacy, and improvement in skills may be needed to affect behaviour change leading to improved sexual health. The specific context and combination of these and other factors is likely to be different for different populations, but we postulate that on a theoretical level, ICBI would work in a similar way (<LINK REF="REF-Hardeman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardeman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hobbis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hobbis 2005</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>, Behaviour Change Theoretical Model).</P>
<P>We therefore included studies if they measured one or more of the following outcomes:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Cognitive outcomes e.g. knowledge; self-efficacy (a person's belief in their capacity to carry out a specific action); attitude (overall evaluation of performing a behaviour).</LI>
<LI>Affective outcomes e.g. sexual satisfaction.</LI>
<LI>Behavioural outcomes e.g. consistency of condom use for vaginal or anal intercourse; partner numbers; sexual activity whilst intoxicated; health seeking behaviour (such as increased STI testing and treatment, uptake of cervical cytology screening); age at first sex, condom use at first sex (young people), consistency of contraceptive use (heterosexual participants); negotiation/communication skills.</LI>
<LI>Biological outcomes e.g. STI rate; HIV acquisition rate; conception rate; abortion rate.</LI>
<LI>Adverse effects i.e. data on unintended adverse outcomes attributable to the intervention.</LI>
<LI>Economic outcomes e.g. costs of developing and implementing interactive computer-based interventions; costs and savings for health services or other agencies (such as costs of screening tests and increased use of health services versus costs of untreated STI); costs and savings for users/consumers (such as costs associated with uptake of preventative health services versus costs of unwanted pregnancy).</LI>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2010-06-25 19:06:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>JB downloaded all citations identified by the search into Reference Manager software. Two review authors (JB and GR) then independently screened titles for relevance (and abstracts where available), using the criteria discussed above (i.e. RCTs of ICBIs which aim to promote sexual health). We categorised citations into three groups:</P>
<OL>
<LI>possibly relevant studies,</LI>
<LI>background literature, and</LI>
<LI>excluded (clearly irrelevant) studies.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The full text of any candidate studies (1, possibly relevant) was obtained, using a low threshold for inclusion if there was any doubt. JB and GR then independently screened these candidate studies to determine eligibility. Disagreements were resolved by discussion, or by seeking a third opinion (EM) (see '<LINK TAG="POTENTIAL_BIASES" TYPE="SECTION">Potential biases in the review process</LINK>'). Where studies described the development or evaluation of an ICBI for sexual health promotion, JB contacted authors to find out whether an RCT evaluation had also been conducted.</P>

<P>JB and CM independently extracted data from included studies using the data extraction form, entering data into separate Excel charts. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or by seeking a third opinion (EM).

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-07-15 12:01:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>We recorded the quality of studies by assessing study validity on the basis of a number of criteria:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Selection bias due to non-random selection of control and intervention groups</HEADING>
<P>We recorded the quality of procedures to assign participants randomly to intervention or control groups, and to conceal allocations until the point of allocation. We rated this A) adequate sequence generation and concealment of allocation, B) unclear or C) inadequate sequence generation and/or concealment. Studies rated (C) were excluded completely from analysis, because of the potential for selection bias inherent in the study design.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Blinding of participants, those who administer the interventions, and researchers</HEADING>
<P>In many trials, it will have been obvious to participants whether they had been allocated to an ICBI or a comparison such as a face-to-face intervention or usual practice. Blinding participants is more possible in online trials of two different designs of computer-based intervention. We recorded the adequacy of procedures to blind participants where this was actually possible. ICBIs by definition were self-administered, but it is not possible to blind those who administer face-to-face interventions. We recorded whether outcome assessors were blinded as to participants' allocation (intervention or comparator).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Attrition bias (differences in drop-out rates)</HEADING>
<P>We recorded overall losses to follow-up, and differences in drop-out rates between control and intervention groups.</P>
<P>We also noted whether outcome data were selectively reported (i.e. whether outcomes were measured but results not presented), and whether authors imputed values for missing data and/or conducted intention-to-treat analyses. We recorded other quality criteria including ethical permission and consent procedures, user involvement in intervention development, baseline imbalances between groups, whether validated outcome scales were used, and the duration of follow-up. We tabulated the quality assessments in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' tables. The quality of randomisation procedure and allocation concealment was judged (A, B or C) and used as a study inclusion criterion; other quality factors were considered in interpretation and discussion of the results, but were not given ratings.</P>
<P>We assessed differences between studies in terms of populations, settings and interventions, differences in the way that studies were conducted, and differences in types of outcomes, which helped to inform decisions as to whether formal meta-analysis was possible and appropriate. These decisions were made at project steering group meetings.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2010-07-15 12:04:19 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Selection of outcomes for meta-analysis</HEADING>
<P>Where multiple outcomes were reported in one study, we selected one outcome only from the following conceptual groups (knowledge, self-efficacy, intention, sexual behaviour, and biological outcomes), so that individual studies made fair contributions to separate meta-analyses. For example, Downs et al. measured three behavioural outcomes: abstinence, condom use with every partner, and condom failures: we chose only one of these (condom use with every partner) to include in a synthesis of behavioural outcomes. Where there were multiple outcomes to choose between, we used criteria which were decided in advance at a steering group meeting:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Authors' primary outcomes where stated.</LI>
<LI>Outcomes reflecting the main aim of the intervention.</LI>
<LI>Sexual health outcomes in preference to other domains of outcome.</LI>
<LI>Condom-related outcomes (e.g. self-efficacy, intention, behaviours).</LI>
<LI>Laboratory measured biological outcomes.</LI>
<LI>Data from the longest measured follow-up period.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We chose authors' primary outcomes and outcomes reflecting the main aim of interventions to allow us to see whether interventions had an effect on the dimensions that authors had chosen as the most salient. Authors' primary outcomes took precedence over other criteria. We chose specific sexual health outcomes in preference to outcomes such as alcohol use or mental health: whilst other domains are intimately bound up with sexual well-being, these do not feature in our hypothesised model of sexual behaviour change (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). We selected condom-use outcomes in preference to abstinence or partner numbers because a fulfilling sex life with reference to the WHO definition could well involve seeking sex with more/new partners. We chose laboratory measured biological outcomes rather than self-reports since laboratory measures are more reliable. We chose the longest follow-up period available since it is important that any change in outcomes is sustained over time.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>We sought numerators and denominators for dichotomous variables (i.e. numbers of events out of possible totals), and means and standard deviations for continuous variables (i.e. averages and their distributions for outcomes measured on a scale). When authors presented only mean values of outcomes with no standard deviation (and authors could not supply missing data), we calculated standard deviations from F statistics where available. We derived standard deviations by calculating the between-group mean square from the means, then deriving the within-group mean square using the F statistic. We took the square root of the within-group mean square to derive an estimated within-group standard deviation (<LINK REF="REF-Armitage-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armitage 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where appropriate, we pooled the results of RCTs using a random-effects model which gives an estimate of the average intervention effect. A random effects model is more conservative than a fixed effects model since it allows for statistical heterogeneity rather than assuming that differences between studies are due to chance alone. We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes. These measures allow combination of outcomes which may have been measured using different scales, giving averages or ratios which are adjusted by trial size. We comment on the size of SMDs using Cohen's rules of thumb, judging 0.2 to be 'small', 0.4 to be 'moderate', and 0.8 a 'large' effect (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>If studies had not accounted for the effects of clustering in their trial design, we planned to adjust sample sizes by a design effect (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>). We did not find papers which cited intra-class coefficients (ICCs) for studies of online sexual health interventions, so we planned to derive the design effect from ICCs given in cluster randomised studies of face-to-face sexual health interventions. Two trials had not accounted for their cluster randomised design, but suitable data for statistical adjustment were not available: number of clusters and the size of clusters is not known for <LINK REF="STD-Di-Noia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Di Noia 2004</LINK>; and standard deviations could not be calculated for <LINK REF="STD-Kann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kann 1987</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK>, two schools were randomly allocated to either intervention or comparator by coin toss: since there were only 2 clusters (2 schools), it is not possible to adjust for clustering effects. In addition, intervention effects are confounded with school: in other words it is not possible to separate out the effects of the intervention from coincidental effects of being in one school or the other. We therefore decided to omit <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK> from meta-analyses, but report the results of this study separately.</P>
<P>We analysed and present separately the results for studies that compare ICBI to minimal intervention (group 1), those that compare intervention to non-computerised, face-to-face sexual health education (group 2), and those that compare two or more different designs of computer-based sexual health intervention (group 3). Separate meta-analyses were also conducted for type of outcome (cognitive, behavioural, biological), selecting outcomes to combine using concepts derived from a theoretical pathway for sexual behaviour change (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>), (sexual health knowledge, self-efficacy, intention/motivation, sexual behaviour, and biological outcomes).</P>
<P>We assessed heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (to check whether combining different trials is valid) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>), and if the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was large, we used the calculated Tau<SUP>2</SUP> statistic which represents the between-study variance in effect size. A 95% range of possible effect sizes was calculated from 2Tau below the random-effects pooled estimate, to 2Tau above it (to estimate how widely distributed the study results were) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2009</LINK>). We present and discuss our findings by type of outcome, in other words cognitive, behavioural and biological, and then discuss any sources of heterogeneity in the findings.</P>
<P>It was not possible to report data on unintended adverse outcomes attributable to the intervention(s) because there were no adverse outcomes reported by study authors. We did not find any economic evaluations of RCTs, so we are unable to comment on the economic effects of interactive computer-based interventions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Consumer participation</HEADING>
<P>'Consumers' for interactive computerised interventions include members of the general population who access the Internet seeking sexual health information, website designers, and also parents, teachers, clinicians or policy makers who may wish to recommend suitable websites to others. Members of the consumer advisory group comprised two sexual health website users, one website designer, one sexual health clinician, one teacher who is also a parent of teenagers, and one person who is a sexual health policy-advisor. Consultation with the consumer advisory group has helped to refine the aims of the systematic review, to interpret results, and to consider the implications of findings.</P>

<P>The search generated 11,363 citations. From these, we identified 143 citations for possible inclusion. Five further citations were obtained from reference lists, two from a personal contact, four following contact with authors, and two from online searching for specific authors' work using Google and Google Scholar. We assessed this final set of 156 citations, excluding 139 because they were not RCTs and/or did not meet our definitions of ICBI or sexual health promotion. Fifteen studies described in 17 papers therefore met our criteria for inclusion. Fourteen other studies appeared to meet our criteria. However, three were later excluded because they were not RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Paperny-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Paperny 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reis--1992" TYPE="STUDY">Reis 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007a</LINK>). Correspondence with authors established that <LINK REF="STD-Lightfoot-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lightfoot 2007</LINK> was an RCT, but it was not clear whether the intervention met our definition of ICBI. Four studies met the definition for ICBI, but were administered by teachers or health workers (<LINK REF="STD-Noell-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Noell 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pacifici-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pacifici 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tian-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tian 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yom-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yom 2005</LINK>). Four studies did not meet our definition of ICBI: one intervention provided information with a multiple choice test but included no decision support, behaviour change, or emotional support (<LINK REF="STD-Marsch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Marsch 2004</LINK>); one intervention provided web-based learning materials to facilitate group learning, but did not feature individual tailoring or feedback (<LINK REF="STD-Lockyer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lockyer 1999</LINK>); one intervention was a computer-generated booklet which is not an ICBI since users did not interact directly with the programme, and the delivery route was by post (<LINK REF="STD-Scholes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scholes 2003</LINK>); and one intervention provided professional counselling by email as well as web-based information and a discussion forum, and the effects of ICBI alone could not be ascertained (<LINK REF="STD-Lou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lou 2006</LINK>) (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table). One study met the criteria for inclusion, but separate data on the effect of the ICBI were not available (<LINK REF="STD-Ochs-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Ochs 1994</LINK>). We also located a trial of ICBI which could not be included because large loss to follow-up meant that there were insufficient data for analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Bull-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>Three studies were conducted entirely online: two with Dutch speaking participants (<LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK>) and one with English-speaking American participants (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2007</LINK>). The remaining twelve studies relied on some face-to-face contact with researchers. All of these were conducted in the USA .</P>
<P>The target populations varied, with six studies focusing on adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-Alemi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Alemi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Di-Noia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Di Noia 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Laar-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Van Laar 2000</LINK>), four focusing on adult men who have sex with men (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Read-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Read 2006</LINK>), three studies focusing on college or university students (<LINK REF="STD-Avina-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Avina 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>), one on male soldiers (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2000</LINK>) and one on 'adults at risk of HIV', including MSM and intravenous drug users (<LINK REF="STD-Perry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1991</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Aims and design of interventions</HEADING>
<P>All interventions were computer-based, and were delivered either on individual computers, or via the Internet. Eight interventions focused on HIV prevention (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Di-Noia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Di Noia 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Read-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Read 2006</LINK>), three on sexually transmitted infection including HIV (<LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK>), two on preventing unwanted pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Alemi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Alemi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Laar-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Van Laar 2000</LINK>), one on 'responsible sexual behaviour' (<LINK REF="STD-Kann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kann 1987</LINK>) and one on preventing sexual assault and enhancing positive dating experiences (<LINK REF="STD-Avina-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Avina 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Intervention designs drew on a large variety of theoretical models (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table). These included Social Cognitive Theory (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK>); the Information, Motivation, Behavioural Skills model (<LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>); practice in decision-making (<LINK REF="STD-Alemi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Alemi 1989</LINK>); four-step model of assertive decision-making (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Noia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Di Noia 2004</LINK>); trans-theoretical model (stages of change) (<LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>), information processing model of social competence (<LINK REF="STD-Avina-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Avina 2006</LINK>); extended parallel process model (<LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK>); and cognitive re-structuring of beliefs (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Laar-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Van Laar 2000</LINK>). Several studies drew on a combination of theories (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies involved stakeholders in intervention development in different ways.

Several studies involved consumers in the development or pre-trial evaluation of interventions, using a variety of different methods: focus groups (<LINK REF="STD-Avina-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Avina 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Read-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Read 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK>), surveys (<LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK>), an 'Internet-based assessment' (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2007</LINK>) and pilot testing (<LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Programmes produced material that was personally relevant to users of the programme in a variety of ways: the most common format was feedback on knowledge tests which was tailored according to the answers given (<LINK REF="STD-Perry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Di-Noia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Di Noia 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Laar-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Van Laar 2000</LINK>); feedback on personality traits (<LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK>); tailoring according to baseline knowledge, motivation and behavioural skills (<LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>); scenarios tailored according to participants' previous experiences (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Laar-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Van Laar 2000</LINK>); selecting a personal goal with feedback on achievement (<LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>); providing feedback following virtual decisions (<LINK REF="STD-Avina-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Avina 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Read-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Read 2006</LINK>); rehearsal of communication skills and decisions (<LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kann 1987</LINK>); appraising 'dysfunctional thoughts' (<LINK REF="STD-Perry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1991</LINK>); and a virtual baby following a decision to have unprotected sex (<LINK REF="STD-Alemi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Alemi 1989</LINK>). Some programmes provided the stimulus for 'real world' activities, including discussing with others to obtain answers to knowledge tests (<LINK REF="STD-Alemi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Alemi 1989</LINK>); practising putting a condom onto a penis model, and practising communication and negotiation skills (<LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Programmes made imaginative use of multimedia capability, for example, games to test knowledge (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Noia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Di Noia 2004</LINK>); stories, scenarios and simulations (<LINK REF="STD-Avina-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Avina 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Di-Noia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Di Noia 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2000</LINK>); virtual characters with choices to make (<LINK REF="STD-Alemi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Alemi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK>); interactive virtual dates (<LINK REF="STD-Read-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Read 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK>); conversations with the computer or virtual characters (<LINK REF="STD-Alemi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Alemi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK>); and animations, music and cartoons (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Laar-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Van Laar 2000</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">b) Self-efficacy</HEADING>
<P>Self-efficacy (a person's belief in their capacity to carry out a specific action) was measured in nine studies. Studies all used different instruments to measure self-efficacy, focusing on sexual behaviours (e.g. safer sex/condom use (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Read-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Read 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Laar-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Van Laar 2000</LINK>), 'HIV risk reduction' (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Noia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Di Noia 2004</LINK>), safe sex assertiveness (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2007</LINK>) and self-efficacy towards taking an annual sexual health check-up (<LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK>)). One additional study reported perceived behavioural control for several safer sex behaviours (the perceived ease with which a skill can be practised), which we judged to be conceptually similar to self-efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">c) Intention</HEADING>
<P>Behavioural intention was reported in six studies. Authors asked about intention towards the following behaviours: taking an annual sexual health check-up (<LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK>); HIV-related behaviours (<LINK REF="STD-Read-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Read 2006</LINK>); condom use for anal sex (<LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK>), negotiated safety (steady partners testing for HIV and agreeing to be monogamous or to have safe sex outside the relationship) (<LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK>); condom use with current or future partners (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>); and preparatory behaviours such as carrying condoms (<LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>). One study reported readiness to change with respect to condom use, and selection of 'high risk' partners (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2000</LINK>). Another study reported various dimensions of motivation (physical outcomes, social outcomes, and self-evaluative outcome motivation towards practising HIV preventative behaviours), but these concepts were not defined (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>A variety of different behavioural outcomes were reported in 10 of the 15 studies, including several different measures of condom use: keeping condoms handy in the last 30 days (<LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>); carrying condoms (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2000</LINK>); condom use in the last 30 days (<LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>) and 3 months (<LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK>); frequency of persuading partners to use condoms (<LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>,); condom failures in last 3 months (<LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK>); condom use for anal sex (<LINK REF="STD-Read-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Read 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK>); and condom use at last (heterosexual) intercourse (<LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK>). Number of sexual partners was also measured in different ways: number of partners in the last 4 months (<LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK>); and one or more new &#8216;high-risk&#8217; partners in 2 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2000</LINK>).

We have indicated which outcomes we selected for meta-analysis in bold typeface in the tables. The sexual health outcomes of included studies are diverse because sexual health interventions are tailored for different populations, and outcomes reflect the aims of interventions (for example, reduction in unprotected anal sex in MSM, reduction in pregnancy in adolescent girls). We justify the meta-analysis of diverse outcomes since we are addressing the question of whether ICBIs change the behaviour they are designed to change. To draw on a metaphor, we are comparing apples and pears in order to draw conclusions about the properties of fruit: combining outcomes such as pregnancy in adolescent girls and unprotected anal sex in MSM allows us to comment on the effect of targeted, tailored, culturally appropriate sexual health promotion interventions on sexual behaviour.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Combining cognitive outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Decisions to combine knowledge, self-efficacy and intention outcomes from different studies were generally straightforward. Locus of control (<LINK REF="STD-Alemi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Alemi 1989</LINK>) was felt to be a different concept to self-efficacy, so was excluded from analysis.</P>
<P>We decided not to combine any attitudinal outcomes in meta-analyses. Social and cultural phenomena such as values and beliefs are hugely important in shaping the context in which sexual behaviour occurs. However, attitudinal variables such as attitude to condoms, peer approval, and comfort with interpersonal communication are not easily measured since their meanings are complex, and this complexity is lost in the reduction to a numerical assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Potter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 2001</LINK>). It is also not necessarily obvious whether an increase or a decrease in a particular attitude is desirable. For example, it is not clear whether a 'conservative' or 'liberal' attitude towards sex (<LINK REF="STD-Alemi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Alemi 1989</LINK>) or waiting until marriage before having sex (<LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK>) is desirable in terms of a holistic definition of sexual health (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). We therefore report studies' attitudinal outcomes in the tables, but did not combine attitudinal outcomes in meta-analyses.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Combining affective outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We did not include depression and anxiety (<LINK REF="STD-Perry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1991</LINK>) in a meta-analysis since these do not feature in our hypothesised model of sexual behaviour change.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Combining behavioural outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The selection of behavioural outcomes for meta-analysis required considerable debate, since studies often reported a number of different behavioural outcomes without clarifying which were primary outcomes. One study measured decision-making behaviour, assertiveness behaviour and interpersonal communication behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-Kann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kann 1987</LINK>): these outcomes fit with a holistic definition of sexual health, but were excluded because they were not clearly defined conceptually (i.e. it was not clear what was being measured). <LINK REF="STD-Avina-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Avina 2006</LINK> et al. measured risky sexual communication (Individuals' perception of their communication of sexual intentions in dating situations and participation in undesired sexual activity). We chose sexual victimisation over this outcome since it reflects the main aim of the intervention.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Differences in the way that studies were conducted</HEADING>
<P>All included studies stated that participants had been randomly allocated, with only five studies clearly reporting adequate sequence generation and concealment of allocation ('A') (<LINK REF="STD-Avina-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Avina 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK>) (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table). The remainder gave insufficient detail to judge whether there were adequate sequence generation and/or concealment of allocation, so were rated 'B'. We excluded studies rated 'C' (<LINK REF="STD-Paperny-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Paperny 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reis--1992" TYPE="STUDY">Reis 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Blinding of participants as to whether they were in intervention or control groups is usually not possible for trials of a computer-based intervention with a very different comparator (e.g. usual practice, face-to-face intervention). Blinding is more possible where two computerised interventions are being compared, for example (<LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Van-Laar-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Van Laar 2000</LINK>). Information about procedures for blinding outcome assessors was not available from included papers.</P>
<P>Three studies were cluster randomised and did not account for this in their statistical analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Noia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Di Noia 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK>), but statistical adjustment was not possible (see '<LINK TAG="DATA_COLLECTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data collection and analysis</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite random allocation of subjects, several studies reported baseline differences between intervention and comparator groups on demographic variables (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Noia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Di Noia 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Read-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Read 2006</LINK>) and/or baseline measurements of outcome variables (<LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK>). Some studies adjusted for these differences before analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Noia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Di Noia 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Read-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Read 2006</LINK>). We planned to use only unadjusted outcome measures, since when studies are combined this should even out baseline differences if participants have been adequately randomised. However, unadjusted data were not available for these studies.</P>
<P>Retention at follow-up in trials with face-to-face recruitment varied from 49% in <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2000</LINK> to 95% in <LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK> (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'). There was poor retention in two of the online trials (31 to 42% at 6 months in <LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK> and 31% at 3 months in <LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK>), but 79% in <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2007</LINK>. Several studies reported drop-out rates which differed by more than10% between intervention and comparator groups (<LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Laar-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Van Laar 2000</LINK>), with data unavailable to assess for <LINK REF="STD-Di-Noia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Di Noia 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2000</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Kann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kann 1987</LINK>.</P>
<P>Four studies allowed for missing data by including the last observation available (<LINK REF="STD-Avina-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Avina 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK>), which may produce bias in either direction.</P>
<P>Selective reporting is an important quality criterion, since if only the more statistically significant outcomes are presented, this will augment the apparent effect of an intervention. Outcomes had been selectively reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2000</LINK>), with raw data not available for many of the non-significant outcomes. In <LINK REF="STD-Read-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Read 2006</LINK> it was unclear exactly which outcome variables had been measured before combination into composite measures of protected and unprotected anal sex.</P>

Meta-analysis shows a statistically significant positive effect on sexual health knowledge, with a standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.72 (95% CI 0.27 to 1.18). This is a moderate effect size using Cohen's criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1988</LINK>), and shows that ICBI do improve sexual health knowledge.</P>
<P>We were not able to adjust for clustering effects in <LINK REF="STD-Di-Noia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Di Noia 2004</LINK> (see '<LINK TAG="DATA_COLLECTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data collection and analysis</LINK>'): it is likely that adjustment would have widened the SMD confidence intervals. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (91%) shows substantial statistical heterogeneity between these studies: the 95% range of study effect sizes was -0.36 to 1.80, suggesting that the SMD in the most favourable scenario could be as great as 1.80, but could also be as small as -0.36 in the least favourable scenario (meaning that ICBI could have less effect on sexual health knowledge than minimal intervention).</P>
<P>One additional study showed no statistically significant differences in HIV knowledge (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2000</LINK>), and another showed statistically significant improvement in knowledge, but data suitable for analysis were not available (<LINK REF="STD-Kann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kann 1987</LINK>). The study by <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK> was not included in meta-analysis because it was a two-school trial. Their results are consistent with the finding that ICBI have a positive effect on sexual health knowledge (SMD 0.49, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.71), but this may not be a causal association (see '<LINK TAG="DATA_COLLECTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data collection and analysis</LINK>').</P>

Only one of these studies showed a statistically significant effect on self-efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2007</LINK>), but combining outcomes from studies gave a standardised mean difference of 0.17 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.29). This is a small effect size using Cohen's criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1988</LINK>), showing that ICBIs have a small effect on self-efficacy.</P>
<P>We were not able to adjust for clustering effects in <LINK REF="STD-Di-Noia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Di Noia 2004</LINK> (see '<LINK TAG="DATA_COLLECTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data collection and analysis</LINK>'): it is likely that adjustment would have widened the confidence intervals. The I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic was 3%, suggesting that there was little statistical inconsistency. One study had very large confidence intervals, attributable to its small sample size (n = 26) (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Laar-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Van Laar 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>One additional study reported no difference between intervention and control for self-efficacy, with data unavailable from authors (<LINK REF="STD-Read-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Read 2006</LINK>).

<P>We combined data from three studies which measured intention on continuous measurement scales (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). None of these individual studies showed statistically significant difference between intervention and control for safer-sex intentions, but the SMD became significant on combining outcomes in a meta-analysis (SMD 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.30), which is a small effect size.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Do ICBIs have an effect on sexual behaviours targeted by the ICBI?</HEADING>
<P>We combined data from three studies which measured sexual behaviour as dichotomous outcomes (numbers of events) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). The outcomes combined were sexual victimisation (<LINK REF="STD-Avina-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Avina 2006</LINK>), negotiated safety or condom use (<LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK>), and condom use in the last 3 months 'every time with every partner' (<LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK>). We calculated the number of participants who did <I>not</I> experience sexual victimisation for <LINK REF="STD-Avina-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Avina 2006</LINK> since this represents a desirable outcome. None of these individual studies showed statistically significant difference between intervention and control for sexual behaviours, and the odds ratio remained non-significant after meta-analysis (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.38). The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was 0%, suggesting that there was little statistical inconsistency.</P>
<P>Data were unavailable for <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2000</LINK> (condom use with risky partners). <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK> was not included in meta-analysis because it was a two-school trial (see '<LINK TAG="DATA_COLLECTION" TYPE="SECTION">Data collection and analysis</LINK>'). The results from this study showed no difference between intervention and control for condom use at last intercourse (for the sexually active subgroup): OR 1.38 (95% CI 0.59 to 3.24).</P>
<P>Two studies measured sexual behaviour on continuous measurement scales: condom use in the last 30 days (<LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>); and protected anal sex (<LINK REF="STD-Read-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Read 2006</LINK>). However, standard deviations were unavailable for <LINK REF="STD-Read-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Read 2006</LINK>, and it was not possible to calculate these from F statistics. Data from <LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK> shows an SMD of 0.61 (95% CI 0.11 to 1.11), showing a moderate effect on condom use in the last 30 days, but with wide confidence intervals, which decreases the certainty of the result (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>We converted the SMD from the study by <LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK> into an odds ratio (<LINK REF="REF-Chinn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chinn 2000</LINK>) so that this study could be combined with the other studies reporting sexual behaviour outcomes (those in <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). This resulted in a combined odds ratio for the four studies of 1.75 (95% CI 1.18 to 2.59), (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>) which is a statistically significant effect on sexual behaviour.

There were no new diagnoses of HIV in the <LINK REF="STD-Perry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1991</LINK> study, so this study could not contribute to the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). The incidence of vaginal chlamydial DNA was relatively low in <LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK> (7%), and the sample size was not large, so the resulting confidence interval for the intervention effect was wide, meaning that is not possible to be certain of the effect.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Estimates of practical impact</HEADING>
<P>The results above (using standardised mean differences) give an idea of the strength of evidence, but SMDs do not indicate what this might mean in practice. We therefore took the largest studies with available baseline data to work out estimates of practical significance. For knowledge, an SMD of 0.72 (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) translates into an increase in score from 6.75 to 8.50 on a 12-item true/false HIV knowledge test (<LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK>) (obtained by multiplying the baseline standard deviation for knowledge in <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK> by the combined effect size for knowledge derived from meta-analysis (0.72)).</P>
<P>Considering self-efficacy (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK> et al. measured adolescents' confidence in using a condom correctly on a five-point Likert scale. An SMD of 0.17 translates into an increase in score from 4.10 at baseline to 4.18, which is a small gain in confidence.</P>
<P>For safer sex intention (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), <LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK> et al. measured students' likelihood of using condoms and engaging in preparatory condom use behaviours on a five-point Likert scale from 'very unlikely' to use to 'very likely'. An SMD of 0.16 translates into an increase in score from 3.77 to 3.96 out of 5.</P>
<P>These estimates of practical significance need to be treated with great caution: there are no widely used, validated scales for knowledge, self-efficacy or intention, so we do not have reliable estimates of baseline means and standard deviations for particular populations. Despite this, there seems to be a useful gain in knowledge (15%), but barely any gains in self-efficacy or intention. In these studies, participants' baseline confidence and intentions were high, so there was not much room for improvement.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 2: Are ICBIs as effective as face-to-face sexual health interventions?</HEADING>
<P>We combined outcomes from group 2 studies to address the question of whether ICBI are as effective as face-to-face interventions, taking studies which compared ICBI with non-computerised, face-to-face sexual health education. These trials are equivalence trials, in that it is a positive finding if there is no difference in effectiveness between ICBI and face-to-face interventions.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sexual health knowledge</HEADING>
<P>We combined data from the two studies with available data on sexual health knowledge: the first study compared ICBI with stress training (<LINK REF="STD-Perry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Perry 1991</LINK>), and the second compared ICBI with lectures (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2000</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). Meta-analysis shows an SMD of 0.36 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.58), which is a small effect size. There were too few studies to estimate heterogeneity using an I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic.</P>
<P>Two further studies reported no statistically significant differences between ICBI and a) a lecture with the same content (<LINK REF="STD-Alemi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Alemi 1989</LINK>), and b) face-to-face counselling (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2000</LINK>), but data were not available to include in the meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Kann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kann 1987</LINK> was a three arm trial which compared ICBI to no intervention, and a lecture to no intervention: data on ICBI vs. lecture were not available.</P>

<P>Only one study in group 2 reported self-efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2000</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intention</HEADING>
<P>One study reported condom use intention (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2000</LINK>).

This is a moderate effect size. However, the study was small (n = 102 at follow-up), reducing confidence in the result.</P>
<P>One study reported readiness to change condom use at 2 weeks, showing greater improvement in the face-to-face intervention arm than ICBI (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2000</LINK>). This outcome was also measured at 2 months, but data were not available from authors, so were not included in meta-analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sexual behaviour</HEADING>
<P>Only one study reported sexual behavioural outcomes which met our criteria for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 2000</LINK>): the outcome selected was condom use with risky partners, but data for this outcome were not available.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">The effect of tailoring:</HEADING>
<P>One study explored the effect of tailoring a computerised sexual health intervention according to individuals' knowledge, motivation and skills (<LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK>). The authors report on comparisons of ICBI with control (no intervention); and non-tailored computer-based intervention with control: we ran analyses to compare the (tailored) ICBI with the non-tailored computer-based intervention. These analyses showed no statistically significant difference between intervention and control for self-efficacy (perceived behavioural control for safe sex agreements outside the relationship) (SMD 0.05, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.22) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>) or intention to practise negotiated safety measured immediately after the intervention (SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.24) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). However, at six month follow-up the tailored ICBI was more effective than the non-tailored computerised intervention in terms of an increase in negotiated safety with current partners (OR 3.47, 95% CI 1.45 to 8.31) (for the subgroup of men who had a new steady partner at 6 months) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is difficult to interpret this apparently contradictory finding (i.e. no effects on self-efficacy or intention, but a positive effect on negotiated safety), since these outcomes were measured at different time points, and negotiated safety was measured only in men who had a new steady partner at 6 months (n = 89).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Risk-based messages:</HEADING>
<P>One study tested the hypothesis that positive framing for messages (e.g. emphasising the advantages of HIV testing and peer acceptance) would be more effective than emphasising the risks of HIV, as a strategy to increase the uptake of HIV testing (<LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK>). Data from authors showed no difference between intervention and control for self-efficacy (SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.18) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>); intention (SMD 0.15, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.32) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>); or STI/HIV testing at 3 month follow-up (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.20) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Are ICBIs effective?</HEADING>
<P>Six studies contributed to the meta-analysis of knowledge, six to analysis of self-efficacy, three to safer sex intention, and four studies to the combined meta-analysis of sexual behaviour. We found that interactive, computer-based interventions have statistically significant effects as follows: a moderate effect on sexual health knowledge (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>); a small effect on self-efficacy (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>); a small effect on safer-sex intentions (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>); and also an effect on sexual behaviour (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). ICBI therefore show promising effects on the mediators of change in sexual behaviour (knowledge, self-efficacy and intention), and also an effect on safer-sex behaviours. We were unable to draw conclusions about the effects of ICBI on biological outcomes, since only one study contributed data (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cost-effectiveness and harms</HEADING>
<P>We are unable to draw conclusions about cost-effectiveness since no studies reported these data. No studies measured potential harms (apart from reporting any deterioration in measured outcomes).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Are ICBIs as effective as face-to-face sexual health interventions?</HEADING>
<P>Meta-analysis was only possible for knowledge, and this showed a small advantage for ICBI over face-to-face interventions for two studies combined (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>), with two further studies showing no statistically significant difference between ICBI and face-to-face intervention. There is insufficient evidence to be certain about the effectiveness of ICBI in comparison to face-to-face interventions in terms of self-efficacy, intention, sexual behaviour and biological outcomes. Larger sample sizes (total 786 participants, 393 per group) are needed to detect a small effect size at 80% power and 5% significance level.</P>
<P>Face-to-face sexual health interventions have had mixed success in changing sexual behaviour: for example, a synthesis of meta-analyses of face-to-face interventions for HIV prevention showed a median increase of 35% in the odds of condom use, and 32% reduction in the odds of unprotected sex, but non-statistically significant reductions in odds of sexually transmitted infection or partner numbers (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2008</LINK>). ICBIs may actually have some advantages over face-to-face interventions. For example, ICBI may have better capacity to tailor for individuals' preferences and needs (<LINK REF="REF-Lustria-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lustria 2009</LINK>); access can be repeated and private; and ICBI can easily accommodate differences in pace of learning (<LINK REF="REF-Barak-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barak 2001</LINK>). Multi-media features may help to hold participants' attention, and another potential advantage is that images, audio or video content may help to reach those with poor literacy. ICBI also have the advantage of being easy to disseminate and potentially more cost-effective (<LINK REF="REF-Barak-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barak 2001</LINK>) than face-to-face interventions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">How do ICBIs work?</HEADING>
<P>Sexual health interventions are complex interventions in that they have a number of components that may interact with each other and act at different levels simultaneously (<LINK REF="REF-Craig-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 2008</LINK>) but it is often difficult to clearly define the components needed for a successful intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Speizer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speizer 2003</LINK>). There are many theories which seek to explain why people engage in risky behaviour: the concepts within theoretical models overlap greatly, but models have differing emphases (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2007a</LINK>). For example, in trying to explain risky behaviour, the Health Belief Model highlights low perceptions of risk; Social Cognitive theory highlights negative attitudes, the influence of social norms, and a lack of confidence in one&#8217;s abilities and skills; the AIDS risk reduction model includes the individual&#8217;s readiness to change as a factor; and the Multiple Domain Model also includes sensation-seeking, impulsive decision-making and environmental influences. A clear theoretical underpinning helps to provide a framework for the design of interventions. However, there is little evidence to guide the choice of one theoretical model over another in a sexual health context (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2007a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies in this review explored how ICBI might work, testing different theoretical approaches: <LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK> explored the effect of tailoring according to individuals' knowledge, motivation and skills, and <LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK> explored different ways of framing health promotion messages.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Tailoring</HEADING>
<P>Tailoring can be defined as "a process for creating individualised communications by gathering and assessing personal data related to a given health outcome in order to determine the most appropriate information or strategies to meet the person's unique needs" (<LINK REF="REF-Lustria-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lustria 2009</LINK>). A review of computer-tailored health interventions delivered over the web describes many different forms of intervention tailoring, for example by demographic characteristics, health beliefs, risk behaviours, or theoretical concepts such as stage of change (<LINK REF="REF-Lustria-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lustria 2009</LINK>). There are also many different ways of customising messages, including personalisation, feedback on responses, and adaptation of programmes according to responses. Whilst it appears that tailoring marginally enhances the effectiveness of printed interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2007</LINK>), there is less evidence for computer-based interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Lustria-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lustria 2009</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK>, feedback was tailored according to participants' information needs, motivation, and behavioural skills, but there were insufficient data to allow conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness of this.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Risk-based messages</HEADING>
<P>The Health Belief model suggests that increasing an individual's perception of risk will lead to protective behaviours, and health promotion messages are commonly based on this premise. However, empirical research brings this assumption into question: for example, perceived risk for HIV infection is not associated with increased HIV testing for MSM (<LINK REF="REF-Lauby-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauby 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK> sought to test the effectiveness of risk-based messages in a trial, but there were insufficient data to allow conclusions to be drawn.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Effects over time</HEADING>
<P>The optimum time to assess the effect of an intervention is not known (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2008</LINK>): for example, participants may forget information over time, but become more skilled in sexual negotiation with practice over time. Only one (small) study measured outcomes repeatedly, showing no change in sexual victimisation between 3 and 12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Avina-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Avina 2006</LINK>). No study measured outcomes after more than six months, and this time period may not be long enough for behaviour change to become routine.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Search end date</HEADING>
<P>This review includes studies which were available up to the end of 2007. This is a rapidly developing field, and the inclusion of more studies in the next update will allow us to carry out more of the proposed analyses, as well as increasing the precision of the results presented.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Losses to follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Losses to follow up were variable (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table). Retention at follow-up was 80% or more in 6 out of the 12 trials using face-to-face recruitment (<LINK REF="STD-Alemi-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Alemi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Read-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Read 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK>). There was poor retention in two of the online trials (31% to 42% at 6 months in <LINK REF="STD-Davidovich-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovich 2006</LINK> and 31% at 3 months in <LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK>), but Bowen et al managed 79% in their online trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bowen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bowen 2007</LINK>). Poor retention threatens validity since an unrepresentative sample may be assessed at follow-up, leading to attrition bias. Study authors did not give details of how missing data were dealt with (for example, accounting for missing data by assuming that those who dropped out did not benefit from the intervention). Poor retention may lead to the decision not to publish the results of online trials (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Bull-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selective reporting of outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Selective reporting of outcomes allows for the possibility of reporting bias: adherence to the CONSORT guidelines for the conduct and reporting of RCTs should ensure that there is no suspicion of this (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). A recent systematic review of RCTs promoting effective condom use found 90 different outcome measures for STI, pregnancy and condom use in 139 studies (<LINK REF="REF-Free-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Free 2009</LINK>). Free et al. suggest that a consensus agreement is needed on outcome measurement, which will reduce opportunities to selectively report positive outcomes and enable easier comparison of trials and synthesis of outcomes. In our review there were eight different measures of condom use reported (see '<LINK TAG="SEARCH_RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results of the search</LINK>'). More detailed reporting would also facilitate judging the quality of procedures for participant allocation and for blinding.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality and fidelity of interventions</HEADING>
<P>We did not assess the quality of interventions, since it is not known what defines a good quality ICBI. It is important that intervention design and delivery is consistent in good quality trials: researchers have good control over the contents and presentation of computer-based interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2009</LINK>).On the other hand, the user has control over the use they make of a computer-based intervention, including the frequency and amount of use. Each user can construct their own unique experience of any given intervention. This may make it hard to determine whether an intervention works: it may be that the intervention can work if used in the way planned by the developer, but that most users use it in a way that renders it ineffective, or vice-versa. This highlights the importance of process evaluations to gather users' viewpoints and to assess how interventions are used.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Generalisability</HEADING>
<P>There was a predominance of studies from economically developed countries (especially the USA) in our systematic review. Whilst there are huge inequalities in access to computer/Internet technology (<LINK REF="REF-Miniwatts-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miniwatts 2009</LINK>), computer-based interventions may still be useful in resource-poor settings, using a different model for dissemination. For example <LINK REF="STD-Tian-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tian 2007</LINK> et al. distributed computers to health workers in three counties in China, offering access to a sexual health website, computer skills teaching and ongoing logistic support for diffusing information to surrounding villages.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Complexity of sexual health research</HEADING>
<P>Researching sexual behaviour is challenging because sex and sexuality are embedded in a web of often contradictory social significance. Sex is usually conducted in private, and open admission of sexual activity or preference may be difficult because of stigma or taboo (<LINK REF="REF-Marston-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marston 2006</LINK>). The personal and medical significance of sex and relationships may be very different: for example, unprotected sex in ongoing relationships between gay men may be a manifestation of trust and love, whereas medically it is conceptualised as 'unprotected anal sex with a high risk partner' (<LINK REF="REF-Flowers-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flowers 1997</LINK>). Qualitative research gives access to deeper understandings about sexual behaviour (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Marston-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marston 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flowers-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flowers 1997</LINK>), but does not yield quantifiable estimates of the effect of interventions. Capturing a 'true' picture of sexual beliefs, attitudes and behaviour is challenging with quantitative tools because standardised questionnaires strip away the complexity and context (<LINK REF="REF-Potter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 2001</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Knowledge</HEADING>
<P>The acquisition of new knowledge can be reliably tested, and we are confident from meta-analyses (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) that ICBI improve sexual health knowledge.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Self-efficacy, intention, attitudes, behaviours</HEADING>
<P>These outcomes are important variables in understanding sexual behaviour, but pose a challenge in survey research because they are self-reported and self-assessed. There are concerns that self-reported outcomes are subject to social desirability bias for sexual beliefs and behaviours which carry a stigma or prestige (<LINK REF="REF-Fenton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenton 2001</LINK>). For example, men tend to report more sexual partners than women do (<LINK REF="REF-Fenton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fenton 2001</LINK>). Over-reporting might be expected for outcomes which reflect the aims of an intervention (e.g. condom use). However, the small effect sizes we found for self-efficacy and intention suggest that 'desirable' outcomes were not being over-reported, and if the magnitude of social desirability bias is similar between groups, this would not affect the estimate of intervention effect.</P>
<P>Dichotomous measurement of sexual behaviour is perhaps less sensitive to change than continuous measurement: for example, 'condom use every time with every partner' (<LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK>) may well remain negative, even if condom use has actually increased over time. A continuous scale may be more sensitive to change (for example the five point Likert scale from 'never' to 'always 'used in <LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>A continuous scale may be potentially more nuanced than 'yes/no' questions, but it may still be difficult to define what exactly the scale is measuring. A typical survey question is the following: "I consider taking a sexual health checkup on a yearly basis to be ('very difficult' to 'very easy)", measured on a seven point Likert scale (<LINK REF="STD-Mikolajczak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mikolajczak 2008</LINK>). The answer to this depends upon how the question is interpreted: 'difficult' could mean difficult to physically get to the clinic, difficult to make time, difficult to confront anxiety about examination, reluctance to receive potential bad news and so on. Although the same questions are asked of all respondents in a particular study, they will be interpreted in unique ways by different people (<LINK REF="REF-Potter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 2001</LINK>). Self-reported quantitative outcomes should therefore be interpreted with these limitations in mind.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Biological outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Biological outcomes such as genital chlamydia or HIV are objectively measurable and therefore more reliable than self-reported outcomes. However, measuring change in biological outcomes is difficult because these events are relatively rare (in statistical terms). For example, although genital chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted infection in young people, sample sizes must be very large to detect differences in cumulative incidence. Changes in HIV incidence are even more difficult to detect because acquisition is more rare than for chlamydia (especially during relatively short study follow-up periods). For example, <LINK REF="STD-Downs-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Downs 2004</LINK> measured genital chlamydia in healthcare settings, using self-administered vaginal swabs at baseline and at final (6 month) follow up, offering $10 to $20 a visit. The study retention rates were good (over 80%), but the study was not large enough to detect an impact on chlamydia rates.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Complex pathways for behaviour change</HEADING>
<P>It is well established that information (knowledge) alone is not necessarily enough to change behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Mellanby-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mellanby 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noar-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2007a</LINK>). There are complex relationships between mediators (e.g. knowledge, attitudes, beliefs) and behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 2003</LINK>): for example, study participants may gain the knowledge, confidence and intention to practise safer sex, but this will not impact on condom use unless a partner is also willing to change behaviour. In addition, condoms are not 100% effective against STI, especially if they are used inconsistently or incorrectly (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The specific mechanisms of behaviour change are likely to be different for different populations: for example, resisting peer pressure may be particularly important for young people (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2007a</LINK>). Sexual decisions do not usually follow a dispassionate weighing up of pros and cons, but are embedded within cultural norms such as beliefs about commitment, trust and love (<LINK REF="REF-Flowers-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flowers 1997</LINK>) and gendered power relationships (<LINK REF="REF-Marston-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marston 2006</LINK>). Social and cultural norms are deeply ingrained, and it is difficult for any brief intervention to impact on these in a way which leads to behaviour change. Such complex determinants of risk require complex interventions, and the optimal design for computer-based interventions is not known.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies for inclusion</HEADING>
<P>It was generally easy to decide whether a study was an RCT, and/or a sexual health intervention by our definitions (see '<LINK TAG="SELECTION_CRITERIA" TYPE="SECTION">Criteria for considering studies for this review</LINK>'). It was also generally easy to decide whether interventions were computer-based programmes that provide information and one or more of the following: decision support, behaviour-change support, or emotional support for health issues. However, it was more difficult to decide whether interventions met our definition of interactivity (i.e. packages that require contributions from users which alter pathways within programmes to produce tailored material and feedback that is personally relevant to users of the programme). For example, interactivity and tailoring could be very simple (e.g. a quiz which provides comments on right or wrong answers), to more complex (e.g. personalised messages based on information, motivation and behavioural skills assessment). There was therefore no clear boundary between 'interactive' and not, and one study was excluded only after steering group discussion and correspondence with the authors (<LINK REF="STD-Lockyer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lockyer 1999</LINK>) since it comprised web-based learning materials to facilitate group learning, with no individual tailoring and feedback.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Combining diverse outcomes</HEADING>
<P>We combined outcomes from studies with differing aims, in differing population groups, in differing settings, and using differing sexual health outcomes. Where studies reported multiple outcomes of the same type (cognitive, behavioural or biological) (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>), quite extensive steering group discussion was required to apply the principles for selection of outcomes for inclusion in meta-analysis (see '<LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>'). Combining diverse studies and diverse outcomes addressed the question of whether ICBIs changed the behaviour they were designed to change, allowing us to draw conclusions about the effect of targeted, tailored, culturally appropriate sexual health promotion interventions on sexual behaviour. Combining diverse studies could have led to a reduction in effect sizes if interventions were effective in some populations or settings and not others. One meta-analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, knowledge) showed a high level of statistical heterogeneity (variety) which makes it harder to be certain of the size of the pooled result.</P>

<P>Three meta-analyses of computer-based interventions for sexual health promotion are available: one examined mediators of HIV preventative behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2010</LINK>); one examined HIV-related behaviours (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2009</LINK>); and one examined computer-based interventions for a variety of health behaviours including safer sex (<LINK REF="REF-Portnoy-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Portnoy 2008</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Meta-analysis of theoretical mediators of safer sex</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2010</LINK> focused exclusively on HIV prevention, and used a looser definition of computer-mediated intervention than our review ("studies had to... use computer technology in the delivery of the intervention, including desktop or laptop computers, the Internet, interactive video, cell phones or personal digital assistants"). The authors included 20 studies in meta-analyses, seven of which feature in our review. We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Lockyer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lockyer 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lou-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lou 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marsch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Marsch 2004</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Scholes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scholes 2003</LINK> since the interventions did not meet our definition of ICBI (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table). We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Tian-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tian 2007</LINK> (two studies) and <LINK REF="STD-Noell-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Noell 1997</LINK> because access to the intervention was facilitated or mediated by others. <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Halpern-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Halpern 2008</LINK> (2 studies) are not RCTs.

Noar's meta-analyses combined minimal intervention comparators with face-to-face comparators, whereas we separated these into group 1 and group 2 comparisons. Noar reported HIV knowledge (SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.33), condom self-efficacy (SMD 0.19, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.26), intention to use condoms (SMD 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.23), and also analysis of attitudes and condom-related communication. Our review describes a greater effect size for knowledge, and similar effect sizes for self-efficacy and intention (see <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2009</LINK>'s systematic review used similar inclusion criteria to <LINK REF="REF-Noar-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2010</LINK>, combining studies of computer-mediated interventions which aimed to increase condom use for HIV prevention. The review included 12 studies, six of which are included in our systematic review. We excluded <LINK REF="STD-Scholes-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scholes 2003</LINK> since it did not meet our definition of ICBI.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Computer-delivered interventions for health promotion and behavioral risk reduction</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Portnoy-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Portnoy 2008</LINK> conducted a systematic review of interventions to promote healthy behaviour, analysing 75 RCTs for tobacco and substance use, physical activity, nutrition, weight loss, diabetes, binge/purge behaviour, general health maintenance, and safer sexual behaviour. Combining all studies with relevant outcomes, the authors found a moderate effect on knowledge (SMD 0.36, CI 0.22 to 0.50); small effects on attitudes (SMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.37) and intentions (SMD 0.18, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.25); and no effect on social norms (SMD 0.27, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.57) or self-efficacy (SMD 0.16, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.33). Four studies focusing on sexual behaviour were included in the authors' meta-analysis. Two of these studies feature in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Kiene-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kiene 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberto-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roberto 2007</LINK>), and two we excluded, one because it is not an RCT (<LINK REF="REF-Bosworth-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosworth 1994</LINK>), and one because we were unable to establish whether the intervention met the definition of ICBI (<LINK REF="STD-Lightfoot-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lightfoot 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Portnoy-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Portnoy 2008</LINK> derived an SMD of 0.35 (CI 0.10 to 0.60) for safer sexual behaviour which is a moderate effect size.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-07-20 21:59:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Julia V Bailey">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-06-25 19:09:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The diversity of included studies shows that ICBI are feasible for a variety of people in different settings (in high-income countries). Computer-based interventions in this review were delivered to participants of different ages including school-age children, college students, and adults (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table). Interventions were effective with heterosexually active people of different ages (especially school/college age), and with men who have sex with men.</P>
<P>This review suggests that ICBI are effective tools for learning about sexual health, with meta-analysis showing gains in knowledge, both for ICBI in comparison with minimal intervention, and also for ICBI in comparison with face-to-face interventions. This has significant implications for the teaching of sexual health knowledge, and suggests that ICBI could usefully enhance the educational efforts of teachers and of health carers. However, although adequate knowledge is necessary for informed decision-making, knowledge is poorly correlated with sexual behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2008</LINK>). The best design for ICBIs is not yet clear; for example, which theory works best for which populations (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2007a</LINK>), how to best to target and tailor interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Lustria-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lustria 2009</LINK>), and how to harness the potential of interactive design and communication technology to facilitate behaviour change (<LINK REF="REF-Hardin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardin 1997</LINK>). Implementation of ICBIs in practice needs to be accompanied by rigorous evaluation.</P>
<P>Technology is evolving, and patterns of computer and Internet use are changing rapidly, for example to more collaborative patterns of Internet use (Web 2.0) with web users uploading their own content, and interacting independently. Lessons learned about successful programme designs risk being wasted: for example, many of the interventions described in this review are no longer available because of incompatibility with newer generations of computer hardware and software. Individuals and organisations are now designing their own web pages, and it is a challenge to design an intervention which will attract and engage users' interest in the context of so many available websites.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-07-20 21:59:48 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Julia V Bailey">
<P>ICBI are promising in terms of their effect on outcomes such as knowledge, safer sex intention, self-efficacy and sexual behaviour. Trials which have adequate power are needed to establish whether ICBI can impact on biological outcomes. We also need data on potential adverse effects, and the cost-effectiveness of ICBI.</P>
<P>The diversity of studies in this review shows that ICBI are feasible in a variety of settings in high-income countries: evidence is needed for the effectiveness of interventions in different settings globally, and with a range of participants including women who have sex with women or older age groups for example.</P>
<P>We also need more evidence on whether ICBI are as effective, or more effective than face-to-face interventions, and whether a combination of both is more effective than either alone. Trials are needed which test whether ICBI can usefully supplement school sex education and/or clinical sexual health services. Equivalence trials to address these types of questions are expensive since they need to be sufficiently large to be confident of 'evidence of no difference' rather than 'no evidence of difference' between interventions. However, face-to-face interventions are very expensive to deliver, and it is therefore very important to know the effects, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of ICBI.</P>
<P>We need to know what components are necessary for an effective intervention. Qualitative ground work is essential in helping to understand the realities and complexity of sexual behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Marston-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marston 2006</LINK>), and to understand which behaviour change theory is most applicable (<LINK REF="REF-Noar-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noar 2007a</LINK>). For example, knowing the main reasons for risky behaviour in a particular population (e.g. inaccurate knowledge, impulsive behaviour, power imbalance) helps to suggest which factors an intervention should target. User involvement is essential to ensure that interventions meet their needs and preferences and are attractive to users. Comparing two different designs of computer-based intervention is relatively easy to do in an online trial, with the advantage that participants can easily be blinded as to which form of intervention they have received. Such trials can test intervention design, for example tailoring, different theoretical approaches to behaviour change, types of interactive multi-media and so on.</P>
<P>Online trials have a number of advantages over trials which involve face-to-face contact with researchers, for example access to large numbers of people including hard-to-reach populations; automated randomisation; blind allocation to online interventions; the opportunity for more user-friendly data collection and outcome measurement; automated and secure data entry; automated reminders; and possibly reduced research costs. Whilst online recruitment may be exceptionally good, there are often also high drop-out rates (<LINK REF="STD-Bull-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bull 2004</LINK>). Research is needed to address the best ways to conduct online trials including how to recruit and retain participants, to verify identity online, and to ensure that data collected are valid and reliable (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pequegnat-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pequegnat 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Whilst many trials are well designed and conducted, there is a need to improve standards of trial conduct and reporting by adhering to the CONSORT recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). It is important that study authors describe intervention theory, design and delivery in detail, to make the design principles clear, and to describe exactly what intervention participants received (<LINK REF="REF-Abraham-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abraham 2008</LINK>). There is also an urgent need for a consensus on outcome measurement, for example international agreements on condom use outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Free-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Free 2009</LINK>). However, it is not possible to produce a universally applicable battery of outcome measures, since outcomes need to be relevant for particular interventions and for particular populations.</P>
<P>Composite outcomes for sexual health may be better at reflecting the complexity of sexual health (<LINK REF="REF-Stephenson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stephenson 2003</LINK>). For example, penetrative sex without a condom may have different significance and sexual health implications depending upon whether a partner is regular or 'casual'. Combining this kind of information in composite outcomes makes data more meaningful. Understanding the meaning and motivation for sexual activity is also important: for example, teenage pregnancies may be wanted and welcomed by young women, and in some settings marriage and pregnancy at early ages are usual (<LINK REF="REF-Swann-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swann 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is increasing realisation that sexual health education should include emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality and not just physical health (<LINK REF="REF-Ingham-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingham 2005</LINK>). This represents a challenge for those who design and evaluate sexual health interventions, since these dimensions are individually, socially and culturally defined rather than objectively measurable. Interventions which may be unsuccessful from a public health perspective may be successful by other criteria: for example, whilst an intensive school-based intervention did not have an impact upon age at first intercourse, condom use, conceptions or pregnancy terminations, it did increase knowledge, and reduce regret of first sex (<LINK REF="REF-Wight-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wight 2002</LINK>). It is therefore important that interventionists' criteria for success take into account broader definitions of sexual health, and also that the aims of an intervention match participants' priorities.</P>

<P>In the protocol we said that we would analyse and present separately the results for studies that compare intervention to no intervention (or minimal intervention) (group 1), those that compare intervention to alternative forms of sexual health education (e.g. face-to-face teaching) (group 2), and those that compare two or more types of interactive computer-based intervention (group 3). We changed the inclusion criteria for the second and third categories slightly, to compare ICBI with non-computerised, face-to-face sexual health interventions (group 2) (because information-based forms of sexual health education such as leaflets are likely to be 'minimally active'), and to compare different designs of computer-based intervention (group 3) (because the design of an intervention can be investigated with computer-based interventions that are not ICBI by our definition).</P>
<P>We had intended to conduct sensitivity analyses (for example looking at studies' quality), and to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity (for example socio-demographic factors which could act as effect modifiers). We decided not to exclude studies on the basis of these factors but to describe studies' methodological or clinical heterogeneity narratively. We discuss possible effects of heterogeneity on the distribution of results, but did not re-run meta-analyses excluding studies.</P>
