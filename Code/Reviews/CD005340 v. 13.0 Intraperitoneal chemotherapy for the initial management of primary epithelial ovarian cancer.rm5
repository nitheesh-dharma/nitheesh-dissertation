<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-09-19 11:28:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ovarian cancer commonly spreads through the peritoneal cavity and usually responds to intravenous (IV) chemotherapy. This review compared the effectiveness of IV chemotherapy to chemotherapy administered directly into the peritoneal cavity (intraperitoneal, or IP). The evidence suggests an improvement in survival if some of the chemotherapy is administered via the intraperitoneal route. The disadvantage is an increase in adverse effects principally relating to the presence of a peritoneal catheter, including pain, catheter blockage, gastrointestinal effects and infection.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-19 11:28:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ovarian cancer tends to be chemosensitive and confine itself to the surface of the peritoneal cavity for much of its natural history. These features have made it an obvious target for intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy. Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is usually given as an intravenous (IV) infusion repeatedly over five to eight cycles. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy is given by infusion of the chemotherapeutic agent directly into the peritoneal cavity. There are biological reasons why this might increase the anticancer effect and reduce some systemic adverse effects in comparison to IV therapy.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-09-19 11:28:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine if adding a component of the chemotherapy regime into the peritoneal cavity affects overall survival, progression-free survival, quality of life (QOL) and toxicity in the primary treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-12-17 14:22:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Gynaecological Cancer Review Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 2, 2011, MEDLINE (1951 to May 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to May 2011). We updated these searches in February 2007, August 2010, May 2011 and September 2015. In addition, we handsearched and cascade searched the major gynaecological oncology journals up to May 2011.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-09-19 11:28:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The analysis was restricted to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing women with a new diagnosis of primary epithelial ovarian cancer, of any FIGO stage, following primary cytoreductive surgery.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-09-19 11:28:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nine randomised trials studied 2119 women receiving primary treatment for ovarian cancer. We considered six trials to be of high quality. Women were less likely to die if they received an IP component to chemotherapy (eight studies, 2026 women; HR = 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72 to 0.90). Intraperitoneal component chemotherapy prolonged the disease-free interval (five studies, 1311 women; HR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.70 to 0.86). There was greater serious toxicity with regard to gastrointestinal effects, pain, fever and infection but less ototoxicity with the IP than the IV route.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-09-19 11:28:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intraperitoneal chemotherapy increases overall survival and progression-free survival from advanced ovarian cancer. The results of this meta-analysis provide the most reliable estimates of the relative survival benefits of IP over IV therapy and should be used as part of the decision making process. However, the potential for catheter related complications and toxicity needs to be considered when deciding on the most appropriate treatment for each individual woman. The optimal dose, timing and mechanism of administration cannot be addressed from this meta-analysis. This needs to be addressed in the next phase of clinical trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-19 11:28:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-09-19 11:28:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the United States, epithelial ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer among women and ranks fourth in female cancer deaths (<LINK REF="REF-ACS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACS 2005</LINK>). The main treatment for advanced disease includes a combination of surgical removal of all resectable disease, if possible, followed by intravenous chemotherapy, including a platinum-based drug with or without a taxane. Based on a meta-analysis of 6885 women (including 81 cohorts of women with stage III and IV ovarian cancer), Bristow and colleagues demonstrated that women with &#8804; 25% maximal cytoreduction had a mean weighted median survival of 22.7 months; those with &gt; 75% maximal cytoreduction had a mean weighted median survival of 33.9 months - an increase of 50%. In addition, they showed that each 10% increase in maximal cytoreduction was associated with a 5.5% increase in median survival time (<LINK REF="REF-Bristow-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bristow 2002</LINK>). This has prompted large trials to evaluate the role of more aggressive surgery and alternative chemotherapy regimes. Further improvements are being sought to specifically target ovarian cancer cells within the peritoneal cavity. These include intraperitoneal antibodies, immunotherapy, radiotherapy and the administration of chemotherapeutic agents directly into the peritoneal cavity before, during or after surgery.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-09-19 11:28:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy for intra-abdominal cancer has its origins in the 1950s when nitrogen mustard was used intraperitoneally for malignant ascites (<LINK REF="REF-Weisberger-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisberger 1955</LINK>). This concept was developed in the 1970s when significantly greater concentrations of certain chemotherapeutic drugs were demonstrated in the peritoneal cavity than in the blood (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1978</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ovarian cancer remains confined to the peritoneal cavity for much of its natural history, spreading by local extension and then by direct spread from the surface of the ovary through the peritoneal cavity. This IP spread is the most common and recognized characteristic of ovarian cancer and makes the disease an ideal candidate for such a drug delivery strategy. The rationale for IP chemotherapy is to eradicate residual disease by concentrating the cytotoxic effect, generating high drug concentrations directly into the peritoneal cavity, and reducing the systemic toxic effects associated with the standard method of intravenous administration.</P>
<P>Intraperitoneal chemotherapy has several foreseeable limitations:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<LINK REF="REF-Los-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Los 1990</LINK> injected radiolabelled cisplatin into the peritoneal cavity of rats; IP concentrations of cisplatin were 10 to 20 times higher than serum levels, but IP tumour penetration depth was limited to 1 to 2 mm. This suggests that the benefit of IP chemotherapy may be limited to women with microscopic or very small volume residual disease after debulking surgery.</LI>
<LI>Ovarian cancer spreads not only by the transperitoneal route, but also via the lymphatic and venous system and by direct invasion through the diaphragm: these sites may not be targeted as well using IP as IV chemotherapy. In <LINK REF="REF-Burghardt-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burghardt 1991</LINK>, the incidence of positive nodes at primary surgery was reported to be as high as 24% in women with stage I disease, 50% in women with stage II disease, 74% in women with stage III disease, and 73% in women with stage IV disease. Therefore, concern arises as to the appropriateness of targeting the peritoneal cavity.</LI>
<LI>The peritoneal cavity in women with ovarian cancer is often distorted by adhesions and sanctuary sites may develop, limiting the access of cytotoxic drugs to tumour surfaces in these areas.</LI>
<LI>Complications of IP drug administration are well recognised and deterioration in QOL scores may be more significant with IP than with standard IV therapy.</LI>
<LI>Concentrations of IP platinum compounds are high after IV administration and IP instillation may not add therapeutic benefit.</LI>
<LI>IP chemotherapy administration requires more clinical space, more time, and a team of medical oncologists and nurses confident and experienced at both the technical aspects and management of complications.</LI>
<LI>Gynaecological oncologists need to be experienced and competent at maximal debulking surgery and insertion and removal of intraperitoneal catheters or intermittent direct transperitoneal infusions.</LI>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-09-19 11:28:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the 1970s there have been many phase I and phase II clinical trials evaluating the effects of IP chemotherapy, and several have been tested at phase III. In summary these phase I and II trials established the feasibility and safety of this approach (<LINK REF="REF-Howell-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howell 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lopez-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Markman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markman 1999</LINK>) but did not establish the efficacy of the treatment. By taking a systematic approach to reviewing all relevant phase III studies, this review of available literature focuses on survival, adverse events and QOL comparing IP with IV chemotherapy. This is an updated version of our original review (<LINK REF="REF-Jaaback-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaaback 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. We explored the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis. For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.<BR/>

<P>We carried out statistical analyses using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect, i.e. where trials were examining similar populations and used similar methods. If survival methods were used but HRs not reported, we estimated HRs using Parmar's methods (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where necessary, we combined different categories of toxicity within trials in order to facilitate pooling of data from different trials. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. Where we used random-effects analyses, the results are presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of T² and I².</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Zylberberg-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Zylberberg 1986</LINK> is the earliest RCT on IP chemotherapy for the initial management of epithelial ovarian cancer. They randomised 20 women with stage III disease to receive either IV chemotherapy including doxorubicin, fluorouracil, bleomycin, cisplatin, vinorelbine and ifosfamide, or a combination of IV doxorubicin, fluorouracil, bleomycin, cisplatin, vinorelbine, ifosfamide and IP bleomycin, cisplatin, fluorouracil and doxorubicin. Both groups received maintenance intramuscular chemotherapy with 12 monthly courses of ifosfamide, fluorouracil, and methotrexate. Ten women were randomised to each arm and the outcome of each patient was reported. They described a statistically significant increase in the number of women alive and free of disease in the IP group (P &lt; 0.05) but no further statistics were provided. In the IV group, of the 10 randomised, there were five deaths after 11, 18, 24, 38 and 62 months and five free of relapse after 31, 40, 42, 64 and 72 months. In the IP group there was one death after 29 months, two with residual disease resected at second look laparotomy, free of disease after 23 and 54 months, and the other seven were free of disease after 23, 23, 27, 28, 34, 58 and 59 months. More mature data are unfortunately not available and our attempts to contact the lead author were unsuccessful. We were able to construct a Kaplan-Meier curve for time to death and these data have been included in the survival meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kirmani-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kirmani 1994</LINK> randomised 87 women with stage IIC-IV disease over four years to receive IV cisplatin 100 mg/m² and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m² or IP cisplatin 200 mg/m² and etoposide 350 mg/m². Of these, 68 were evaluable for toxicity, 62 for survival (33 IV and 29 IP), and 46 for response. Ten were excluded from participation after review of the pathology. Seven women refused their assigned treatment arm (4 IP and 3 IV). For various reasons another eight women were not evaluable for response. The two groups were well balanced with respect to age, stage and residual disease, but more in the IV group had an ECOG performance status of 0 (14 versus 5) and fewer had a status of 2 (3 versus 6). This was the only trial comparing direct IV to IP (without additional IV) chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier curves show non-significantly better overall survival in the IV arm. Disease-free survival included only those with no clinical evidence of disease at the end of treatment, and also showed no significant difference between the two groups. However, only 25 IV and 21 IP women were evaluable for this assessment. There was also no detectable difference in either haematological or non-haematological toxicity between the high-dose IP regime and the standard-dose IV regime.</P>
<P>The North West Oncology Group trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gadducci-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gadducci 2000</LINK>) was run over 7½ years, and randomised 113 women with 100 evaluable (54 IV and 46 IP) participants. They considered stage II-IV disease with &lt; 2 cm residual disease after debulking surgery. The chemotherapy arms included IV or IP cisplatin 50 mg/m². Both groups also received IV epidoxorubicin 60 mg/m² + IV cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m². Twenty-two women did not complete the assigned treatment (2 IV and 20 IP). Significant reasons for treatment change in the IP arm included patient refusal (6), bowel perforation (3) and abdominal pain (2). Patient characteristics were well balanced in the two groups except histotype. Seven women with clear cell histology were randomly allocated to the IV arm. Median disease free survival was 25 and 42 months for the IV and IP arms (P = 0.13) and median overall survival was 51 and 67 months (P = 0.14). Similar survival curves were obtained after exclusion of the women with clear cell histology. The only significant toxicity difference was more grade 3-4 myelotoxicity in the IP group (52% versus 34%).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Polyzos-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Polyzos 1999</LINK> randomised 90 women (46 IV and 44 IP) with stage III disease randomised to receive either IV or IP carboplatin 350 mg/m² all of whom were eligible for analysis. Both groups also received IV cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m². There were no statistically significant differences in the distribution of characteristics of the women between the two chemotherapy groups. There was no maximum tumour diameter permitted for entry into this trial. A residual tumour volume &#8805; 2 cm was found in 43% of women. There were no significant differences in time to progression or overall survival in the two groups, even after adjusting for residual tumour volume but we were unable to obtain the survival curves to include data in the meta-analysis. Significantly more women in the IV group had grade 3 or 4 leukopenia (P &lt; 0.01) and non-significantly more grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (P &lt; 0.09). However, 10% of women receiving IP chemotherapy were reported to have major catheter-related morbidity, including three cases of chemotherapy infused directly into the large bowel with ensuing massive diarrhoea, and two cases where fluid was infused between layers of the abdominal wall. Weaknesses in this study include the poor statistical power with the low number randomised. Fewer women had tumour volumes &lt; 2 cm (25 IV and 26 IP). The randomisation technique and allocation concealment was unclear, and analysis by intention-to-treat was not described.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Yen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 2001</LINK> randomised 132 women with stage III disease to receive either IV cisplatin 50 mg/m² or IP cisplatin 100 mg/m² and of these 118 were eligible (55 IV and 63 IP). Both groups also received IV adriamycin or epirubicin 50 mg/m² and IV cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m². There were no significant differences between the two study groups with regard to important prognostic factors. All women initially had optimal debulking surgery with residual disease of &#8804; 1 cm. The median survival rates were 43 months for the IP group and 48 months for the IV group (P = 0.469). Significantly more women in the IV group had grade 3 or 4 leukopenia but there was no significant increase in thrombocytopenia or anaemia. Catheter-related complications in the IP group included pain (41.8%) and obstruction (25.5%).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Alberts-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Alberts 1996</LINK> coordinated the first large study incorporating investigators from the SWOG and GOG, randomising 654 women with residual disease of &#8804; 2 cm to either IP or IV cisplatin (100 mg/m²); 546 women were finally eligible. Both groups also received IV cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m². The trial investigators included a subgroup analysis in January 1991, four and a half years after the study commenced accrual, after consensus emerged that women with a residual tumour size of &#8804; 0.5 cm would be most likely to benefit from IP chemotherapy. The study was then extended for an additional year to achieve an adequate (powered) sample size for analysis of this subgroup. There were no significant differences between the two study groups with respect to important prognostic factors. The IP arm had significantly less myelotoxicity and tinnitus but there were no major differences between the two arms in terms of severe toxicity, treatment-related deaths and removal of women from the study due to adverse events.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Markman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Markman 2001</LINK> randomised 532 women with 462 evaluable (227 IV and 235 IP) and compared an IV paclitaxel plus cisplatin regime with an experimental combination of two courses of high dose IV carboplatin followed by six courses of IV paclitaxel plus IP cisplatin. The maximum tumour diameter permitted for entry into this trial was 1 cm. Women in the IP arm had a median disease-free survival of 28 months and a median overall survival of 63 months, both of which were superior to the median 22-month progression-free survival and median 52-month overall survival associated with IV-administered drugs (P = 0.02 and P = 0.05, respectively). Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and gastrointestinal and metabolic toxicities were significantly greater in the IP group such that 18% of these women actually received &#8804; 2 cycles of intraperitoneal cisplatin. This was thought to be a consequence of the two initial high dose IV carboplatin treatments (AUC 9), designed to minimize the residual volume of disease prior to IP treatment.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-GOG-172" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 172</LINK> was a similar trial for women with stage III, optimally de-bulked ovarian cancer. In this trial 429 women were randomised and 14 were ineligible. This left 210 in the IV arm to receive paclitaxel 135 mg/m² plus cisplatin 75 mg/m² and 205 in the IP arm to receive IV paclitaxel 135 mg/m² plus IP cisplatin 100 mg/m² plus IP paclitaxel 60 mg/m² on day 8, with each regime delivered every 21 days for 6 cycles. The principal endpoint was progression-free interval, with secondary endpoints being overall survival and toxicity and quality of life scores. Data provided by the study chair from the GOG meeting in January 2005 revealed the following: 429 women had entered, well balanced for prognostic factors and completion of treatment in each arm. There were significantly more grade 3 or 4 toxicities in the IP arm, including leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal, renal, neurologic, fatigue, infection, metabolic and pain scores. This may be expected due to the use of a higher IV cisplatin dose (100 mg/m² v 75 mg/m²) and the addition of IP paclitaxel on day eight. Nevertheless, the median progression-free interval and time to death for the IP group was prolonged, with the RR of recurrence 0.79 and a RR of death 0.75, suggesting a therapeutic advantage for IP therapy. These data have since been published (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Yen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 2009</LINK> randomised Stage III ovarian cancer patients to IP versus IV cisplatin or carboplatin after giving all IV paclitaxel. The objective of the trial and published manuscript was to construct a prognostic nomogram addressing the following risk factors: age, CA-125, IP/IV delivery, stage, histology, and upper abdominal metastases. Out of 367 women recruited, 298 were analysed (152 in IV group and 146 in IP group). Chemotherapy consisted of a three hour infusion of paclitaxel (175mg/m²) on day one to all women. On day two, platinum (either 100 mg/m² cisplatin or 300 mg/m² carboplatin) was administered by either the IP or IV route. This was repeated every three weeks for six cycles provided serum creatinine was less than or equal to 2 mg/dl, WCC &gt; 3000/mm<SUP>3</SUP>, and platelet count was &gt; 80,000/mm<SUP>3</SUP>. IP therapy was discontinued and shifted to IV chemotherapy if catheter problems occurred. Published data consisted of a nomogram to predict survival, including an odds ratio (OR) for IV versus IP of 2.14 (95% CI 1.93 to 2.41) in favour of IP therapy. The investigators also showed that they could identify the subset of women who are least likely to benefit from IP chemotherapy, i.e. age &gt; 80 years or with baseline CA 125 &gt; 3000 U/ml or Stage IIIc disease or clear cell carcinoma or upper abdominal tumour metastases or colon resection, and may, therefore, be spared the potential complications. We obtained additional methodological information and unpublished data, including survival data and adverse effects (Grade 3/4), from the trial investigators.</P>
<P>Overall survival data were extracted from the reports and unpublished data of all but one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Polyzos-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Polyzos 1999</LINK>). Five trials provided HRs and covariates in Cox regression analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Alberts-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Alberts 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GOG-172" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 172</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Markman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Markman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 2009</LINK> <I>[unpublished data]</I>). Most included age, tumour type and grade, performance status and residual disease as covariates prior to commencing chemotherapy. Six trials displayed Kaplan-Meier survival curves (<LINK REF="STD-Alberts-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Alberts 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gadducci-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gadducci 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GOG-172" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 172</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kirmani-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kirmani 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Markman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Markman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 2001</LINK>) and we were able to construct a survival curve for the <LINK REF="STD-Zylberberg-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Zylberberg 1986</LINK> trial from individual patient data presented. One of these presented sufficient data to allow calculation of the HR using Parmar's methods (<LINK REF="STD-Gadducci-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gadducci 2000</LINK>). The HR of death for <LINK REF="STD-Kirmani-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kirmani 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zylberberg-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Zylberberg 1986</LINK> was estimated from the Kaplan-Meier survival curves.

<P>Disease-free survival data and Kaplan-Meier disease-free survival curves were available from five trials (including unpublished data from <LINK REF="STD-Yen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 2009</LINK>). Two presented the calculated HRs (<LINK REF="STD-GOG-172" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 172</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Markman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Markman 2001</LINK>), two trials presented sufficient data to allow calculation of the HR using Parmar's methods (<LINK REF="STD-Gadducci-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gadducci 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 2009</LINK>) and the HR of recurrence for <LINK REF="STD-Kirmani-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kirmani 1994</LINK> was estimated from the Kaplan-Meier diease-free survival curves. The definitions of recurrence varied amongst these trials. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Kirmani-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kirmani 1994</LINK> used the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group definition, <LINK REF="STD-Markman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Markman 2001</LINK> used date of entry to date of appearance of disease (clinical or radiological) or equated it to survival, <LINK REF="STD-Gadducci-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gadducci 2000</LINK> used date of entry to date of first progression and <LINK REF="STD-GOG-172" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 172</LINK> used date of randomisation to progression, death, or the date of last contact, whichever came first.</P>

Women who received higher dose IP therapy (paclitaxel 135 mg/m² IV, cisplatin 100 mg/m² IP, paclitaxel 60 mg/m² IP) experienced more QOL disruption when compared to those who received the more conventional dose of IV therapy (paclitaxel 135 mg/m² IV, cisplatin 75 mg/m² IV). Women in the IP arm reported worse QOL and pain prior to the fourth chemotherapy cycle (P &lt; 0.001) and worse QOL 3 to 6 weeks post-treatment (P = 0.009). The <LINK REF="STD-GOG-172" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 172</LINK> protocol exposed women in the IP arm to additional taxol and neurotoxicity was significantly worse in the IP arm 3 to 6 weeks after completing chemotherapy (P = 0.0004), and one year later (P = 0.0018). There were no significant QOL or PAIN score differences between arms one year post-treatment.<B>

In <LINK REF="STD-GOG-172" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 172</LINK>, of the 205 women in the IP arm 118 (58%) did not complete 6 cycles of IP therapy. Intraperitoneal therapy was stopped in 34 (28.8%) for reasons unrelated to the peritoneal access device, but catheter failures occurred in 49 (41.5%) women. Catheter complications were the primary cause for discontinuing IP therapy in 39% participants. Descending colon or rectosigmoid colon resection appeared to decrease the number of cycles successfully delivered (P = 0.022).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Survival data were statistically homogeneous and the results are robust to the findings of the original review. Women in the IP arms of <LINK REF="STD-GOG-172" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 172</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Markman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Markman 2001</LINK> received a higher total chemotherapy dose initially; however, more women finished their IV course of therapy (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) and very-high-dose-chemotherapy intravenously did not improve clinical outcome. Women in the IP arm of <LINK REF="STD-GOG-172" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 172</LINK> received dose-dense paclitaxel which may have an advantage over standard taxane administration (<LINK REF="REF-Katsumata-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katsumata 2009</LINK>). When we excluded these two trials from the survival meta-analyses for exploratory purposes, the improvement in survival in the IP group remained. <LINK REF="STD-Alberts-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Alberts 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gadducci-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gadducci 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polyzos-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Polyzos 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 2009</LINK> describe trials where the chemotherapy regimes are similar in each arm and the survival outcome was similar when the analysis was restricted to these trials. Thus, we concluded that the intraperitoneal route is associated with an increased cure rate beyond the simple addition of more agents or a higher dose.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Haematological (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), renal, neurologic and pulmonary toxicity data were heterogeneous and so the meta-analyses with respect to these outcomes are less reliable. This heterogeneity can be explained clinically by the different dosages, variable schedules of chemotherapy administration and different drugs used, not only between the trials, but also between arms of the same trial. It is not surprising that the <LINK REF="STD-Markman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Markman 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-GOG-172" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 172</LINK> studies revealed significantly greater haematological toxicity in the IP arm in contrast to the findings from <LINK REF="STD-Alberts-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Alberts 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gadducci-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gadducci 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Polyzos-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Polyzos 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yen-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zylberberg-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Zylberberg 1986</LINK> who all used regimes which could be expected to be more balanced with respect to this adverse effect. The <LINK REF="STD-Markman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Markman 2001</LINK> trial used two cycles of very high dose (AUC 9) carboplatin to prime women allocated to intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The conventional IV dose is limited to AUC 6 because the additional toxicity from a higher dose does not translate into a survival advantage. This, in itself, will explain the haematologic toxicity in this group of women. The <LINK REF="STD-GOG-172" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 172</LINK> trial included a higher total dose of both cisplatin and paclitaxel in the IP arm and this, too, may explain the additional haematological toxicity seen here. Toxicity from IP chemotherapy including catheter-related adverse effects and haematologic toxicity are major reasons for the lack of acceptance of this treatment option in current gynaecologic oncology practice. More attention has been focused on ameliorating this, including modification of the <LINK REF="STD-GOG-172" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 172</LINK> regime with lower dose IP cisplatin and slower IP infusion (<LINK REF="REF-Chi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chi 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Data on pulmonary toxicity, including transient dyspnoea, were also heterogeneous and included three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alberts-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Alberts 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GOG-172" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 172</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 2009</LINK>) one of which revealed a significant increase in toxicity in the IP arm (<LINK REF="STD-Alberts-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Alberts 1996</LINK>). This can be explained clinically by the rapid IP injection of two litres of normal saline in this trial, resulting in compression of the base of the lungs and hence transient dyspnoea.</P>
<P>QOL comparison was only assessed in the <LINK REF="STD-GOG-172" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 172</LINK> trial. More disruption was noted in the IP arm during and shortly after treatment but quality of life improved in both arms over time. Only neurotoxicity remained significantly greater in the IP group 12 months after completion of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Wenzel-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wenzel 2007</LINK>). This difference in QOL may be due to the higher total dose of both cisplatin and paclitaxel in the IP arm rather than the method of chemotherapy administration.</P>
<P>When we restricted the analysis to trials that compared the same chemotherapy regimes and differed only by route of administration, we found that the IP catheter causes pain but there are no other detectable differences that are statistically significant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment regimens</HEADING>
<P>The trials in this review studied very different regimens, most of them including cisplatin in the IP arm. However, current standard therapy for the primary treatment of ovarian cancer is carboplatin with or without a taxane (<LINK REF="REF-du-Bois-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">du Bois 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ozols-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ozols 2003</LINK>). Carboplatin has been used with good effect and it remains in the peritoneal cavity for longer than if it was given by the intravenous route. Twenty-four hour platinum AUC in the peritoneal cavity is approximately 17 times higher when carboplatin is administered IP compared with IV administration, whilst 24 hour serum concentrations are the same.</P>
<P>Multiple studies have addressed the potential benefits of carboplatin over cisplatin for intraperitoneal use with reports of better tolerance, less discontinuation of therapy, less impact on quality of life, but with greater haematologic toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Fujiwara-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fujiwara 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fujiwara-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fujiwara 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fujiwara-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fujiwara 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gray-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zeimet-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeimet 2009</LINK>). Hence, IP carboplatin has been included in all three ongoing inter-group trials: <LINK REF="STD-GOG-0252" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 0252</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-NCIC-CTG-OV.21" TYPE="STUDY">NCIC CTG OV.21</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-GOTIC_x002d_001_x002f_JGOG_x002d_3019" TYPE="STUDY">GOTIC-001/JGOG-3019</LINK> (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> and <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-GOG-0252" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 0252</LINK> is an ongoing phase III trial comparing two different IP regimens to IV chemotherapy, all given with bevacizumab during chemotherapy and as consolidation. They also incorporate dose-dense paclitaxel in all three arms, based on the results of the JGOG study reporting a significant improvement in survival associated with dose-dense paclitaxel (<LINK REF="REF-Katsumata-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katsumata 2009</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-NCIC-CTG-OV.21" TYPE="STUDY">NCIC CTG OV.21</LINK> phase III trial is comparing IP/IV against IV chemotherapy after three to four courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The Japanese GOG and Gynecologic Oncology Trial and Investigations Consortium (GOTIC) are currently recruiting to a phase III trial comparing IP carboplatin versus IV carboplatin, both given with weekly dose-dense IV paclitaxel (<LINK REF="STD-GOTIC_x002d_001_x002f_JGOG_x002d_3019" TYPE="STUDY">GOTIC-001/JGOG-3019</LINK>). Results of these trials should supplement the evidence supporting intraperitoneal chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Women likely to benefit most from IP chemotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Evidence from <LINK REF="STD-GOG-172" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 172</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Makhija-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makhija 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 2009</LINK> suggests that distal colonic resections predispose to catheter complications and reduce the number of successful cycles delivered. We consider upper abdominal bowel surgery to be a relative contraindication as bowel injury from a catheter may be avoided by intermittent intraperitoneal injections. Current opinion, however, favours preferentially selecting IP therapy for women with minimal residual disease, who have not required upper abdominal bowel surgery, and have chemosensitive tumours such as serous papillary morphology. This group is most likely to benefit and to gain an exaggerated survival advantage.</P>
<P>Mathematical modelling of the data reported by <LINK REF="STD-Yen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 2009</LINK> shows that one, two or three cycles of IP therapy were all associated with a median survival of about 44 months, compared with 53 months if five or more cycles were given. This implies that we should aim for five cycles of IP chemotherapy. The modelling also suggests that the prognosis is so poor for elderly women with clear cell tumours, especially those who have not been optimally debulked, that the added toxicity and side effects from IP therapy over IV treatment exceeds the benefits.<BR/>

<P>The results of this review support the use of IP chemotherapy. IP chemotherapy increases both overall survival and progression-free survival in women with advanced ovarian cancer. The potential for catheter-related complications and complications relating to toxicity need to be taken into consideration in dialogue between the clinician and patient when deciding on the most appropriate form of treatment for the individual. However, this meta-analysis provides the current most reliable estimates of the survival benefits associated with IP therapy and should be used as part of this decision making process.</P>
<P>It is difficult to translate these data into real advantages. A HR of 0.81 and 0.78 for time to death and time to recurrence reflects a significant survival advantage. However, one woman out of 13 is likely to suffer fever, one in nine will get an infection, one in six will experience pain from the catheter that she would not have experienced had she received intravenous chemotherapy alone, and one in three might suffer serious (grade 3 or 4) gastrointestinal toxicity to gain this survival advantage. These complications might be reduced by selecting a less toxic regime or better administration technique. Until new data are available, we can tell women that the trials show that the IP route has significant difficulties but there is a survival advantage to the IP route of administration.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-12-17 14:03:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This meta-analysis cannot determine if the taxane component should be given intraperitoneally. The theoretical disadvantage of intraperitoneal taxane is that it is associated with a significant risk of catheter adhesions and the theoretical therapeutic advantages are limited. Taxanes are complex molecules that are not well absorbed from the peritoneal cavity and consequently very high concentrations are found intraperitoneally after intravenous administration. The role of intraperitoneal paclitaxel is being addressed specifically in the <LINK REF="STD-NCIC-CTG-OV.21" TYPE="STUDY">NCIC CTG OV.21</LINK> trial.</P>
<P>The three ongoing GCIG trials will add data to answer the outstanding questions around the optimal IP drug, dose, combination and number of courses of IP chemotherapy. There has been some progress made on elucidating which subgroups may benefit from IP chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Yen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Yen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yen 2009</LINK> modelling also showed that we should aim for 5 cycles of IP therapy, but more can be done in this area.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-GOG-0252" TYPE="STUDY">GOG 0252</LINK> stratifies the participants by stage and size of residual disease which should help to determine whether IP chemotherapy is beneficial for more advanced disease. IP catheter complications include blockage, catheter leakage, infection, diarrhoea, bowel perforation and fistula formation. These problems might be reduced by a single-use catheter rather than the semi-permanent subcutaneous implantable port and catheter system, like the Tenckhoff, Port-A-Cath or BardPort systems; this is also in need of evaluation.</P>
<P>To date, there are few QOL data from trials using similar chemotherapy regimes and more data on this outcome, when the ongoing GCIG trials mature, will be invaluable. More trials comparing different IP chemotherapy administration techniques may be worthwhile. The main focus must be to compare IP carboplatin with cisplatin. VEGF inhibitors are effective at reducing ascites and have a significant progression-free survival advantage (<LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2013</LINK>) but their role in IP treatment is unknown and, to date, there are no data on their use with IP chemotherapy. Similarly, there is limited evidence evaluating heated IP therapy but a small Italian phase II trial has recently been published with promising results in terms of survival with comparable morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Deraco-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deraco 2011</LINK>), and a Dutch trial is ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-Hyperthermic-IP-therapy" TYPE="STUDY">Hyperthermic IP therapy</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The following methods of assessment of bias were used in earlier versions of this review. Where the method of allocation was truly random e.g. computer generated random numbers, coin tossed etc, this was coded as:</P>
<P>(a) Adequate, e.g. women allocated to treatment arms using a sequence of random (or pseudo-random) numbers;<BR/>(b) Inadequate randomisation, e.g. women allocated to treatment arms on basis of clinic id, surname, month, day of the week;<BR/>(c) Unclear.</P>
<P>Where there was proper concealment of allocation; this was coded as:</P>
<P>(a) Adequate, e.g. randomisation carried out on a central site and transmitted to treatment providers by telephone, fax, or sealed opaque envelope;<BR/>(b) Inadequate;<BR/>(c) Unclear.</P>
<P>Where blinding of the outcome assessor was performed, this was recorded as:</P>
<P>(a) Blinding of the outcome assessor was performed;<BR/>(b) Blinding of the outcome assessor was not performed;<BR/>(c) Unclear.</P>
<P>Where loss to follow-up was accounted for, numbers lost to follow-up in each treatment arm were noted.</P>
<P>It was noted whether intention-to-treat analysis (understood to mean that participants were analysed in the groups to which they were initially assigned, regardless of which treatment they actually received) was performed. This was recorded as:</P>
<P>(a) Intention-to-treat analysis was performed;<BR/>(b) Intention-to-treat analysis was not performed;<BR/>(c) Unclear.</P>
<P>An overall description of the quality of trials is included in the report. Trials were defined as being of low quality if they were of poor quality in at least three of the above areas (Table 1).</P>
