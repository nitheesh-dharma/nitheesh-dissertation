<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-06-13 13:28:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A partogram is usually a pre-printed form, the aim of which is to provide a pictorial overview of labour progress and to alert health professionals to any problems with the mother or baby. It has been unclear whether a partogram should be used and, if so, which design of partogram is better for women and babies. The review authors identified six randomised controlled trials involving 7706 women in spontaneous labour at term. Two studies, with 1590 women, assessed introducing the use of a partogram versus routine care without a partogram. Four studies, involving 6116 women, compared different types of partograms. Overall, there was no evidence from this review that using a partogram reduced or increased caesarean section rates or had any effect on other aspects of care in labour. Where different types of partogram were compared, no design appeared better than others. A single centre study, conducted in India, however, comparing a partogram with a latent phase (composite) and one without, demonstrated more favourable outcomes for the mother and baby when the modified chart was used. It is possible that partograms may be useful in settings with poorer access to healthcare resources, as studies in Mexico and Africa also showed some reduction in caesarean section rates with partogram use and early intervention for delayed progress in labour.</P>

<P>The partogram (sometimes known as partograph) is usually a pre-printed paper form on which labour observations are recorded. The aim of the partogram is to provide a pictorial overview of labour, to alert midwives and obstetricians to deviations in maternal or fetal wellbeing and labour progress. Charts often contain pre-printed alert and action lines. An alert line represents the slowest 10% of primigravid women's labour progress. An action line is placed a number of hours after the alert line (usually two or four hours) to prompt effective management of slow progress of labour.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-13 13:27:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have included six studies involving 7706 women in this review; two studies assessed partogram versus no partogram and the remainder assessed different partogram designs. There was no evidence of any difference between partogram and no partogram in caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 1.70); instrumental vaginal delivery (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.17) or Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.06) between the groups. When compared to a four-hour action line, women in the two-hour action line group were more likely to require oxytocin augmentation (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.22). When the three- and four-hour action line groups were compared, caesarean section rate was lowest in the four-hour action line group and this difference was statistically significant (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.70, n = 613, one trial). When a partogram with a latent phase (composite) and one without (modified) were compared, the caesarean section rate was lower in the partograph without a latent phase (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.72 to 3.50, n = 743, one trial).<BR/>

<P>On the basis of the findings of this review, we cannot recommend routine use of the partogram as part of standard labour management and care. Given the fact that the partogram is currently in widespread use and generally accepted, it appears reasonable, until stronger evidence is available, that partogram use should be locally determined. Further trial evidence is required to establish the efficacy of partogram use.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-06-13 13:32:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-06-12 13:09:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Detection of prolonged labour is important as both postpartum haemorrhage and infection are more common in women with long labours (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2003</LINK>). These risks are greater in developing countries with poorly-resourced health services.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-06-13 13:30:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The partogram (or partograph) is a simple, inexpensive tool to provide a continuous pictorial overview of labour. The partogram is a pre-printed form, usually in paper version, on which midwives and obstetricians record labour observations. Most partograms have three distinct sections where observations are entered on maternal condition, fetal condition and labour progress; this last section assists in the detection of prolonged labour (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The first obstetrician to describe the progress of labour graphically was Friedman (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1954</LINK>) following his study of the cervical dilatation of 100 African primigravidae at term. The women were given frequent rectal examinations and their progress was recorded in centimetres of dilatation per hour, producing a slope resembling a sigmoid curve ('S' shaped). This became know as the cervicograph. In an attempt to utilise midwives efficiently in a hospital and clinic service in Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia), where doctors were in short supply, <LINK REF="REF-Philpott-1972a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philpott 1972a</LINK> developed a partogram from this original cervicograph. This provided a practical tool for recording all intrapartum details, not just cervical dilatation. An 'alert line' was added following the results of a prospective study of 624 women (<LINK REF="REF-Philpott-1972b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philpott 1972b</LINK>). The alert line was straight not curved and was a modification of the mean rate of cervical dilatation of the slowest 10% of primigravid women who were in the active phase of labour. This line represented a progress rate of 1 cm per hour. Should a woman's cervical dilatation progress more slowly, it would cross this alert line and arrangements were made to transfer her from a peripheral unit to a central unit where prolonged labour could be managed. The next stage of partogram development was the introduction of an 'action line', four hours to the right of the alert line (<LINK REF="REF-Philpott-1972c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philpott 1972c</LINK>). This line was developed to identify primary inefficient uterine activity to prompt appropriate management. Correction of primary inefficient uterine activity would usually be with an intervention such as amniotomy or oxytocin infusion, or both.</P>
<P>There have been a number of challenges associated with partograph completion, including shortages of human resources, low status within labour wards and inadequate training (<LINK REF="REF-Fatusi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fatusi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lavender-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavender 2011</LINK>). These challenges has resulted in a number of adaptations to the original partograph, one of which is the simplified partograph (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). In a small cross-over trial, this partograph was shown to be more &#8216;user-friendly&#8217; (<LINK REF="STD-Mathews-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mathews 2007</LINK>). More recently, a randomised controlled trial, in India (<LINK REF="STD-Kenchaveeriah-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kenchaveeriah 2011</LINK>), comparing the modified with the traditional partograph, confirmed a preference amongst medical staff of using the simplified version.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-06-13 13:31:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The partogram has been heralded as one of the most important advances in modern obstetric care (<LINK REF="REF-Safe-Motherhood-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safe Motherhood 1990</LINK>); however, this was prior to any rigorous evaluation. Furthermore, the majority of early studies took place in hospital settings where most maternal deaths occur among women admitted with severe complications and often neglected labour (<LINK REF="REF-Lennox-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennox 1995</LINK>). More than 20 years after its introduction, and using a partogram adapted from that formulated by Philpott and Castle (<LINK REF="REF-Philpott-1972b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philpott 1972b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Philpott-1972c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philpott 1972c</LINK>) the World Health Organization (<LINK REF="STD-WHO-1994" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1994</LINK>) conducted a prospective non-randomised study of 35,484 women in South East Asia and concluded that the partogram was a necessary tool in the management of labour and recommended its universal application. In this study, four pairs of hospitals participated (two pairs in Indonesia, one each in Thailand and Malaysia). A staged approach was adopted, whereby for the first five months of the study all eight centres collected baseline data; after five months the partogram was randomly introduced into one of each pair; in the remaining five months the partogram was introduced into all hospital sites. Introduction of the partogram, and agreed management protocol, reduced prolonged labour (from 6.4% to 3.4%), the proportion of labours requiring augmentation (20.7% to 9.1%), emergency caesarean section (from 9.9% to 8.3%) and stillbirths (from 0.5% to 0.3%).</P>
<P>A belief that partogram use is not affected by racial, cultural and socioeconomic differences, led to the approach finding favour in both high-income and low- to middle-income countries. However, in practice, it is conceivable that such variations in care between countries, and even units, may alter the use of the partogram and subsequent effectiveness, in terms of maternal and neonatal outcomes. As a consequence, some practitioners have questioned its effectiveness, particularly when used in high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Groeschel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groeschel 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is some evidence to suggest that midwives find the partogram to have practical benefits in terms of ease of use, time resourcefulness, continuity of care and educational assistance (<LINK REF="REF-Lavender-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavender 1999</LINK>). These positive aspects may contribute to improving maternal and fetal outcomes. On the other hand, it has also been reported that the partogram's status within some obstetric units is such that they may restrict clinical practice, reduce midwife autonomy and limit the flexibility to treat each woman as an individual (<LINK REF="REF-Lavender-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavender 1999</LINK>), factors which could also impact on clinical and psychological outcomes. Conversely, in a qualitative study in Kenya (<LINK REF="REF-Lavender-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavender 2011</LINK>, student midwives reported the lack of status held by the partogram amongst midwives and obstetricians; this, they suggested created a barrier to partogram use.</P>
<P>Furthermore, there are worries that the use of the partogram can create unnecessary interference (<LINK REF="REF-Walraven-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walraven 1994</LINK>). This is because by assuming that all women will progress in labour at the same rate, partogram use could have adverse effects such as increased rates of artificial rupture of the membranes, oxytocin augmentation and use of analgesia resulting in a more negative labour experience.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-06-13 13:32:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The partogram has become an integral part of routine labour care in most parts of the world; assessment of its efficacy is therefore imperative.</P>
<P>Different designs of partogram exist, and <LINK REF="STD-Cartmill-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cartmill 1992</LINK> hypothesised that the way a partograph is presented may affect an obstetrician's perception of the labour progress and thus influences decision-making. This hypothesis has received some support from others (<LINK REF="REF-Lavender-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavender 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tay-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tay 1996</LINK>) who have suggested that the slope and position of the action line have an impact on caesarean section, intervention and maternal satisfaction.</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to assess the benefits and harms of partogram use on women in labour to enable women and clinicians to make informed evidence-based decisions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4"> (2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether the intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>

<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses which we undertook.</P>

<P>We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it was clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review had been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes had been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings.  We explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see '</I>Sensitivity analysis'. </P>

<P>Cluster-randomised trials were eligible, however, we did not identify any cluster-randomised trials for inclusion.</P>
<P>If cluster-randomised trials become available in future updates, they will be included in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We will adjust their<I> </I>sample sizes<I> </I>using the methods described in the <I>Handbook </I>using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>
<P>We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.</P>

<P>Cross-over trials were not eligible for inclusion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. The impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect was explored by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, analyses were carried out, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.  </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the T², I² and Chi² statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if the I² was greater than 30% and either T² was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity.<B> </B>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>If there were 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we planned to investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We planned to assess funnel plot asymmetry visually, and to use formal tests for funnel plot asymmetry. For continuous outcomes we would have used the test proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>, and for dichotomous outcomes we would have used the test proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Harbord-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harbord 2006</LINK>. If asymmetry was detected in any of these tests or was suggested by a visual assessment, we would have performed exploratory analyses to investigate it.<I>
<BR/>

</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials.</P>
<P>Where we used random-effects analyses, the results are presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of  T² and I².</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>If substantial heterogeneity was identified, we investigated it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We considered whether an overall summary was meaningful, and if it was, used random-effects analysis.</P>
<P>We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Resource setting: low versus high.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We planned to use the following outcomes in subgroup analyses: caesarean section, oxytocin augmentation, duration of first stage of labour, maternal experience, Apgar score and admission to special care baby unit.</P>
<P>For future updates for fixed-effect inverse variance meta-analyses, we will assess differences between subgroups by interaction tests. For random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses using methods other than inverse variance, we will assess differences between subgroups by inspection of the subgroups&#8217; confidence intervals; non-overlapping confidence intervals indicate a statistically significant difference in treatment effect between the subgroups.</P>

One additional report (<LINK REF="STD-Ajoodani-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ajoodani 2011</LINK>) was identified from an updated search in 2013 and is awaiting translation.</P>
<P>Two studies compared partogram versus no partogram (<LINK REF="STD-Walss-Rodriguez-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walss Rodriguez 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Windrim-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Windrim 2006</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Windrim-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Windrim 2006</LINK> study took place in Canada and the <LINK REF="STD-Walss-Rodriguez-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walss Rodriguez 1987</LINK> study in Mexico; therefore, they were from two very different settings. The <LINK REF="STD-Windrim-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Windrim 2006</LINK> study and <LINK REF="STD-Walss-Rodriguez-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walss Rodriguez 1987</LINK> study both compared their usual descriptive, sequential, recording of intrapartum details, with an experimental arm, i.e. the partogram. In the <LINK REF="STD-Windrim-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Windrim 2006</LINK> study the partogram used incorporated a two-hour alert line, but no action line. In the quasi-randomised trial by <LINK REF="STD-Walss-Rodriguez-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walss Rodriguez 1987</LINK>, a 'Friedman' (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1954</LINK>) partogram was used. The partogram was not currently in use in either unit. Two studies compared partograms with different placement of action lines (<LINK REF="STD-Lavender-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lavender-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Lavender-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 2006</LINK> was a two-arm trial and <LINK REF="STD-Lavender-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 1998a</LINK> was a three-arm trial. Other than the placement of the action line, labour management remained consistent. If progress crossed the action line, a diagnosis of prolonged labour was made and managed according to standard protocol; this involved clinical assessment and augmentation, as appropriate. Both studies took place in a single hospital in England. One study, in South Africa, compared a partogram with an alert and action line with one which contained an alert line only (<LINK REF="STD-Pattinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pattinson 2003</LINK>). In this study, the group that received a partogram with only an alert line received more aggressive intrapartum management; a vaginal examination was carried out every two hours and oxytocin infusion advocated when progress crossed the line. Those with an alert and action line had more expectant management; vaginal examinations every four hours and commencement of oxytocin if progress crossed the four hour action line. The most recent trial <LINK REF="STD-Kenchaveeriah-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kenchaveeriah 2011</LINK>, conducted in India, compared two partographs - a composite partograph including the latent phase with a modified one without the latent phase. This trial was carried out in India were the use of the partograph has not been incorporated and practiced widely, even at the tertiary level. The plotting of the composite partograph was started as soon as the woman was in labour. In the modified partograph, the plotting of the partograph was started with at least 4 cm of cervical dilatation. Prolonged labour was defined when the woman was in labour for more than 12 hours in the active phase.The papers by <LINK REF="STD-Kenchaveeriah-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kenchaveeriah 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Walss-Rodriguez-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walss Rodriguez 1987</LINK> generally lacked detail, making assessment of quality and contextualisation of the results difficult.</P>

<P>Two randomised trials were included in this comparison with 1590 women participating (<LINK REF="STD-Walss-Rodriguez-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walss Rodriguez 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Windrim-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Windrim 2006</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Walss-Rodriguez-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walss Rodriguez 1987</LINK> study reported only three outcomes, relevant to this review, therefore results were only pooled for these outcomes. There were no significant differences between groups in caesarean section rates (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>: risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 1.70, n = 1590, two trials); instrumental vaginal delivery (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.17, n = 1590, two trials) or Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.06). (For the result relating to caesarean section there were high levels of heterogeneity (I²<SUP> </SUP>= 93%) so this result should be interpreted with caution.) There was insufficient evidence of benefit or harm in any of the other maternal or neonatal outcomes, reported by <LINK REF="STD-Windrim-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Windrim 2006</LINK>. The results for caesarean section rate were different in the two studies. In the study carried out in a low-resource setting (<LINK REF="STD-Walss-Rodriguez-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walss Rodriguez 1987</LINK>), the caesarean section rate was lower in the partogram group (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.61). In the high-resource setting (<LINK REF="STD-Windrim-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Windrim 2006</LINK>), there was no difference between groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.28).</P>

<P>To examine the effect of early or late intervention in high- and low-resource settings, we pooled results from three studies. Two studies examined two- and four-hour action lines (<LINK REF="STD-Lavender-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lavender-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 2006</LINK>) in a high-resource setting and one study examined alert line only versus alert and action line in a low-resource setting (<LINK REF="STD-Pattinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pattinson 2003</LINK>). When results were pooled, there were no differences between the groups for caesarean section rate, Apgar score or instrumental delivery. However, as stated above, in the low-resource setting, the early intervention had a positive effect on the caesarean section rate.</P>

The caesarean section rate was lower in the partograph without latent phase (modified) condition (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>: 95% RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.72 to 3.50, n = 743, one trial), and the level of caesarean section fetal distress was also lower in that group (<LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>: RR 4.87, 95% CI 2.83 to 8.37, n = 743, one trial).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-13 13:45:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 7706 women were recruited from six trials comparing partogram use; two trials comparing partogram versus no partogram and four trials comparing different partogram formats. There was no evidence of any difference between partogram and no partogram in caesarean section rate; instrumental vaginal delivery or Apgar score less than seven at five minutes between the groups. When compared with a four-hour action line, women in the two-hour action line group were more likely to require oxytocin augmentation. When the three- and four-hour action line groups were compared, caesarean section rate was lowest in the four-hour action line group and this difference was statistically significant. When a partogram with a latent phase (composite) and one without (modified) were compared, the caesarean section rate was lower in the partograph without a latent phase.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-06-13 13:46:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on the limited evidence from the six trials included in this review, there remains uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of partograph use.</P>
<P>Only two trials compared partograph versus no partograph. These trials were conducted in different settings; one in a high resourced setting (<LINK REF="STD-Windrim-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Windrim 2006</LINK>) and the other in a low resourced setting (<LINK REF="STD-Walss-Rodriguez-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walss Rodriguez 1987</LINK>). In both studies (<LINK REF="STD-Walss-Rodriguez-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walss Rodriguez 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Windrim-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Windrim 2006</LINK>), the partogram was the experimental arm. These findings can not be extrapolated to units where the partogram is currently in use; removing the partogram as opposed to introducing it may produce different findings.</P>
<P>Four trials compared the use of different designs of partogram for women in spontaneous labour. Combined evidence from trials comparing the different placement of action lines (<LINK REF="STD-Lavender-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lavender-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 2006</LINK>) showed little difference in caesarean section rates and few differences in other maternal outcomes. When the two-hour action line was compared with the four-hour action line, the only difference found was an increase in oxytocin augmentation in the two-hour arm. This is unsurprising given that the associated guidelines advocated earlier use of oxytocin. When the two-hour action line and three-hour action line were compared, differences were found in the self-reported maternal experience with less women in the two-hour arm reporting a negative experience. The relevance of these findings is uncertain, especially as the comparison between the two-hour versus four-hour arm and three-hour versus four-hour arm revealed no differences. It may be that women in the two-hour arm perceived their labours to be shorter, as the three-hour action line was current local policy. Alternatively, it may be that because those women whose labours were managed with the two-hour action line received more intervention, they also received more labour support. There were no differences in any neonatal outcomes. Although the findings of these studies were fairly consistent, both studies were from the same setting, and therefore their generalisability needs consideration.</P>
<P>The fifth trial included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Pattinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pattinson 2003</LINK>) was not combined with the previous trials, as this was a trial which compared a partogram with an alert line and aggressive management versus one with an alert and action line, with more conservative management. This trial described a package of care for labour management alongside the partogram use, which advocated more frequent vaginal examinations (two-hourly) for women in the aggressive management group, thereby suggesting a more complex intervention. This study compared different partogram designs that clearly demonstrated a difference in caesarean section rates; the more aggressive arm having the lower rate. Given that the partogram is a complex intervention, used in conjunction with labour guidelines, the approach used in this study may be more appropriate. Utilising a reductionist approach, to what is in essence a complex intervention, may produce less meaningful findings.</P>
<P>The most recent trial included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Kenchaveeriah-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kenchaveeriah 2011</LINK>) compared two partographs - a composite partograph including the latent phase with a modified one without the latent phase. The trial confirmed that a partograph without a latent phase was associated with a lower rate of caesarean section indicating labour can be managed without a latent phase being plotted on the partograph.</P>
<P>Only two of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kenchaveeriah-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kenchaveeriah 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walss-Rodriguez-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walss Rodriguez 1987</LINK>) included multiparous women, and all trials included women with uncomplicated pregnancies in spontaneous labour. However, in reality, the partograph is used for a wide spectrum of women in the intrapartum period. Consideration needs to be given to the applicability of these review findings to pregnant women who fall outside the inclusion criteria of the included trials. Further research on different populations would be preferable.</P>
<P>Important clinical outcomes were absent from the included trials, particularly in low-resourced setting, e.g. length of first and second stage of labour. None of the trials examined the impact of the partograph on resource utilisation; a factor particularly important in low-resourced settings. Only the Lavender studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lavender-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lavender-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lavender 2006</LINK>) reported measures of maternal childbirth experience.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-06-13 13:47:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Evidence from this review is inconclusive. Evidence from trials comparing partogram versus no partogram was limited to only two trials with 1590 women (<LINK REF="STD-Walss-Rodriguez-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walss Rodriguez 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Windrim-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Windrim 2006</LINK>) of differing methodological quality. Four of the six trials were of good quality. In <LINK REF="STD-Walss-Rodriguez-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Walss Rodriguez 1987</LINK>, the method of allocation concealment and the method of randomisation were unclear. In the remaining trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kenchaveeriah-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kenchaveeriah 2011</LINK>), no information was provided on how women were allocated to groups following random sequence generation. The strongest study, in terms of quality, was that conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Windrim-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Windrim 2006</LINK> which showed no differences in any clinical outcomes measured (caesarean section rate, duration of labour, oxytocin augmentation, amniotomy, epidural use, use of antibiotics in labour, Apgar scores, or admissions to neonatal intensive care unit) following introduction of the partogram. However, as acknowledged by the study authors, the findings may have been influenced by the relatively high percentage of non compliance in completing the partogram (20%) or the cross contamination of care by staff, or both.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-06-12 13:07:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We are unable to make any explicit recommendations regarding the use of the partogram for the purposes of providing a pictorial overview of labour. However, we acknowledge that many units, in high- and low-income settings, currently use a partogram and have reported quality of care benefits in terms of ease of recording, provision of pictorial overview of progress, auditing of care, training of clinicians and transferring of care (<LINK REF="REF-Lavender-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavender 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lavender-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavender 2007</LINK>). Furthermore, there has been evidence from non-randomised trials of potential benefits of partogram use (<LINK REF="REF-Bosse-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosse 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fawole-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fawole 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1994" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1994</LINK>). Given the fact that the partogram is currently in widespread use, and generally accepted, it appears reasonable, until stronger evidence is available, for decisions regarding whether or not to use a partograph and which one to use, to be locally determined.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-06-13 13:48:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whether or not there is a need for a trial of partograph versus no partograph is open for debate. However, a recent consensus of international experts (<LINK REF="REF-Fistula-Care-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fistula Care 2011</LINK>) proposed that this is no longer an important question. A more important question is which partograph should be used, as current evidence, from the included trials, fails to provide robust guidance. Trials comparing different partograph designs, are therefore recommended.</P>
<P>Although the partograph is a low cost, low-invasive intervention, it forms part of the overall management of labour care, making it part of a complex intervention. As such, any future trials should be designed to consider the clinical environment in which it will be used. Standard care should be clearly described to allow for judgments on transferability of findings, to be made. A cluster-randomised trial would be the most appropriate design, as this would enable consideration of key organisational issues (e.g. training of individuals, hospital practices and clinical protocols). Using a cluster design would also reduce any contamination between facility-based health professionals who would be supporting many women in labour at the same time; this was an issue raised in the included trials. </P>
<P>Given the limitations of existing trials, future studies should consider the inclusion of both primigravid and multigravid women, as, in most units which use the partograph, the same chart is used irrespective of parity. Any future trials should stratify participants according to parity, services with low (20 or less per 1000) and high perinatal mortality (more than 20) and low versus high intervention rates in the first stage of labour. This clarity would also allow for more accurate comparability, both clinically, and also between trials for the purposes of systematic review by meta-analysis, allowing for more robust conclusions and recommendations.The trials in this review included women at urban hospitals only. Whether the partogram is beneficial for women across all facilities is unclear and needs further investigation.</P>
<P>It is essential to involve consumers in all stages of future trials, and most significantly during the planning stages, in order to identify those outcomes which are deemed most relevant. Important outcomes are absent from the existing trials and should be considered in future protocols. Important clinical outcomes, for example, relate to recognition of prolonged labour and include the length of the first and second stage of labour. Moreover, maternal experience is of crucial importance and should be investigated using recognised validated scores in order to allow women to make informed choices about their care. There was no information in any of the included trials regarding long-term outcomes for women and babies. We propose that future trialists should consider instituting some form of long-term follow-up which is feasible and appropriate for the study population in question. Any future trials should be of adequate size and data on economic outcomes should be obtained, to allow for allocation of resources and service planning.</P>
<P>As detailed earlier, in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Windrim-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Windrim 2006</LINK>), there was a relatively high percentage of non-compliance in completing the partogram; we were unable to draw any conclusions about why this may have happened. In future trials, consideration should be given to the inclusion of a nested qualitative study, which would enable the capture of comprehensive information on the barriers and facilitators to partogram use.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection and analysis</HEADING>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>We assessed for inclusion all potentially eligible studies. All authors independently evaluated trials for inclusion, without consideration of their results. However, trials to which an author (T Lavender) has contributed, were evaluated by the two other review authors. We were able to gain additional data from contacting one trial author (<LINK REF="STD-Windrim-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Windrim 2006</LINK>), who provided subgroup data for women who met our eligibility criteria.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of study validity</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the validity of each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We independently assessed the quality of included trials according to allocation of concealment, completeness to follow up and blinding in the assessment of outcomes. We resolved differences of opinion as to eligibility and quality by consensus.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>We assigned a quality score for each trial, using the following criteria:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate concealment of allocation, such as telephone randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes;</LI>
<LI>unclear whether there was adequate concealment of allocation; such as a list or table used, only specifying that sealed envelopes were used, or study does not report any concealment approach;</LI>
<LI>inadequate concealment of allocation, such as use of case record numbers, dates of birth or days of the week, and any procedure that is entirely transparent before allocation such as open list of random numbers.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Completeness to follow up</HEADING>
<P>We assessed completeness to follow up and have noted levels of attrition; levels of attrition were assessed as adequate, unclear or inadequate. For outcomes measured in labour, we rated attrition levels as adequate if they were less than 20%.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Blinding</HEADING>
<P>We have noted where there had been any attempt to blind study participants, caregivers or outcome assessors to group allocation. With a complex intervention such as a partogram it is often not feasible to blind women or staff to group assignment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>We designed a form to extract data. At least two authors extracted the data using the agreed form. We resolved minor discrepancies through discussion. We used the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>) to enter the data, and these were then independently double checked.</P>
<P>When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we attempted to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Statistical analyses</HEADING>
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). For those outcomes measured in labour, we only included trials with at least 80% complete follow up for the outcome measure of interest. We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data when trials were sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>For dichotomous data, we present results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes the mean difference is used if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials. We used the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measure the same outcome, but use different methods. We have reported where there was evidence of skewness.<BR/>
<BR/>We analysed data on an intention-to-treat basis. Therefore, all participants with available data were included in the analysis in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention.</P>
<P>Measures of heterogeneity between trials were applied when appropriate using the I² statistic. When we identified high levels of heterogeneity among the trials (exceeding 50%), we used random-effects models. We did not carry out subgroup analyses because insufficient data on subgroups was provided.</P>
