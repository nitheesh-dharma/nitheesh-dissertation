<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-09-17 09:24:50 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Early volume expansion for very preterm babies has not been shown to improve their outcomes but more research is needed. Low blood pressure and blood flow have been linked to brain injury in preterm babies. They can also cause permanent injury to other organs and developmental problems. One way of trying to increase the blood pressure and flow of blood is to increase the amount of fluid in the blood stream (volume expansion). This can be done with products such as albumin (a protein) and salt solutions. The review of evidence from trials found that volume expansion has not been shown to improve outcomes for preterm babies. More research is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Reduced perfusion of organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys and the gastrointestinal tract may lead to acute dysfunction and be associated with permanent injury.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-11-07 15:14:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard search strategy of the Neonatal Review Group was used. Updated searches were performed of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 3, 2008), MEDLINE (1996 - July 2008), EMBASE (1980 - July 2008), previous reviews including cross references, abstracts and conferences.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-11-07 15:14:13 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised trials of early volume expansion with normal saline, fresh frozen plasma, albumin, plasma substitutes or blood compared to no treatment or another form of volume expansion in preterm infants &#8806; 32 weeks gestation or &#8806; 1500 g were included. Volume expansion was defined as at least 10 ml/kg given in the first 72 hours after birth.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-04-22 00:59:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Standard methods of the Neonatal Review Group with use of relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and weighted mean difference (WMD). The fixed effects model was used for meta-analysis. Data from individual studies were only eligible for inclusion if a least 80% of infants were reported for that outcome.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-09-17 09:23:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight studies were included. Five studies compared volume to no treatment. Most studies enrolled very preterm infants on the basis of gestation or birthweight. Two studies comparing different types of volume expansion enrolled very preterm infants with hypotension. No study enrolled infants on the basis of low blood flow. One study examined the effect of volume expansion on blood flow, but evaluated normotensive very preterm infants.</P>
<P>Four studies comparing volume expansion and no treatment with a total of 940 very preterm infants reported no significant difference in mortality (typical RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.88, 1.40). The large <A HREF="nnni 1996">NNNI 1996</A> study reported no significant difference in severe disability (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.52, 1.23), cerebral palsy (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48, 1.20) and combined death or severe disability (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80, 1.24). Although one small study (<A HREF="beverley 1985">Beverley 1985</A>) reported reduced P/IVH with volume expansion, this was not supported by any other study. No significant difference was reported in grade 3-4 P/IVH and combined death or grade 3-4 P/IVH. One study (<A HREF="nnni 1996">NNNI 1996</A>) reported no significant difference in the incidence of hypotension. The finding of decreased necrotising enterocolitis and increased sepsis in infants who received fresh frozen plasma compared to no treatment in one study should be treated with caution. No significant differences in mortality or disability were found in this study. Comparing albumin and saline in hypotensive infants, one study (<A HREF="lynch 2008">Lynch 2008</A>) reported a significant increase in mean BP and reduced incidence of treatment failure (persistent hypotension treated with dopamine). The other study (<A HREF="so 1997">So 1997</A>) and the meta-analysis of the two studies found no significant difference in treatment failure (typical RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.54, 1.07) or in any other clinical outcome.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-09-17 09:24:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence from randomised trials to support the routine use of early volume expansion in very preterm infants without cardiovascular compromise. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether infants with cardiovascular compromise benefit from volume expansion. There is insufficient evidence to determine what type of volume expansion should be used in preterm infants (if at all) or to determine the benefit of using early red cell transfusions. The significance of the finding of a significant increase in blood pressure in hypotensive preterm infants in one trial comparing albumin and saline is unclear, but the overall meta-analyses found no other significant clinical benefit in using albumin compared to saline.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-03-16 09:11:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Reduced perfusion of organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys and the gastrointestinal tract may lead to acute dysfunction and be associated with permanent injury. Twenty percent of surviving babies born very premature do so with some degree of neurodevelopmental disability (<LINK REF="REF-Lorenz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lorenz 1998</LINK>). Low systemic blood pressure (BP) and systemic blood flow (SBF) have both been linked to cerebral injury in preterm infants. Systemic arterial hypotension is associated with peri/intraventricular haemorrhage (P/IVH), ischaemic cerebral lesions and poor<BR/>long-term neurodevelopmental outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Miall_x002d_Allen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miall-Allen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Low-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Low 1993</LINK>). Low upper body blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Kluckow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluckow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miletin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miletin 2008</LINK>) and low cerebral blood flow (<LINK REF="REF-Meek-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meek 1999</LINK>) on the first day after birth are associated with late P/IVH. In addition, low upper body blood flow on the first day (as measured by flow in the superior vena cava) was associated with a significant increase in mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kluckow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluckow 2000</LINK>), necrotising enterocolitis (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2007</LINK>) and subsequent neurodevelopmental impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Hunt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunt 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2007</LINK>) in infants born &lt; 30 weeks' gestation.</P>
<P>Clinical features suggesting reduced perfusion include low BP, reduced cutaneous perfusion and metabolic acidosis. However, systemic arterial pressure has been shown to be poorly correlated with SBF as measured by Doppler ultrasound in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Kluckow-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluckow 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kluckow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluckow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2004a</LINK>). In addition, clinical measures of hypovolaemia including systemic hypotension have been found to be poorly correlated to blood volume in premature infants (<LINK REF="STD-Barr-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Barr 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bauer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bauer 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Various therapeutic strategies have been used to provide cardiovascular support to preterm infants including inotropes, corticosteroids and volume expansion. Most strategies have targeted low BP using inotropes such as dopamine vs. dobutamine (<LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hentschel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hentschel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klarr-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klarr 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roze-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roze 1993</LINK>), dopamine vs. adrenaline (<LINK REF="REF-Pellicer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pellicer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Valverde-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valverde 2006</LINK>), corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Gaissmaier-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaissmaier 1999</LINK>), and corticosteroids vs. dopamine (<LINK REF="REF-Bourchier-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourchier 1997</LINK>). Trials of dopamine vs. dobutamine in very preterm infants with systemic hypotension have not found a difference between these inotropes at preventing mortality and P/IVH. Dopamine was more effective than dobutamine at treating systemic hypotension in very preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Subhedar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subhedar 2003</LINK>). Despite an increase in systemic BP, dopamine was shown to reduce aortic blood flow in one study (<LINK REF="REF-Roze-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roze 1993</LINK>). In another study in very preterm infants with low SBF, dobutamine which produced little change in BP but a significantly greater increase in SBF than dopamine, despite dopamine resulting in a significantly greater increase in BP (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2002</LINK>). However, there was no significant difference in long-term outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2007a</LINK>). Strategies to correct systemic hypotension and hypovolaemia have also included volume expansion. Observational studies have found increases in cardiac output after albumin infusion in sick preterm infants (<LINK REF="STD-Pladys-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Pladys 1997</LINK>) and a small increase in systemic BP in hypotensive preterm infants (<LINK REF="STD-Barr-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Barr 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bignall-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bignall 1989</LINK>). Short-term increases in SBF have also been reported after saline infusion in preterm infants with low SBF (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2002</LINK>). Observational studies have also reported an increase in P/IVH (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1980</LINK>) and chronic lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Marter-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Marter 1990</LINK>) in preterm infants receiving volume expansion. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials of albumin infusions in critically ill patients including those with hypovolaemia, burns and hypoalbuminaemia found a significantly increased mortality for those patients receiving albumin compared to control (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The question addressed by this review is what is the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the use of early volume expansion to prevent mortality and morbidity in very preterm infants. In view of the difficulties of identifying infants with poor perfusion and hypovolaemia, subgroup analysis was planned according to method of diagnosis of poor perfusion (unselected preterm infants, preterm infants with clinical indicators of poor perfusion [low BP, reduced cutaneous perfusion and metabolic acidosis] and infants with ultrasound Doppler detected low blood flow). As there is evidence to suggest that late intraventricular haemorrhage is associated with systemic hypotension and low SBF in the first day of life (<LINK REF="REF-Miall_x002d_Allen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miall-Allen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kluckow-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kluckow 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2003</LINK>), subgroup analysis was performed with the hypothesis that trials that used early volume expansion were more likely to prevent intraventricular haemorrhage. As different volume expanders have different effects, subgroup analysis was performed according to type of volume expansion used. This is an update of a previous Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>Criteria and methods used to assess the methodological quality of the included trials: Standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group were used. The methodological quality of each trial was reviewed independently by the second review author. Particular emphasis was placed on allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of follow up and blinding of outcome assessment. Allocation concealment was ranked: Grade A: adequate; Grade B: uncertain; Grade C: clearly inadequate. Additional information was requested from authors of each trial to clarify methodology (see 'table of included studies' - 'notes').</P>
<P>Methods used to collect data from the included trials: Each review author extracted data separately then compared and resolved differences. Additional data where required was requested from authors of trials (see 'table of included studies' - 'notes').</P>
<P>Methods used to synthesise the data: Standard methods of Neonatal Review Group with use of relative risk and weighted mean difference where appropriate. The fixed effects model using RevMan 5.0 was used for meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was explored using funnel plots and the chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic for heterogeneity, and quantified using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. Sensitivity analysis was performed on the basis of methodological quality.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-17 12:17:50 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review examines evidence from randomised controlled trials for the use of early volume expansion in very preterm infants. In subgroup analysis, it looks for evidence for the use of different types of volume expansion and for the use of volume expansion in different types of infants. The analysis had a power of 80% to detect a 9% absolute difference in rates of combined death and severe disability between volume and control groups at the 5% significance level. Six of the 7 trials reported adequate randomisation procedures and allocation concealment. Only one reported efforts to blind caregivers with this study comparing use of albumin with normal saline in hypotensive infants (<LINK REF="STD-Lynch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lynch 2008</LINK>). Only one trial provided data on long-term neurodevelopment (<LINK REF="STD-NNNI-1996" TYPE="STUDY">NNNI 1996</LINK>). This was the largest trial with no losses to follow-up and blinded assessment of neurodevelopment at two years, including the Griffiths' Scales of Mental Development and clinical examination. This trial had incomplete ascertainment of head ultrasound findings in a subgroup of infants born in centres with routine scan facilities. The studies with complete ascertainment of head ultrasound abnormalities are much smaller (<LINK REF="STD-Beverley-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Beverley 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekblad-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ekblad 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The studies comparing volume to no treatment did not enrol infants with evidence of cardiovascular compromise. Infants were predominantly enrolled on the basis of gestation or birthweight. However, by virtue of their gestation or birthweight, these infants were at risk of mortality, P/IVH and disability. Whether or not these infants had hypovolaemia was not measured. The studies that did enrol infants on the basis of cardiovascular compromise enrolled infants on the basis of low BP and compared different forms of volume expansion. They did not have a control group that received no treatment. Blood flow (left ventricular output and cerebral blood flow) was measured by only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lundstrom-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lundstrom 2000</LINK>). This study enrolled infants with stable cardiovascular status and normal mean BP who had not received volume or inotropes in the preceding three hours. There is no data on blood flow in infants with cardiovascular compromise.</P>
<P>There is no evidence to support the routine use of volume expansion given to very preterm infants on the basis of gestational age or birthweight in the first days after birth. There is no evidence that routine early volume expansion decreases the incidence of cardiovascular compromise (hypotension) or mortality. Evidence from one study of a reduced rate of P/IVH is not supported by the overall meta-analysis or any other study. No difference was seen in the rates of higher grade cerebral ischaemic lesions or subsequent disability. The observations from one study that infants who received fresh frozen plasma had a lower incidence of necrotising enterocolitis and higher incidence of sepsis should be treated with caution. The overall rate of mortality and disability were not different between infants who received fresh frozen plasma compared to no treatment in this study.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Lynch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lynch 2008</LINK>) reported a significant reduction in treatment failure (persistent hypotension) and a greater increase in mean BP in infants with hypotension treated with albumin compared to normal saline. Other clinical outcomes including mortality and P/IVH were not reported. The other study (<LINK REF="STD-So-1997" TYPE="STUDY">So 1997</LINK>) and the overall meta-analysis do not support a reduction in rate of treatment failure or change in mean BP, and there was no significant difference in mortality, P/IVH or other clinical outcomes. Differences between the studies identified in subgroup analyses included the different timing of intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Lynch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lynch 2008</LINK> enrolled infants &lt; 3 days age and <LINK REF="STD-So-1997" TYPE="STUDY">So 1997</LINK> enrolled infants &lt; 2 hours age) and the lack of blinding of treatment in one study (<LINK REF="STD-So-1997" TYPE="STUDY">So 1997</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-NNNI-1996" TYPE="STUDY">NNNI 1996</LINK>) reported no significant difference in mortality, P/IVH or disability in infants who received a gelatin-based plasma substitute compared to fresh frozen plasma. No data were available for the use of early blood transfusion. Data for the use of albumin compared to no treatment are only available from one small study with inadequate power to demonstrate any benefit and enrolling infants with a stable cardiovascular status.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-04-21 19:59:30 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence from randomised trials to support the routine use of early volume expansion in preterm infants without evidence of cardiovascular compromise. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether infants with evidence of cardiovascular compromise benefit from volume expansion. There is insufficient evidence to determine what type of volume expansion should be used in preterm infants (if at all) and for the use of early red cell transfusions. The significance of the finding of a significant increase in BP in hypotensive preterm infants in one trial comparing colloid (albumin) and crystalloid (saline) is unclear, but the overall meta-analysis found no other clinical benefit in using albumin compared to saline.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-09-17 11:46:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The question of whether volume expansion should be given before or in addition to inotropes in preterm infants with cardiovascular compromise has not been answered. Future trials of volume expansion should identify and enrol those infants with low cardiac output or organ perfusion. Further trials of albumin vs. saline are warranted in infants with cardiovascular compromise. In addition to important clinical outcomes (mortality, cerebral ischaemic lesions and neurodevelopment) future trials should measure changes in cardiac output and/or organ blood flow. Further research is required into methods of detecting hypovolaemia in preterm infants.</P>
